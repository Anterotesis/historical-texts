            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the true wisdome of a Christian to
understand aright and with a spiritual eye
to discern the great difference between the
Law and the Gospel, the Covenant of
Works and that of Grace, the Legal and
Euangelical Justification, the ignorance
whereof is the great Cause of most errours this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
professed Christians. When our blessed Saviour
came into the world, he found flowing out of this bad foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a multitude of Heresies in the Jewish Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the Pharisees, blind Leaders of a blind People,
erecting &amp; establishing their our Righteousness before the
throne of God. And it is certain that our Lord Jesus
Christ was rejected of the Jews, because they could not
believe their own unrighteousness, miserie &amp; condemnation
by the Law, nor be made to seek in the <hi>Messiah</hi> his
Sufferings &amp; Satisfaction the true expiation of sins and
a compleat Righteousness, sufficient to eternal happiness.
Certainly they understood not the promises of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
especially that of <hi>Isaiah</hi> Chap. LIII. neither loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
they to the end of the Ceremonial oeconomie &amp; Law
<pb facs="tcp:104357:3"/>
which was to be abolished, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13. Of this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daical
errour we have a clear example in the Apostle Paul,
before his conversion a Pharisee, &amp; by his great Masters
well instructed in the letter of the Law. For he looking
upon himself, and not understanding the nature of the
Law in its Spiritual meaning, was in his own eyes no sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but a just man, <hi>living,</hi> and having a right to pretend
a sentence of Justification before God upon the account of
his works according to the Law. But when it pleased
God to reveal his Son to his soul, he could <hi>count all things
but l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ,</hi> and
desire <hi>only to be found in him, not having his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
which is of the Law, but that which is through the
Faith of Christ; the Righteousness which is of God by
Faith. Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 9. And so became a great example of
all true Converts &amp; Believers, &amp; his Conversion a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of this Euangelical Doctrine, that no man is
Justified by his works, but by the Righteousness of Christ
imputed &amp; by Faith received &amp; applyed.</p>
            <p>No doubt, Christian Reader, but this doctrine is the
whole scope of the same Apostle in his Epistles to the
<hi>Romans &amp; Galatians.</hi> For having proved both Jews and
Gentiles to be all under sin, &amp; supposing consequently that
by the works of the Law no flesh shall be justified in the
sight of God, he sheweth, that all elected sinners coming
short of the glorie of God, must be justified freely by his
grace through the Redemption which is in Jesus Christ,
whom God hath set forth to be our Propitiation through
faith in his blood, so that all boasting may be excluded;
which cannot be, if a man could be justified by his works.
Yea the Apostle <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. gives a Demonstration of this
doctrine out of the examples of <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; <hi>David,</hi> to
whom after conversion, Righteousness is imputed &amp; sin
<pb facs="tcp:104357:3"/>
pardoned by faith in the promise. In his Epistle to the
<hi>Galatians,</hi> he likewise presseth this Doctrine against the
heresie of judaizing Ministers, who would have mingled the
Law with the Gospel, and rejects their sentence as another
Gospel worthy to be Anathematized, with every one who
teacheth it, though even an Angel from Heaven; since he
saith upon the matter, that Christ is dead in vain, as we see
<hi>Chap. 1. 8, 11. Chap.</hi> 11. 21.</p>
            <p>How happy were the Church in these dayes, if the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Gospel-Justification did continue pure, &amp; could
be propagated &amp; transmitted to the following ages! But it
is too manifest that the Christian Church, by Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
&amp; Jewish errours upon the one hand, &amp; by Pelagian
infusions on the other, hath lost a great deal of her primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
sinceritie &amp; puritie. Certainly the Roman Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
tending only to the establishing of humane Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
in Gods sight, are clear demonstrations of a corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
doctrine, yea of that Apostacie of the latter times so
oft soretold by the Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi> For we see that Popery
is wholly erected upon a Judaical &amp; Pelagian Righteousness,
proceeding from the bitter root of the Heathenish Free-will,
whereby the corruption of Nature is denyed, sin excused,
the faculties of Nature, as sufficient to all good works,
asserted; especially when they are sustained by a <hi>sufficient gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi>
given to all men for obtaining eternal happiness. But
this great errour, worthy of the Apostles Anathema, was
abominable in the eyes of our Protestant Fathers: and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
the Doctrine of a contrary Gospel-Justification was
the greatest reason of separation, especially when they heard
the trumpet from Heaven sounding and crying, <hi>come out
of Babel, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and
that ye receive not of her plagues.</hi> And herein we must
admire the wonderful providence of God, that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
<pb facs="tcp:104357:4"/>
did aggree in this point of Justification, even when
their minds were distracted about the Doctrine of the
Lord's Supper: and it is known how careful the Lutherians
are, even to this day, in following the Doctrine of their
Master in this great Article.</p>
            <p>But alas! it is a sad &amp; lamentable thing, that Arminians
(being fomented by the Kings of <hi>France</hi> &amp; <hi>Spain</hi> as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
way to introduce Popery, saith <hi>Wilson</hi> in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie
of <hi>Great Britain pag.</hi> 119.) when they adopted the
Pelagian grounds, did forsake the imputation of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ, because they could not join this great
mystery of the Gospel with the opinions of Universal Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
&amp; Redemption, as appears in the writings of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,
Curcellaeus, Limburgh,</hi> and others, filled not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with Arminian, but also with wicked Socinian errours
against the Divinity &amp; Satisfaction of our Saviour Jesus
Christ. And how could it be thought, that those books
should have been accepted &amp; approved by Reformed Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
&amp; Churches, as we see they are in our neighbouring
Kingdom of England? O what errours in that Nation are
observed &amp; complained of before by <hi>Honorius Reggius</hi> in
his book <hi>de Statu Ecclesiae Britannicae,</hi> errours tending
even to the ruine of the Protestant Cause! And what shall
we say of the latter books, written by <hi>Bull, Parker, Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi>
and others, against the principles of Reformation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
hitherto with great agreement in all the Confessions
of Reformed Churches. Yea even those who were purer
in appearance, pressing the moral duties &amp; practical doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of pietie (I mean the followers of that famous Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter</hi>) did corrupt the true Doctrine of
Justification, because they adopted Universal Grace and
Redemption. For suspending such an Universal Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
as Conditional, upon the vertue of Faith, taught,
<pb facs="tcp:104357:4"/>
that Justification is depending upon this vertue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that a man by Faith, as a vertue, must be justified:
and because Repentance should be acknowledged as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of eternal happiness, beside the vertue of Faith, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they imagine that Justification may be suspended even
upon Repentance; so that we must believe, that Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not only by Faith, but also by Repentance.</p>
            <p>But, O my Brethren, ye are out of the way, ye have left
your first love! Remember therefore from whence ye are
fallen, and repent, and do the first works! Remember the
former dayes and years! Remember your former Divines
at the beginning of the Reformation, <hi>Iuel, Whitaker, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi>
and other glorious stars once shining in your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey!
Remember the Apologie of your Church against
that harlot of Rome, written by that most excellent Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
J. <hi>Iuel</hi> B. of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> &amp; approved of your Fathers! Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
your Confession aggreeing with all the Confessions
of Reformed Churches, and confirmed in the dayes of Q.
<hi>Elisabeth An.</hi> 1562. by a Synodical decree; yea by the
Parliament of your Kingdome! Remember the former ages,
when the Doctrine of <hi>Anselme</hi> &amp; <hi>Bradwardine</hi> Archb. of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> against Pelagianisme sounded &amp; obtained in
your Churches! Yea <hi>Bradwardine</hi> his book <hi>de Causa Dei</hi>
opposed to the Cause of men defended by Pelagianisme,
printed first in this age <hi>An.</hi> 1616. in the dayes of King <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi>
who himself was a great Adversarie to Arminian te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
by the care and studie of <hi>George Abboth</hi> a worthy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour
of that great Divine, because he loved the Doctrine
of Grace, and could not endure that Arminian errours
should infect the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to that time depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
onely upon the grace of our Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>But what great iniquitie is it now to neglect this grace,
and, leaving the principles of Protestant Religion, to rely
<pb facs="tcp:104357:5"/>
upon, and trust to our own works for Salvation? My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
how think ye to mingle the Law with the Gospel?
the Righteousness of Christ with your own? your faith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
alone upon your Saviour, with your works? What
will ye say, when you wil dye, &amp; this weighty case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
comes to be resolved, how shall my poor, guiltie &amp;
sinful Soul be justified before a Righteous God? How can ye
thus prepare the way to return, and lead your followers back
again unto Babylon? What fellowship hath Righteousness
with unrighteousness? or what communion hath light with
darkness?</p>
            <p>Yet glory be to God in the highest, who hath reserved
by his grace many Protestant and Learned Divines against
all these and the like errours. And hence we have the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Labours of the worthy J. BURGES, J. OWEN. A.
PITCAIRN and other eminent Divines, worthy to be
remembered in all ages. And to those great Doctours we
may very warrantably add the worthy Author of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Treatise Mr. JOHN BROUN, whose praise liv's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
in the Churches, and whose light did for a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
space shine here in our <hi>Low-countreys,</hi> when through
the iniquitie of the times, he was because of his zeal, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
faithfulness and good Conscience obliged to leave his
native Land. Yet was he not idle: for while he was here
he wrote, with a great deal of wisdom, against the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
of this time, who would subject the Scriptures to
Philosophie, setting up humane Reason for a Rule of
Scripture-Interpretations. Moreover, he was known in
our Churches by his Books of the Perpetual Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Sabbath, written with a great efficacie of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
and approved by <hi>Fr. Spanheym,</hi> that worthy
and most famous Divine of our age; besides what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Treatises he wrote in English. But we have he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb facs="tcp:104357:5"/>
his work of Justification as a Posthumus, full of
Wisdom, Doctrine and Pietie. The Author had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the care of it to his very intimate and dear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
the Reverend and Learned Mr. JAMES
KOELMAN, who, while he was alive, had the care of it
at the press: but before the work was perfected, he was
called home to his Masters joy, after he had faithfully
served God in his generation. And I being now desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to prefix the accustomed Ceremonie of an Epistle
to this excellent book of Mr. JOHN BROUN, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
it most cheerfully with all my heart. For I must
give Testimony to the Reverend &amp; Learned Author of
this work, that he wisely expounds the mysteries of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
according to the Doctrine of the Gospel, &amp;

the expounded Doctrine with efficacious arguments able to
stop the mouths of all Adversaries; that he prudently dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
all their vain oppositions; that he shows himself a
true Christian Minister, and a Scribe well instructed by
the Holy Spirit unto the Kingdom of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this excellent book was worthy to be printed, to be
esteemed and loved amongst the best Treatises upon this
great and weighty Doctrine of Justification. I need say no
more, the work will speak for it self, and the Judicious

Demonstration of the Spirit &amp; Power, profitable for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Reproof, Correction, Instruction in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and Consolation of penitent souls. I pray the
God of all grace, that he would give the Readers the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Wisdom and of a sound mind, that having the
eyes of their understandings enlightened, they may know
what are the great mysteries of Redemption, and may be
sound in the Faith in order to this fundamental point of

Justification here expounded and vindicated, with this
full persuasion of mind that the Reformed profession is the

they cannot expiat our sins, or endure the severity of Divine Iustice; Yet they

                  <item>Works which are done before the Grace of Christ, and the influence of his
Spirit, since they do not proceed from the Faith of Iesus Christ, are not
at all acceptable to God; neither doe they merit the grace, which many call
congruous. Yea, because they are not done according to Gods will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
we doubt not, but they have the nature of sin.</item>
                  <label>XVII. Of Predestination, and Election.</label>
                  <item>Predestination to life, is the eternal purpose of God, whereby He, before
the setling of the foundations of the world, by his Counsel hid indeed as
to us, Immutably decreed, those whom he had chosen in Christ out of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
should be delivered from the curse and destruction, and (as vessels
made to honour) brought to eternal Salvation by Christ. Hence those who are
gifted with this notable favour of God, are called in due time, according to
his purpose, His own Spirit working, they obey by Graces call, are Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
freely, are Adopted to be the sons of God, and made consorme to the
<pb facs="tcp:104357:7"/>
Image of his only begotten Son Iesus Christ, they walk holily in good
works, and in end, by the mercy of God, they come to eternal happiness. As
the pious consideration of our Predestination, and Election in Christ is sweet,
pleasant, and full of ineffable consolation to the truely Godly, and to
those, who find in themselves the efficacie of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying
the deeds of the flesh, and members, which yet are upon the earth, and by
force drawing the mind to things above, both because it does
much establish, and confirme our Faith of obtaining eternal Salvation, as
also because it vehemently kindles our love toward our good: So it is a very
destructive precipice to curious and carnal men, and who are destitute of the
Spirit of Christ, to have alwayes the sentence of Gods Predestination pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to their view, whereby the Devil either presses them to despair, or into
equally pernicious security of a most impure life. Thereafter, the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
most be so imbraced, as they are generally proposed to us in the holy
Scriptures, and the will of God, which we have expresly revealed in Gods word,
is to be followed by us in our actions.</item>

And what then must follow upon the corrupting of this Truth, &amp; u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
Erroneous Apprehensions &amp; practices herein, is aboundantly obvious
to all such, as have not sinned away all sense &amp; consideration, in these
matters.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is no wonder, that Satan hath, in all ages, laboured, by
one Instrument or other, upon one occasion or other, and under one pretext,
or other, to corrupt the pure streames of this wholesome Fountaine of Truth,
in one Measure or other, in one particular or other; &amp; that by such <hi>Mediums</hi>
&amp; Arguments, as he knew would be most taking, &amp; seem most plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
at these Several times, &amp; upon these Several occasions. What way,
&amp; how far the corruption of this Truth was advanced, in the Antichristian
Church, is yet known; &amp; what ground, their errour in this gave un to
such, as began to be enlightened in the knowledge of the Truth, to separate
from them, &amp; to appear against them, is manifest: and what Effaies the
Devil made, about the beginning of Reformation, or shortly after, to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
this Truth, by Questions &amp; Disputes, even among such, as hold the
Truth fast, as to the maine, and what since, by Several New Opinions,
or new Modes and Methods (as they were called, and given out to be)
vented, and improven by Several Artifices, to seeming different Ends, he
hath effectuated; to the hardening of some, in their Misapprehensions; &amp;
to the Corrupting of the Hearts &amp; Mindes of others; and also the Stagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and Shaking of not a few, may be called to minde with grief and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
Not to mention the bold attempt, made by <hi>Socinians,</hi> to overturne
the whole Grounds of Christian Religion; and to take away at once all the
pillars of Gospel-justification.</p>
               <p>The devil began early, in the breaking up of the clear day of Christianity,
to darken this Sun, that the poor Church might for ever abide in darkness,
if the Church, her Head and Husband had not provided a Remedie, and
had not effectually dispelled these Cloudes: And he had no small advantage
of the corrupt <hi>Iewes,</hi> who had a zeal of God, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
and had a very Specious pretext of crying up the Law, prescribed by
God himself, and of Obedience thereunto, and constant observation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in all points, to the prejudice of the Gospel-truth, in the matter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.
And though the first rise of this difference and debate was upon
occasion of the Ceremonial Law, which was the dispensation of the Grace
of God, which the ancient Church was under, while under Tutors &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
and in her Non-age state; and was never rightly obeyed, or
improven, but when in led them unto the promised Messiah, Christ, the
end of that law, in a peculiar manner, the Substance thereof, and vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
thereunder; and which they might have known, was to be done away,
when Christ, the Substance of all those shadowes, came in to the world,
in the due time appointed and foretold; and which, contrare to its very
Nature &amp; End, to the many prophecies of old, &amp; to the signal dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104357:8"/>
of God, giving clear significations of his mind, touching the evani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of these shadowes, the <hi>Iewes,</hi> principled with false Conceptions
about that Law, &amp; with prejudices against the truth of the Gospel, and
animated and encouraged by false Teachers, raised up of Satan,
to corrupt the Doctrine of the Grace of God, did strenuously contend
for the constant Observation thereof, either Solely, as a Sufficient
ground of their Justification; or in conjunction with the Gospel: Yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this tookalongs with it, the observation of all that Law, which God
had prescribed of old, as the only ground, in their mistaken apprehension,
of their Justification, &amp; acceptance with God; therefore we finde the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<hi>Paul</hi> (who was especially stirred up, &amp; immediatly inspired of the
Spirit, to vindicat the Gospel-way of justification from this corruption;
after he had been singularly fitted thereunto, by being in so signal a manner
brought to embrace this Truth, (who was formerly so zealous for the Law,
&amp; against the Gospel in all points) prosecuting the controversie to the full;
&amp; not only handling it in reference to the immediat Rise &amp; occasion thereof;
but in reference to that also, where-unto of necessity it must have come, &amp;
where it must have landed, at length.</p>
               <p>And though there have been few, since those dayes, &amp; none at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
who will contend for the Observation of the ceremonial Law, in the
sense, &amp; for Ends, urged by the <hi>jewes,</hi> &amp; jewish false Apostles, in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
times; yet we must not think, that therefore all the Doctrine of the
Apostle hereanent is if no use to us. Many debates &amp; discourses had the
Apostle, beside what we have recorded of him in Scripture; &amp; to think,
that his Disputes &amp; Discourses, in his Epistles, concerning Justification,
are of no more concernment to us, as to the question about justification,
because none now adaies, plead for justification by the observation of the
ceremonial Law, as did the jewes, against whom <hi>Paul</hi> Disputed, is, in
my judgment, no small imputation upon the Spirit of the Lord, inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reing
the Apostle to write these Epistles, &amp; putting them into our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:
and of this such, in my apprehension must be guilty, who think
to wave all the Apostles Discourses, in this matter, with this, that he is
only to be understood, as speaking &amp; Disputing against such, as cried<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up
the constant observation of the Ceremonial Law, as such.</p>
               <p>But, whatever circumstantial differences, whether as to the Rise or
occasion, or as to other things of the like Import, there may seem to
be, or may really be, betwixt the Disput, as then stated, &amp; as now
prosecuted; Yet all the Disputes &amp; Differences about the Maine &amp; Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
of justification, as also about inferiour &amp; subordinat Questions, in so
far as they depend upon, or are influenced by the Maine, will be found
to be, upon the matter, one &amp; the same, whether managed of late or
of old: For different Termes &amp; Expressions may be, where the matter
&amp; thing so expressed, is really one &amp; the same. And therefore, as we
are to observe with thankfulness the Lords love to &amp; care of His Church,
in providing &amp; preserving, for the use &amp; Edification of the same, in all
ages, to the end of the world, such a necessary <hi>Depositum;</hi> &amp; His won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful

refell the Errour, in all its Circumstances &amp; Branches, as it was then
broached, to the darkning of Gospel-light; but so also as the Truth might
remaine full cleared, confirmed &amp; saifguared against all the assaults of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
in all time coming, by whatever Instruments, &amp; under whatsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be attacqued: So are we to acquaint our selves
well with the Doctrine of the Spirit of the Lord, in this matter; to the
end, we may be fully instructed in the Truth, &amp; enabled, to maintaine
the same, &amp; fortified against all new Assaults; or, rather, old Assaults
renewed, howbeit mannaged by seemingly new weapons, &amp; new filed
Instruments &amp; Arguments.</p>
               <p>It would prove long &amp; tedious, to handle at length (&amp; to touch in short,
upon them, may seem to some to be but superficiary work) all the various
controversies, that are on foot this day, about the matter of justification;
&amp; a short discovery of the truth, in this matter, as to the most principal
things controverted (to which others may be so reduced, as a Scriptural
discovery of the truth, as to those, may serve for a discussion of the rest;
at least, so pave the way, that a solution of these Inferiour Controversies
may be the more easie) may therefore be sufficient to such, at least, whose
Edification and Instruction we mostly Intend here; that is, Such, as are
not in case to improve what is written of Controversies, in Scholastick &amp;
abstruse termes. And, I judge, who ever handle this Controversie, in such
termes only, or mostly, as are above the reach of ordinary Christians, who
are herein as much concerned, as others, misse that mark, which they
should mainely aime at, that is, Edification &amp; Instruction of such, whose
high concernment this is; &amp; who have most need to be plainely instructed in
this foundamental point of Truth, a Practical mistake in which may prove
to them deadly &amp; destructive; &amp; especially of such, who, when under the
pangs of an awakened Conscience, &amp; under the convictions of sin, &amp; fears
of wrath, pursueing for sin, are then most ready to take any course that may
seem to promise present ease &amp; reliefe; &amp; to be led away from Christ, the
onely peace-maker, through the slight of Satan, &amp; the deceitfulness of
their own heart; &amp; through Ignorance of, or Mis-information about the
true Gospel-way of Justification &amp; peace with God; whereby their Ease
&amp; Reliefe may prove more deadly, than was their Distemper &amp; Disquiet.
As therefore, I Judge, this concerning Truth cannot be made plaine enough;
so I think, the less use be made of Philosophick or Scholastick termes (which
none but such as are well versed in these dry Nations, can competently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand;
&amp; which, though never so handsomely, set off, will prove ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unsatisfying to awakened Consciences) it will be so much the better;
seing, let men please themselves in them, as they will, as they are not the
language, the Spirit of the Lord hath thought good to use in this matter so
they darken rather, than cleare the matter, at least to me.</p>
               <p>The Apostle (that we may in short cleare the words, upon which we are
to ground our Discourse) in this <hi>vers.</hi> 11. after other Arguments, former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104357:9"/>
adduced to prove the <hi>Thesis,</hi> which he laid down <hi>Chap. 2. vers.</hi> 16. to wit,
<hi>That a man is not Iustified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Iesus
Christ;</hi> he bringeth another Argument from Scripture, after he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
repeated the one halfe of the grand <hi>Thesis,</hi> by which the other is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
understood, &amp; more emphatically included in the probation, or
Testimony of Scripture adduced, saying,</p>
               <q>
                  <bibl>Gal. 3: 11.</bibl> But that no man is Justified by the Law, in
the sight of God, it is evident; for the just
shall live by faith.</q>
               <p>HE doth not explaine what is meaned by that word, <hi>Iustified;</hi> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth
that there was no doubt, concerning the true meaning the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof,
among those, with whom he had to do, in this Disput: as
Indeed none, that consider what is the constant use thereof, in the Old
Testament, (well known to the Jewish Teachers) yea &amp; in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
also, can doubt of its true Import, how ever <hi>Papists</hi> do quite mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
its true Nature &amp; Import, supposing that it signifieth an Inward Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
or Infusion of Holiness; &amp; so make it the same with Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But as no man, acquainted with the Scriptures, &amp; with what is said
of justification in them, can be ignorant of its right meaning; so every man,
exercised with the sense of his own natural condition, &amp; of the curse of
the Law, under which he feeleth himself lying, according to what is he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
said, in the foregoing verse, readily understandeth, what it is to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
&amp; freed from that curse &amp; Sentence of Condemnation; &amp; so made
free from the wrath that he is liable unto, because of the broken Law of
God: So that we need say no more of it here.</p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>No man is Iustified by the Law;</hi> &amp; so, maketh no exception
of any what somever, no not of the holiest meer Man, that ever existed
since the fall: &amp; this is of the same import with that expression <hi>Chap.</hi> 2: 16.
<hi>No flesh; for by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified.</hi> So he hath the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
expression <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 20.</p>
               <p>It is here said, <hi>by the Law;</hi> in the original it is, <hi>in the Law:</hi> but the
sense is the same with that expression <hi>Chap.</hi> 2: 16. thrice repeated, <hi>by the
works of the Law.</hi> The <hi>Ethiopike</hi> Version here is rather a short Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
for there it is; <hi>They are not justified doing the command of the Law.</hi> It is
observable, That the Apostle useth variety of expressions, in this matter,
all tending to cleare this one thing. That there is no justification by the
works of the Law; so as no coloure or shew of evasion might be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. he saith <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>by</hi> or <hi>out of the works of the Law;</hi>

works of the Law:</hi> all which expressions are used to signifie one &amp; the same

thing. And in the following <hi>verse,</hi> he taketh <hi>the Law,</hi> &amp; <hi>doing of them,</hi>
that is, the commands of the Law, for one &amp; the same thing. Those that
were looking to the Law for justification, he saith of them vers 10. That
<hi>they are of the works of the Law</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 4: 21.—<hi>Ye that desire to be under the

even all that Law, that was the Rule of Righteousness, &amp; was prescribed
of God, as such; &amp; not the Ceremonial Law only: that Law, by the
works whereof he denied (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 1, 2.) that <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of
the faithful, was justified. That Law, in obedience to which consisted
that righteousness, which the <hi>jewes</hi> laboured to cause stand; &amp; that righteousness,
which himself desired not to be found in: That Law, which was
called the Law of righteouness: That Law, which the Gospel establisheth
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 31. In a word, it is that Law, whereof he speaketh, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
verse, <hi>that is,</hi> that Law, the transgression of which, in the least
particular, bringeth the sinner under the curse, according to that saying.
<hi>Cursed is every one, that continueth not in all things, which are contained in the
book of the Law, to do them Deut.</hi> 27: 26. And here also we see the Law &amp;
the book of the Law, are one: &amp; sure, this book of the Law contained
more, than the Ceremonial Law, even all the Moral Commandments;
in respect of which &amp; not in respect of the Ceremonial Law, the Gentiles,
&amp; amongst the rest, these <hi>Galatians,</hi> at least, so many of them, as had
not yet Judaized, were of the Law, &amp; so, under the curse. It is obvious,
how useless all the Disput of the Apostle here, &amp; in his Epistle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
is rendered by asserting, That <hi>Paul's</hi> Disput runneth only upon the
observation of the Ceremonial Law; seing now the very Subject of the debate
is taken away from us. And, if matters be so, I would faine know,
why the Apostle should have used any other Argument, in all his Dispute,
beside this one, That by the Gospel, the subject of the question is wholly
removed; the Ceremonial Law being utterly abrogated by the Gospel?
Sure, this would have Sufficiently put an end to that debate. But this
Supposal is, I confess, a short cutt to answere all the otherwise unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
Arguments of the Apostle against Justification by works, but yet
it is such, as cannot yeeld satisfaction.</p>
               <p>He addeth, <hi>in the sight of God,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is the same, upon
the matter, with that expression <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>, <hi>in His sight;</hi>
whereby we understand, what justification this is, whereof the Apostle
speaketh; even; justification before Gods Tribunal, in His Court, who
is the Supream &amp; Righteous judge; as it is with Him alone that the poor
convinced &amp; wakened Sinner hath to do: And this is the justification, that
we are most concerned to know the nature of, &amp; to understand what way
it is brought about, or to be had: This is the justification, which the
Apostle alwayes denieth to be by works, &amp; asserteth alwayes to be by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104357:10"/>
faith, in opposition to works. As for a justification of our selves against the
false Accusations of Satan, the unjust Surmises of our own treacherous
Hearts, &amp; mis-informed Consciences, &amp; the groundless Alleigances of
men, judging not according to truth, but according to their owne mis-apprehensions
(whereof <hi>Iob's</hi> friends were guilty, in an high measure) It
is not that justification, whereof the Apostle treateth. And whatever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
good works may have herein, as real fruites of an upright working
faith, &amp; consequenly as evidences of our Interest in Christ, &amp; of our being
in a state of justification; Yet they are utterly excluded from having an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in that justification, which is before God, &amp; in His sight: &amp; he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
Christ's Righteousness, Laid hold on by faith, only taketh place.</p>
               <p>The Argument, whereby the Apostle disproveth this justification by
the works of Law, in the sight of God, is in the following words, where
he ushereth-in the argument with an, <hi>It is Manifest,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; to shew,
That the Argument was irrefragable, &amp; that the truth thereby was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
&amp; beyond Contradiction. Now, the Argument is taken from the
opposition, that is betwixt <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Law,</hi> or, <hi>the works of the Law,</hi>
in the matter of justification: A ground, whereupon the Apostle goeth,
in his whole Disput, upon this matter; as we see <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 27, 28. &amp; 4:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. &amp; 9: 32. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 16. and therefore it must be a certaine truth,
That if justification before God be by faith, it can not be by works; &amp; consequently, whoever assert justification by works, destroy Gospel-justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by faith: and hence, it is also Manifest, That justification can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be by both together, Faith &amp; works conjoined; because what is of
faith cannot be of works; these two being here inconsistent <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 6.</p>
               <p>That Gospel-justification is by faith, the Apostle proveth from that
known sentence, <hi>the just shall live by faith;</hi> a sentence, which the Apostle
adduced first of all, when he was to handle this question, in his Epistle
to the <hi>Romans Chap.</hi> 1. vers 17. saying; <hi>for therein</hi> (i.e. in the Gospel) <hi>is
the Righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, the just shall
live by faith.</hi> Where we see, that this Sentence confirmeth the whole
nature &amp; contents of the Gospel, <hi>that is,</hi> That the Righteousness of God,
i.e. the Righteousness, which only will stand in Gods Court, &amp; be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of him, in order to the justifying of sinners; &amp; which is the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of one, who is God, is revealed from faith to saith; that is to say,
is hold forth to be embraced bysinners through faith, first &amp; last; &amp;
this Righteousness, thus embraced &amp; laid hold on by faith, is the onely
ground of the life of justification: so that beleevers their living by faith,
saith, their faith laith hold on the Righteousness of God, revealed in the
Gospel, as the onely ground of their life.</p>
               <p>As to the passage it self, it is cited our of <hi>Habakuk chap. 2. vers</hi> 4. where
the Prophet being told vers 3. that howbeit sometime would passe, ere
the promised delivery should come; Yet it would come; &amp; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he &amp; all the People of God, should waite for it, &amp; live in the certaine
expectation thereof, addeth these words, as being told him of the
Lord, that <hi>his Soul, which is lifted up, is not upright in him</hi> (how various<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104357:11"/>
&amp; these words are rendered by diverse, we need not mentione) the
meaning is this, That such, as will not, in faith &amp; patience, waite with
confidence upon the Lords promise, that shall be made good, in His good
time; but in their pride &amp; impatience of heart, will think to anticipate
their delivery, by sinistrous &amp; sinful meanes, declare, that their heart is
not upright, &amp; that they are void of true faith. Upon the other hand, it
is said, <hi>the just shall live by his faith,</hi> that is, Such, as are real &amp; true
beleevers, will waite in the exercise of faith, till God's time come; &amp;
by this faith, trusting &amp; leaning to the faithful promise of God, through
the Messiah, in whom all the promises are yea &amp; amen 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 20. they
shall have a life of it, they shall be carried thorow, supported, streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
&amp; com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orted. And much to this same Purpose, is this passage,
cited by the Apostle <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10: 37, 38. <hi>For yet a little while, &amp; he that shall
come, will come, &amp; will not tarry, now the just shall live by faith &amp;c.</hi> (of which
we have spoken elsewhere) in all these places, the Apostle leaveth out the
pronoun <hi>his,</hi> which the Prophet useth; but that maketh no great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the matter being clear, &amp; that sufficiently understood. The <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gints</hi>
make a great alteration, when they render the words thus, <hi>The just
shall live by my faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great difficulty is, how these words of the Prophet, spoken of such,
as were already justified, &amp; beleevers; &amp; his saying of them, that they
shall live by their faith (for we need not owne that sense of the words;
which some think may not improbably be given, to wit, <hi>That he, who is
by his faith just</hi> (or justified) <hi>shall live</hi>) can be applicable to the Apostl'es
purpose, to prove justification by faith. Not to mentione what others say
to this, nor judging it very necessary to enquire anxiously into this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
seing the Spirit of the Lord's moving &amp; inspireing of <hi>Paul</hi> to alleige,
&amp; apply this passage of Old Testament truth, for confirmation of what
he was about to prove, may fully satisfie us, as to its pertinency, though
we should not satisfie all by proprosing our thoughts concernin it. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
the ground may be this, That this being a general truth, &amp; uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
true, that even beleevers, who are already changed, &amp; have a
life begun in them, must all their life long make use of faith, gripping to
the promises, as yea, &amp; amen in Christ, (promised &amp; come) who is
the Substance &amp; Kirnel of them all, to the end they may be supported,
Strengthened. Upheld, &amp; carried thorow Difficulties, Distresses, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
Temptations &amp; the like, without fainting, or doing what is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beseeming
a living Beleever, in the day of trial; so that their whole life,
even unto the end, is kept-in &amp; continued by faith, bringing new sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
&amp; influences from the head, through the promises; it will hence
follow, that without faith no man can at first attaine to this life, &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
from death; yea, that in this case, faith is much more necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
yea faith only without works is &amp; must be, the only way to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
of life: for if the progress, &amp; continuance of this life, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
of it after decayes, be had by faith, drawing sap, life &amp; influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
from the head, much more must this be the way of getting the first chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104357:11"/>
made from death to life. And this way (or not much different) of
argueing in this same debate, we see the Apostle followeth <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. where
from what was said of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a considerable time after he was a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever,
he proveth justification by faith, without works, or that <hi>Abraham</hi>
was justified by faith, &amp; not by works. The Import then of the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is, that this life, whereof beleevers are made partakers, is begun,
continued &amp; carried on by faith, &amp; therefore it is not by the works of the
Law, but by faith, that they are justified &amp; brought into a state of life;
If it be true, that without faith, even belevers cannot be supported, nor
in case to live, as becometh, to the glory of God, &amp; to their own peace
&amp; Comforth, in new Trials &amp; Difficulties; much more is it true, that
without faith those, who are in nature, &amp; in state of Enmity to God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live the life of justification, &amp; with it alone they can &amp; shall.</p>
               <p>Before we come to speak particularly to any Truthes, deducable from
the words, we shall premise some few things considerable.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">Naturally we are inclined to cry up Selff, in
Justification.</head>
               <p>THe Apostle, as we see, in all his writtings about this matter, is
very carefull to cleare the question of justification so, as Man may
have no cause of boasting, or of glorying in himself, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of any thing he hath, or he hath done in order to justification;
that hereby he might cast a copie unto all such, as would approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
faithful unto the Lord, in being co-workers with Him, in the
Gospel; &amp; that he might so much the more set himself against that inna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telusting
of heart, that is in all naturally, unto an exalting &amp; crying up
of <hi>Self,</hi> in the matter of their justification before, &amp; Acceptance with
God; and especially we finde, how zealously, how frequently, &amp; with
what strength &amp; multitude of Arguments, he setteth himself against, &amp;
cryeth down that, which men do so naturally, &amp; with such a vehement
byasse, incline unto; <hi>to wit,</hi> justification by their own works, or by their
own obedience to the Law; to the end, their innate pride may have ground
of venting it self, in boasting &amp; glorying before men.</p>
               <p>From this we may premit, in short, the consideration of these Three
things, to prepare our way unto the clearing-up of the Gospel-Doctrine in
this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First.</hi> That there is a corrupt byasse in the heart of men by nature, &amp;
a strong Inclination, to reject the Gospel-Doctrine of free justification,
through faith in Christ; &amp; to ascribe too much to themselves, in that
affaire: as if they would hold the life of justification, not purely of the
free grace &amp; rich mercy of God, through Jesus Christ; but of themselves,
either in whole, or in part, in one measure, or another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:104357:12"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is the duty of all, who would be found faithful Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
for Christ, after the example of the Apostle, so to preach forth
the Grace of God, in this mystery, &amp; to explaine the same, as corrupt
Nature within, &amp; such without, as are byassed with mistakes about this
matter, &amp; are led away with proud &amp; carnal self conceits, may have no
apparent or seeming ground of boasting; nor be confirmed in their natural
prejudices &amp; Mistakes therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That in very deed, free Gospel-justification is so contrived
&amp; ordered as that none have any real ground of boasting, or of glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in themselves, or of ascribing any part of the glory thereof unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as if they, by their deeds &amp; works, did contribute any thing to
the procuring thereof.</p>
               <p>It will not be necessary to speak to these at any length, but only briefly
to touch upon them, to make way unto what followeth to be said on this
weighty subject, which is of so much concernment to us all.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>First</hi> of these (to which we shall speak little, in this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
&amp; thereafter of the rest, in their due order) it is too too apparent
to be a truth from these grounds following.</p>
               <p>I. This is most manifest from the many Errours &amp; false opinions, that
are Vented, Owned &amp; Maintained, with so much Violence &amp; corrupt
zeal, &amp; all to cry-up Self, in less, or in more; &amp; to cry down Grace.
Hence so many do plead, with great confidence, for an Interest of our
works, in our justification; Such as <hi>Papists,</hi> (who quite mistake the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of true justification) <hi>Socinians, Arminians,</hi> &amp; Others, who side with
these in less, or in more; &amp; will plead for a justification by our inherent
Righteousnoss, or works of Righteousness, which we do. Others, that
will not plead for such an early Interest of our works, in this matter, will
plead for faith, as our Gospel-Righteousness; &amp; affirme, that the very
act of our Obedience in us, is imputed for a Righteousness to us, &amp; is
accounted such by God; &amp; so, hath the same place in the New Covenant,
that compleet &amp; perfect obedience had in the Old Covenant of works,
made, with <hi>Adam;</hi> which, as shall hereafter appear, driveth us upon the
same rock.</p>
               <p>II. It is manifest likewise from the large &amp; frequent Disputes about
this matter, that we have in <hi>Paul's</hi> Epistles. If there had not been a great
pronness in man, by nature, to cry-up himself, &amp; to set up his own
Righteousness, in matter of justification, why would the Spirit of the Lord
have been at so much paines (to speak so) to cry down <hi>Self</hi> &amp; our works,
in this matter, as He is, in these Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> if He had not seen the
great necessity thereof, by reason of this strong Inclination, that men
Naturally have hereunto? We must not think, that any thing is there
spoken in vaine; or that the Spirit of the Lord would have left that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
so fully cleared, wherein our works are so expresly excluded, if there
had not been a necessity for it, &amp; if it had not been as necessary, in all
after ages of the Church, as at that time, when first written. Whatever
the truth be, that is so frequently &amp; pungently inculcated in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104357:12"/>
we may saifly suppose, that as the faith &amp; practice of that truth is
necessary; so there must be much reluctancy of Soul in us to receive the
same, &amp; to close with it, and a strong Inclination to beleeve &amp; practise the
contrary.</p>
               <p>III. In the Infancy of Christianity, we see, what a strong Inclination
there was to cry-up works, what we do, &amp; the Law, as the only ground
of justification; or, at least, to have a share with Christ, in that Interest,
which gave occasion to the penning of these Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> where this
matter is so fully &amp; clearly handled; particularly that to the <hi>Romans,</hi> &amp;
that to the <hi>Galatias;</hi> &amp; unto the speaking less or more hereunto, in almost
all his other Epistles. And this Inclination to the crying up of works &amp;
the Law, in Opposition to the pure Gospel-way of justification, was not
only among the Gentiles, who had been without God, &amp; without Christ,
&amp; all the Meanes of understanding any thing of Salvation, through a
slaine Saviour; but even amongst the Jewes, who, by the Dispensation of
the New Covenant, which they were under, might have been better prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled;
for it was they, who most urged the Interest of the Law, &amp; of
works, &amp; thereby<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> laboured to corrupt the Gentiles, &amp; to lead them off
the simplicity of the Gospel-truth; and of them, saith the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi>
10: 3. that, <hi>being ignorant of God's Righteousness, &amp; going about to establish
their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness
of God.</hi> They sought after a Righteousness another way, than by faith in
Christ, who is the end of the Law for righteouness, to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 4. but as it were by the works of the Law <hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 32.</p>
               <p>IV. The Pharisee, who went up to the Temple <hi>Luk.</hi> 18: 11, 12. &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thus with himself <hi>God, I thank thee, that I am not, as other men are,
Extortioners, Unjust, adulterers, or even as this Publican: I fast twice in the
week, I give Tithes of all that I possesse,</hi> &amp;c. hath many followers. Many
there are, who will have confidence in the flesh, &amp; in what they do.
Nature never taught <hi>Paul,</hi> to account all his great Privileges &amp; Attainments
loss &amp; dung; but rather to account them gaine; for he saith, they were
gaine to him; that is, while he was a stranger to the Gospel, &amp; to the
Grace of God, manifested therein. Hence is it, that the <hi>last are first,
&amp; the first are last;</hi> such, as thought themselves far advanced, &amp; to have
attained a great measure of righteousness, &amp; so to be children of the
Kingdom, are shut out, &amp; Publicanes &amp; Harlots are preferred, as being
willing to renounce themselves &amp; their own righteousness more, than
such <hi>Legalists &amp; Iusticiaries,</hi> who confide in something, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
do, &amp; have attained.</p>
               <p>V. This is also manifest from the great difficulty of prevaling with such,
as seem to themselves to have in them something more than ordinary, to
relinquish &amp; renounce these things, &amp; to betake themselves only unto
Jesus, &amp; to rest on Him alone, for Righteousness, Life &amp; Salvation; &amp;
from the little fruit that the Gospel Doctrine findeth among them. How
many subterfuges finde they out, under which they think to shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the wrath of God? How many fig-leaves do they sowe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104357:13"/>
that they may cover the shame of their nakedness withall? And at
what cost, paines &amp; charges are they, in seeking to establish their own
Righteousness? And all to fortifie themselves in their own delusions, &amp; to
keep our the pure Doctrine of the Gospel. And how ready are some to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
hold of the smallest wig, that they may hang upon it, &amp; finde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
if it can yeeld but the least ground of hop, in their imaginations,
ere they betake themselves to Christ according to the Gospel? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Fetches, Turnings &amp; Windings hath a Soul, pursued with wrath, &amp;
the apprehension of death, ere it be willing to close heartily with Christ,
offered in the Gospel? Yea, if such, as have had some wakenings, come
so far, as to change something of their former outward sinful courses,
&amp; be not so loose &amp; prophane, as formerly, how ready are they to sit
down, even upon that bit of negative righteousness? Much more, if they
be brought the length, to go about some religious duties, how will they
then sit down &amp; sing, as if all were well? All which do plainly evince,
that there is a strong Inclination in us by nature, to follow the way of
works, that we may have some share of the honour of our own justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>VI. This sad truth is hence apparent likewise, That when any Opinion
is broached, that but seemeth to give more to works, than ought to be
given, though possibly upon the matter, there be but little said, that may
make any real Difference, how ready are many to close therewith, to
entertaine that Doctrine, to cry it up &amp; commend it, &amp; to improve the
Advantages, real or supposed, there had, to the fur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er Confirmation of
that Anti-evangelik errour, which their Soul's fully comply with: when,
upon the other hand, there is such a nauseating in many too too mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
at the Simplicity of the Gospel, &amp; of the Doctrine of justification by
faith alone in Christ.</p>
               <p>If it be enquired, whence doth this proceed? or what can be the true
causes hereof? I <hi>answer,</hi> Many things have a powerful Influence into
this, as.</p>
               <p>I. The Natural Enmity unto all the wayes of God, that each hath,
as a piece of his heirship from <hi>Adam:</hi> What ever God <hi>willeth, we will
not,</hi> yea we <hi>will nill;</hi> though our nilling of it be against ourselves, &amp;
we have no reason for it. There is a Spirit of Contradiction &amp; Enmity to
God in us all by nature, that we neither can, nor will comply with God's
wayes, &amp; with what tendeth to set forth His Glory. It is marked of the
<hi>Iewes,</hi> that they stumbled at that stumbling stone, Jesus Christ, who was
the end of the Law for righteousness, to all such as beleeve <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 4. &amp; 9:
32. They had such a prejudice at Christ, &amp; at the way of Salvation through
Him, that they brake their necks upon Him, who onely was the rock of
Salvation.</p>
               <p>II. The innate darkness of Mens mindes, touching themselves, &amp; all
the things of God, especially the Mysteries of Salvation, is another cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of this Opposition to the Gospel-way of justification. They neither
know their own hearts, nor their own wayes &amp; doings; nor are they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

with the holy &amp; righteous Nature of God, nor with the nature
of His Lawes &amp; Commandments &amp;c. They know not, I say, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of their own Natures &amp; the innate wickedness which is there,
which neither is, nor can be subject to the Law of God. Hence ordinarily
such as erre, in this matter of justification, do intertaine erroneous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
about Original sin, &amp; our innate Pravity; as do all the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
Papists, &amp; many <hi>Arminians</hi> &amp; others. So they are ignorant of the
Law of God, not knowing how Holy, Good &amp; Spiritual it is; &amp; how it
obligeth the whole man, Spirit, Soul, Judgment, Understanding, Will,
Affections &amp; Memory; &amp; all the out ward Man; condemning the least
sin, in Thought, word or deed, &amp; commanding the highest pitch of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
duties, &amp; right Principles, Ends &amp; Motives &amp;c. And hence they see
neither Omissions of what is commanded, not their Commissions of what
is prohibited, whether as to their Nature, Multitude, or other Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations;
and the ignorance of this maketh them to see less the necessity
of a Righteousness without them; &amp; to seek for it with less earnestness
&amp; zeal: whence it cometh to passe, ordinarily (as is to be seen among Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists)
that such as are most for works, in justification, shape the Law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their minde, &amp; curtaile it, as did the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of old, that it
may look more conforme to their works, when their works are no way
conforme to it. So likewise, they are ignorant of god, &amp; of His Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
&amp; Righteousness; &amp; because they see, that if He be Such, as the
Orthodox say He is, according to His Word, they cannot stand before
His justice; therefore they deny His justice altogether, as do <hi>Socinians;</hi>
or Imagine Him to be all Mercy &amp;c. &amp; so imagine Him to be altogether
such an one, as themselves; &amp; therefore are not very zealous for any other
righteousness, than what may come most readily to hand, &amp; they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
can make up with their own diligence &amp; care; never remembering,
that the justice of God must be satisfied; therefore deny all Satisfaction
(as do <hi>Socinians;</hi>) or suppose Christ hath satisfied for all, &amp; procured a
New Covenant, or way to life, wherein we may bring what we have, &amp;
it will be accepted, &amp; there is no more to do: Nor remembering, that
we must have an Interest in Christ by faith, ere we have any Interest in His
Merites &amp; Satisfaction; &amp; that the whole of our Salvation is so contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as Man may be abased, &amp; Christ only exalted.</p>
               <p>III. A vaine conceite, that all things in Religion must be just as we
apprehend them to be; &amp; our blinde, corrupt &amp; byassed Reason &amp; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
must be the Supream judge &amp; Determiner of all these Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Hence the <hi>Socinians</hi> down-right say that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Scripture say what
it will, &amp; how oft it will, they are to beleeve &amp; to receive nothing, but
according to their Reason: so that, what their blinded Reason cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
they may &amp; will reject. And others, who possibly will not so
plainely lay down this ground; Yet in stead of conforming their judgments
and Apprehensions to the word, &amp; of being led by it, do frame a concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Matters of God, in their own heads, &amp; then cause the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
comply with their Apprehensions, by Interpreting them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104357:14"/>
So that following a corrupt guide here, they cannot but incline to
that way, which suiteth most with that corrupt Principle; &amp; be most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
from compliance with the Mystery of God, which is most opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
there-unto.</p>
               <p>IV. Natural corrupt self love is another evil Principle, concurring to
this effect, by its malignant Influence. We love to cry-up ourselves, to
have something of our owne to boast of, &amp; to glory of before men; and
hence we cannot naturally comply so sweetly with that way, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
away all boasting, &amp; leaveth no ground for man to glory in any
thing, save in the Lord; &amp; such is the way of faith, &amp; of Gospel-justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 27 <hi>&amp;</hi> 4: 2.</p>
               <p>V. A vaine &amp; groundless high conceite, that people have of themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
&amp; of what they do, as if there were worth &amp; excellency in it, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
God, to bestow upon them, what reward they think meet; not knowing,
that when they have done all they can, they are but unprofitable, &amp; that
they have nothing but what they have received; &amp; that for any good they
do, they are more beholden to God, than God is beholden to them; &amp;
that the best of their actions are so defiled, that they could not answere for
one of them, nor stand, if God should enter into judgment with them, &amp;
strickly mark iniquity <hi>Psal.</hi> 130: 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 143: 2.</p>
               <p>VI. Pride of heart is another malignant cause of this Aversation &amp; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness,
to comply with God's way; &amp; of this strong Inclination to
the way of justification by Works. This was it, which led the jewes away
from Christ, the end of the Law for righteousness: they would not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselves unto the righteousness of God <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 3. &amp; because they
would not bow themselves to take on this Righteousness, therefore they
were at so much paines &amp; labour, to establish their own, &amp; to cause it
stand. Proud man would work, &amp; enjoy the reward of his laboures, &amp;
will not willingly hearken to any other way. he will not be beholden to
free Grace, nor ascribe glory to the Lord Mediator; but will still be at
the old way of the first Covenant, at work &amp; wages; that he may have
it to say, he hath erned &amp; purchased the crown of life with his own hands
&amp; industrie.</p>
               <p>Therefore, from this we should all take warning, to look about us, &amp;
to guard against this strong &amp; violent torrent, that is ready to carry us head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to our ruine; &amp; to be jealous of our treacherous hearts. Hence also
we may see, whence it cometh, that the Gospel getteth so little footing
among many; &amp; how nothing less than the mighty power of God, will be
able to prevail with a Natural Soul, &amp; cause it comply with the Gospel-way
of justification, &amp; submit it self unto the Righteousness of God, &amp;
hold on Christ by faith. <hi>Further,</hi> We need not wonder to see, so many
riseing-up, in all ages, against the Gospel of the Grace of God, &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
the Gospel-Doctrine of justification, seing blinded &amp; unmortified
Man is not in case, to be cast in its mould, nor willing to embrace it, untill
he be broken, &amp; broken over againe.</p>

               <p>WE come <hi>next</hi> to speak a word unto the <hi>Second</hi> particular men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
<hi>to wit,</hi> That all, who would be found faithful Ambassadours,
&amp; be accepted of the Lord, should endeavoure, both
in practice &amp; in Doctrine, to keep this doctrine of the Grace of God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
&amp; unmixed: &amp; particularly guard against the giving ground, or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to proud Nature, to cry-up Self, in the matter of justification, by
any expression, used in the explication thereof. We see here &amp; elsewhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
how careful <hi>Paul</hi> is in this Matter, using such expressions, as may most
emphatically exclude man, &amp; all his paines, &amp; set free grace on high, that
God alone may be exalted; for here &amp; elsewhere he debaseth man, &amp; exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all his works, even the works of the best of men; even his works, who was
the father of the faithful: &amp; he crieth up Christ as all, &amp; free grace as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
&amp; carrying on all; consonant to what the Prophet <hi>Esaias</hi> said <hi>Esai.</hi>
45: 24, 25. <hi>Surely shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousness &amp; strength</hi> (or,
as it is in the Margine, <hi>Surely, he shall say of me, in the Lord is all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
&amp; strength) Even to him shall men come—In the Lord shall all the
seed of Israel be justified, &amp; shall glory.</hi> So that such, as look to Him (as it
is <hi>vers</hi> 22.) &amp; come to Him (as it is <hi>vers</hi> 24.) have all their righteousnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in the Lord, &amp; from Him; and in Him alone are they &amp; shall they be
justified, &amp; shall glory; &amp; not at all in themselves. So <hi>Ieremiah Chap.</hi> 23:
6. expresseth the matter very emphatically, holding it forth, as one of
Christ's glorious &amp; comfortable Titles of honour, that He shall be called,
<hi>the Lord our Righteousness,</hi> thereby Importing, that all the Saints their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
in order to their justification before, &amp; acceptance with God,
was in Christ; &amp; that it would be a robbing of Christ of His due honour,
to seek for a righteousnes else where. So <hi>Chap.</hi> 33: 14, 15. it is promised <hi>that
the Lord will cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David,</hi> &amp; that
<hi>hereby Iudah should be saved, &amp; Israel should dwell saifely:</hi> And it is further
said, that His spouse should wear her husbands name, &amp; be called after
Him, <hi>the Lord our righteousness;</hi> thereby professing her adherence to Him, as
her Husband, &amp; her owning of Him, as all her righteousness, &amp; glorying
in that, that He and He alone is her righteousness.</p>
               <p>In compliance herewith, we should beware of expressing our conceptions,
about the matter of justification so, as may give proud man ground of boas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
&amp; of robbing Christ of His Crown, Title &amp; Glory, in less, or in
more: and these expressions following seem to me justly chargable herewith.</p>
               <p>I. To say, That all works are not excluded in justification; but such only
as are done by the meer Power &amp; Strength of Nature; &amp; not the works
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104357:15"/>
of Grace, wrought by the Spirit. But who seeth not, how this is to set up
proud Man, whom <hi>Paul</hi> would have debased &amp; kept down? And doth
not <hi>Paul</hi> expresly tell us, that neither <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor <hi>David</hi> were so justified
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4? And that if our father <hi>Abraham were justified by works, he should ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
had, whereof to glory, though not before God vers</hi> 2? And doth he not also
tell us, that this would make the <hi>reward to be reckoned not of grace, but of
debt vers</hi> 4? &amp; would exclude faith &amp; its operations, in reference to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
&amp; take away that blessed &amp; refreshful stile of God, that <hi>He justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the ungodly vers</hi> 5? Should we not thus <hi>be saved by works of righteousness,
which we do, &amp; not according to His mercy,</hi> expresly contrary to <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 5.</p>
               <p>2. In like manner to say, That we are not justified by the works of the
Ceremonial Law; but by obedience to the Moral Law, is peccant here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so:
for the works of the moral Law are works of righteousness, which we
do, &amp; such as obey this Law, &amp; are considered as such, cannot be called
ungodly. Neither doth the Apostle thus distinguish, that proud man might
have any Interest. Nor doth he exclude only such works, when he saith,
that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not justified by works; for his works were not works of
the Ceremonial Law, but of the Moral, which will as well give ground
of boasting, &amp; make the reward of debt, &amp; not of grace, as works of
the Ceremonial Law, if not more. And it is manifest, that <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh
of that Law (&amp; of obedience to it, or of works commanded by it) which
convinceth of sin, &amp; discovereth it <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 20. &amp; 7: 7. &amp; maketh all the
world guilty <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 19. &amp; bringeth them under the curse <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 10. is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by faith <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 31. &amp; hath the promise of life annexed to it <hi>Rom.</hi>
10: 5. Gal. 3: 12. Nor doth he exclude only such works, when he speaketh
of himself <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9.</p>
               <p>3. Likewise to say, That all works are not excluded, but only Outward
works, which are done out of Principle of fear, &amp; not out of love &amp; faith,
&amp; are not inward works of grace; is to adde Fewel to this fire of pride,
&amp; to please proud <hi>Self,</hi> &amp; proud Man: for who can think, that only such
works, would lay the ground of boasting, &amp; of glorying before men? or
that only such would make the reward of debt? or that any in these daies
were pleading for justification, upon the account only of such works? or
that such works were to be understood by the Law, as if the Law did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
no other? or that such were <hi>Abraham's</hi> works? or that <hi>Paul</hi> thought
of none other, when he desired not to be found in his own righteousness
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9?</p>
               <p>4. They are guilty of the same crime, who say, That <hi>Paul</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
the jewish Law: for if thereby they meane only the Ceremonial
Law, it is manifest from what is said, that hereby <hi>Self</hi> &amp; Man shal be much
exalted, when justification is made to be by, &amp; according to the works of
the Moral Law. If they meane thereby the Judicial Law, then justification
should be by obedience to the Moral Law; yea &amp; by obedience to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law, as well as by obedience to the Moral Law, quite contrary to
the whole discourse of the Apostle. And if they meane all the Law, that
was given to the jewes, then the Moral Law is included: &amp; so all works
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104357:15"/>
are excluded, which are done in obedience to any Law of God.</p>
               <p>5. It is no less injurious to truth, &amp; favourable to proud <hi>Self,</hi> to say
with <hi>Socinus,</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> onely excludeth perfect works, done in full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the perfect Law of God; but not our Imperfect works, which
through grace are accepted, &amp; accounted our righteousness: for even these
works being works of righteouness, which we do, would not exclude boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
but give ground of glorying before men. Neither did <hi>Abraham,</hi> or
<hi>Paul,</hi> or any other Saint suppose, that their works were perfect. Nor is
it Imaginable, that any in these dayes did plead for justification, by their
own works, upon the account, that they were perfect, &amp; wholly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurat
unto the Law. Nor doth <hi>Paul</hi> insinuate, in all his discourse, any
such Distinction, or give any ground to think, that Imperfect works should
be the ground of justification, when Perfect works are not. And all this
is grounded upon this gross mistake, That by faith, which the Apostle op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
to works, is meaned our Imperfect Obedience unto the Commands
of God.</p>
               <p>6. It is injurious, upon the same account, to say, That <hi>Paul</hi> onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
such works, as are accompanied with a conceite of merite, &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
else: for he excludeth all works, without any such Distinction, even
the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (who, doubtless, was far from any such fonde
conceite, to think, that his works were meritorious) &amp; all such works,
as give ground of boasting before men, though not before God. And who
will say, that even <hi>Adam's</hi> works, performed in Innocency, had any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
in the ballance of commutative justice, or would merite at God's
hand, <hi>ex condigno?</hi> And yet, sure, such works would have made the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of debt, according to the Compact. Yea, the Apostle, in his way
of argueing, supposeth, that works cannot be mentioned in this case,
without merites; so that merite is inseparable from them. And shall we
think, that <hi>Paul Phil.</hi> 3: 9. meaned, by his own righteouness, only such
works, as he expresly accounted meritorious? Or that he could, or did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
any of his works such?</p>
               <p>7. It runneth far in the same guilt, to say, That faith it self, which
is our work, &amp; considered as our act of obedience, is Imputed to us for
righteousness, &amp; is that righteousness, upon which we are justified: for
how easily might proud <hi>Self</hi> lift up its head, &amp; boast &amp; say, it was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
because of some thing within it, or because of one work of righteou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
done by it: &amp; so glory in it self, &amp; not in the Lord? for though
it were granted, that faith were the gift <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> God yet that would not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
keep down pride, seing such, as plead for justification by good
works, will also grant, that these good works come from the Grace of God,
&amp; are wrought by the Spirit: &amp; yet such a justification would lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of boasting, &amp; of glorying before men; &amp; some would have more
ground of boasting, than others, because of their stronger faith: And ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by this way, would as well be opposite to justification through
Christ, &amp; His Imputed righteousness, &amp; by Grace, as justification by
good works; for faith here would not be considered, as bringing-in &amp; laying
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104357:16"/>
hold on a Righteousness without, the Righteousness of Christ imputed;
but as a commanded duty, &amp; as a piece of obedience to the Law; &amp; would
as well make the reward of debt <hi>ex congruo, &amp; ex pacto,</hi> as if justification
were by works.</p>
               <p>8. It is of the same Nature, to say, That <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth the works of
the Law, but not the works of the Gospel: for the same ground of pride,
boasting &amp; glorying should be laid, that would be laid, by pleading for
the works of the Law: because these are still works of righteousness, which
we do, &amp; so opposite, in this matter, unto mercy, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 5. And <hi>Paul,</hi>
to exclude all boasting &amp; glorying before Men, opposeth faith, (not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
in it Self, but as laying hold on the Righteousness of Christ, &amp; as
carrying the Man out of himself to Christ for Righteousness) unto works;
&amp; not Gospel-works unto works of the Law. And, sure, we cannot say,
that none of <hi>Abraham's</hi> works were Gospel-works, or works required in
the New Covenant, seing even then he was a beleever, when the object
of his faith, or that which he laid hold on by faith, in the Gospel, which
was preached unto him, was said to be imputed unto him for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And is it not plaine, that if justification were upon the account of
Gospel works, that God should not then be said to justifie the ungodly;
seing he, who is clothed with a Gospel righteousness, cannot be called, or
accounted an ungodly person? And yet faith looks out unto, &amp; laith hold
upon a God, that justifieth the ungodly <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 5. In a word, the asserting
of this would be the same, upon the matter, with asserting of justification
by the works of the Law: for what ever is required in the Gospel, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
by the Law; &amp; so is an act of obedience to the Law, which is
our perfect Rule of Righteousness, &amp; all our obedience must be in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
thereunto.</p>
               <p>9. It must also be accounted dangerous, for puffing-up of <hi>Self,</hi> to say,
That we are justified by our Inherent Righteousness: for then the Man could
not say, that all his righteousnesses were as filthy rags <hi>Esai.</hi> 64: 6. Nor
could that be true, which is <hi>Psal.</hi> 143: 3. <hi>for in they sight no man living
should be justified,</hi> to wit, <hi>if God should enter into Iudgment with him.</hi> Why
should <hi>Iob</hi> have abhorred himself <hi>Chap.</hi> 42: 6. if he had a righteousness
within him, &amp; had been justified by the Lord, upon the account of that
inherent righteousness? And had not <hi>Paul</hi> as good ground, as any, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
his justification by his personal inherent holiness &amp; righteousness?
Yet we hear of no such thing out of his mouth; but on the contrary, his
accounting all things but less &amp; dung, that he might gaine Christ, &amp; be
found in His Righteousness, hath a far different import. How proud might
man be, if he had it to say, that he was justified in the sight of God by
works of Righteousness, which he had done, or by his own inherent
righteousness?</p>
               <p>10. Nor will it much help the matter, to say, That this Inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is not the price laid down, but onely the Condition, or <hi>Causa, sine
qua non,</hi> or the like: for still man would hereby have some thing to be
proud of, &amp; to glory of before men; because, he would have it to say,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104357:16"/>
that his own Inherent Holiness was as well the ground of his justification,
&amp; the Condition thereof, as <hi>Adam's</hi> obedience would have been the ground
of his justification. And who knoweth not, that <hi>Self</hi> can wax proud, &amp; be
puffed up, upon a smaller occasion, than is this? And is it not strange, that
<hi>Paul</hi> never once made mention of this distinction? Shall we think, that
<hi>Paul</hi> denied <hi>Abraham</hi> to have been justified by works, because <hi>Abraham</hi>
looked upon them, as the meritorious cause, &amp; not as the Condition on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of his justification? or that <hi>Abraham</hi> indeed did so? or that <hi>Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
them, as the condition of his justification, when he said, he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not to be found in his own Righteousness, meaning, not his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
as a price, or as the Meritorious cause of his acceptance? Why
should <hi>David</hi> have spoken so absolutely, &amp; said <hi>Psal.</hi> 143: 2. <hi>enter not into
judgment with thy Servant; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified,</hi> seing,
even though God should enter into judgment with His servants, they
should be justified, as having fulfilled the condition? And why should he
have said <hi>Psal.</hi> 130: 3. <hi>If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities; ô Lord, who
shall stand?</hi> seing, though the Lord should mark iniquities, yet where the
Person hath fulfilled the Condition, &amp; hath a Personal Inherent Righteou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sness
to hold up, as the fulfilling of the condition required, he is in case to
stand in judgment, &amp; to plead for his justification, &amp; absolution, upon
the account of his performing all the condition required: And would not
vaine man have great ground of boasting here?</p>
               <p>11. Neither yet will it prevent this boasting, to say, That this Inherent
Righteousness is but a Subordinat Righteousness, whereby we have right
unto the Merites of Christ, which are the Principal Righteousness, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the demandes of the Law: for if man have any thing in himself, that
can be called a Righteousness, though but a Subordinat Righteouness, &amp;
yet such a Righteousness, as giveth right &amp; ground to justification, though
that justification be also called, only a subordinat justification, conforme to
the New Covenant, &amp; the Condition thereof, he will soon boast, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
his justification not of free grace but of due debt, conforme to
the covenant: And though this be called, only a Subordinat Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
yet proud <hi>Self</hi> will account it the Principal; because upon it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all his justification; for thereby not onely hath he a right unto Christ's
Merites, but unto justification it self; this being called the proper condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the New Covenant, wherein justification, Adoption &amp;c. are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
(as they say) upon this condition. And will not proud Man see,

the Covenant, to presente unto God where-upon to seek &amp; expect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of debt, according to the covenant? And so much the rather should we
abstaine from such expressions, in this matter, that we finde no mention made
of two fold Righteousness, &amp; of a twofold Justification; the one subordinat,
the other Principal, in the Scriptures; but all expressions, in this matter,
framed designedly to abase man, &amp; make all appear to be of free grace,
that he, who glorieth, may glory in the Lord. And as <hi>Self</hi> will be ready,
in this, to make that, which is called a Subordinat Righteousness, a Prinpal
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104357:17"/>
Righteousness; so it will have this faire &amp; plausible ground to do so;
<hi>to wit,</hi> That upon our own Righteousness, we are Immediatly accepted of
God, as Righteous; especially when the Merits of Christ are made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
unto our personal Righteousness, as procuring the New covenant;
&amp; that therein our Personal Righteousness shall be accepted, &amp; accounted
perfect &amp; compleet, though it be not so in it self, &amp; we thereupon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
justified, &amp; accepted of God, as Righteous; as they love to
speak, who assert these things.</p>

onely thing required of us, in order to our Interest in Christ, &amp; actual par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of the benefites of His Redemption, &amp; of justification in the first
place, according to the Gospel methode: Yet it is too favourable to proud
<hi>Self,</hi> to call it such a Condition, as hath a far more dangerous Import; That
is, (1.) To call it a Condition, &amp; withall deny, that it is an instrumental
Cause, or that it is to be considered, in the matter of justification, as it laith
hold on Christ, &amp; His Righteousness. (2.) To say, that the very act of
faith, or the <gap reason="foreign">

justification, &amp; not the Righteousness of Christ, except as to its Effects, in
respect of some whereof, Yea the chiefe &amp; only immediat, it is equally
Imputed to all, Reprobat, as well as Elect. (4.) To say, that this faith is
our Gospel-Righteousness, &amp; because a Righteousness, is perfect, &amp; ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
to the Rule of the New Covenant. (5.) To say; that this faith hath
the same place &amp; consideration, &amp; consequently, the same force &amp; effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
in the New Covenant, that perfect obedience had in the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

his death made Satisfaction to justice for the breach of the Law; &amp; so
purchased freedom from the Curse of the Law to all, equally, at least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally;
whereby it is apparent, that all are put <hi>in statu quo prius,</hi> in the
state, they were once in, &amp; that equally; &amp; now have new conditions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto them, which, if they performe, they are righteous, &amp; upon
that performance are freed from the Curse, &amp; made heirs of Glory: and
thus the New Covenant is of the same Nature &amp; kinde with the Old,
only its Conditions are a little altered, &amp; made more easie; &amp; their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the condition must-have a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

though not <hi>ex condigno,</hi> as neither <hi>Adam's</hi> Perfect obedience could have
had. And the performers of this condition, in this case, may reflect upon
their own deed, &amp; lay their weight on it, &amp;, it being their Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
may plead upon it, as their immediat ground of right, before God,
unto justification, &amp; Acceptance. Let any man now consider these things,
&amp; see whether or not, the asserting of faiths being such a condition, as this,
be not a plaine gratification of proud <hi>Self,</hi> &amp; the laing down a ground for
vaine man to boast, &amp; of glorying, though not-before God, yet before
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104357:17"/>
others; And whether this be not an ascribing more to faith, than is done
by such, as, yeelding it to be a condition, of the mean appointed of God,
&amp; required of us, in order to justification, say with all, that it is to be
considered not in it self, nor as an act of our obedience; but as an Instrument,
or mean laying hold upon the Righteousness of Christ without us, that it
may be ours, &amp; our onely Righteousness, where upon we may expert, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Gospel justification &amp; absolution, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>13. It tendeth too much to blow up proud <hi>Self,</hi> to say, That if works
of Obedience be not the Condition of our <hi>first</hi> justification, yet they may
be called the Condition of our <hi>Second</hi> justification, or of the Continuance
of our justification: for, as the Scripture speaketh nothing of a <hi>Second</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification;
so to assert our works to be the Condition thereof, is to crosse
the argueings of the Apostle, &amp; manifestly to lay a foundation of glorying
for Man: for if even <hi>Abraham</hi> had been justified by works, a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
time, after he was first justified, and first a beleever, he should have
had, whereof to glory, though not before God, as saith the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi>
4: 2. And <hi>vers</hi> 3. he proveth that he was justified by faith, &amp; that after he
had been a beleever; for that passage, <hi>Abraham beleeved God, &amp; it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him for righteousness,</hi> was not spoken of &amp; at his first beleeving; &amp;
so cannot be properly meaned of his <hi>First</hi> justification onely; but some
yeers there after: &amp; therefore must be true, of his <hi>Second</hi> justification,
if there were any such; Yea, <hi>the just liveth by faith</hi> (a passage that the
Apostle useth (as wee have seen) to prove justification by faith, both here
in our Text, &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: 17.) all alongs, both first &amp; last; so that the
beginning &amp; continuance of this life of justification is by faith, &amp; not by
works.</p>
               <p>14. It is also dangerous, to say, That the work of the Law, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of sin, with the Effects &amp; Consequences thereof, Sorrow, griefe, Anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety,
Legal Repentance, &amp;c. are either Dispositions, Preparations, or
Conditions of justification, or Meritorious thereof by way of Congruity;
as if there were a certaine &amp; constituted connexion betwixt these &amp; the
blessing of justification, made by any Law or promise of God; &amp; as if
none could be justified, that had not these sensible &amp; affecting Effects going
before. Sure, the asserting of this cannot but contribute much, to stirre
up &amp; foster pride in Man, &amp; give occasion to think, that man himself
hath done or suffered something, that calleth for, procureth, &amp;, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
at least, meriteth justification.</p>

               <head type="sub">Justification is so contrived, in the Gospel, as man
may be abased, &amp; have no ground
of boasting.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THirdly,</hi> we come to speak to the <hi>third</hi> thing mentioned above, <hi>to
wit,</hi> That justification is so contrived, begun &amp; carried on, that
man hath no real, or apparent ground of glorying before men, or
of boasting in himself. A few particulars will sufficiently cleare this.</p>
               <p>I. The Lord's ordinary &amp; usual Method, in bringing His Chosen ones
into a justified State, is first to convince them of their Sin and Misery, by
setting home the Law, &amp; wekening their Consciences; as <hi>Paul</hi> doth Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinally
follow this method, when he is about to cleare-up, &amp; explaine
the truth, about Gospel-justification, in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
in the first place, he convinceth all of Sin, both jewes &amp; Gentiles <hi>Chap.
1. &amp; 2. &amp;</hi> 3. concluding <hi>vers 23. That all have sinned, &amp; come short of the glory
of God, &amp; vers</hi> 9. he giveth an account of his foregoing Discourse, saying,
<hi>we have before proved both jewes &amp; Gentiles; that they are all under sin.</hi> And
againe <hi>vers 19. that every mouth may be stopped, &amp; all the world may become
guilty before God.</hi> Now this work of Conviction layeth the sinner low before
God; for thereby the Man is discovered to himself, to be undone in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to be under Sin &amp; Wrath, under the Sentence of the Law, having
his mouth stopped, &amp; having nothing to plead for himself, neither by
way of Extenuation, nor of Apology; &amp; having nothing in himself, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith
he can come before the Lord, to make Atonement for his Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
&amp; to make Satisfaction to justice: And thus the man is made to
despare in himself, as being irremediably gone &amp; undone, if free grace
prevent him not.</p>
               <p>II. Whereupon the man is made to renounce all his former grounds of
Hop, &amp; Confidence, all his former Duties, good works, civility, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Holiness, &amp; what else he placed his Confidence in formerly; Yea
all his Righteousnesses are as filthy rags, &amp; accounted as loss &amp; dung. So
that he hath nothing within himself, as a Righteousness, that he can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be justified by, before God; but on the contrary, he findeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
under the Curse, &amp; that what he thought before to be his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
is now, by the light of the Law, &amp; the discovery he hath of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
condition, founde to be sin &amp; iniquity before God; &amp; therefore to
be so far from bringing any reliefe unto him, that thereby his anxiety is
made greater, &amp; his case more desperat.</p>
               <p>III. The way of Gospel-justification is so contrived, &amp; the wakened
man (whom God is about to justifie) is now convinced of it, that Man
must be abased; for he is now made to see, that he is empty &amp; poor, &amp;
hath nothing to commend him to God, no Righteousness of his own to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104357:18"/>
produce; nothing within him, or without him, except the alone Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ the Mediator &amp; Cautioner, that can stand him in stead;
Nothing of his own must here come in reckoning, neither alone, nor in
conjunction with the Righteousness of Christ; for what is of Grace, must
not be of works, otherwise Grace is no more Grace <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 6. Christ must
have all the glory, &amp; he, who glorieth, must glory alone in the Lord.
And therefore is Christ made <hi>Righteousness</hi> unto us. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 30. &amp; is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>the Lord our Righteousness Ier.</hi> 23: 6. And all His must say, That <hi>in the
Lord, they have righteousness Esai.</hi> 45: 24.</p>
               <p>IV. Nothing, that preceedeth faith, no motions or workings of the
Law, no legal Repentance, &amp; the like, have any infallible connexion with
justification; nor are they any congruous disposition thereunto, or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
thereof, there being no promise made, that all such, as are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
&amp; awakened, &amp; have some legal terrours &amp; works of the Law upon
their Spirites, shall certainely be justified; &amp; experience proving, that
several, who have had deep convictions &amp; Humiliations, have, with the
dog, returned to their vomite, &amp; become afterward worse than ever, doth
also confirme this. So that, after the deepest legal Humiliations &amp; works
of Terrour &amp; outward Changes, &amp; the like Effects of the Law (though
when they are wrought by the Lord, intending &amp; bringing about the Elect
sinner's Conversion &amp; justification, they have this kindly work upon the
heart, to cause the Soul more readily &amp; willingly listen to the offers of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
&amp; Mercy, in the Gospel; &amp; to submit to the termes &amp; Method,
which God hath, in His great wisdom &amp; mercy, condescended unto, as
to the actual Conferring &amp; bestowing of the blessings, purchased by Christ,
for His own chosen ones) justification is an Act purely of God's free Grace,
undeserved of them, on any account; &amp; an act of His meer mercy &amp; Love.
So that they are justified freely by His grace, through the Redemption,
that is in Christ <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 24.</p>
               <p>V. Unto this justification, their good Works are not required, upon
what somever account: for good works must follow justification, &amp; not
preceed it. They must be first accepted through Christ, before their works
of holiness can be accepted. The whole Gospel doth most plainely exclude
works of the Law, under whatsoever Notion, Qualification, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction,
as we manifested above, &amp; shall more manifest hereafter: Yea,
all works, upon what somever account, are excluded, as opposite to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by faith, through Jesus Christ. The man, who had no more to
say, but <hi>God be merciful to me a sinner,</hi> went home justified, when he, who
said, <hi>God, I thank thee, I am not as other men, nor as this Publican, &amp;c.</hi>
did miss that Privilege. <hi>Paul</hi> hath so directly &amp; plentifully proved, that
no man is justified by works, that we need say no more of it; and therefore, in
this matter of justification, man hath no ground of boasting, but must glory
in the Lord alone.</p>
               <p>VI. As without a Righteousness no man can be justified before God,
because His judgment is alwayes according to truth, &amp; He will pronunce
no man Righteous, who is not so, or who hath no Righteousness: And as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104357:19"/>
no man hath a Righteousness of his own, &amp; in himself, that will abide
the trial of God's judgment; for if He should enter into judgment, with
any that liveth, they should not be able to stand before His judgment seat,
&amp; be justified; but all, who are justified, are in themselves ungodly, &amp;
void of all Righteousness, that can ground a sentence of absolution from
the Condemnation of the Law: So it is the Righteousness of Christ, as
Mediator &amp; Cautioner, which is to them the only ground of their abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
&amp; justification; &amp; this Surety-Righteousness of Christ is imputed to
them by God, &amp; they are clothed therewith; &amp; being considered as clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
there with, are pronounced Righteous by the Lord, the righteous
judge, &amp; dealt with as such. So that all the Righteousness, which is the
ground of their absolution from the Condemnation of the Law, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them, in another, who was appointed their Cautioner: &amp; therefore
all appearance of any ground of boasting in themselves, is quite taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by the Law of faith <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 27. &amp; the reward is now wholly of grace,
&amp; not of debt <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 4.</p>
               <p>VII. Though faith, &amp; faith only be required of us, in order to our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Interest in Christ &amp; His Righteousness, &amp; to justification therethrough;
Yet this leaveth no ground of boasting unto man, or of glorying in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
for it is in it self a plaine solemne Declaration of the Beleevers Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
Conviction, &amp; Acknowledgment of his own Beggarliness. Poverty
&amp; Nakedness, &amp; of his being a dyvoure &amp; <hi>non-solvendo,</hi> haiving no Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of his own, &amp; renounceing all that is in him, in order to his
own justification; &amp;, as it were, a swearing of himself bare; &amp; a laying
hold upon a Righteousness without him, even the Righteousness of Christ,
<hi>who is the End of the Law for righteousness to every one that beleeveth Rom.</hi> 10: 3,
4. &amp; resting upon it; &amp; a producing of it, as the ground of his Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in face of court, to his own shame, &amp; to the glory of his Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
So. far is it from being the mans Righteousness, that it is a plaine &amp;
open declaration, that he hath no Righteousness, but must go to Christ
for a Righteousness. And so far is the beleever from reflecting on it, as
his Righteousness, &amp; from darring to present it to God, as his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
&amp; plead for absolution upon the ground thereof, as if it were
perfect, &amp; a full Righteousness, according to the Gospel; that he only
thereby saith, <hi>in the Lord have I Righteousness;</hi> &amp; he looks upon it, as most
weak &amp; imperfect; &amp;, being encouraged by the free promise of God,
he laith hold on Christ, with the trembling &amp; weak hand of faith,
which he hath; &amp; ostentimes, so far is he from having any confidence in
his faith, that with much doubting &amp; hesitation, he, as almost despairing
of being the better thereby, seeing no other outgate, or remedie, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureth,
with a peradventure, he may be saved so, &amp; that how ever he can
but perish. How far, such a soul, that is fleing to Christ for refuge, is
from conceiveing any ground of boasting in himself, is sufficiently plaine,
&amp; the sense &amp; experience of all, so exercised, can declare.</p>
               <p>VIII. Even this Act of the soul, looking out, going to, gripping &amp;
laying hold upon Jesus Christ &amp; His Righteousness, held forth &amp; offered
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104357:19"/>
in the Gospel to all self condemned sinners, despairing in themselves, is
not of themselves; it is the gift of God <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 8. The Spirit of Jesus bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
&amp; inclineth the soul hereunto, &amp; determineth the doubting man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this choice, &amp; maketh him willing, whether it be in a lesser, or in a
greater degree, to flee to Christ for shelter, from the storme of wrath,
&amp; to be saved from the Curse: And though the soul, in the meane while,
be not in case to observe &amp; take notice of the powerful workings of grace
herein; Yet afterward he is in better case to see it, &amp; to celebrate the rich
&amp; free grace of God, who hath visited him in his low condition, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
à work in him &amp; never left him, untill he landed him in Christ, in
whom was all fulness, &amp; he found he was compleat, &amp; through whom
he obtained that delivery from wrath, which he was seeking after, meerly
out of his wonderful free grace &amp; mercy.</p>

&amp; serving to prepare the way unto what followeth to be
spoken unto; we come more particularly to handle the words, &amp;
to see what may be drawn out of them for our Information &amp; Edification,
that we may be instructed concerning the nature of this noble Privilege, &amp;

thereof, as also stirred up unto a right Improvement of the truth
herein, whether we be already made partakers thereof, or are yet strangers
thereunto.</p>
               <p>We Intend not (as we hinted at the beginning) to touch upon, far less
to discuss at lenghth, all the many &amp; perplexed controversies, that are

Nor do we intend to handle the several Arguments, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
adduceth for confirmation of the Truth, in this matter, But our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
only being to touch upon, &amp;, at least, to endeavoure the clearing
of some of the Principal Questions, moved in this matter, in reference
to the forementioned ends, we shall satisfie our selves, at present, with
speaking to such particulars, as the Text will give ground for.</p>
               <p>The words having been cleared, &amp; the Scope of the Apostle declared,
which cannot be hid from the eyes of any, who will read the purpose, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
are only two things, which call for our Consideration; <hi>First</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
which the Apostle is disproving &amp; confuting with a <hi>manifesto;</hi> to
wit, <hi>That no man is justified in the sight of God by the Law,</hi> or by the works of
the Law. <hi>Next</hi> The argument, which the Apostle maketh use of, to this
end; <hi>for the just shall live by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apostles way of argueing here, &amp; elsewhere, with the same, or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104357:20"/>
the like Argument, whereby he stateth an Inconsistency, yea an Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
betwixt justification by the Law, &amp; justification by faith, saith, that
it will not be very necessary to speak much to that, which is here the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
Conclusion; that is, to cleare, that justification is not by the works
of the Law: for the clearing of justification by faith will enforce that of it
self. We shall not therefore insist upon that, howbeit we may in end, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
what is said by some for justification by works, &amp; what way such think
to shun the <hi>odium,</hi> of manifestly contradicting the Apostle, &amp; of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
that Errour, which he setteth himself so peremp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>orily against, as
acted by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>The Principal thing then, which we have here to do, is to consider the
Import of the Apostles argument, <hi>for the just shall live by faith,</hi> yet we are
not to consider these words, in their just length &amp; breadth, nor particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
in reference to the use, which the Prophet <hi>Habbakuk</hi> maketh of them.
<hi>Hab.</hi> 2: 4. &amp; this same Apostle <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 38. (of this we have spoken else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where)
But only in reference to the use, which the Apostle here maketh
of them, in clearing up the way, how justification is brought about. And
considering them in this respect, we will have two things only to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of; <hi>First</hi> The assertion of justification by faith. <hi>Next</hi> The Influence, that
this assertion hath into the Apostles Conclusion; <hi>to wit,</hi> That therefore
justification is not by the Law, nor by the works of the Law.</p>
               <p>In speaking to the <hi>First,</hi> we will have occasion to speak both to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
the nature &amp; ground of this change, made in justification, as
also to the continuance of that state of justification. And then we will
have occasion to show, how both the beginning &amp; Continuance of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is by faith: for as the sinner at first becometh just, or is brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a justified state by faith, so is he carried on &amp; continueth in that state
of life, to the end: this being alwayes true, that first &amp; last, the just li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
by faith; faith beginneth, &amp; faith carrieth on this life, untill the
justified man be glorified.</p>
               <p>The Apostle (that we may come to speak something to cleare the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this State of justification) is asserting justification by faith, to cry
down justification by the Law, or by the works of the Law, which some
false Teachers were perswading those <hi>Galatians</hi> to beleeve; &amp; he addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
a passage of Scripture, which saith, <hi>the just shall live by faith,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
giving us to understand, that the just man, or the justified man, is
a living man; for the <hi>just liveth.</hi> And it is too narrow, to interprete this
life, of eternal life; &amp; this would make the Apostles argument very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure;
we must therefore unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

end in glory: &amp; this is most consonant both to the Prophet's scope,
&amp; to the scope of the Apostle here.</p>
               <p>Whence we may gather, That in justification by faith, there is a real
life obtained: by justification the soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is brought into a new state of life; &amp;
by it, such, as were really dead, are really made alive. This may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cleared from these particulars following.</p>
               <p>I. Such are said to be born again <hi>Iob.</hi> 3: 5. not only by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104357:20"/>
may import <hi>Sanctification,</hi> but also by <hi>Water,</hi> which may import <hi>Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
wherein iniquities are pardoned, &amp; the Soul is washen from its guilt,
through the bloud of Jesus Christ, represented by the Water in Baptisme.
Thus are they also put into a new state, being <hi>delivered from the Power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and translated into the Kingdome of His dear Son, Col.</hi> 1: 13. Christ now
owneth them, as His, &amp; Satan hath no more power and jurisdiction over
them, their guilt being removed, and their sinnes being pardoned: for,
because of sin hath Satan, as a jailour, had power over them, as so many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
but sin being taken away, in their justification, they are loosed
from his bondes, and delivered from his prison and power. We see <hi>Paul</hi>
was sent <hi>Act.</hi> 26: 18. <hi>To open eyes, and to turn from darkness to light, &amp; from
power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sinnes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Hereby they are brought into a State of Salvation, and being out of
harmes way, they are said to be saved, being now in a State of life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
through Jesus Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 5, 8. <hi>For by grace are ye saved through
faith:</hi> and how was this? It was by Christ, together with whom they were
quickened; when before they were dead in sins &amp; trespasses, v. 5. So <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 5.
<hi>Not by works of rigteousness, which we have done, but according to his mercy he
saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</hi> But
how was this work of Salvation begun? See vers 7. <hi>That being justified by
His grace, we should be made heirs, according to the hop of eternal life.</hi> So that
as justification maketh way for Adoption; so it bringeth Souls into a saife
state, a state of Salvation; so as they, in a sense, are already denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
<hi>saved;</hi> that is, brought out of the state of death, and put into a
state of Salvation: Thus are they also said, to be <hi>quickened together with Him,</hi>
(i. e. Christ) <hi>having forgiveness of all their sinnes, Col.</hi> 2: 13. This will be
further clear, if we consider how</p>
               <p>3. Those, who are justified, shall certainly be saved, not only in respect
of the Decree and purpose of God; but in respect also of the Gospel constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the declared will of God. Therefore saith the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 1.
<hi>There is therefore now no condemnation to them, which are in Christ Iesus.</hi> And
all such, as are in Christ Jesus, are justified; as the Gospel cleareth. And
againe more clearly, vers 30. <hi>And whom he justified, them he also glorified.</hi> The
connexion betwixt these two is indissoluble. So doth the Apostle not only
assert, but he confirmeth this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 9. <hi>Much more being now justified by his
bloud, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.</hi> And againe, vers 17. <hi>For
if by one mans offence death reigned by one, much more they, which receive aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of grace, and of the gift of righteousness.</hi> (That is, who welcome, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
and receive the rich offer of grace, and the rigteousness of Christ, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and graciously presented in the Gospel to all that will accept thereof)
<hi>shall reigne in the life by one Iesus Christ.</hi> So likewise, vers <hi>last. That as
sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reigne through righteousness unto
eternal life by Iesus Christ, our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. They who are justified, are brought into a state of blessedness, and
therefore may well be said to live, or to be made partakers of a life, <hi>Rom.</hi>
4: 6, 7, 8. <hi>Even as David also describeth the man, unto whom God imputeth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104357:21"/>
righteousness, without works; saying, blessed are they whose iniquities are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
and whose sinnes are covered. Blessed is the man, to whom the Lord will
not impute sin.</hi> See <hi>Psal.</hi> 32: 1, 2. If then they be brought into a state
of blessedness, they must be a in a state of life; for death and blessedness are
inconsistent.</p>
               <p>5. They are said to be redeemed; and consequently brought out of the
state of death, wherein they were, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 7. <hi>In whom we have redemption,
through his bloud, the forg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>veness of sins, according to the riches of his grace.</hi> In &amp;
by justification is this forgiveness of sinnes, whereby they are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of a redemption. <hi>See Col.</hi> 1. 14. Where the same is asserted by the
Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>le.</p>
               <p>For further clearing of this, let us see wherein this life consisteth; and
then we shall not only see, that it is really a life, but also, that it is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
and excellent life. To this end therefore, let us consider these following
particulars.</p>
               <p>1. Hereby they have Remission and pardon of their Iniquities, as was now
cleared, and is manifest from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 24, 25. <hi>Being justified freely by this
grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ; whom God hath set forth to
be a propitiation for the remission of sins, that are past, &amp;c.</hi> And by this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and pardon of sins, they have a freedom and exemption from the
Curse and wrath of God, that was lying upon them, and to which they
were obnoxious by sin and guilt, Orginal and Actual, which they were to
be charged with, that being the penalty threatned in the Law, even death
and the Curse of God; for it is written, <hi>cursed is every one that continueth not in
all things written in the Law, to do them, Gal.</hi> 3: 10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27: 26. O how
excellent a life is this, to be delivered from the wrath of the Almighty, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revenging
God, and from the Curse and malediction of the great Legislator,
and dreadful Judge? How rightly may they be said to live, who are freed
from the sentence of death, to which they were liable; from the penalty of
the broken Law of the great God of Heaven and Earth; and from that doom,
that all, who shall not share of this rich privilege of Remission, shall be
made to hear at length, <hi>depart from me, ye Cursed, &amp;c.</hi> A person guilty of
death, and lying in chaines, looking for nothing but the sentence &amp; doom
to be given out against him, would think himself a living man, if in stead
of that sentence, which he was every houre looking for, he should hear of
a free and gracious pardon. Much more may this state of Remission be
looked upon as a state of life. (2) They are hereby freed from that death,
Slavery and Tyranny, which the Law did exercise over them before, and
doth exerce over all such, as are not yet justified, for as the Law discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 20. So it worketh wrath <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. And thereby hath
dominion over a man, binding him over in chains, as it were, unto the
wrath &amp; Curse of God. But Christ hath now <hi>delivered them from the Curse of
the Law, being made a Curse for them, Gal.</hi> 3: 13. And they by faith having
fled to him, are pardoned, and the Law hath no more to say, especially
seing it is satisfied by the Cautioners being made a Curse, and having fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it in our Nature and place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 3, 4. Thus are they freed from and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104357:21"/>
dead to the Law by the body of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: 4. O what a noble, sweet
and refreshing life is this, to be free of this Slavery and Bondage, whereby
the Law is alwayes lying about the neck of the poor sinner, the Curse and
wrath of God, as oft as he sinneth. And adde to this (3.) That they are
freed from the just and well grounded managment of the Law against them
by Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an, or a wakened Conscience. I say, <hi>just and well grounded ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagment;</hi>
for I grant, the Devil and a mis-informed Conscience can bring
forth the Law, and terrifie therewith a true beleever, by charging, him
with the transgressions thereof, even after these transgressions are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
but this is unjust and illegal; and the beleever is under no obligation
to acknowledge these Charges, or to admit them, but, on the contrary,
to reject them, as being groundless, &amp; contrary to the tenor of the Gospel.
But the unbeleever and unjustified Soul is laid open to all these fearful char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and dreadful challenges, to all those summons, that are as so many poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
darts, shot into his very heart, every one of which is a death to him,
which he seeth not how to evite. Must not then this be a considerable and
noble heavenly life, to have sin pardoned and thereby be freed from these
Soul-affrighting, Heart-pierceing, Conscience-burning and Mind-tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
Acculations, Charges, Libels, and Dittayes, brought home and
delivered by the wicked Accuser of the Brethren, and a wakened enligtened
Conscience? Must there not be many lives in this one?</p>
               <p>2. Hereby they have peace and Reconciliation with God, <hi>being justified
by faith, we have peace with God, Rom.</hi> 5: 1. <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the
World unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, 2 Cor.</hi> 5: 18, 19.
They are now reconciled, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 10. So <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 20. <hi>And, (having made
peace, through the blood of His cross) by Him to reconcile all things unto Himself.</hi>
Herein also they have received the Atonement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 11. And the <hi>Enmity
is abolished, Ephes.</hi> 2: 15. And <hi>slaine</hi> v. 16. So that the enmity on both hands is
taken away; they are reconciled unto the Lord, who before were alienated
and enemies in their mindes by wicked works, <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 21. And the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being made, the wrath of God is apaced towards them, and that
Law-wrath, under which they did formerly lye, is quite removed, and they
are no more looked upon, nor dealt with as Enemies, but owned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
as reconciled friends. And who can express the good and sweet of
this life? or who can conceive what an heaven lyeth wrapped up here? How
justly may he be accounted a dead man, who is an Out lawer and a Rebel to
God, who tasteth nothing of the Kindness and Friendship of God, getteth
nothing from Him, as from a Friend, but all as from an Enemie, even all
the outward favoures he enjoyeth in the World; how great and glorious
so-ever they be, in the eyes of men? And, on the other hand, how happy
is he, and how justly and deservedly may he be called a living man, who can
call God his Friend; go to Him as to a Friend; receive all from Him as
from a Friend, how inconsiderable so-ever in the eyes of the World
the things be, which he getteth. This is a life, the Good, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
the Joy, the Comfort, the Peace of which, who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:104357:22"/>
3. Hereby they are absolved and acquitted from all, that could be justly
laid unto their charge: for justification in Scripture, is expressive of a juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
Act of a just Judge, absolving a person from the guilt laid to his charge,
and from the sentence of the Law, due upon the account of that, where
with he was charged; and never doth denote a making of righteous by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
of tigteousness, or by making any real physical change within, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>Papists</hi> say, as wee see, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25: 1. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15: 4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17: 15. <hi>Esai.</hi>
50: 8. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8: 31, 32. <hi>Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d.</hi> 23: 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12: 37. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7: 29. &amp; 16: 15.
And in multitudes of moe places. O! what a life is here, when a poor
self-condemned sinner standeth before the Judge, the righteous Lord, &amp; hath
his sinnes charged upon him, and the Law brought forth, cursing every
transgressour, for every transgression, and justice appearing against him,
calling for the execution of the sentence, according to Law, and for death
&amp; vengeance due by Law; and upon all this can look for nothing but doom
and present execution of the dreadful sentence: what a life, I say, is it for
such a sinner; standing in this posture, to have a sentence of absolution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
and be openly declared righteous, and not worthy of death, or
free of the charge given in against him: and thus is it with Beleevers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Gospel constitution; for though they have sinned, &amp; come
short of the glory of God, in themselves; yet now they are justified freely
by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ, and that by
faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 22, 23, 28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 16. Though they were Unrighteous, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators,
Idolaters, Adulterers, Effeminat, Abusers of themselves with
mankind, Theeves, Covetous, Drunkards, Revilers, and Extortioners;
yet now they are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6: 9, 10, 11.
God justified the Ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 5. The Circumcision by faith and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision
through faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 30.</p>
               <p>4. The ground of this sentence of Absolution, passed upon them, or in
their favours, will more manifest both the Reality and Excellency of this
life. Though they in themselves have been, and are sinners and ungodly, &amp;
cannot plead not guilty, nor adduce any ground in themselve where upon they
can plead Exemption from the penalty of the Law; but as they stand guilty
in Law, so they stand convicted in their own Consciences, their mouthes are
stopped, and they are become guilty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 19. They know and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
that they have sinned, and come short of the glory of God vers 23. &amp;
so can expect nothing, but death &amp; destruction, if the Lord should enter
with them in jugdment, and mark iniquity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130: 3. &amp; 143. 2. Yet,
the judgment of the Lord being alwayes according to truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2: 2.
Such as He pronunceth Righteous, and absolveth from the sententence of
the Law, as such, must be Righteous; for to justifie the wicked is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17: 15. And seing they are not, neither can be
Righteous, in themselves, nor have a Righteousness of their own, which
they can present to justice, and in which they can appear before God, who is
a righteous Judge, they must needs have a righteousness from some other;
and this is a Surety-righteousness, the righteousness of the Mediator and
Cautioner, Jesus Christ, Imputed to them, and received by faith: and being
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104357:22"/>
clothed with this noble rob of Rigteousness, with Christ, who is <hi>the Lord
our Righteousness,</hi> and beareth this Name and Title, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23: 6. And who
<hi>is made of God unto us Righteousness. 1. Cor.</hi> 1: 30. They may be looked upon
as living indeed. <hi>In the Lord have they righteousness,</hi> and upon this account,
<hi>in the Lord are they justified, and shall glory, Esai.</hi> 45: 24, 25. This is <hi>the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of God, without the Law,</hi> which is <hi>witnessed by the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Iesus Christ, unto all, and
upon all them that beleeve. Rom.</hi> 3: 21, 22. This is that <hi>faith,</hi> or object of
faith, that was <hi>imputed to Abraham for righteousness, Rom.</hi> 4: 3, 5, 9. And
the <hi>righteousness, that God imputeth without works</hi> vers 6, 11. This is the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of faith, through which the promise is,</hi> vers 13. This is the <hi>righteousness,
that shall be imputed to all, who beleeve on Him, that raised up Iesus our Lord
from the deed.</hi> vers 24. This is <hi>the free gift by grace, which is by one man, Iesus
Christ, that hath abounded unto many, Rom.</hi> 5: 15. This is that <hi>aboundance of
grace, and gift of righteousness,</hi> which beleevers <hi>receive,</hi> whereby <hi>they reigne
in life, by one Iesus Christ,</hi> vers 17. And that <hi>righteousness of one;</hi> by which
<hi>the free gift come upon all</hi> beleevers, <hi>unto justification of life.</hi> vers 18. And the
<hi>obedience of one, by which many are made righteous,</hi> vers 19. And that <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
through which grace reigneth unto eternal life by Iesus Christ, our Lord,</hi>
vers 21. This is the <hi>righteousness of the Law, fulfilled in us,</hi> by Gods <hi>own Son,
whom He sent in the likeness of sinful flesh, Rom.</hi> 8: 2, 3. This is <hi>Gods righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
to which the Jewes would <hi>not submit,</hi> but went about <hi>to establish their
own righteousness: for Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every one that
beleeveth, Rom.</hi> 10: 3, 4. It is that <hi>righteousness, which is of faith,</hi> which the
<hi>Gentiles have attained,</hi> who <hi>followed not after righteousness;</hi> &amp; which <hi>Israel did
not attaine to,</hi> though they <hi>followed after the Law of righteousness, because they
sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law, for they stumbled at
that stumbling stone, Rom.</hi> 9: 30, 31, 32. By this are Believers made <hi>the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of God in Him,</hi> who, though <hi>He knew no sin, yet was made sin for us.
2 Cor.</hi> 5: 21. This is that <hi>righteousness, which is through the faith of Christ, the
righteousness, which is of God by faith, Phil.</hi> 3: 7, 8, 9. which <hi>Paul</hi> desired
only to be found in, and that in opposition to his own righteousness, which
is of the Law; and for which he did account all things, which formerly were
gaine to him, to be loss &amp; dung. Now, what a noble life of faisty and
Security is this, for a poor naked sinner, void of all righteousness, and
thereby exposed to the lash of the Law, to the Curse and wrath of God, to
be covered with a compleet and perfect righteousness, consisting in full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to all the demandes of the Law, both for doing and suffering; with
which the Self condemned sinner may now, with boldness and confidence,
think of approaching unto, and appearing before the Tribunal of God?
who can express the Serenity of Soul, the inward peace calmness, and Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of mind, the Joy, Cheerfulness and Exulting of heart, that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
here upon? How is the Drooping, Sincking, Dead and discouraged
Soul, that hath any sense or feeling of this, revived &amp; quickened? And
how beit the sense of it be away (as oft it happeneth) yet the change, that
is hereby made, when the Lord imputeth this righteousness of Christ, &amp;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104357:23"/>
causeth the Soul by faith to embrace it, and accept of it, is as a Resurrection
from the dead.</p>
               <p>5. They have, as a benefite, necessarily following upon, and insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
accompanying this justification, the noble and rich privilege of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>For to as many, as received Him, to them gave He power to become the Sones
of God, Joh.</hi> 1: 12. And all those, that are justified, receive Him and His
righteousness, and rest upon it. Being thus redeemed from under the Law,
<hi>they receive the Adoption of Sones, Gal.</hi> 4: 5. And <hi>being justified by His grace,
they are made heirs, according to the hop of eternal life, Tit.</hi> 3: 7. And by this
as their State is demonstrated to be a State of life; so the many and exceeding
great and rich, yea incomprehensibly glorius and excellent favours, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
and Privileges, that lye in the womb of this comprehensive Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege,
shew their life to be an excellent life: for (1) Being thus adopted,
they have a new Relation unto God, as their Father, and they are His
Children, taken into His Family: they have His name put upon them,
they are called by His name, or His name is called upon them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 14: 9.
Then is that word make good, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 18. I will be a Father unto you, and
ye shall be my Sons and Daughters, saith the Lord God Almighty.</hi> Then is He
their God in a peculiar manner, and they are His People, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 1. Then
have they written upon them the name of Christs God, and the name of the
City of His God, and His own new name, in its earnest and beginnings,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 3: 12. O! what a life is here, to stand thus related unto the great
God? what an honourable life and Privilege is this, for such, who were by
Nature Children of the Devil! (2) Being thus Adopted, they have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to all the Children of the Family, and are united unto them, as
members of the same Familie, as Brethren or Sisters of the chosen Family.
They are then among those, whom Christ hath gathered together in one,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 10. And belong to that Church, which is <hi>His Body, the fulness of
Him, that filleth all in all,</hi> vers 22, 23. They have a relation now unto the
Church Triumphant, as well as to the Church Militant; whence that is in
part verified. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12: 22, 23. <hi>But ye are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the
living God, the heavenly Ierusalem, &amp; to an innumerable company of Angels; to
the General Assembly &amp; Church of the first born, which are written in Heaven.</hi>
They are <hi>no more Strangers and Forreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints,
and of the houshold of God, Ephes.</hi> 2: 19. (3) Being by Adoption <hi>Children,
they are heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ, Rom.</hi> 8: 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4: 7.
They are now <hi>begotten to an Inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that
fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for them. 1. Pet.</hi> 1: 4. Hence they are <hi>heirs
of Salvation, Heb.</hi> 1: 14. <hi>Being Abrahams seed, they are heirs according to the
promise, Gal.</hi> 3: 29. &amp; these <hi>promises</hi> they do <hi>inherite, Heb.</hi> 6. 12. What a
life hath the Son and heire of a great King, when he may look upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great Dominions &amp; Kingdomes of his Father, as his own? But what a
greater life is it, when a poor sinner, that is now adopted through faith,
may look thorow all the great and precious promises, contained in the Book
of God, and say all these are mine; and may look up to Heaven, &amp; to that
glory, which eye hath never seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104357:23"/>
heart of man to conceive, &amp; say, all that is mine, through Jesus Christ
I am served heire thereunto, &amp; have the begun possion thereof, in mine
Head &amp; Elder Brother Jesus Christ? (4.) Being adopted, they have the
earnest of the Spirit, sealing them to the day of Redemption: for in
Christ they have <hi>obtained an inheritance, &amp; are sealed with that holy Spirit of
promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
possession Ephes.</hi> 1: 11, 13, 14. &amp; 4: 30. And who can express what
a life this is? (5) Being adopted, they have free access to the throne
of Grace with boldness, God being their Father, the door standeth open,

<hi>through Christ, they have an access by the Spirit unto the Father Ephes.</hi> 2: 18.
And <hi>in Him, they have boldness &amp; access with Confidence, by the faith of Him
Ephes.</hi> 3: 12. They may now <hi>come boldly unto the throne of Grace, that they

to have heart &amp; tongue loosed, &amp; to be in case to speak unto the Father,

&amp; say, Thus &amp; thus doth my Father unto me; this is the hand &amp; working
of a Father about me: This how sharpe so ever it seem to be, yet is the
effect of tender love, &amp; floweth from the heart &amp; bowels of a kinde &amp;

               <p>6. Their justification saith, They are translated out of nature, &amp; deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from that death, under which they did lye formerly, unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
any, even the least, vital act of life: for before justification, they
are united unto Christ by faith, life is begun in their soul, the seed of life
is beginning to bud in them, &amp; to bring forth fruit, when they are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to beleeve, &amp; to act faith upon, &amp; to receive Jesus Christ, as He
is offered in the Gospel. The spiritual life is in them, &amp; is working, when
it moveth them Christ-ward, &amp; powerfully draweth &amp; inclineth their Soul,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104357:24"/>
to close with Christ. This faith is the work of the Spirit of God alone;
It is <hi>not of our selves,</hi> but the <hi>gift of God Ephes.</hi> 2: 8. This beleeving is <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the working of his mighty Power, which he wrought in Christ, when he
raised him from the dead Ephes.</hi> 1: 19, 20. Therefore is the Spirit called, the
<hi>Spirit of faith,</hi> which all beleevers have 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 13. for now, in order to
the effectual producing of this grace of faith in the Soul, their mindes are
enlightened to understand Spiritually &amp; Savingly, the things of God <hi>Act.</hi>
26: 18. For God revealeth them unto them by His Spirit, who only kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
the things of God; which Spirit they have received, that they might
know the things, that are freely given them of God 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2: 10, 11, 12.
Now they have <hi>received the Spirit of Wisdom &amp; Revelation, in the knowledge
of Him, the eyes of their understandings being enlightened Ephes.</hi> 1: 17, 18. And
as their mindes are changed, so is their heart; for the heart of stone is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

36: 26. &amp; their wills are renewed &amp; inclined unto good: They have gotten

               <head type="sub">What mysteries are in Justification.</head>
               <p>WHat was said in the foregoing <hi>Chapter</hi> may by way of use, <hi>First,</hi>
discover unto us that Kindness and Love of God our Saviour,
that hath appeared unto men, whereof the Apostle speaketh,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 4. For this is one remarkable Instance thereof, and calleth for Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and praise from us, upon that account. O! what Tenderness, Love
and Pity appeareth here! And what a wonderful Grace is this, that is here
manifested? what condescension of Love and free Grace is clearly legible in
this business? And how clear and distinct will all this appear to a self condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sinner, arraigned in its convinced Conscience, before the tribunal of
God; and then seeth, in the Gospel, a well contrived way of absolution,
&amp; closeth with it? How will all this shine forth unto them with a heavenly
Lustre and Majestie? And how sweetly will their hearts acquiesce in this Sure
and Saife way of obtaining life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This may discover unto us, what a manifold wisdom of God is
to be seen &amp; observed, in the Gospel dispensation, that even Principalities
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104357:24"/>
and powers may look into, and wonder at; as it is said to be made known
unto them, by the Church, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3: 10. That is, by what they see and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
in the administration thereof, in the Church. And in this part of
Gospel-device, there are several things remarkable, that may give us
ground to wonder at this manifold Wisdom of God. The whole is
a mysterie, and this is a prime part of the mysterie, and in this myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
there are many mysteries, a short view of which may be of some use
to us.</p>
               <p>1. What a mysterious and wonderful thing is it, That such, as are dead
by Law, lying under the sentence thereof, &amp; so bound over to the wrath
of God, according to the threatning of the Law, which is just and righteous
in all points; and such, as have nothing to defend themselves by from the
threatned death, unto which they are obnoxious; nor any thing, whereby
to make Satisfaction to the demandes of the Law, or to the offended Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,
or where with to appease Him; should notwithstanding hereof be
Really, Formally and Effectually absolved from the sentence of the Law,
by the sentence of the Judge; and so made and declared to live juridically &amp;
in Law-sense; and to be as free of the curse and penalty of the Law, as if
they had never been guilty of the transgression thereof. And thus is it here
indeed; Such, as <hi>were dead in trespasses and sinnes, and in the uncircumcision of
the flesh, are quickened together with Christ, Ephes.</hi> 2: 1, 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2: 13. He,
who before had the wrath of God on him, and abiding on him, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
on the Son of God, hath everlasting life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: 36. And they,
who were in a manner condemned already, yet, by beleeving on Him,
are not condemned, yea have eternal life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: 15, 18.</p>
               <p>2. What a mysterie is this, That God, who is righteous and just, and
the righteous Judge of the World, and who hath declared, that he looketh
upon it, as an abomination for any man to justifie the wicked <hi>Prov.</hi> 17: 15.
And whose judgement is alwayes according to truth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2: 2. Should be
one that justifieth the Ungodly? And yet so is He said to be, and so is He
stiled, and so is He held forth, as the object of faith, <hi>Rom. 4. 5. But to
him that worketh not, but beleeveth on Him, that justifieth the Ungodly, his faith
is counted for righteousness, Papists</hi> &amp; others, who will not suffer their Reason
to follow Revelation, but will measure all the mysteries of the Gospel, by
the corrupt rule of Reason; and wiredraw <hi>those,</hi> according to the dictats of
<hi>this,</hi> pretend an Inconsistency here; and therefore will rather pervert the
whole nature of Gospel-justification, than yeeld to the Spirits Revelation of
the matter. Hence it is, that they say, a person cannot be justified by God,
untill he be a Godly man, and have a Righteousness within him, upon the
account of which he must be justified; little adverting, That by their own
principles it would follow, that no man should ever be justified: for, seing
God is a God of righteousness, and it is a sure and certaine thing, that His
judgment is alwayes according to truth, He could not absolve a Person as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
that were not perfectly righteous, and void of all sin; &amp; where is
the man, (not out of his wits) that dar say this, remembering what <hi>David</hi>
said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 3. &amp; 143. 2. But here lyeth the truth &amp; the mystery. Such
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104357:25"/>
as are really and truely Ungodly in themselves, and have nothing of their
own, but unrighteousness within them, and whose righteousnesses are but
as filthy rags, <hi>Esai.</hi> 64: 6. are yet justified by God upon the account of a
perfect righteousness, imputed to them, &amp; received by faith. In the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, such, as in themselves are Ungodly, are considered as clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with the perfect righteousness of the Mediator, Christ, that Head &amp;
publik person, which free grace putteth on them, &amp; they receive &amp; stand
under by faith; and so are justified &amp; declared to be righteous by God,
whose judgment herein and sentence is most righteous, &amp; most consonant to
truth: for he justifieth such, as are righteous, though not with their own
inherent righteousness, yet with the righteousness of their cautioner, now
made theirs.</p>
               <p>3. Here is another piece of this mystery, That Transgressours of the Law
shall be Absolved and Justified; &amp; yet the Law established, which threatneth
death to Transgressours, and promiseth life only to such, as observe it in
all points. Who can reconcile this seeming Contradiction, that is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quanted
with the glorious mystery of the Gospel? <hi>Paul,</hi> a man well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quanted
with this mystery, tels us expresly, that the Gospel-way of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which he preached, and fully cleared in his Epistles, derogateth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from the Law, but establisheth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 31. Where, after he had
cleared &amp; confirmed the Nature and Causes of Gospel-justification, &amp; had
said vers 30. that He <hi>was one God, who would justifie the circumcision</hi> (or Jewes)
<hi>by faith, and the uncircumcision</hi> (that is, the Gentiles) <hi>through faith;</hi> hy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ateth
this objection, that some might have proposed, &amp; said, What shall
then become of the Law? you make it void, by speaking of faith, &amp; ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
justification to it, as a mean, in opposition &amp; contradiction to works:
he answereth. <hi>Do we then make void the Law, through faith? That be far from us,
yea we establish the Law.</hi> So that there is nothing, in this Gospel justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that weakeneth, or maketh void the Law; but, on the contrary, it is
thereby more fully confirmed and established: for, <hi>what the Law could not
do, in that it was weak, through the flesh, God sending His own Son, in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of sinful flesh, &amp; for sin condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteouness of the
Law might be fulfilled in us, Rom.</hi> 8: 2, 3. Here is then the mysterie, Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours
of the Law are justified, upon the account of what their Mediator,
and Surety, their publik person &amp; Representer did &amp; suffered, for Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to Law, Justice &amp; the Law-giver; &amp; by what He did &amp; suffered, the
Law is more established, then it would have been by any thing that we did, or
could suffer; for He made Satisfaction to all its demands; there was perfect
obedience given thereunto, &amp; its commands answered, in all points, by
our Lord Jesus Christ, who knew no sin, nor was deceite found in His
mouth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 21. <hi>Esai.</hi> 53: 9. And because it was violated by sinners, &amp;
the Curse threatned was due, therefore, He did also satisfie that demand,
by dying the shameful death of the cross, &amp; undergoing the wrath &amp; curse,
due to us for sin; &amp; thereby making a more perfect Satisfaction unto the
Sanction and threatning part of the Law, than we could have done, by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in hell for ever more. And by faith, closeing with Christ, &amp; resting
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104357:25"/>
upon Him, as such a satisfying Cautioner &amp; Redeemer, the sinner acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
the Law, in all its force, confessing himself a Transhressour, and
obnoxious to the Curse; &amp; now presenting to the Law &amp; Law-giver the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
&amp; Satisfaction of Christ, whereby both its commands &amp; Sanction are
fully answered; &amp; resting thereupon, as the only ground of his Absolution
from the sentence of the Law for his guilt, and of his right to the Crown,
which he formerly had forfeited.</p>
               <p>4. Here is another mystery. That such, as are unrighteous, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
should be declared and pronunced Righteous. In justification, the
person is declared not guilty, of what was laid to his charge, in order to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, &amp; that juridically; and so he is declared free from the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the Accuser was seeking to have inflicted upon him; and so is
declared &amp; pronunced to be a righteous man, though not one, that hath not
sinneth, yet now one, that is juridically righteous, But how can this be,
seing every man and woman is guilty before God, and is come short of the
glory of God? The mystery lyeth here (as was said) The righteousness of
their Cautioner, Christ, is reckoned upon their score, and is imputed to
them, &amp; they receive it by faith, and so it becometh theirs; for now by
faith they are united unto Christ, &amp; become members of His mystical body,
He being the Head and true Representative; &amp; thereby He and they are one
Person in Law, (being one Spirit) as the Husband and the Wife are one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in Law (being one flesh) and as the Representer and Represented, the
Cautioner &amp; principal debtor: and thus they have a true Interest in His
Righteousness &amp; obedience to the Law, which He yeelded, not upon His
own account, being not obliged thereunto, antecedently to His own volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
condescension for us; for as to His person, He was God, and so not
obnoxious to any such Law, imposed upon man, who is in the way to the
obtaining of a Crown, as the end of his race: yea nor was this requisite, as
to His humane Nature, which, by vertue of the personal union with the
God-head was, as to it self, either <hi>in Patria,</hi> and in possession of the State
of blessedness; or in a capacity thereto, without working therefore: And
it is certaine, that therefore His being made under the Law, was for His
owne people, that, in their room, He might, in the Nature of Man, give
perfect obedience to the Law; and so make up a righteousness, with which
they might all become clothed, by Imputation on Gods part, &amp; by faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it, on their part; and so be justified. Hence-saith the Apostle, <hi>by
the obedience of one shall many be made righteous, Rom.</hi> 5: 19. And thus are
they, who are unrighteous in themselves, being Transgressours of the
Law, constituted righteous as to the Commands of the Law by the
righteousness of their Cautioner. As also they are, though guilty in
themselves &amp; obnoxious to wrath, yet pronunced free, and absolved from
that charge, by the Imputation of the Satisfaction of Christ, made in His
sufferings, &amp; death, <hi>who did bear our griefs, and carry our sorrowes, and was
wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement
of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed, Esai.</hi> 53:
4, 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 24. <hi>And his own self bear our sins, in His own body on the tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:104357:26"/>
3. There is likewise a mystery here, That the Imputation of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Righteousness of Christ doth not take away the Imputation of
His Satisfaction, nor make His Satisfaction useless &amp; of no Importance, or
necessity, as <hi>Socinians</hi> imagine, who cast the whole Gospel in the mould of
their own corrupt Reason and understanding: For they think, if Christs
Righteousness be imputed to us, we are perfectly righteous; and if we be
perfectly righteous, we have no sin; &amp; if we have no sin, there is no need
of Satisfaction for our sin. But they little consider, that we are both guilty
of the broken Law, and also nothwithstanding obliged to perfect obedience.
It is unreasonable to think, that <hi>Adam,</hi> by his breach of the Law, was
exeemed &amp; delivered from any obligation to obey the Law; sin doth not,
neither can, dissolve that obligation; otherwayes, the best way of being
freed from the Lawes of God, or Man, were to break them, &amp; cast them
at our heels. We then being transgressours, &amp; still under the obligation
of obedience to the whole Law, our Mediator and Cautioner must not only
obey the Law for us, to the end, we may inherite the promised reward;
but must also make Satisfaction, for the Violation of the Law, to the end
we may escape Gods Curse &amp; wrath, threatned in the Law, and due to us
for the breach of the same. Had we perfectly kept the Law, we had then
had no need of any Satisfaction for our breach thereof: but being guilty of
sin, this Satisfaction and the Imputation thereof to us, is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.
And though we need not nicely here distinguish betwixt this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouness
&amp; Satisfaction, in reference to the different ends; and say, that
by His Righteousness imputed to us, we have right to the Crown, &amp; by His
Satisfaction, freedom from death, which was the penalty of the broken
Law: for God hath joined both together for both ends; &amp; what He hath
thus joined together, as we should not separat, so neither may we nicely
&amp; scrupulously distinguish; but adore the wonderful wisdom of God in
this contrivance, and observing our necessity of both, sweetly acquiesce in
and thankfully accept of both. But you will say, if we be perfectly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
by the Imputation of Christs righteousness, what need have we of any
more? are we not possessed of right to the reward, and being righteous, are
we not free of our sin? I <hi>answer.</hi> It is true indeed, if we said, that Christs
Righteousness, or compleet obedience, was first imputed to us; or if the
Scripture gave any ground to say so, there might be some coloure for this
Exception: but, as the Scripture giveth no such ground; so neither do we
assert it: Only we have need of both, &amp; both are graciously imputed,
and received by faith: yea, we being sinners, if we might speak of an order
here, Satisfaction must first be imputed, that thereby we may be freed from
the sentence of the Law, which most presseth a wakened, convinced sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
who is most anxious hereanent, crying out, How shall I escape the
wrath and curse of God? But, as the Lord hath graciously and wonderfully
knit the effects together, so is the Cause. Both Christs obedience and Sufferings
were so woven together, that they belonged both to, &amp; made up His
state of humiliation; &amp; by both imputed by God, and received by faith,
the beleever receiveth the whole Effect, that is, both Immunity from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104357:26"/>
&amp; a Right to the reward promised to obedience, or to the Crown.
As Christ, the Messias, <hi>made an end of sins, &amp; made reconciliation for iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
so He <hi>brought in an everlastingh righteousness, Dan.</hi> 9: 24. And beleevers
have the benefite of both; for as they receive the grace of God, &amp; the gift
by grace, &amp; aboundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness; so they
shall reigne in life; and grace through righteousness reigneth unto eternal
life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 15, 17, 21.</p>
               <p>5. Upon the other hand, this mystery is also observable. That Christs
Satisfaction taketh not away the necessity of the Imputation of Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
&amp; obedience; as some do say, who think, that because we have
full pardon of all sinnes, by vertue of the Satisfaction of Christ; therefore
we need no more; a person, who is pardoned, being therefore one, that is
not unrighteous; &amp; one that is not unrighteous, being righteous, for (say
they) there is no mids betwixt just, or righteous, and not unjust, or not
unrighteous; &amp; he, who is righteous, having done all his duty, &amp; so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a right to the promised reward of life. So that, upon this ground they
suppose, there is need of no more, in order to obtaining of life: &amp; beside,
say they, the Scripture saith, that the man is blessed, to whom the Lord
imputeth not sin; &amp; he, who is blessed upon this account, needeth no righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
to be added, to render him blessed, and to give a right unto glory.
But (1) we were (as was said) guilty of the breach of the Law, &amp; so, liable
to punishment, &amp; were also under obligation, to give perfect obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Law; Satisfaction therefore for our breach, &amp; our pardon upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
faith not, that we have not broken the Law; and if we have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Law, we cannot be said to have yeelded perfect obedience unto the
Law, when God pardoneth upon a Satisfaction made, He doth not judge,
or suppose, that the person pardoned hath perfectly kept the Law; for His
judgment is according to truth; and the very pardon supposeth a Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and a Transgression taketh away perfect obedience; as perfect obedience
destroyeth or rendereth useless all pardon. Wherefore neither before God,
nor man, can a person, meerly because of Pardon, be said, or be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to have all that was required. Upon Pardon, it is true, he is as
much exeemed from the obligation to punishment, as if he had kept the
whole Law; but yet, by that pardon, he is not made, nor accounted to be
one, who never broke the Law, &amp; there upon hath a right unto the reward
promised: As (supposing for illustrations sake) when a Prince maketh a Law,
&amp; commandeth such &amp; such persons to obey the same, under the paine of
death; &amp; with all promiseth to such, as observe the Law, and do what is
commanded, that they shall enjoy a rich reward, &amp; become heirs of a
great Kingdom; and the persons, after they have broken the Law and become
guilty of death, are pardoned, upon the Interposition of some great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
&amp; Satisfaction made by the same for the failure; they cannot, upon the
account of this Satisfaction, &amp; their pardon thereupon, be said to have done
what was commanded, nor to have right unto the reward, &amp; to the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
promised to such, as obeyed the Law. (2) Therefore, though a
person, that is pardoned, be one that is not unrighteous, that is, obnoxious
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104357:27"/>
to the penalty; yet he is not one that is righteous positively, or in reference
to the reward; but only one that is negatively righteous; that is, one that
though he hath no right to the reward, yet he is not liable to the punishment:
and therefore, though he be thus negatively not unrighteous, that is, one
that is freed from the punishment; yet he cannot be accounted one, that
hath done all that was commanded; &amp; so he cannot be accounted Righteous,
in reference to the reward. (3) So that there is a manifest mids betwixt
being righteous, that is, one having a right to the reward, and being not
unrighteous, that is, not obnoxious to the punishment, as is clear by the
Instance of <hi>Adam,</hi> before his fall; for during that time (how long, or how
short so ever it was) he could not be said to be untighteous, because he had
not yet sinned; nor could he be said to be righteous, in reference to the
reward, that was promised, on condition of perfect obedience to the end;
that is, such as had done all his duty: for if he had then done all his duty,
or all that was required, in order to the reward, he had then had a full and
compleat right to the reward of life promised, &amp; God would have given it
to him, according to the Covenant and Promise. But we know it was not
so; for he was to finish his course &amp; run his race to the end, before he could
have challenged a right to the promised inheritance; and this he did not. So
that before he fell by transgression, it might have been said of him, that he
was not unrighteous, that is, that he was one, that had not yet transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and deserved the punishment-threatned; but he could not be said to
have been fully &amp; positively righteous, that is one, that had done all his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and therefore had now a full &amp; compleat right unto the reward.
(4) It is true, the Scripture saith, that <hi>the man is blessed, to whom the Lord doth
not impute sin:</hi> but it doth not say, That he is blessed, to whom the Lord
only imputeth not sin, or to whom He giveth no more: nor doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
say, that this pardoning, or not imputing of sin, purely &amp; abstractive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considered, that is, considered alone without any more (as it must be
considered by such, as oppose us here) is that compleat blessedness, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Scripture speaketh. But the reason, why such are said to be blessed,
to whom the Lord doth not impute sin, is, because Imputation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is inseparebly annexed with non-imputation of sin: &amp; therefore in
that same place of Scripture; to wit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6. It is said, that <hi>David Psal.</hi>
32: 1, 2. <hi>describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
while he saith, <hi>blessed is the man, unto whom the Lord will not impute
sin, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby we see, that both these are so firmly connected by the
Lord, that the one cleareth and confirmeth the other; &amp; that who ever
hath the one, hath the other also; and upon that account are blessed, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
the whole Effect of the Imputation of Christs whole Surety-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:
and these two, <hi>to wit,</hi> pardon of sins, and the Right to the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
flowing from the Imputation of Christs Satisfaction, &amp; of His o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
though they are never separated, yet they are distinguished, &amp;
spoken of distinctly in Scripture. It is one thing to be delivered from under
the Law, &amp; another thing to receive the Adoption of Sones, and the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of <hi>Abraham, Gal.</hi> 3: 13, 14. &amp; 4: 4, 5. As it is one thing to finish the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104357:27"/>
Transgression, to make an end of sin, &amp; to make Reconciliation for iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
&amp; another thing to bring-in Everlasting Righteousness, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9: 24.
Yea, the redemption from the Law and from its curse is mentioned, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
the other; as the finishing of transgression is also mentioned before
the bringing-in of Righteousness, in the passages cited. And thus, as these
Effects are distinguished, though inseparable, so is the Cause. By the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Christs Satisfaction, we have pardon of sin, being redeemed
from the curse of the Law, by His being made a curse for us, &amp; by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of His Rigteousness, and obedience, we are looked upon as Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
&amp; so have a right to the promise and Inheritance: Though we need
not thus distinctly consider both, save only to demonstrat the necessity of the
Imputation of both: for Christ by His death did also purchase the Inheritance
for us; and by His obedience made Satisfaction for sin, it being a piece of
His Humiliation. So that both, in the deep wisdom of God, make up one
cause of that one Effect, which comprehendeth all Blessedness; that is,
both pardon of sinnes and Right to the Inheritance, &amp;c. By the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of both, or of this compleat Surety-righteousness of Christ including
both, beleevers are pardoned and adjudged unto life. Hence our pardon
and justification are often ascribed unto Christs death, not as distinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
or as excluding His Righteousness &amp; obedience; but, among other
reasons, because that was the compleating Act of His obedience; and to
which all the rest preceeding had a respect, as to that, which should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
the whole Meritorious part of His Mediation. And hereby His obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
can no more be excluded, than His foregoing soul-sufferings. Nay
His death did presuppose and include His obedience; for it was the death
of one, who had perfectly obeyed the Law; which death &amp; obedience,
being His Mediatory work in the state of His Humiliation, was a compleat
Righteousness, for the blessedness &amp; advantage of all those, for whom He
appeared, &amp; whose debt He undertook to pay. (5.) That the obedience of
Christ must also be imputed to sinners, is manifest from this, That other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they should have no Righteousness at all imputed to them, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
can be called a Righteousness: for if nothing but that, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called Christs passive obedience, or His Sufferings, be imputed,
there can no Righteousness be said to be imputed; for dying and suffering
the penalty, as such, are no righteousness; being no obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Law, in conformity to which consisteth proper Righteousness:
as when one dieth for his crime of Murther, he cannot be said to be thereby
a righteous man, or to have obeyed the Law, forbidding Murther, nor
can we be said properly to have obeyed the Law, when Christ in our room
did suffer the penalty of death, due to us for the breach of it. They who
are in hell, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire, cannot be said to be
obeying the Law. It is true, Christ in dying did obey a command, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
upon Him by the Father; but that was no command of the Moral
Law, prescribed unto man: &amp; thereafter in dying &amp; Suffering, He gave
no obedience to that Law, under the obligation to which we were stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
no more than He can be said to have Suffered the penalty, while He
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104357:28"/>
was obeying the Law; these two being so manifestly different. So that it is
clear, that if Christs obedience be not imputed to us, no proper Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is, or can be said to be imputed to us. Yea (6) If Christs obedience be
not imputed to us, that Law, which saith, <hi>do this and live,</hi> is not fulfilled;
but rather abrogated &amp; quite abolished: and it must be said, that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of that constitution of Gods, <hi>we live,</hi> though we neither <hi>do this;</hi>
nor is our Cautioners doing of it imputed to us. And so we have a right to
the Reward, &amp; get it at lenght, without the Righteousness required in order
thereunto. Let us therefore admire the harmonious perfection of this Effect,
&amp; Work of infinite wisdom. I know several things are objected against this
Truth, as there are many other grounds &amp; Reasons adduced for the same;
but these I shall speak to at more length afterward.</p>
               <p>7. This is also a mysterie here to be noticed, That a Righteousness, that
is not ours inherently, but Christs, should be made ours, made over to us,
&amp; reckoned upon our score, or we become clothed therewith, &amp; there
upon justified as Righteous, as really &amp; effectually, as if we had wrought it
our selves, and it had been properly inherent in us. <hi>Socinians, Papists, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi>
&amp; others, who will not subject their reason unto this mystery, and
give credite to Revelation, will acknowledge no such imputation of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:
but at most do grant but an improper imputation; that is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
as to Effects: so that with them, Christ neither Suffered, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
in our stead &amp; room; but only for our good &amp; advantage; &amp; that
too conditionally only, in case, we beleeve and performe the Gospel-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But this imputation as to Effects only, is no imputation at all, there
being no thing thereby Imputed; not the Righteousness of Christ it self; for
this they expresly deny; nor yet the Effects themselves, for we no where
read of Imputed Justification, Adoption, Pardon &amp;c. which are the Effects.
Yea, it is not enough to them to deny this Imputed Righteousness; but
in contempt &amp; scorne, they call that, which we name an <hi>Imputed Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
a putative Righteousness,</hi> as if it were a meer imaginary thing. But
whatever such in decision think or say, the Gospel holdeth forth to us a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
imputed, or the Righteousness of Christ, graciously bestowed u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
&amp; made over to belevers, or freely given unto them, so that they are
dealt with by God, as Righteous Juridically &amp; legally, or as possessours
of such a compleat &amp; perfect Righteousness, &amp; that as really, &amp; to all
Effects, as if it had been their own inherently, &amp; performed by them, &amp;
so had been theirs without any such Imputation. And because this, as
the cause, is imputed to them &amp; made theirs; therefore all the Effects
thereof shall really &amp; certainely be bestowed upon them, in God's appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
time &amp; methode. This is the Truth, which the Gospel holdeth forth, to
the solide peace, joy &amp; comfort of Beleevers; the full clearing &amp; vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
of which would require a just Treatise. I shall therefore here propose
but a few clear &amp; manifest Grounds of this refreshful &amp; comfortable truth,
leaving the further prosecution &amp; vindication of them, &amp; of other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that are used in this matter, with the examination of what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
on the contrary, till afterward. <hi>First</hi> therefore, we say, as Christ,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104357:28"/>
who knew no sin, was made sin; that is; had the sinnes of His people laid
upon Him, &amp; imputed to Him; so that they were all caused to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on Him <hi>Esai.</hi> 53: 6. &amp; He therefore was made a Sacrifice for sin, or
dealt with &amp; punished, as a sinner, though no sinner inherently, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Imputation, for <hi>He did bear our griefs, &amp; carried our sorrowes, &amp; was
wounded for our transgressions, &amp; bruised for our iniquities, Esai.</hi> 53: 4, 5. to
wit, now imputed to Him by God, &amp; reckoned upon His account, who
knew no sin in Himself inherently: So are we made the Righteousness of
God in Him 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 21. that is, have His Righteousness, who is God,
imputed to us, who were in our selves &amp; inherently sinners; &amp; being in
Him by faith are dealt with as Righteous. The manifest scope of the place,
&amp; the plaine Import of the word, must enforce this truth, on all, who
are not more than ordinarily blinded with prejudice. <hi>Secondly</hi> as <hi>Adam's</hi>
posterity, who were not existing, when he transgressed the Law of God,
but were only in his loines, &amp; federally comprehended with him, in that
covenant, by God's voluntary disignation &amp; appointment; &amp; so did not
actually, &amp; really eat that fruit, which <hi>Adam</hi> did eat; yet have that sin
&amp; guilt so imputed unto them, that it is really accounted theirs; &amp; not
meerly in its Effects, for its Effects are not truely Imputed, neither can be
saied to be so; for that natural contagion &amp; corruption of Nature, which
is truely propagated to the posterity, &amp; all actuall trangressions, the fruits
thereof, cannot be said to be imputed, because they are really theirs, &amp;
inherent in them. But that original sin, which is the guilt of <hi>Adam's</hi> first sin,
is only it, which can be imputed (unless we mean such an Imputation,
whereby our actual sinnes, which we commit, are said to be imputed to
us, when they are laid to our charge, &amp; we actually punished therefore)
to them, who did not actually commit it, in their own person; &amp; by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of this Imputation, they are accounted guilty of that self same sin; &amp;
therefore are dealt with &amp; punished, upon the account thereof, no less than
if they had actually committed it themselves, in their own persons; &amp; no
less than <hi>Adam</hi> himselfs was punished therefore. So are Beleevers, being
by faith united unto Christ, &amp; made real members of His mystical body,
&amp; now interessed in Him, as His Children &amp; Brethren, made partakers of
His Righteousness, &amp; have it imputed unto them, for all ends &amp; uses, as
if it had been their own, without any Imputation. The reading of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
discourse <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. from <hi>vers</hi> 12. &amp; forward to the end, may satisfy any
as to this whole affaire, who will yeeld themselves captives unto Truth:
for upon this doth the Apostle found His whole discourse &amp; explication of
the rich advantages, had by Christ &amp; His Righteousness, clearing, &amp; il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrating
the same by that similitude of <hi>Adam,</hi> whom He expresly calleth
the <hi>figure of Him, that was to come vers</hi> 14. &amp; so asserteth, that <hi>as by one
man sin entered into the world, &amp; death by sin, &amp; so death passed upon all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ause
all did sinne; so by one man,</hi> Jesus Christ, the second Adam, <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
ontered into the world, &amp; life by it, &amp; so life passed upon all, that were in
Him,</hi> because they are righteous in Him, or have His righteousness impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto them. Nay, in the following verses, the matter is cleared with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104357:29"/>
an advantage unto Beleevers in Christ. But (saith he <hi>vers</hi> 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.)
<hi>not as the offence, so also is the free gift; for if through the offence of one, many be
dead; much more the grace of God, &amp; the gift by grace, by one man Iesus Christ,
hath abounded unto many,</hi> &amp;c. And so he goeth on to shew what &amp; how
great things beleevers receive from Christ, with no less, Yea rather with
much more of a certainety, than the Posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> were interessed
in what he did: and therefore, as <hi>judgment was by one to condemnation;</hi> (saith
he) <hi>so the free gift is of many offences unto justification; &amp; if by one mans offence,
death reigned by one, much more they who</hi> beleeve or <hi>receive aboundance of grace,
&amp; of the gift of righteousness, shall reigne in life by one Iesus Christ.</hi> And as the
offence of one <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed unto all, &amp; thereby guilt &amp; judgment
came upon all, making them liable to condemnation: So by the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of one Jesus Christ, imputed to all, that receive this aboundance of
grace &amp; of the gift of righteouseess, the free gift of justification cometh
unto them, reconciling them to God, &amp; instating them for life. And the
ground &amp; reason of this is laid down <hi>vers 19. for as by one mans disobedience,
many were made sinners;</hi> &amp; so were guilty, &amp; made liable to judgment &amp;
condemnation; <hi>So by the obedience of one,</hi> that perfect obedience to the Law,
that Christ performed, opposite to <hi>Adam's</hi> transgression &amp; disobedience,
<hi>shall many be made righteous,</hi> that is, constituted righteous; &amp; therefore
dealt with as such, through this imputed righteousness; &amp; so justified &amp;
made heirs of life: for <hi>vers</hi> 21. he addeth <hi>as sin hath reigned unto death, even
so grace must reigne, through righteousness, unto eternal life, by Iesus Christ,
our Lord.</hi> They then, who will deny, or oppose themselves unto this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Christ's righteousness, must do manifest violence unto the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
discourse of the Apostle, in this place. <hi>Thirly.</hi> Hence another eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
ground of this imputation: for as what is done by a publick person,
representing others, whether upon one ground, &amp; after one manner, or
another, is accounted legally to be done by those, who are represented,
&amp; they are dealt with accordingly, as <hi>Adam</hi> was a publick person, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
all his posterity, that were to come of him by ordinary generation,
according to the ordination &amp; appointment of God: So Christ, of whom
<hi>Adam</hi> was a figure, was a publick person, representing all, whom the
Father had given to Him, &amp; for whom He had undertaken, &amp; for whose
sake He sanctified Himself <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17, 19. &amp; become their Brother taking
on their Nature. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2: 11, 14. &amp; becoming like them in all things, sin
only excepted <hi>Heb.</hi> 2: 17. comp: with <hi>Heb.</hi> 3: 15. <hi>Therefore He took not upon
Him the Nature of Angels, but the seed of Abraham Heb.</hi> 2: 16. &amp; He was
<hi>the Captaine of their Salvation, vers</hi> 10. He is also made &amp; called the <hi>Head
of the Church,</hi> which is, <hi>His body &amp; fulness Ephes</hi> 1: 22, 23. &amp; 5: 23. <hi>Col.</hi>
1: 18. and so He with His Church make up one mystical body, whereof
He is the Head, &amp; Beleevers are members; Thus there is a closs &amp; mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
union betwixt Christ &amp; Beleevers; beyond any union, that is in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whether it be that of Head &amp; members, of Root &amp; Branches, of
King &amp; Subjects, or of that betwixt Husband &amp; wife, for all these are
but dark resemblances of this Spiritual Union betwixt Christ &amp; Beleevers,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104357:29"/>
which is therefore compared unto these, &amp; in part explained thereby, for
our better understanding of the matter: but none of them, nor all of them
do fully unfold the mystery. And in it there is ground enough to suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
Christ to be a publick person &amp; a Representative; as also for asserting
of this Imputation; because Beleevers being thus united unto Christ, are
made partakers of His righteousness, &amp; of what He, as Head &amp; Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
did &amp; suffered, in their room &amp; place; &amp; they thereupon are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with all the fruits &amp; effects thereof. <hi>Fourthly</hi> His being called a <hi>Surety
Heb.</hi> 7: 22. doth also give ground &amp; confirmation unto this Imputation:
for as He who becometh Surety for another, undertaketh to do or suffer,
what he, for whom he is Surety, was obliged to do, or suffer: As when
<hi>Paul</hi> became Surety for <hi>Onesimus;</hi> &amp; bound himself, as such, unto <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon,</hi>
he would have <hi>Philemon,</hi> requiring all, that <hi>Onesimus</hi> was due to
him, at his hand, &amp; reckoned upon his score; &amp; he undertook to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him for this debt, or for what he could crave of <hi>Onesimus;</hi> as we see
<hi>Philem. vers 18, 19. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that upon
mine account, I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it.</hi> So
what the cautioner doth, or suffereth, as such, or according to his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
is reckoned upon the score of the Principul debtor; as <hi>Paul's</hi> pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what <hi>Onesimus</hi> &amp; imputed to was endue te <hi>Philemon,</hi> was to be reckoned on the
score of <hi>Onesimus,</hi> him, that he thereby might be freed
from all pursuite of Law, or action against him, at the Instance of <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
Wherefore as Christ, becoming Surety for His Children, &amp; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Father, <hi>Lo, I come, in the volumne of they book it is written of me,
I delight to do thy will; ô God Psal.</hi> 40: 7, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7. did take upon Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the debt of sinners, &amp; engaged to pay all; that is, both to give per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Obedience to the Law, &amp; fulfill all Righteousness, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3: 15. as
also to pay the penalty, to make Satisfaction to Justice, by becoming a
Curse, &amp; suffering Griefs, Sorrowes, Bruisings, Mockings, &amp; the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
death of the Cross: for all this He did willingly &amp; cheerfully. <hi>I have</hi>
(said He) <hi>a baptisme to be baptized with,</hi> (meaning His death) &amp; <hi>how am
I straitened</hi> (or pained) <hi>untill it be accomplished</hi> Luk. 12: 50. He laid down
His life, that He might take it againe; &amp; no man took His life from Him,
against His will; but He laid it down of His own accord <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10: 17, 18.
And as Christ did really &amp; actually performe all, that He did undertake, so
that He said upon the Cross, <hi>it is finished:</hi> It must of necessity follow, that
all they, for whom He became Surety, &amp; undertook to do &amp; suffer what
was laid upon Him, must have that Imputed, &amp; made over unto them,
&amp; they must be clothed with that rob of Righteousness, which He did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
for them, &amp; must appear before the throne of justice clothed therewith.
<hi>Fiftly</hi> Christ's making proper &amp; full Satisfaction to the Father, in the
Name &amp; room of His people, saith also, That there is an Imputation of
Christ's Righteousness unto them, for whom He performed that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;
as His Satifaction must be for them. So that if Imputation be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
Satisfaction also must be denied. Hence the <hi>Socinians</hi> wickedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
both: &amp; indeed, who ever deny the one, must also deny the other,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104357:30"/>
or not speak consequentially; for when one laith down a satisfactory price
for another, it must be reckoned upon the score of &amp; imputed to that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
to the end, he may be dealt with, as if he had laid it down himself;
&amp; thereby be freed from what otherwayes he must have undergone: &amp; if
upon the account of that Satisfaction, he be not so freed, it cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Satisfaction for him. When Christ laith dwon his life for His sheep,
His sheep must not dye &amp; perish; for if they perish, He did not die for
them; &amp; if they perish not because of His dying for them, His death must
be imputed to them; &amp; upon the account of it they must be saved So that
Christ's dying for His own is dying in their Room, Person, place &amp; Stead,
as the particle <hi>for</hi> manifestly importeth 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18: 33. <hi>Gen.</hi> 44: 33. <hi>Numb.</hi> 3:
12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 6, 7. Hence His Ransome is expresly called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2: 6. Many moe arguments might be here adduced, for confirmation of
this Truth; but I shall satisfy my self at present, with these few &amp; plaine
ones; &amp; so proceed.</p>
               <p>8. This Mystery is also considerable here, That both the justice of God,
the Mercy &amp; free Grace of God, take place in this matter. <hi>Socinians</hi> cry up
the Mercy &amp; free Grace of God, in the matter if justification: but it is
to this end, that they may, with more desperat confidence, shut out the
Justice of God, so as it may have no place there: &amp; therefore they deny
all Satisfaction, Redemption &amp; Atonement &amp;c. (except what is meerly
metaphorical) because they cannot see, how justice &amp; mercy both can with
joint hands concurre to our justification. But the Apostle, better taught
than they, &amp; better acquainted with the mind of Christ, in this Mystery,
than they are, seeth no Inconsistency; But rather declareth the sweet &amp;
&amp; perfect harmony &amp; concurrence of these, in this mystery; telling us
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 24, 25, 26. That <hi>we are justified freely by His grace;</hi> &amp; yet addeth,
<hi>through the redemption, that is in Iesus Christ, whom God hath set forth to be a
propitiation, through faith in His bloud, to declare His righteonsness,</hi> &amp;c. And
againe, <hi>to declare His righteousness, that He might be just, &amp; the justifier,
of him, which beleeveth in Iesus.</hi> Here is a free grace triumphing; &amp; yet
Justifice declared and manifested; God declared to be just, and His righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
manifested; &amp; yet sinners and beleevers justified freely by grace.
So <hi>Eph.</hi> 1: 7, 8. There is a <hi>Redemption</hi> through the price of <hi>bloud;</hi> &amp; yet a
<hi>free pardon of sinnes, according to the riches of Gods grace, wherein He hath aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
towards us, in all wisdome &amp; prudence.</hi> But if it be enquired, wherein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to this mercy and freedom of grace, in our justification, seing there
was a Satisfaction made to justice, for all the sinnes of His peaple? I <hi>answer,</hi>
(1) was it not an Act of wonderful free grace &amp; mercy, that, when the
Lord might have executed the sentence of the Law upon us, according to
that threatning, <hi>that day thou eats, thou shalt die;</hi> and so have made us, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who transgressed the Law, to die and suffer; yet He would accept of
a Satisfaction, at the hands of a Surety &amp; Cautioner? (2) Was it not Act
of grace &amp; mercy to us, that He himself would provide a Surety and put
His name in our obligation; &amp; so make Him sin for us, who know no sin,
&amp; lay all our iniquities upon Him, that He might bear the punishment, due to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104357:30"/>
us for the same? See <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: 16. (3) Was it no Act of Soveraigne grace &amp;
mercy, that God should both provide a Mediator &amp; Surety for us, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of His Mediation and Satisfaction, most freely, out of free Grace and
Love, when we neither had done, nor could do any thing to move Him
hereunto, or to procure this at His hands; yea, when all our carriage, &amp;
all that He could see in us, did rather cry aloud for the contrary dealing?
(4) Was it no Act of Soveraigne Grace, that God should provide all this
remedie for a few, whom He did choose for Him self out of free Grace and
Love, and gave away to Christ, to bee redeemed by Him, leaving the rest,
&amp; passing them by, though no more unworthy, than such, as were chosen?
(5) Is it no Act of grace &amp; mercy, that in order to this great favour of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
no more should be required on our part, than faith in Jesus
Christ; seing this very faith, including an Union with and a marriag-consent
unto Christ, is, in it self, a favour nothing, in a manner, inferiour to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of all our sinnes, &amp; to the accepting of us as Righteous, in His sight?
(6) Is justification no Act of grace and mercy, though it be upon the account
of the obedience and Satisfaction of Christ; when that very faith, which is
only required of us, in order to our full interest in Christ &amp; His merites, is
also the free gift of God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 8? If these particulars will not aboundantly
say that we are saved in justification by grace, &amp; by the exceeding riches of
Gods grace &amp; kindness towards us, through Christ Jesus, according to
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 7. what will!</p>
               <p>9. Here is a great and wonderful mystery, in this matter, That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
should suffer, and the guilty escape &amp; go free. The <hi>Socinians,</hi> that
they may strengthen them selves in their mischievous prejudices against the
Satisfaction of Christ, imagine an Impossibility here, &amp; an Inconsistency with
Justice, that an Innocent person should be put to suffer. But what ever they
dream, who will walk in these mysterious matters by no other guide, than
the dim light of corrupt nature, it comporteth aboundantly with Justice, that
the Surety be put to pay what he hath undertaken to pay, for the principal
debtor.
And here was no wrong done to our Surety, Jesus Christ, who
willingly undertook this debt, and was lord of His own life, having abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
power to lay it down, and power to take it up againe, and to raise him
self from the dead; &amp; knowing withall, how richly to compensate &amp; make
up that loss another way, so as He should be no loser, when He should see
His Seed, and receive the rich reward of His laboures from the Father,
whose Servant He was, in this affaire. Here is then a mystery of wisdom,
Grace and Love, that the Innocent Lamb of God, who <hi>knew no sin,</hi> who
did <hi>no violence, nor was guile found in his mouth, 2 Cor.</hi>

               <p>10. This is also a Part of this Mystery, That nothing should be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
&amp; yet all should be forgiven. Nothing was forgiven to our Surety,
He paid all that was required of Him; <hi>for the Lord laid on Him the iniquity of
us all.</hi>
He gave full obedience to the Law, in all its demandes, &amp; made
a perfect &amp; compleat Satisfaction for our Offences; so that the Father was
well pleased in Him; &amp; the same was at two several times declared, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
out of heaven; once at His Baptisme, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3: 17. &amp; againe at His
Transfiguration, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17: 5. The sword of Justice was awakened against
Him, though He was Gods fellow, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13: 7. And did abate Him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of what was due. The Lord Jesus <hi>gave him self for us, an offering and a
Sacrifie to God, for a sweet smelling savour, Ephes.</hi> 5: 2. He is a perfect High
Priest, continueing for ever, having an <hi>unchangable Priest-hood,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>is able to save them to the uttermost, that come unto God by Him; for He nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not daily as the High Priests under the Law to offer up Sacrifie first for His
own sinnes, &amp; then for the People; for this He did once, when He offered up Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
for the word of the Oath maketh Him a Priest, who is consecrated for ever more,
Heb.</hi> 7: 24, 25, 26, 27. And yet, though He had nothing forgiven or abated
to Him, while standing in our room, but paid all to the outmost farthing;
all notwithstanding is freely forgiven to us, and we have blessedness, by the
Lords <hi>forgiving our Iniquities, &amp; covering our sins, or not imputing them to us,
Psal.</hi> 32: 1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 7, 8. Our Redemption is forgiveness of sinnes <hi>Ephes.</hi>
1: 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 14. And all sinnes must be forgiven to us, or our Redemption
should not be perfect, nor we saved; for one sin would ruine us for ever;
because if the Lord should mark iniquity, &amp; enter in to judgment, no man
should stand, &amp; no flesh should be justified <hi>Psal.</hi> 130: 3. &amp; 143: 2.</p>
               <p>11. Here is another Mystery, considerable in our justification, That
though thereby we be declared &amp; pronounced righteous, &amp; so acquite &amp;
absolved from what was, or might be charged upon us; Yet we have need
of Pardor, &amp; must be freely pardoned. <hi>Socinians</hi> cannot or will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Conexion, that Infinite Wisdom hath made here; &amp; therefore make use
of forgiveness &amp; free pardon of sinnes, as an Argument, wherewith to
fight against true Gospel justification, or the justification of a sinner upon
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104357:31"/>
the account of the Imputed Righteousness of Christ; &amp; against the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Christ's Righteousness to this end, that the sinner may be absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
&amp; pronounced righteous, &amp; accepted as such. But the Scripture seeth
no Inconsistenry or Repugnancy here, but an harmonious &amp; sweet accord
betwixt the Lord's causing people their iniquities passe from them, &amp; His
clothing them with change of raiment <hi>Zach.</hi> 3: 4. And the Apostle joineth
both, as inseparable; yea he declareth the necessity of both, saying <hi>Rom.</hi>
3: 21, 22. That now <hi>the righteousness of God without the Law is manifested—
even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Iesus Christ, unto all, &amp; upon
all them that beleeve.</hi> where upon it followeth, <hi>vers</hi> 24. that they <hi>are freely
justified by His grace.</hi> But then, what need is there of Remission? might
one say: doth not this quite take away all Remission? No; for he addeth
<hi>vers 24, 25. through the redemption, that is in Iesus Christ, whom God hath set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
to be a propitiation, through faith in His bloud, to declare His righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for the remission of sinnes, that are past.</hi> Yea, the forgiveness of sinnes esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth
&amp; confirmeth the Imputation of righteousness, where by we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified;
for thus speaketh the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7, 8. <hi>Even as David also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without
works, saying, blessed are they, whose iniquities are forgiven, &amp; whose sinnes are
covered; blessed is the man, unto whom the Lord will not impute sin.</hi> Where we
see, that non-imputation of sins is so far from shutting out Imputation of
Righteousness, that it confirmeth it, &amp; proveth it, &amp; is in separable from
it, &amp; must necessarily presuppose it: for we, being sinners, can have no
Absolution, untill the Satisfaction of Christ be applied to us, &amp; made ours
by Imputation: &amp; where this is imputed by God, the soul must be absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from all that can be laid to its charge. Therefore in justification, as we
are declared righteous, by reason of the Righteousness of Christ imputed
to us &amp; received by faith; so have we thereby a full remission of all our
sinnes. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 19. That <hi>God was in Christ, reconciling the world
unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.</hi> And what giveth he for
the ground of this? See <hi>vers</hi> 21. for) saith he) <hi>He hath made Him to be sin for
us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. It is also observable in this mysterious business, That though our je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
be an act of God's free grace, wherein, only upon the account
of the Righteousness of Christ Imputed to us by God; &amp; not upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of any thing in us, or done by us, He pardoneth our sins &amp; accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
our persons as righteous: Yet this is not with an exclusion, bur ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with an Inclusion of faith, which is a Receiving, a laying hold upon,
&amp; a Leaning unto the righteousness of Christ, imputed to us, <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inians</hi>
&amp; others are utter strangers unto this mystery; &amp; make use of their wit
here, to plead against the imputation of Christ's Righteousness, the onely
ground of our justification; because faith is required of us, in order to our
justification, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as they say) it self <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to us as our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousneis;
upon the account of which we are justified. They suppose, that if
Christ's Righteousness be imputed to a person, &amp; he thereupon acquite &amp;
pardoned of all his sinnes, that person must be righteous, pardoned &amp; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104357:32"/>
whether he beleeve, or not; &amp; the Righteousness of Christ must
be his, before he beleeve, But, leaving the debating of that Question,
<hi>whether faith properly taken, that is, as our act, done in obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, be Imputed to us, as our righteousness?</hi> untill we come to the
next part of the words. I shall only now say, as to the other thing here
alleiged, That they, as ignorant of the Gospel, feigne an opposition in
things, among which the Gospel pointeth forth to us a perpetual &amp; har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
agreement; &amp; upon the other hand, they will patch up a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
&amp; agreement betwixt those things, which the Gospel setteth at
perfect Opposition &amp; variance: for <hi>Paul,</hi> better acquainted with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
&amp; with the nature of Gospel-justification, than they, tels us, yea
he proveth it by many Arguments, <hi>That by the deeds of the Law, there shall no
flesh be-justified;</hi> &amp; consequently, not by faith, as one deed or work of
the Law. And he maketh mention of the <hi>righteousness of God without the Law;</hi>
&amp; saith, that that <hi>righteousness of God is imputed to &amp; upon all them, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi>
And notwithstanding of this; he tels us, that this Righteousness is
<hi>by faith of Iesus Christ, &amp; imputed to all that beleeve,</hi> exclusive of others
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 20, 21, 22. And againe he tels us, that as we are <hi>justified freely by
bis grace;</hi> yet it is <hi>through the Redemption, that is in Iesus Christ, whom God
hath set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in His bloud vers</hi> 24, 25. And
againe vers 26: as God is declared in this matter to be <hi>just;</hi> so is he <hi>the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifier
of him</hi> only, <hi>that beleeveth in Iesus.</hi> Moreover <hi>vers.</hi> 27. he mentioneth
the <hi>Law of faith,</hi> as opposite to the <hi>Law of works,</hi> in that it <hi>excludeth boasting;</hi>
&amp; concludeth againe <hi>vers</hi> 28. That <hi>a man is justified by faith, without the deeds
of the Law,</hi> and <hi>vers</hi> 30. that God <hi>justifieth by faith &amp; through faith.</hi> Yet we
never hear, that he faith, we are justified for faith or upon the account of
faith. <hi>Further,</hi> That faith is required, in order to justification, is clear from
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 31, 32. where it is said, that <hi>Israel which followed after the Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
hath not attained to the Law of righteousness, because they sought it not
by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law.</hi> This also is fully proved by the
same Apostle, in this Epistle to the <hi>Galatians, knowing</hi> (saithe he <hi>Chap.</hi>
2: 16.) <hi>that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of iesus
Christ; even we have beleeved in Iesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith
of Christ.</hi> And to pointe forth this Interest of faith; &amp; yet not as imputed
for our righteousness; when properly taken, the same Apostle <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9.
calleth that righteousness, which he opposeth unto his own righteousness,
which is of the Law, a <hi>righteousness, which is through the faith of Christ, &amp;
the righteousness which is of God by faith.</hi> By all which, &amp; many other passages
mentioning our justification by faith, which might be cited, we see that
the Lord hath so ordered the matter, that faith should have an Interest in
justification as an Instrumental cause, or some such thing (for to contend
about words, is not much to edification) as may fully denote &amp; pointe
forth the Emphasis of the Scripture expressions herein; such as are to be
found <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 22, 28, 30. &amp; in other places now cited; and that because
faith carrieth a poor convicted &amp; self-condemned sinner out of himself, to
seek a righteousness in Christ, in &amp; upon the acount of which, he may be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104357:32"/>
accepted of God &amp; justified: &amp; so bringeth him to close with Christ &amp;
to accept of His righteousness, &amp; put it on, that he may appear in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, &amp; so receive the Atonement &amp; abundance of grace and &amp; of the
gift of righteousness <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 11, 17. And albest it may satisfie us to know,
that so the Lord God hath ordained it, that the self-condemned sinner
should flee to the Righteousness of Christ, held forth in the Gospel, lay
hold on it, &amp; lean to it, thereby he may attaine Justification and Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
without enquireing after reasons of this Contrivance: Yet we may
clearly see the wisdom of God shining forth, in this appointed way of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:
for the sinner is hereby brought to swear (as it were) himself
bare, to renounce all in himself, to declare &amp; profess himself a plaine ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krupt;
and so to despare in himself; that the riches of the free grace of
God, &amp; everlasting love may shine forth in him, in a more divine lustre,
&amp; in a singular heavenly beauty: &amp; hereby all ground of pride, boasting,
or glorying in himself is taken away; &amp; the sinner is made to see &amp; to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
unto the glorious wisdom, that then appeareth in that contrivance,
&amp; to wonder; as also to see his everlasting obligation unto the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver,
&amp; to the Lord Ransomer. So is he made to see the perfect ground
of security &amp; saifty in this way, when he seeth, that, in order to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of the great blessings &amp; favoures, his soul longeth for, he must
first be united unto Jesus Christ himself, &amp; married unto Him, in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
marriage-Covenant, that shall never be dissolved. And he winneth
hereby to a sure ground of peace &amp; Tranquillity of soul, when he seeth, that
it is nothing in himself, that is taken, as Satisfaction to the Infinite justice
of God; but the Righteousness of Christ who is God &amp; Man in one person;
&amp; so a perfect &amp; Infinite Righteousness, able fully to repare the breach
made, &amp; to make Satisfaction for the wrong done to the Infinite God.
So that upon this ground, he may boast &amp; glory in the Lord alone, &amp; triumph
over all assaults &amp; Temptations of Satan. Hereby then as the Lord hath
consulted His own glory; for the sinner, fleing to the Righteousness of
Christ, as his only refuge, &amp; resting there, doth proclame God to be
Holy, Just, Righteous, Gracious &amp; only Wise; so he hath consulted the
saifty, Peac, joy, &amp; Confidence of His own. The consideration whereof
should make us comply sweetly with this noble contrivance; &amp; in stead of
disputing against it, or ourselves out of it, acquiesce with all our heart in
it, &amp; rest there.</p>
               <p>13. We may observe further another mystery, in this matter of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<hi>to wit.</hi> That the way of justification, through the Imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ, doth not take away the necessity &amp; Usefulness of the
Exercise of the Grace of Repentance. <hi>Socinians</hi> &amp; others, who follow their
footsteps, can observe no harmony here, &amp; cry-out against the Imputation
of Christ's Righteousness, because (as they suppose) it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the
Use and Necessity of Repentance, and enervateth all the commands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining
it. But (1) This mistake must certainly flow from a misconception
of the true Nature Use &amp; ends of Gospel-repentance, for they must of
necessity Suppose, that Gospel-Repentance is required for the same Ends
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104357:33"/>
&amp; Uses, for which the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness is required;
otherwise they could not think, that the asserting of the one should tend to
the justling out of the other. But whatever they imagine, we assert no
such thing; but affirme. That Christ hath purchased the whole of our
Remission: and Repentance, whatever <hi>Papists say,</hi> hath no interest herein;
nor hath it any merite with-it, whether <hi>ex condigno,</hi> or <hi>ex congruo,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Remission, &amp; the Favoure of God, or Reconciliation with Him;
but it is only required in its own place, to accompany faith, &amp; to follow
upon it, as a sutable &amp; profitable exercise for sinners, advanced to such
high favoures &amp; Privileges. And the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness,
can no more prejudge the exercise of this grace, than of any other Gospel-Grace,
or duty, such as Love, Fear, Hop, prayer, Patience &amp;c. but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
incite &amp; encourage to it (2.) what was formerly said of faith &amp; its
harmonious agreement with the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness,
will sufficiently also clear &amp; confirme this: for if the Adversaries speak of
legal Repentance, the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness will no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
take that away, than faith, for it preceedeth faith, whereby the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
laith hold on Christ. And if they speak of Gospel Repentance (which
is more to the purpose) they must know, that though in its Exercise (at
least in its remarkakle exercise) it doth follow faith, and in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is posteriour to it; Yet it is inseparably-connected therewith; so that
where faith is, there is &amp; must also be Repentance, at least, in its root &amp;
begun exercise: for a sinner cannot rightly accept of &amp; close with Christ,
as offered in the Gospel, for Gospel ends, &amp; in a Gospel manner, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the call of the Gospel, but withall he must have a sight &amp; sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of his sins, &amp; a hatred thereof, as also a purpose firme &amp; fixed, to
turn from them unto God, as also an Endeavour after new obedience.
Yea, we finde sometimes, Repentance pressed, as including faith in it;
as when pressed in order to pardon &amp; acceptance with God: Sometimes
againe it is mentioned together with faith, as being inseparable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.
(3.) As the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ, and the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of beleevers thereupon, doth not put them in such a case, as they
shall sinne no more afterward, so neither doth it take away the Usefulness
and necessity of renewed Acts of faith and Repentance; nor in the least wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the after exercise of these Graces, but rather doth excite thereunto,
each in their proper place, and to their proper ends, in order to actual par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
according to the Gospel Method, in which it is required, that justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
persons or Believers repent of their after sinnes, and by faith flee to
Christ for pardon, and as at the first, so afterward there can be no true
exercise of faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ, for pardon of after sinnes,
without a true exercise of Repentance towards God, these perpetually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
other: yet we must not think, that Repentance considered by
it self, and as distinct from faith, hath the same Interest in the Covenant,
for pardon, first or last, that faith hath: for neither doth it so act on Christ
and his Righteousness, in order to pardon, as faith doth; nor is it appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or called for, for that end: and when it is enjoined and mentioned,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104357:33"/>
in order to Remission, it is to be taken as distinct, far less as separated
from faith, but as including faith, being the necessary concomitant and
consequent thereof, as also the publick and sensible expression and evidence
of true and lively faith: for Repentance being towards God, &amp; a turning
to God, from whom Sin draweth the Soul away, must of necessity have
faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, accompanying it, and laying a ground
for it, seing there is no coming to the Father, but by the Son. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14: 6.
(4.) To say, that by Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, we should ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
no more need of Repentance, than Christ had, who was wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sin, is to imagine, that we dream of such an Imputation, as maketh
us to have been no Sinners, or under no guilt; and consequently to have
stood in need of no gracious Imputation. But we assert no such thing; for
we were Sinners, and so stood in need of a Righteousness to be imputed to
us, in order to our iustification. And he who graciously did provide this
Righteousness for us, might also, without the least derogation from the
freedom and glory of his Grace &amp; Favoure, as appointe the meanes, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
&amp; way, how he will have us made partakers of the benefites of this
Grace &amp; Imputed Righteousness first &amp; last; so also to prescribe what du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
He thought meet for such, as He had so visited with Grace &amp;
Mercy.</p>
               <p>14. Another part of this Mystery lyeth in this, That justification through
the Imputed Righteousness of Christ, taketh not away the rich &amp; honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
privilege of Adoption. Such, as are Adversaries unto this Imputation
of Christ's Righteousness, alleige that there is no consistency here; becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
say they, if Christ's Righteousness or Obedience should be imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, that so we may have a Right and Title to life, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Covenant, <hi>do this and live,</hi> Adoption, by which this Title and
Right is conveyed, according to the Scriptures, is rendered Useless. But
not to mentione the great difference, that is betwixt the Life and Privileges
of Life, a Right whereunto is solemnly had in Adoption; and the Life,
that was promised in the old Covenant, by these words, <hi>do this and Live.</hi>
They consider not, that the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness doth no
more destroy or take away Adoption, than it doth destroy, or take away
pardon; and that it is so far, from rendering either Useless, that it establisheth
both, &amp; is the ground and firme <hi>Basis</hi> of both: for as without the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Christ's Righteousness and Satisfaction, there can be no ground
for pardon; so without the Imputation of his Righteousness and obedience
there is no ground for Adoption. As justification is a solemne and formal
stating of a person in Favour &amp; reconciliation with God, and in pardon of
Sinnes; so Adoption is a Solemne and formal stating of a person in a Right
to glory and to all the Privileges of Son-ship here &amp; hereafter. Now net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these are rendered Useless, through the Doctrine of Imputation;
but both are the more cleared, confirmed and secured thereby. The Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Righteousness is not formally pardon it self, nor is it formally a
Right to glory; but the necessary ground of both. Christ's Righteousness is
Imputed, that we may be justified, and that we may be Adopted; that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104357:34"/>
is, solemnely and formally placed in a state of pardon &amp; Reconciliation, &amp;
into a state of Right &amp; Interest in the Privilege of Son-ship. As the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of the cautioners payment, in judgment, is not formally the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the debtor, but the ground of a formal sentence of absolution; so
the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness and Satisfaction, is not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
sentence of Absolution &amp; pardon, but the ground thereof: And as the
paying of the price condescended on for Land or houses, is not a formal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feofing,
or a formal and legal conveyance of Right &amp; Title, by Charter
and Seasing, but the ground thereof; So the Imputation of Christ's merites
and obedience is not the formal &amp; legal Conveyance of Right to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of glory, and glorious Privileges of Son-ship; but is the ground
thereof, upon which necessarily followeth adoption, which is, as it were,
the Beleevers Infeosment and Seasing, whereby Right is formally &amp; legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
conveyed unto him, to all these Privileges.</p>
               <p>15. This is also a mystery in this matter, that such as are adversaries to
the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, cannot understand, <hi>to wit,</hi> That
Beleevers should be accounted Righteous, &amp; there upon justified, through
the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ; and yet the Lord should see
sin in them. They say, if beleevers be righteous with the righteousness
of Christ, God can no more see sin in them, than in Christ. But they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
not betwixt the being of sin, and obnoxiousness to punishment,
which is separable from the being of sin, otherwise there could be no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
In such, as are coered with the Righteousness of Christ, imputed
by God, and received by faith, God seeth sin in its being, for He pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, and pardon doth not make sin to have been no sin; nor say, that the
man hath not sinned; for then pardon should be no pardon, seing all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
supposeth sin: but he seeth not sin so, as to punish and condemne for it:
for in respect of this <hi>Reatus,</hi> guilt and obligation to punishment, sin is
taken away, forgotten, cast behind God's back, &amp; in to the depths of the
sea &amp;c. As the Scripture expresseth this matter. The judge seeth not the
debtor guilty &amp; obnoxious to the sentence, when the payment made by the
cautioner is instructed in open court: yet He cannot but see, that he hath
contracted debt, and was thereupon obnoxious to the sentence. Neither do
our Adversaries here consider, that by this way of argueing, they destroy
all pardon; for when a man is pardoned, he is no more obnoxious to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
and God cannot see sin in him, in order to condemnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is pardoned; &amp; thereby that obligation to condemnation is taken
away: And so, if they mean this only, by God's not seeing of sin, when
they deny this, they must deny Remission, nor yet do we say, that the
Imputation of Christ's Righteousness taketh away the being of all after sins,
and maketh them no sins; but only that it ensureth their pardon. Nor do
we argue the not being of after sinnes, or God's not seeing of them, from
this Imputation, but only the Non imputation of them unto condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for we know, that sin, in its being, is killed and mortified another
way <hi>viz</hi> by the work of Sanctification.</p>
               <p>16. To the same end, we may consider. That though by the way of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104357:34"/>
through the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, and faith
laying hold on the same, the Law is not made void, but established; as
the Apostle saith <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 31. and the righteousness of the Law is in some
sense fulfilled in us, being fulfilled in our Nature, by Christ, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
and Surety <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 4. yet we are not justified by the Law, but by
the Gospel; not by the Covenant of works, but by the Covenant of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
The Adversaries to Imputation alleige, that we, by asserting the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
do establish justification by the works of the Law, because the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Christ was obedience to the Law, and so legal Righteousness;
and if that be imputed to us, so as we are accounted to have done what he
did, we must be justified by Law-righteousness, &amp; consequently by the
Law; which is contrary to the Scriptures. But in answere to this I say
(1.) They advert not, that some of themselves do expresly call Christ's
Righteousness, our legal, or prolegal righteousness; &amp; therefore it must
be a righteousness answering the Law, &amp; also made ours. (2.) Nor do
they observe, that justification by the Law, or by the works of the Law,
which the Scriptures speak so much against, is not to be understood in
their sense; the obvious, plaine and only meaning thereof being this,
that no man can be justified by his own personal obedience to the Law,
for by the Law, the doers only of the Law are justified <hi>Rom.</hi> 2: 13. The
plaine tenor of the Law is Set down: <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 5. Where <hi>Moses</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
as describing the Righteousness of the Law to be this, <hi>that the
man, who doth those things, shall live by them. Levis.</hi> 18: 5. When therefore the Law saith, that the man, that doth these things, shall live by
them, &amp; not, the man that either doth those himself, or getteth a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
to do them for him, shall be justified; it is manifest, that we are
not justified by the Law, seing we do not these things ourselves, in our
oun persons; but by the Gospel, which only provideth this Surety, &amp;
proposeth justification through His Righteousness imputed &amp; received by
faith. Thus we see. That justification through the Imputation of Christ's
Righteousness, doth quite annull &amp; destroy our Justification by the Law:
all Imputation being inconsistent with Law-justification, &amp; repugnant the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reunto,
because it is of grace; &amp; what is of Grace, neither is, not can
be of works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 6. (3.) We assert not Imputation in this sense, <hi>to
wit:</hi> That we are accounted &amp; reputed to have done what Christ did; for
that cannot be, God cannot judge amisse; but He should judge amisse, if
He should judge, that we did what Christ did. Our meaning is this, that
the Beleever, being now united unto Christ, hath an Interest in Christ's
Righteousness &amp; upon the account thereof, now reckoned upon his Score
by Imputation, he is freed from all that the Law could charge upon him,
and that as fully, to all ends, as if he had performed that Righteousness
himself.</p>
               <p>17. It is likewise here considerable, That we are justified upon the account
of the Righteousness of Christ imputed; and yet this Righteousness of
Christ is the proper meritorious cause of our justification, &amp; of all that
followeth there upon. Some, who oppose this Imputation, imagine an
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104357:35"/>
opposition here: But mistakingly they think, that the Righteousness of
Christ must be made the meritorious cause of it self, or of that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
which is imputed; whileas we only say, That Christ's Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
is the meritorious cause of our justification, Adoption &amp;c. and
that it is also imputed to us, for this end, that we may be thereby formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
righteous, juridically &amp; in Law sense; and so justified. &amp;c. And who
seeth not, that it must be so, seing we can be justified by no Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which is not a proper meritorious cause of our justification: &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
that we cannot be justified by any other Righteousness than the
Righteousness of Christ; &amp; so not by our own Gospel-righteousness, nor
by faith, as suchs a Righteousness; for that cannot be a meritorious cause of
our justification.</p>
               <p>18. This is also a considerable part of this mystery, which carnal eyes
cannot see, and which men, carried away with prejudice at the pure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Grace of God, in the Gospel, cannot sweetly comply with;
<hi>to wit.</hi> That our justification is Solely upon the account of the Imputed
Righteousness of Christ, and not upon the account, or because of any thing
wrought in us, or done by us: &amp; yet our obligation to holiness &amp; confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the Law of God, in all points, is not hereby in the least weakened.
<hi>Paul's</hi> frequent preoccupying of this Objection, in his Epistles, may
let us see, how ready carnal hearts are to abuse the doctrine of the Grace
of God, revealed in the Gospel, to carnal liberty; and what a propensity
there is in us, to look for justification upon the account of our works only;
so that if we hear of any thing, to put us of this apprehension, we presently
are ready to conclude, that all study of and endeavour after holiness, is
wholly useless &amp; unnecessary: and that we need not wonder much at <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
&amp; others, who do thus reasone against the Imputation of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ. But <hi>Paul</hi> doth cleare to us a sweet consistency betwixt
free justification upon the account of Christ's Righteousness imputed, and
the serious study of holiness. He saw no Inconsistency betwixt the study
of obedience to the Law, in all points, and the expectation of justification
by faith in Christ alone, whatever men, who would seem sharp-sighted,
&amp; zealous for the study of holiness, do suppose they cannot but see. And
albeit men in those dayes were ready enough to except against free justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
through the Imputed Righteousness of Christ; and to pretend, that
the asserting thereof did take away all study of holiness: yet (&amp; this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
remarkable) the Apostle, to remove that objection, never giveth the
least hint of the necessity of our works of obedience, in order to our justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
And though He doth frequently press to holiness; yet he never
maketh use of any argument thereunto, which might so much as insinuat,
that we were justified by works, in one measure, or other. Nay, we will
finde, that He draweth arguments, pressing unto holiness, from the very
nature of their Gospel-justification, &amp; of their State by vertue thereof.
And experience proveth, this day: that the most effectual <hi>Medium</hi> to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
is taken from free justification, through faith in Christ alone; and
that the holiness and obedience of such, as practise the orthodox doctrine,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104357:35"/>
concerning justification, hath another heavenly lustre (as it floweth from
another fountaine, &amp; standeth upon another ground) and looketh more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
true holiness, &amp; universal sincere obedience, than what is to be seen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
such, as lay most weight upon their own duties, whether we speak
of <hi>Papists, Socinians, Arminians,</hi> or of others. And whatever inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency
men may imagine to be betwixt free justification, through the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Righteousness of Christ, and the Universal, Sincere, &amp; Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
study of holiness, yet the Gospel knoweth no such thing; but presseth
holiness, though not for this end, that we may thereby be put into a state
of justification, or might sweat &amp; foile, run &amp; work for the prize, as the
hire &amp; wayes of our work; yet upon more Spiritual &amp; Gospel like grounds;
and by Arguments more sutable to the state of the justified, who only are
in case to performe acts of obedience, and duties of holiness, acceptably
unto God; Such as the Image of God proposed for our Imitation; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
obligation of His Law; the Relation they stand into; the holy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of God; the engagments they stand under, the Spiritual help
&amp; furniture, which is at hand, the Nature of holiness it self; the genius
&amp; kindly inclination of the new Nature, whereof they are partakers; and
the many advantages thereof here and hereafter, too many, here to
be mentioned. Let any consider the Arguments, used to this purpose by

Yea, if they leane unto faith it self, which is called for only to interesse

man abased, they deceive themselves; &amp; not only disappoint themselves
of what they are expecting, but even destroy the very Nature &amp; Ends of
true Gospel-justifying faith: for its native &amp; proper work is, to carry the
man out of him self wholly unto Christ, for Righteousness, Life &amp; Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for faith is the Mans looking to Christ, as the stung Israelite in the
wilderness did look unto the brazen serpent <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: 14, 15. and saying, as
it is <hi>Esai.</hi> 45: 24. <hi>In the Lord have I righteousness:</hi> and it is the beleevers

<hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 12, and receiving of the Atonement in Him, &amp; through Him.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 11. and of aboundance of grace &amp; of the gift of Righteousness. <hi>Rom.</hi>
5: 17. Therefore it is called a <hi>beleeving on His name. Ioh. 1: 12. &amp; on Him,
whom the Father hath sent &amp;c. Ioh. 6: 29 &amp; 7: 35. &amp; 17: 20. Act. 16: 31. &amp;</hi>
19: 25. And because faith laid hold on this Righteousness of Christ; the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
is this Righteousness called the <hi>Righteousness of faith Rom.</hi> 4: 11. &amp;
the <hi>righteousness, which is of faith Rom.</hi> 9: 30. &amp; that, <hi>which is through the

this be the native work of justifying faith (as we shall more fully cleare after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward)
to receive Christ, and His Righteousness; &amp; consequently to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Man out of himself, that he may finde &amp; partake of that al sufficient
Righteousness of Christ, to the end he may with confidence stand before
God, and expect pardon and Acceptance; It cannot be said without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the &amp; Native work of justifying faith, that faith is that Gospel-Righteousness, unto which they may leane, &amp; upon the account of which they
may expect justification. Faith, in this matter, is as the eye of the Soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, that,
seeth not it self, but looketh out to another. Beside, this would overturne
the whole Nature of the Covenant of Grace, and is irreconcilable with the
doctrine of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> about justification, as shall be manifested
hereafter. Therefore, all, who would live the life of justification, must
betake themselves to Jesus Christ, &amp; leane to Him, &amp; to His Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
for with the rob of His Righteousness must they alone be cloathed, &amp;

               <p>I know, this doctrine is not favourie to many, now adaies, &amp; as <hi>Papists,

&amp; plainness I can, lay down &amp; vindicate the Grounds and Reasons of
our Assertion; and then take notice of their contrary Objections; that
this Truth may be made plaine &amp; clear to such, as are concerned therein.
As to our Grounds, I shall first beginne with Scripture Authority; &amp; here
propose our Reasons from the <hi>Old Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi> The <hi>First</hi> passage to this purpose, which I shall take notice of, is
<hi>Esai.</hi> 45: 24. <hi>Surely shall one say, in the Lord have I righteousness,</hi> (or in the
Lord is all righteousnesses) <hi>to wit,</hi> for me: and this following upon what
was said <hi>vers 22. look unto me, &amp; be ye saved, all the ends of the earth;</hi> which
was an Invitation &amp; call to them, to act faith upon Him, in order to their
Salvation; as the stung Israelites did look unto the brazen serpent, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their recovery; this <hi>looking</hi> being clearly explained <hi>by coming vers</hi> 24.
<hi>Even to Him shall men come</hi> (and we know how frequently faith is held forth
&amp; expressed by <hi>coming,</hi> in the Gospel) saith, that hereby is pointed forth
the rich Advantage, that such shall have, who look &amp; come to Him by
faith, &amp; submit unto Him heartily &amp; cheerfully, imported by <hi>bowing of the
knee,</hi> &amp; <hi>swearing with the tongue,</hi> to wit. That they shall have a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Him; &amp; this they shall avow &amp; profess: and this being exclusive
of all others, as the Context cleareth, saith, that they should be brought
to that, that they should renounce all other righteousness what somever,
&amp; rest on this God alone, who is the only God <hi>vers</hi> 22. &amp; on His righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
for in Him they shall be made to look for it, &amp; that in rich aboundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce:
And upon this followeth their justification, &amp; glorying in the Lord
alone <hi>vers 25. In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, &amp; shall glory.</hi>
This passage therefore doth clearly hold forth a justification, through the
righteousness of the Messiah, of the true &amp; living God, laid hold upon &amp;
applied by faith, or owned &amp; embraced, as their only righteousness: &amp;
this righteousness is not a righteousness wrought in them; for such a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
is aboundantly hold forth by the word <hi>strength;</hi> but a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
made over over Beleevers, &amp; which they owne as theirs, and rest
upon.</p>
               <p>It is too narrow &amp; scanty an Interpretation, to limite this justification,
to the Lords vindicating of His peoples sincerity &amp; Innocency, in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of their Enemies, at whose hands they suffered great things, and that
unjustly; &amp; not to take in their Spiritual justification, &amp; delivery from the
guilt of sin, through faith in the Messiah; especially seing there is an Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
going before to them, to lay hold on the Lord Messias by faith, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Gospel Methode; and upon this followeth their glorying
in the Lord conforme to what the Apostle saith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 30, 31. that the Lord
Jesus is made of God Righteousness to His people, that he that glorieth, may
glory in the Lord.</p>

out their eyeing of the Lord, and coming to Him, and that in order to
their justification and Salvation; together with their profession of owneing
the Lord's Righteousness alone, for their Righteousness, renouncing all
other Righteousness, in themselves, or in others, in order to justification:
and thereby declaring, that they look upon it as necessary for them to have
a Righteousness; and that this is onely the Righteousness of Jehovah, or
of the Messiah, where with they desire to be clothed, and rest satisfied. All
which import the Lords bestowing of this Righteousness upon them, that
is, imputing of it unto them; for without this they cannot have it, nor
glory in it, as their owne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is faid <hi>Esai.</hi> 61: 10. <hi>I will greatly rejoice in the Lord; My
Soul shall be joyful in my God; for He hath clothed me with garments of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
He hath covered me with the rob of Righteousness</hi> &amp;c. And this coming in
upon the back of what was said, in the beginning of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Christ's furniture for His work of Mediation, His Call thereto, and
His special work, or the End, for which He was sent, to wit, <hi>to binde up the

sweet welcome, and hearty acceptance, that the anointed Messiah should
have among His own chosen ones: for these words hold forth their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of their sense of what they had received from Him, and of their
joy upon the account thereof. They professe openly their joy &amp; rejoiceing
in the Lord, because He had clothed and covered them with the garments
of Salvation, and with the rob of Righteousness. Now this rob could not
be a rob of their owne making; nor can it be understood of their Inherent
holiness; for it is a Garment put on, and wherewith they are covered. Thus
are we said to put on the Lord Jesus <hi>Rom.</hi> 13: 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 27. And <hi>Iohn

their outward and temporal delivery, is but a part of their <hi>Socinian</hi> fiction,
without any apparent ground in the Text. Nay, the first part of the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,</hi>
which Christ applieth to Himself <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. and the several particulars

                  </gap>, as the jewes did dream their Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias
would be. And the Gospel reacheth us Spiritually to expound, as poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth Spiritual promises, even such promises, as savoure more of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
things, as to the letter, that what are here mentioned do (2.) it is
but ground-less to imagine (and a piece of the ordinary course of <hi>Socinians,</hi>
in evading clear Testimonies of Scripture, brought against them) that <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>
here doth signify God's <hi>faithfulness:</hi> for though somewhere, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
mention is made of God's Righteousness, and other circumstances of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104357:37"/>
Text make it evident, this sense might be admitted; yet it cannot be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
here, where the Righteousness is said to be granted to the people,
as a rob and a garment to cover them: and the very following words of the
<hi>verse</hi> show, that this is meaned of Some thing, bestowed upon them, for it
is added, <hi>as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
her self with her jewels;</hi> or, as Some render the words, <hi>He hath decked
me with ornaments, as a bridegroom, and with jewels as a bride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. He excepteth, <hi>If these words be taken in a Spiritual sense, the promise,
which is contained in them, cannot suite the Church; because the Church is at all ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
and alwayes clothed with Christ's Righteousness, being justified in Him Ans.</hi>
This one answere will destroy all the Spiritual promises, hold forth by the
prophets, as the fruits &amp; effects of Christ's coming; for the Church of true
and faithful beleevers was really, in some measure answerable to that more
dark dispensation, made partaker of these Saving and Spiritual benefites,
both at that time, and before, even from the beginning: and thus there
shall be no promises in all the old Testam of Spiritual things, touching par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of Sin, Justification, Grace and Sanctification, and the like, made unto
the Church; but all of them must be interpreted of carnal things: though
the New Test. teacheth us the contrary, as might be evinced by multitudes
of places. But the matter is clear, <hi>to wit.</hi> That this is mentioned, as the
open profession of the Church, with joy and thankfulness, of what she
was blessed with, and made partaker of in Christ; and had, as a fruit and
effect of His performing His Mediatory work; that is, That she was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with a rob of Righteousness; and that by Him, which was, and would
be to her a ground of perpetual joy, and rejoiceing in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Against that passage <hi>Rev.</hi> 19: 8. which was adduced for clearing of the
place, now under hand, he excepteth thus, <hi>These words only pointe forth
the honour and dignity, which Christ now conferreth upon the Church, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of her Righteousness: for it is parallel to that other place Rev.</hi> 3: 4. <hi>Ans.</hi>
This is nothing, but a plaine perversion of the Scriptures; for it is not said,
<hi>for her Righteousness; nor for the Righteousness of the Saints:</hi> but in these words
a reason is given, why by this araying in fine Linen, the bride is said to be
made ready; and withall hereby the signification and Import of that <hi>fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linen</hi>
is held forth, when it is said, <hi>for the fine linen is the Righteousness of the
Saints.</hi> The Spirit of the Lord is here speaking of the returne of the jewes,
and of their marrying of new with their former husband, from whom
they had so long departed, by playing the harlot; (as worthy and judicious
<hi>M. Durham</hi> sheweth, in his comment on the place) and of this new Bride
it is said, that <hi>she is arayed in fine linen, clean and white;</hi> and this linen is
explained to be the <hi>Righteousness of Saints,</hi> or <hi>justifications of Saints,</hi> the
word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the same, that is used <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 16, 18. Where it is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
<hi>justification;</hi> and it is called here the <hi>Righteousness,</hi> or <hi>justifications of
Saints,</hi> because it is no other, than that which is common to all Saints;
whereby is signified, that the jewes, at their conversion, shall be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and justified, after the same manner, that all the Saints have been;
even after that self same manner, at which they formerly stumbled, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104357:38"/>
which wickedly and peremptorily they refused and rejected. This Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
therefore can be nothing else, than the Righteousness of Christ
imputed: for this only is cleane and white, all other having spots and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
This is not within, but from without, and is put on, &amp; is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Church, and so imputed.</p>
               <p>Against that saying of <hi>putting on Christ,</hi> twice mentioned, he excepteth
saying. <hi>That none of them speak of justification, but that Rom.</hi> 13: 14. <hi>spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of Sanstification; and that Gal.</hi> 3: 27. <hi>of profession. Ans.</hi> If we are said to
put on Christ in <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and as to a <hi>profession,</hi> much more may we be
said, to put Him on in <hi>justification,</hi> which is the basis and ground work of
Sanctification, and the truth &amp; reality of that which is professed. Without
justification there is no Sanctification; and except we be clothed with
Christ, and put Him on in order to justification, we cannot put Him on,
in order to Sanctification. And as such, as are baptized in Christ, have
declared, that they have put on Christ; so such have done it in truth and
reality, who are the Children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and are
Christ's and are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise <hi>Gal.</hi>
3: 26, 29. Not could they be said to do this outwardly, as to a profession,
in their Baptisme, if a real putting on of Christ were not to be found in
such, as had the Spiritual and inward thing Imported &amp; signified by outward
Baptisme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirely</hi> a 3 passage is <hi>Ier.</hi> 23: 5, 6. <hi>Bohold the dayes come, saith the Lord,
that</hi> I <hi>will raise unto David a Righteous Branch, and a King shall reigne &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper,
and shall execute judgment &amp; justice, in the earth. In his dayes judah
shall be saved and Israel shall dwell saifly: and this is His name, whereby He
shall becalled, the Lord, our Righteousness.</hi> It is undeniable and manifest,
that this is spoken of Christ, who was the Branch, raised up unto <hi>David;</hi>
and the King that should reigne and prosper; and it is through Him, that
judah is saved, and Israel made to dwell sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly. Now of this Righteous
Branch, it is said, that His name shall be called Jehovah our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
He shall be owned and embraced as such; whereby it is declared,
that as we have need of a Righteousuess, and have none of our owne; so
this Righteous Branch shall become a Righteousness to us: in Him, and in
Him alone shall all His people have a Righteousness: He and His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
shall be made over unto them. And as they shall glory in Him,
acknowledging all their Righteousness to be in and from Him; so He shall
glory in that stile and Title, which shall be given to Him upon that account,
and He shall owne it, as His glorious Title and Name, for their further
refreshment and Consolation. He shall look upon that, as His greatest
honour, to be called the Lord our Righteousness, Jehovah that purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
and prepareth for and bestoweth a sufficient Righteousness on His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
This passage with its forcible light so opened the eyes of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
the popish adversary to the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ, that
he was forced to confess, <hi>That Christ is said to be our Righteousness, because
he hath made Satisfaction for us to the Father; and doth so give and communicat
that Satisfastion unto us, when He justifieth us, that it may be said to be our
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104357:38"/>
Satisfaction &amp; Righteousness—and in this sense, it would not be absurd, if
any should say, that the Righteousness of Christ &amp; His merites are imputed unti us,
as if we our selves had satisfied. De justif. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 10.</p>

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> adde to this <hi>Ier.</hi> 33: 15, 16. where, as <hi>Iunius</hi> &amp; the <hi>Dutch</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
have it, this same Title is repeated, as given unto the righteous
Branch: but if we take the words, as they are rendered by others, &amp; as
they are in our Translation, as the Stile &amp; name of the Church, they willcon
tribute not a little to our present purpose. <hi>And this, wherewith she shallbe called,</hi>
THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNES: for hereby is clearly Imported
the Churches glorying in that Title, &amp; in having all her righteousness in &amp;
through her Head &amp; Husband; that as she owned herself to be the Spouse
of Christ, &amp; had His name called upon her; so this would be all the name,
that she would owne, as her greatest glory; &amp; by that alone would she
be called; thereby professing, with glorying &amp; satisfaction, that she had
no righteousness of her own; &amp; if any would know her aright, &amp; give
her her highest titles, they should know her under that notion, &amp; give her
that Name, that should openly declare, that she were void of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in her self, &amp; were ungodly, &amp; had all her Righteousness from her
husband, &amp; would appear before God in no righteousness, but in her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.
So that she would owne that Title alone, which should be a procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
to all the world, that she was covered with her Husbands, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
&amp; with that alone, &amp; a constant <hi>Memorandum,</hi> to keep her in the
fresh conviction, Faith &amp; Profession of this.</p>
               <p>Against these clear &amp; pregnant passages <hi>Ioh. Goodwine</hi> excepteth. <hi>pag.</hi> 127.
<hi>saying, It is not here said, the righteousness of the Lord shall be our righteousness,
or shall be imputed to us for righteousness. Avs.</hi> Though this be not said, in so
many words &amp; syllabs, yet that same is said in a more clear, convinceing &amp;
emphatick manner: so that he, who seeth not this lying in these words,
must be more blinde than <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was. When this righteous Branch is
raised up by Jehovah, &amp; gotteth this name, <hi>the Lord our Righteousness,</hi>
what can be more manifest, than that, He is made Righteousness to His
people; Yea &amp; all their Righteousness; &amp; that this Righteousness is made
over to them; so that He is, in a manner, wholly theirs, &amp; nothing but
theirs, &amp; all that He hath is theirs; &amp; particularly that His Righteousness
is all the Righteousness they owne, as their Righteousness.</p>
               <p>He excepteth 2 <hi>That in no tolerable sense, can Christ, being a person, be
said to be imputed to us. Ans.</hi> Do we not hear, that a childe was born to us,
&amp; a Son was given to us? <hi>Esai.</hi> 9: 6. &amp; was not that child &amp; Son a person?
And may not a person be as well said to be Imputed, as given, seing impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
upon the matter, is nothing but a giving, or bestowing? Yet we
do not say, that Christ is Imputed; but that this expression here used, doth
manifestly evince, that we are righteous through the righteousness of Christ
made ours, &amp; that Christ is become the Lord our righteousness, &amp; that
true beleevers receive &amp; owne Him, as such, &amp; rest upon His righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
alone by faith.</p>
               <p>He excepteth 3. <hi>The plaine &amp; direct meaning is, that He shall be generally
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104357:39"/>
acknowledged &amp; celebrated by his people of the jewes, as the great author &amp; procurer
of that righteousness, or justification in the sight of God, upon which aboundance
of outward glory, peace &amp; prosperity should be cast upon them, Ans.</hi> (1.) That
this is not to be restricted to the jewes, is manifest, seing it is spoken of
the Gospel times, when the righteous Branch shall be raised up unto
<hi>David,</hi> &amp; a King shall reigne &amp; prosper. (2.) It is too carnal an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
to think, the text speaketh only of such a justification, as is followed
with aboundance of outward Glory, peace &amp; Prosperity; whileas the whole
Gospel informeth us of something more spiritual, attending upon &amp; following
justification. (3.) Righteousness &amp; justification are here made Synonymous,
which ought not to be; though these two be inseparably lincked together;
yet they are formally different. (4.) Wherein standeth this righteousness
&amp; justification? He tels us, in the place, to which he here referreth us,
that it standeth in Remission of sins: But pardon of sins is no righteousness;
though a man pardoned hath freedom from the obnoxiousness to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
yet righteousness is another thing, &amp; respecteth the obligation to
duty, required in the Law. (5.) Though it is true, Christ is indeed the
author of our justification &amp; pardon (which is an effect of God's pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
us righteous, &amp; of His accepting of us, as righteous in justification)
as of our peace; yet that needeth not destroy what we assert, there being
no inconsistency here, but a necessary &amp; essentiall agreement betwixt the
Imputation of Christ' righteousness &amp; justification; but it rather contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to the establishment of our Assertion: Yet it is obvious, that when
Christ is called <hi>the Lord our Righteousness,</hi> there is more Imported, than His
being the author of our peace &amp; justification; even the way also, how He
bringeth about our peace &amp; justification, is here denoted, <hi>to wit,</hi> His being
made of God righteousness to His people; so that His righteousness beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
theirs, in order to their peace &amp; justification.</p>
               <p>But to confirme his Interpretation, he tels us, 1. <hi>That the Imposition of name
upon either thing or person, often notes the quality, or proprity in either, or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
benefite redounding from either, answereable thereunto, as Esai.</hi> 9. his name
shall be called wonderfull, <hi>that is, he shall be acknowledged &amp; looked upon by
men, as a doer of things very strange. Ans.</hi> Seing all these names given to
Christ <hi>Esai.</hi> 9. cannot be so interpreted, as to have this import mentioned;
for who will say, that the name <hi>everlasting Father,</hi> &amp; <hi>the mighty God</hi> can
be so interpreted, as to denote only some answerable benefite redounding
there from; who seeth not how little this can satisfie? But (2.) be it so,
that this name shall denote some benefite, redounding therefrom, why
may it not denote this Effect, which is only answerable hereunto, <hi>to wit,</hi>
that His people shall be made partaker of His Surety-righteousness, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
the same made over unto them, as they become united unto Him, &amp;
have His name called upon them.</p>
               <p>He tels us 2. <hi>That it is familiar to attribute the Effect to its Cause, or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
by a verbe substantive only; as when Christ is called our Hop, our life,
Resurrection, peace &amp; Glory, meaning that he is the author &amp; purchaser of all these.
Ans.</hi> Yet this proveth not, that He is the author of all these Effects after
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104357:39"/>
one &amp; the same way. He is otherwise our hope, of which He is the Object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as well as the Author, than He is our life: And He is otherwise our life
and peace, which He worketh &amp; createth in us, than He is our Resurrection
and Glory. So He is our Righteousness, by making us partaker of His Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety-righteousness,
&amp; imputing it unto us, that it may be reckoned on our
Score; for this the nature of the thing requireth, seing a Righteousness we
must have, ere we be justified; and a Righteousness of our owne we have
not; and therefore must have one imputed to us: and what Righteousness
can suite us better than His, who is THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS?</p>
               <p>He tels us 3. <hi>That by Righteousness is meaned that justification, which stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in Remission of Sinnes: and the meaning is, that through Him God would be
reconceled to them and pacified with them. Ans.</hi> Justification is something else,
than pardon of sins; for a justified man is one, that is declared and pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Righteous in order to pardon of Sins; and in order to a persons being
declared such, by God, who alway judgeth according to truth, he must
be Righteous; &amp; Righteous can no man be in the sight of God, in order to
his justification, by what is in himself; &amp; therefore he must have a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
from some other: &amp; seing Christ is called, <hi>the Lord our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
it must be His Righteousness, which must be bestowed upon them, in
order to God's being reconciled to them, &amp; pacified with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly</hi> another passage is <hi>Dan.</hi> 9: 24. <hi>to finish the transgression, and to make
an end of sins, &amp; to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting
Righteousness.</hi> That all this is to be understood of the gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at &amp; spiritual ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of power &amp; Grace, which are to be brought about by the Messiah, no
Christian candeny; and among the rest we see, He is to bring in a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and a Righteousness of ages, an everlasting Righteousness, that
shall endure for ever, &amp; shall have everlasting effects: and this Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is something more, than Remission of Sins, &amp; is distinct from it, which
is sufficiently held forth by the foregoing Expressions of <hi>finishing transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
of <hi>making an end of Sins,</hi> and of <hi>making reconciliation for iniquity:</hi>
which saith, that to justification there is a Righteousness required, &amp; that
this Righteousness is not meer Remission of Sins; but some thing beside,
that must endure, when sin is taken away. This Righteousness is to be brought
in by the Messiah, as a favoure, distinct from the preceeding, &amp; yet inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
there from, &amp; firmly connected therewith. This Righteousness,
which the Messiah is to bring in, being something beside Remission of Sins,
must be a Righteousness wrought by the Messiah, &amp; brought in for the use
and advantage of His people, who, as they are to be made partaker of the
foregoing favoures, are also to be made partaker of this; and consequently
must have it imputed to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seing no other way, it can be made
theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly</hi> We way adduce to this purpose, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3: 4. <hi>take away the filthy
garments from him: and unto him he said, behold, I have caused thine iniquity
to go from thee; I will cloth thee with change of rayment.</hi> Here by a vision is
signified to the propher, how the Lord would at length be reconciled to His
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104357:40"/>
Church, &amp; bring her in to His favour againe, that her service might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
acceptable to Him, which now was wholly defiled, and so defiled, that
even their High priest, who should weare the holy garments, whereupon
was engraven <hi>Holiness to the Lord,</hi> is said to have had on filthy garments;
whereby the accuser of the Brethren, Satan the enemie, had no small ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
against them: and the way is set down in borrowed termes, which
are in part explained. <hi>First</hi> the Lord caused to take away the filthy garments
from the High Priest; and this is more plainely expressed, in these words,
<hi>I have caused thine iniquity to go from thee.</hi> But beside this, there is a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
required, in order to acceptance with God, as was said above:
therefore that this work of justification may be compleated, it is added,
<hi>&amp; I will cloth thee with change of rayment.</hi> Some, it is true, would referre
this to Sanctification; but others unto justification. <hi>Iunius's Notes,</hi> &amp; the
<hi>English annot,</hi> take in both: and sure, if this be true of Sanctification, which
is wrought in us, it is much more true of the Righteousness, that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto justification, which is without us, and must be put on. And the
<hi>Chaldee Paraphrase</hi> turneth it thus, <hi>behold I have taken away thine iniquity, &amp;
have clothed thee with Righteousness.</hi> The word in the original, which is
translated <hi>change of rayment,</hi> importeth some suite of apparell, that is not
for ordinary wearing, but kept for solemne times, &amp; so may well import
the Saints wedding or Marriage-suite: &amp; that which is added in the sollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
verse, may be understood, as denoting Sanctification, which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the <hi>Mitre</hi> on his head, signifying the graces of the Spirit, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying

occasion hereafter to examine his grounds, both from this and other passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
for the Imputation of faith, in opposition to the Imputation of
Christ's Righteousness. I shall only say at present, that this Righteousness
cannot be faith it self, because it is <hi>revealed to faith;</hi> &amp; it is called the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of God, which is <hi>by faith of Iesus Christ;</hi> &amp; so not faith it self.
One thing cannot be both the Act, &amp; the Object of that Act. And
what sense would that make, to say, <hi>faith is upon all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. He said. <hi>By the Righteousness of God some under stand here His truth and
faithfulness, in keeping promise. Ans.</hi> But though God's Righteousness may
elsewhere import &amp; signifie His faithfulness in keeping promise; yet that
is not the Righteousness here understood; for this suiteth a guilty sinner;
such as the Apostle hath been proving, in his foregoing discourse, both
jewes &amp; Gentiles to be; &amp; is such a Righteousness as is requisite to such,
as would be justified in God's sight vers 20. &amp; cannot be had by mans doing
the deeds of the Law, by which is the knowledg of sin, &amp; which therefore
rendereth their case more desperat; &amp; such a Righteousness, as is had by
faith, &amp; which is unto all &amp; upon all them that beleeve vers 20, 22. and
such a Righteousness, as is manifested without the Law vers 21. All which,
and much more, which might be mentioned, show, that some other thing
is here understood by the Righteousness of God, than His Faithfulness &amp;
Truth; even the Righteousness of God, which is imputed unto, &amp; bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon all that beleeve.</p>
               <p>3. He saith. <hi>Hereby is mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t that way, method &amp; meanes, which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath found out to justisis, or make men Righteous: or else that very Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by which we stand justified, or Righteous, in the sight of God. But not
the Righteousness of Christ: nor is there the least appearance in the context of any
necessity to take is so. Ans.</hi> It is true, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is here showing the whole
way, method &amp; meanes of our justification; &amp; particularly, what that
Righteousness is, by which poor sinners can stand justified &amp; Righteous in
the sight of God; even a Righteousness, that is not had by the works of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104357:41"/>
the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ: and this sufficiently evinceth,
that the Righteousness of God, here spoken of, is the Righteousness of
Christ, which saith seeketh in, and goeth to Christ for, that it may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted;
for faith hath no other end or errand to Christ, in reference to a
freedom from the wrath &amp; Curse of God, but to lay hold on a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in which the poor self condemned sinner may appear before God.
Beside that the following words vers 24, 25, 26. where the Redemption &amp;
propitiation of Christ, which was His Surety-righteousness, is mentioned,
may Satisfie us, as to what is meaned by this Righteousness of God. Sure,
there is not the least appearance of <hi>Paul's</hi> understanding that Mean &amp; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
which this Excepter supposeth to be the onely Method, <hi>to wit.</hi> That
our faith, considered, as our Act, is that: as if that were the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, &amp; could constitute us Righteous, in the sight of God, and
were a Righteousness had without works &amp; without the Law, &amp; received by
all that beleeve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Rom. 3. last Do we then make void the Law through faith? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid;
yea we establish the Law.</hi> Where the Apostle, preoceupying an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
asserteth; That through justification by faith, he did not make
void the law, but rather did establish it; the ground whereof is this, That
by the Gospel-way of justification, the law getteth full Satisfaction, in all
points, because Christ not only Satisfied for the penalty thereof, which
we were guilty of, and did lye under; but did also yeeld a perfect obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
thereunto; that so He might make up a full &amp; compleat Surety-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
by the Imputation of which unto His own, or the Lord's recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it upon their score, when they receive it by faith, they may be justified.
And thus, though sinners, who have broken the Law, &amp; so have forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the reward, promised to such as observe it in all points, &amp; are come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Curse, threatned to Transgressours, be not only freed from the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
but receive the rich Recompence of reward; yet the law is not made
null &amp; void, but is rather established &amp; confirmed in its full force, both as
to its Commands &amp; Sanction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn Goodwine</hi> excepteth 1. <hi>There is no necessity, that by the Law, in this<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
should be meaned precisely the moral law; others understand it as well of
the Ceremonial Law. Ans.</hi> But sure, <hi>Paul's</hi> doctrine was not for establishing
of the Ceremonial Law, in whole, or in part. The Law, whereof the
Apostle is speaking, is that Law, by which both Gentiles &amp; jewes were
convinced of sin, &amp; had their mouthes stopped, &amp; were become guilty
before God vers 19. &amp; that Law, which maketh a discovery of sin vers 20.
comp. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: 7. &amp; by the deeds of which no flesh shall be justified,
in the sight of God vers 20, 28. It is that Law, by the works whereof even
<hi>Abraham</hi> could not be justified, nor <hi>David Rom.</hi> 4: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>2. He said, <hi>It is much more probable, that Paul should here assert the establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of the Ceremonial Law, than of the Moral 1. Because the jewes were more
tender and jealous over the Ceremonial Law, placing the far greatest part, if not
the whole of their hop of justification and Salvation, in the observation thereof. 2.
Because the Doctrine of faith did not carry any such colour of opposition to the Moral,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104357:41"/>
as to the Ceremonial part of their Law. Ans.</hi> To imagine, that no Law is here
to be understood, but the Ceremonial Law, is to make the Apostle esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
here, what he destroyeth else where, particularly in his Epistles to
the <hi>Galatians &amp; Colossians,</hi> &amp; in his whole doctrine: yea this would make
the Apostle, to cross the whole intent and designe of the Gospel, which
who dar once have the least thought of? The Law here doth plainely signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that, which was the Rule of Righteousness and of Obedience, &amp; was
publickly given unto the jewes for that end; &amp; by obedience to &amp; obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of which Law, they were expecting justification &amp; life; as by the
young man is manifest, who came to Christ to enquire what he should do
to be saved; &amp; said, he had observed all these &amp;c. As to his reasons, they
have no force: for. 1. The jewes had a zeal for the whole Law, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to knowledg, &amp; went about to establish their own Righteousness,
which was not in meer Ceremonials but in obedience &amp; full conformity
(as they supposed) unto the Righteousness, which they sought after, yea
followed and hunted after <hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 31. &amp; 10. 3. (2.) The doctrine of faith
carrieth the same colour of opposition to the Moral Law, that it doth to
the Ceremonial, in the point of justification. And it is not the doctrine of
faith that carrieth any colour of opposition to the Ceremonial Law; though
the doctrine of the Gospel-administration doth; else we must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay, there
was nothing of the doctrine of faith, under the Law, or that old dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>
               <p>3. He saith. <hi>Though the moral Law were precisely here understood; yet there
is no necessity to say, that it is established by the Imputation of Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
for, Some affirme, that the Law is therefore said to be established by faith,
because faith compasseth &amp; attaineth that righteousness, which the Law sought
after, &amp; could not attaine. 2. The Moral Law may in this sense be said to be
established; because faith purgeth the hearts of beleevers, &amp; so promotes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of it. Ans.</hi> As for the <hi>first,</hi> I do not understand, what the meaning
of it is. What is that Righteousness, which faith compasseth, and the Law
sought after, and could not attaine? It would seem to be nothing else but
Holiness and Sanctification: and if so, the two make but one: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I answere to this also, by saying to the <hi>Second.</hi> That albeit Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
can well consist together, &amp; this sense needeth not thrust out our sense;
yet I judge, this is not the maine Objection, that <hi>Paul</hi> obviateth here: he
reserveth a peculiar place for that hereafter, where he speaketh fully to it
<hi>Chap.</hi> 6. &amp; 7. But he speaketh of the establishing of the Law, both in its
commanding power and Sanction; for having spoken so much of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by faith in opposition to justification by the Law; and having said in the
foregoing <hi>vers</hi> that <hi>the circumcision shall be justified by faith, and the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
through faith:</hi> and neither the one, nor the other by or through the
Law; some might have thought, that by his thus crying up of faith, and
speaking so much of it, and only of it, as to justification, he was quite
casheering and rendering the Law null &amp; void: And therefore he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
That he is so far from making the Law void through faith, that he
rather doth establish the same, as was shown above.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:104357:42"/>
4. He saith. <hi>The Law may be said to be established by saith, in as much as
the threatnings of the Law are by the doctrine of faith declared not to be in vaine,
Christ's sufferings being a full confirmation of the force, efficacy and authority of
the Curse of the Law. Ans.</hi> This is so fargood: But why shall not also His obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
be a full confirmation of the force, efficacy &amp; authority of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
power of the Law? This being principally intended in the Law,
belongeth as much, at least, to the establishment thereof, as the Sanction.
We assert not the one with an exclusion of the other; but assert the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of both by faith: and thus the Law is by faith fully established,
in all its parts &amp; demands.</p>
               <p>5. He saith. <hi>The best Interpretation is, that by the Law here is meant that
part of the Old Test. which comprehendeth the writting of</hi> Moses, <hi>with those other
books, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h together with the writtings of the Prophets, make up the entire body
thereof, as it was used</hi> vers 21. <hi>and in this sense, the Law may most properly be
said to be established by Paul teaching the Doctrine of faith, because it is fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
&amp; agreable to those things, that are written there. Ans.</hi> But this sense is not
the same with the sense of the word <hi>Law</hi> v. 21. for the <hi>Law</hi> there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
as distinct from the Prophets. And if that part of the <hi>Old. Test.</hi> be
meaned, which is different from the book of the Prophets, what ground was
there to think, that the doctrine of faith did more seem to cross what was con
ained in the one, than what was contained in the other? especially seing he
had said v. 21. that the Righteousness, he spoke of, was witnessed both by the
Law and the Prophets. And if both should be here understood, seing the
Apostle did fully enough declare his mind as to that v.21. what ground is there
to think, that he was called to remove that objection here againe? And
what imaginable colour can be from any thing that the Apostle spoke, in the
foregoing words, for such an objection, as this? This manifestly is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a groundless invention of men, that know not else what to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly Rom.</hi> 4: 6. where mention is made of a Righteousness imputed
without works, &amp; that as the ground of a mans blessedness &amp; justification:
for it is of the blessedness of justification that the Apostle is there speaking,
and he showeth, that this is attained, not by the works of the Law, but
by an imputed Righteousness, which can be none else, that the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of God, spoken of in the preceeding <hi>Chapter;</hi> or of Christ, who
wrought the Redemption, and was set forth to be a propitiation through
faith in his blood.</p>
               <p>Against this He excepteth <hi>pag.</hi> 140. saying 1. <hi>If we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>will needs here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
a positive legal Righteousness, it is much more probable, He should meane
a Righteousness consisting of such, or of such an obedience to the Law, as hath an
absolute &amp; perfect agreableness to every mans condition &amp; calling respectively, than
the Righteousness of Christ, which hath no such property in it. Ans.</hi> The Apostle
speaketh of a Righteousness, and of a Righteousness imputed, and all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
must consist in obedience to the Law, and in full conformity the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto:
and seing it is said to be imputed, and not by our works, it must of
necessity follow, that the Apostle is to be understood, as speaking of the
Surety-righteousness of Christ. And if the Righteousness of Christ, who
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104357:42"/>
gave perfect obedience to the Law, and was constituted Mediator and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety
by the Father, and as such did give full Satisfaction both in obeying
the Law, and in paying the penalty, be not such an obedience to the Law,
as will serve every Beleevers turne, where else will the beleever finde a
more adequat Righteousness? Shall we think, that his act of saith, which
is but one act of obedience to the Law, or an act of obedience to one
command of the Law, hath a more perfect &amp; absolute agreablness to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mans condition respectively, than the perfect obedience &amp; Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ! Let such beleeve this, as can.</p>
               <p>2. He saith. <hi>The Righteousness, which God is said here to impute, is placed
in Remission of Sins. Ans.</hi> That Imputation of Righteousness and pardon of
sinnes do inseparably go together, is true; and that the one proveth the
other, is also clear from these words. But it is not proved, nor can it
be proved, that Imputed Righteousness and Remission of Sins are the same;
seing it is obvious enough, that Righteousness is one thing, and pardon of
sinnes is another distinct thing. No man will say, that a pardoned thiefe,
is a Righteous man; for that were as much, as to say, He was never a
thiefe. It is true, by pardon He is no more obnoxious to the penalty; the
obligation to underlye that being now taken away: yet that will not evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
that He is a Righteous man: and there is still a difference betwixt him,
and one that never was chargable with that guilt: this man, as to this, is
indeed a Righteous man, but not the other.</p>
               <p>3. He saith. <hi>The phrase of</hi> imputing Righteousness <hi>is best understood by the
contrary expression of</hi> imputing sin; <hi>&amp; this signifieth either to look upon a person,
as justly liable to punishment; or to inflict punishment upon him, in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sin. Therefore doubtless to</hi> impute Righteousness <hi>importeth nothing else,
but either to look upon a man as righteous, or to conferre upon him the privileges,
belonging to persons truely righteous. Ans.</hi> This is true, if we speak of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who is truely Righteous, antecedently unto this Imputation; as the
sinner is supposed to be truely a sinner antecedently unto this Imputation.
But when sin is imputed to a Righteous person, or to one, who, before
the imputation, was not guilty, nor looked upon as a Sinner, as Sin was
imputed to Christ, the Holy and Righteous one, who knew no sin; and
as Sin through injustice, was imputed to <hi>Naboth,</hi> who was not guilty of
what was laid to his charge; Imputation, in this case, must import some
thing else, than either of these two mentioned, and that antecedently to
an holding of that person liable to punishment, or to a punishing of him,
with consideration to that sin: thus before Christ could be looked upon, as
a person liable to punishment, or could be punished for sin, by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
God, sin must first have been imputed to Him, and reckoned upon
His Score; and that Righteously, because of His undertaking and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
submitting to the debt, as Surety: as when <hi>Iezabel</hi> would have <hi>Noboth</hi>
killed as a Malefactor, she first by injustice and indirect meanes, made him
guilty of sin, &amp; then held him liable to punishment, and dealt with him
accordingly. So, upon the other hand, when Righteousness is imputed
to a sinner (as we all are sinners) before He can be looked upon as a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104357:43"/>
person, or be dealt with, as a Righteous person, He must first have
a Righteousness imputed to him, and bestowed upon him: for how can God,
whose judgement is according to truth, look upon a person as Righteous,
and conferre privileges upon him, due only to such as are Righteous, who is
not Righteous indeed? Must He not first bestow a Righteousness upon him,
&amp; reckon a Righteousness upon his Score, to the end He may be just and
Righteous, when He is the justifier of him that beleeveth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly</hi> He said. <hi>Here is neither peer nor peep of the least ground or reason to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that by</hi> Righteousness, <hi>in this Scripture, should be meant the</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is enough that the Text saith, <hi>Righteousness is
imputed:</hi> for the man here spoken of, hath not a Righteousness of his own,
as the Apostle hath proved in the preceeding <hi>Chapters,</hi> &amp; doth here, take
for granted: And therefore this Imputed Righteousness must be the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of another; and it must be such a Righteousness of another as can
found free Remission of Sins. And whose Righteousness else can this be,
if it be not Christ's? Is there any third competitour here imaginable? must
it not be the Righteousness of Him, whom faith goeth out unto &amp; laith
hold on, in order to justification? Must it not be His Righteousness, who
was the Mediator, who laid down the price of Redemption, &amp; was a
propitiation, as He told us in the preceeding Chapter? Some men, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiging
a difference, betwixt a Righteousness imputed to us Sinners, and
the Righteousness of Christ, as if there could be any other Righteousness
imputable to us, except the Surety-righteousness of Christ; as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
in this joine with <hi>Socinians</hi> (See <hi>Volkel de vera Relig. lib. 5. cap.</hi> 21.
<hi>p.</hi> 565.) &amp; with <hi>Papists</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminians;</hi> so they declare themselves utter
strangers to the Gospel; yea greater strangers; than those were, against
whom the Apostle wrote, who took it for granted, that if any Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
from without, or that was not by any thing, which we do, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
it behoved to be the Righteousness of the Mediator: And this,
we may conceive, is the reason, why the Apostle doth not say, in so many
express words, that it was the Righteousness of Christ; for who could ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
thought of another?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly Rom.</hi> 5: 19. a place, with its whole contexture pregnant for our
purpose: for the Apostle is not onely here confirming, but also illustrating
this whole matter, from the Imputation of <hi>Adam's</hi> Sin unto his posterity;
&amp; after many various and emphatick expressions, used there-anent from
vers 12. and forward, he saith here vers 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>for as by one mans disobedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
many were made Sinners; so by the obedience of one shall many be made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.
Socinus de Servat. lib. 4. cap.</hi> 6. is so bold as to tell us, <hi>That he
supposeth, there is nothing written in the Scriptures, that hath given us a greater
occasion of erring, than that comparison betwixt</hi> Adam <hi>&amp;</hi> Christ, <hi>which</hi> Paul
<hi>made &amp; did prosecute at length here.</hi> And he would cleare to us the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
thus, <hi>That as by</hi> Adam's <hi>Sin &amp; disobedience, it came to passe, that
all men were condemned and died; so by Christ's righteousness and obedience it
came to passe, that they wero absolvod, and did live: for Christ by His own
Righteousness and Obedience, by vertue of the decree of God, did penetrate the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104357:43"/>
heavens, there to reigne for ever, and there he begote eternal life and everlas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
blessedness both to Himself, and to His.</hi> How aliene this is from the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
of the Apostle's discourse, needs not be declared, seing there is not one
word giving the least hint of the Apostle's designe to be, to declare how &amp;
what way Christ obtained power and authority to save: Yet He goeth on to
tell us, <hi>That as</hi> Adam's <hi>fault made him guilty of death, whence it came to
passe, that all mankind, that are procreat of him after that guilt, is obnoxious
to death: so Christ by His Righteousness purchased to Himself eternal life; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
it cometh te passe, that who ever are procreat of him, partake of this life.</hi> But
He never once taketh notice, that <hi>Paul</hi> giveth for the ground of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind's
becoming guilty of death, their <hi>sinning in him</hi> vers 12. even such, as
had not sinned after the similitude of <hi>Adam's</hi> transgression vers 14. yea, in
every verse this cause is noted, or pointed at: &amp; it being Notour of it self,
that ifall mankind did sin in <hi>Adan, Adam's</hi> sin must be imputed unto them;
so Christ's Righteousness must be imputed unto all His, inreference to their
justification, &amp; that with a <hi>much more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now see what <hi>Iohn Goodwine</hi> excepteth <hi>pag.</hi> 142. &amp;c. <hi>It is not here</hi>
(said He) <hi>said, that by the Imputation of</hi> Adam's <hi>disobedience, men are made
formally Sinners, but simply sinners, that is, either obnoxious to death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
or else sinners by propagation, not Imputation. Ans.</hi> This is the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
upon the matter, with <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> answer <hi>de justif. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 9. &amp; here
we have a distinction proposed without any explication, <hi>to wit.</hi> betwixt <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
sinners,</hi> and <hi>formally sinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And what can he meane by <hi>formally sinners?</hi>
possibly he meaneth that, which otherwise is expressed by <hi>inherently sinners:</hi>
And if so, though <hi>Adam's</hi> posterity, so soon as they come to have a being,
have an universal corruption of Nature convoyed by propagation; yet that
is not it, which is properly said to be Imputed: for that which is imputed, is
the guilt of <hi>Adam's</hi> sin, whereby they become sinners, that is guilty le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally,
and so obnoxious to punishment, death &amp; condemnation: &amp; this is
enough for us; for as the posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> have the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> so imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them, that they become guilty and obnoxious to wrath; so Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
have the Righteousness of Christ imputed unto them, and they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
are accounted legally righteous. (2) Whileas he will not grant, that
<hi>Adam's</hi> posterity are sinners by imputation, he joineth with the <hi>Socinians,</hi>
who turne these words vers 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

4: 10. 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 3: 7. But enough of this here, seing that matter is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cleared by the orthodox, writting against the <hi>Socinians;</hi> and we have
also spoken of it against the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe saith He, <hi>Neither doth the Apostle here oppose unto, or compare the
Obedience of Christ, with the disobedience of</hi> Adam, <hi>as one Act unto or with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104357:44"/>
but as Satisfaction to and with the provocation; or the Remedie to and with
the disease. Otherwise he should make sins of Omission to be no disobedience, be
cause Omissions are no Acts. Ans.</hi> The Apostle so compareth the Obedience of
Christ with the disobedience of <hi>Adam,</hi> as the Satisfaction with the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or as the Remedie with the disease; as that withall &amp; chiesly, he
cleareth up the manner &amp; way thereof to be by Imputation, thus, That
as Adam's sin of disobedience (which includeth both Omission &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
being a Violation of the Law, &amp; of the Covenant) was imputed
to his posterity, &amp; they hence became guilty &amp; obnoxious to death, yea
&amp; were punished with original Corruption, (which cometh by propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
&amp; the consequences thereof; so Christ's obedience, which was full
&amp; compleat, is imputed unto Beleevers, whereupon they become Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
in order to their recovery out of their Natural state of sin and
misery.</p>
               <p>Further He saith, <hi>By that obedience of Christ, whereby it is here said, that
many are, or shall be</hi> made Righteous, <hi>that is</hi> jus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ified, <hi>we cannot understand
that Righteousness of Christ, which consists only in obedience to the Moral Law;
but that Satisfactory Righteousness, or obedience, which He performed to that
peculiar Law of Mediation, which was imposed upon him, and which chiesly
consisted in his sufferings. Ans.</hi> By the obedience of Christ unto the Law of
Mediation, strickly so taken, as distinguished from His obedience to the
Moral Law, beleevers could not be made Righteous, as the posterity of
<hi>Adam</hi> are made sinners by his disobedience; for that could not be properly
imputed, as this is, as hath been shown; &amp; so <hi>Paul's</hi> similitude should
halt. But (2.) Why is Christ's obedience to the Law of Mediation set in
opposition to His obedience to the Moral Law, seing <hi>this</hi> was a part of <hi>that,</hi>
&amp; unto this He obliged Himself, in undertaking the Mediation. Was He
not by the Law of Mediation bound as well to give obedience to the Law,
as to suffer the penalty? And was He not obliged to both, as Surety, in
room &amp; place? And then why may not both be imputed unto them? (3.)
Why should obedience here be thus restricked to the Law of Mediation?
He addeth two reasons, but neither are valide. The 1. is this, <hi>Because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the opposition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>etwixt</hi> Adam's <hi>disobedience, which was but one single Act,
and Christ's Obedience, if it were his universal conformity to the Law, would not
hold. Ans.</hi> This same man told us in his former exception, That Christ's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edience,
in respect of <hi>Adam's</hi> disobedience, was considered &amp; opposed, as
the Satisfaction to the provocation, &amp; as the Remedie to the disease: now
if this be true, Christ made Satisfaction for no provocation, but for that
single act of eating the forbidden fruit: &amp; what He did &amp; suffered should
be only a Remedie for that one distemper: &amp; if so, how shall the rest of
the Provocations and diseases be taken away? or are there no more Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
or diseases? (2.) <hi>Adam's</hi> disobedience was no Single act of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
but a disobedience including the breach of the whole Moral Law:
Saith not <hi>Iames,</hi> that <hi>he who offendeth in one, is guilty of all? Iam.</hi> 2: 10.
&amp; prove it too, in the following vers? The 2. is this, <hi>The Effect that is here
attributed to this obedience of Christ, to wit,</hi> justification, <hi>or</hi> Righteous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104357:44"/>
                  <hi>of many, is constantly appropriated to the death &amp; blood of Christ. Ans.</hi> This
that is attributed to the blood &amp; death of Christ elsewhere, <hi>to wit,</hi> our
justification, sheweth, that the death of Christ is not understood exclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely;
for by His death, exclusivly considered, we cannot-be made Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;
for the Imputation of another's suffering, though it may exeem
from death &amp; suffering; yet it cannot constitute Righteous, in reference
to the commanding Law. (2.) The death of Christ must not be looked
on, as one act of obedience; but as including all His foregoing acts of
obedience, belonging to His State of humiliation, whereof His death was
the crowning piece; &amp; so as including as His whole suffering; so His
whole obedience to the Law, under which he was made: for He is said to
have <hi>been obedient unto death, even unto the death of the cross Phil.</hi> 2: 8. not
that the death of the cross was all His obedience, as it was not the whole
state of His humiliation, but the terminating remarkable act thereof; as
it was not all His suffering, His whole life being a life of suffering. (3.)
If this obedience be understood of this one act of obedience in His dying,
&amp; justification be looked upon, as the effect of this only, what shall beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of His Soul-sufferings, while He was in an agonie in the garden? But
if the act of obedience in His death, include these, why not His whole
state of humiliation? And if it include all this, why not also His obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to the Law, seing His being made under the Law, belongeth to His state
of humiliation, as the Apostle tels us <hi>Gal.</hi> 4: 4.</p>
               <p>He excepteth furder, saying, <hi>Suppose, that by the obedience of Christ, we
should here undorstand, His active obedience to the Moral Law, yet it will not
hence follow, that men must be justified, or made Righteous by it, in such a
way of imputation. Ans.</hi> If by Christ's obedience to the Moral Law, we be
made Righteous, as the posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> were made sinners by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
of <hi>Adam,</hi> that obedience of Christ must necessarily be imputed
to us, as <hi>Adam's</hi> disobedience was imputed to his posterity: for there is
no other way imaginable. Let us hear his reason to the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For certaine it is</hi> (said he) <hi>that that justification or Righteous-making, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Apostle speaketh</hi> vers 19. <hi>is the same with that, which He had spoken of</hi>
v. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Now that Righteousness</hi> vers 17. <hi>is described</hi> vers 16. <hi>to be the gift</hi>
(i.e. <hi>the forgiveness) of many offences i.e. of all the offences, whereof a man either doth,
or shall stand guilty of before God, unto justification: and evident it is, that that
Righteousness &amp;c. cannot stand in the Imputation of a fulfilling of the Law. Ans.</hi>
(1.) Though <hi>making Righteous</hi> and <hi>justification</hi> be inseparable; yet they are
not formally one &amp; the same; but Righteous-making (to wit by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
is antecedent unto justification, &amp; the ground thereof, as becoming
sinners is not formally to be condemned, but is prior to it, &amp; the ground
thereof. (2.) That free gift mentioned vers 16. is not <hi>free forgiveness,</hi> but is
that, which is opposite to <hi>judgment,</hi> or <hi>guilt,</hi> or <hi>reatus,</hi> tending to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
&amp; so is the same with that which is called the <hi>Grace of God,
&amp; the gift by Grace</hi> vers 15. and <hi>the gift of Righteousness</hi> vers 17. which is in
order to justification &amp; free pardon. As therefore the <hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, guilt</hi> is not
the same with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>condemnation;</hi> but tendeth thereunto; so neither
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104357:45"/>
is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>free gift</hi> the same with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>justification,</hi> but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
thereunto, &amp; is followed therewith. (3.) Nor can the Adversary Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
take these words vers 16. <hi>the free gift is of many offences,</hi> to be the
same with <hi>free pardon of many offences,</hi> else he must say, that this free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
goeth before justification &amp; consequently is not justification it self, as
he saith else where; for the text saith, that <hi>the free gift is of many offences
unto justification;</hi> as judgment or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was antecedent to condemnation.
(4.) So then, the true meaning is, that the free gift of Righteousness hath
respect unto many sinnes, to the end, that justification &amp; pardon, that
followeth thereupon, might be full, whileas the guilt, that was imputed
to <hi>Adam's</hi> posterity, had respect only to his first breach of the Covenant,
for which all were made obnoxious to condemnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly</hi> He saith. <hi>It is but loose and unsavoury argueing, to reason from a thing
simply done, to a determinat manner of doing of it: so is it to reason from being
made Righteous, to a being made Righteous by Imputation. Ans.</hi> The particular
manner or way how we are made Righteous, is aboundantly signified by our
being made &amp; constitute Righteous by the Righteousness of another, who
was our Head, Representative &amp; Surety: &amp; that because it can be imagined
to be no other way, than by Imputation. And <hi>Further,</hi> the whole discurse of
the Apostle here, &amp; particularly the comparison so much here insisted upon,
putteth the matter beyond all debate. As <hi>Adam's</hi> sin was imputed to his
posterity, whereby all were accounted sinners, &amp; dealt with as such, even
as guilty, by reason of <hi>Adam's</hi> act of sin: So Christ's Righteousness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
ours by Imputation, &amp; we are made Righteous &amp; accounted such
&amp; dealt with as such, upon the account thereof. No man can imagine,
how one shall be accounted guilty, &amp; punished as guilty of a sinful act,
done by another, unless the guilt of that sinful act be imputed to him; so
no man can imagine, how one can be accounted Righteous, &amp; dealt with
as such, upon the account of the Righteousness of another, if that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the other be not imputed to him. And beside, This is called
a <hi>gift,</hi> a <hi>free gift,</hi> &amp; a <hi>free gift of Righteousness,</hi> &amp; a <hi>free gift of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
received,</hi> which fully pointe forth this Imputation, which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly. Rom.</hi> 8: 3, 4. For <hi>what the Law could not do, in that it was weak
through the flesh, God, sending His own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh, &amp;
for sin condemned sin in the flesh, that the Righteousness of the Law might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in us.</hi> The Law could not help a sinner from under the Curse, nor
unto the recompence of reward, because it was weak through the flesh,
through the sin &amp; corruption of man, whereby he could not give right and
full obedience thereunto. And therefore God sent His Son, in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of sinful flesh, who by His obedience &amp; suffering, in His state of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
took away the sting of death, &amp; the strength of sin, by satisfying
all the demandes of the Law, the whole <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>jus</hi> &amp; <hi>right</hi> of the
Law, which consisted in yeelding full &amp; perfect obedience, &amp; in making
full Satisfaction for the violation committed: for the Law said, <hi>cursed is
every one, that continueth not in all things, which are written therein, to do them
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104357:45"/>
Deut.</hi> 27: 26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 13. And the Righteousness, which is of the Law, is,
that <hi>the man, who doth these things, shall live by them.</hi> And this was so orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the <hi>Righteousness of the Law,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Law, the <hi>jus</hi> and
<hi>demand</hi> of the Law mentioned, <hi>might be fulfilled in us,</hi> that is, in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by the Redeemer &amp; Surety, who did &amp; suffered all this in &amp; for His
own. The <hi>Ethiopik</hi> Version is a clear commentary, <hi>and when we were impotent
to do the commands of the Law, God sent His own Son for that sin, who took on
our body of sin, &amp; condemned sin it self in our body, that he might justifie us, &amp;
be propitious unto us, and that so he might fulfill the work of the commands of the
Law for them, who walk in the Law of the holy Spirit.</hi> Let us now see what
<hi>John Goodwine</hi> excepteth p. 145. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He saith. (1.) <hi>Some understand this rather of</hi> Sanctification, <hi>than of</hi> justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
<hi>&amp; by the</hi> fulfilling of the Righteousness of the Law, <hi>that Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
obedience to the precepts thereof, which all those, that truely beleeve in Christ,
do in part performe, and desire and strive to performe more perfectly. Ans.</hi> Gospel
justification &amp; Gospel-Sanctification agree well together, and Christ is the
true foundation &amp; cause of both. But that this is to be understood rather
of justification, appeareth hence. (1.) That this is a further explication &amp;
confirmation of what was said vers 1. <hi>There is therefore now no Condemnation
to them, which are in Christ Iesus</hi> (2.) all that measure of Sanctification,
which the Saints through Grace attaine unto here, cannot be called a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of the Righteousness of the Law, the Lawes demands are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
satisfied; for it calleth for perfect obedience, which none of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
can give. (3.) If this were understood of Sanctification, why are
these words added, <hi>who walk not after the flesh, bue after the Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. He said. <hi>By the Righteousness of the Law, which is here said to be fulfilled
in beleevers, cannot be meant the Righteousness or active obedience of Christ impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
because it must of necessity be such a Righteousness and such a fulfilling, as
may be apprehended as a proper and sutable effect of Christ's condemning sin in the
flesh, as the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> declareth. But it is unpessible that the active obedience
of Christ, or the imputation of it, should be any proper effect of condemning sin in
the flesh, that is of the abolishing or taking away the guilt, or the accusing and
condemning power of sin; for when the guilt of sin is purged away, there needeth
no other Righteousness, nor Imputation of Righteousness for justification. Ans.</hi>
(1.) Christ's obedience &amp; Suffering need not be distinguished, both being
done in His state of humiliation, and belonging-thereto, &amp; both being
necessary to answere the demand of the Law, which we did lye under:
Christ performed both, to the end the whole <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>jus</hi> &amp; <hi>right</hi> of
the Law might be ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>illed in us, and for us, by this Surety. And before
guilt be purged away, we must have both imputed to us; for justification
by saith must not make the Law void, but rather establish it. (2.) Neither
is this vers 4. to be looked on, as holding forth the end of that, which did
immediatly preceed in the end of vers 3. or of Christ's condemning sin in
the flesh; but rather as a further end of God's sending His Son in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of sinful flesh; or as a comprehensive end of all that was mentioned
before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:104357:46"/>
3. He saith. <hi>That clause</hi> in them <hi>still notes either a subjective inhesion of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
things in persons, or else some kind of Efficiency. But the Righteousness of
Christ is Subjectively and inherently in Himself only; nor are we the workers of
this righteousness. Ans.</hi> Though the Righteousness of Christ be subjected in
Him only, &amp; wrought by Him alone: yet the same being imputed unto
Beleevers, the Righteousness of the Law may be said to be fulfilled in them
because by faith they are in Christ, &amp; Christ is in them: and <hi>in them,</hi> is
as much, as <hi>for them,</hi> or <hi>upon them,</hi> or <hi>on their account</hi> (as this same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
hereafter granteth, in a like case) &amp; so it is accepted of God for all ends,
as if it were performed by them; &amp; so it is fulfilled in our nature, for for
this end, He came in the likeness of sinful flesh.</p>
               <p>3. He saith. <hi>If by</hi> Righteousness of the Law <hi>we understand that entire obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
which every beleever, according to the great variety of their several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
callings, &amp; relations stand bound to performe, it cannot be said to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in them, by the imputation of Christ's righteousness: for every beleever is
bound to many moe particular acts, than can be found in all that golden Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
of</hi> works of Righteousness <hi>performed by Christ. Ans.</hi> If the works of
Righteousness, performed by Christ, shall not be a compleat Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that can Satisfie the demandes of the Law, where shall beleevers get
a compleet Righteousness? Shall their poor imperfect obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
themselves are not satisfied, but complaine much of, and mourne
for, be a more perfect &amp; compleat fulfilling of the Righteousness of the
Law, than was the perfect obedience of Christ, with which the Father
was well pleased? Or shall the single &amp; weak act of their Faith (as this
Author saith) be a more entire fulfilling of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Law, than
the Catalogue of the works of Righteousness, performed by Christ? What
probable ground is there for this imagination? (2.) Christ's obedience was
perfect, &amp; the Law-giver was satisfied there with, &amp; accepted of it, in the
behalfe of all the chosen ones, &amp; all their defects &amp; sinnes, in their vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conditions, callings &amp; Relations, were done away by the Satisfaction
made by Christ: so that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Law was perfectly fulfilled, in
their behalf; &amp; this being imputed unto them &amp; received by faith, no
more is requisite unto a stateing of them into a state of pardon &amp; right
to glory.</p>
               <p>5. He saith. <hi>The word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifieth not obedience to or conformity with
the Law, but rather that</hi> justification, <hi>which was the end and intent of the Law,
or rather that</hi> jus, <hi>or</hi> right, <hi>or</hi> Law (<hi>as it were) of the Law. Ans.</hi> But all
this will not weaken our Argument: for that <hi>right, jus,</hi> or <hi>demand</hi> of the
Law was, as to us now sinners, both Satisfaction for transgressions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and full and compleat obedience; &amp; till both were done &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
there could be no justification of sinners: and so this rather
establisheth than hurteth the doctrine of Imputation, whatever he may
imagine.</p>
               <p>6. He saith By <hi>the word</hi> Law, <hi>cannot necessarily be understood the Moral Law
for 1. The weakness of the Law extends also to the judicial and Ceremonial. 2. The
jewes, to whom he specially addresseth himself, in all this disputati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104357:46"/>
much on the observation of the Ceremonial Law. 3. The Moral Law, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
observed, could not have justified all men, at least, not the jewes, who we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
obliged to the observation of other Lawes. 4. The Imputation of the observation
of the Moral Law would not have served for the justification of the jewes, who
were under the transgression of, other Lawes. Ans.</hi> It wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> satisfie us, if by the
<hi>Law</hi> here be understood, that universal Rule of Righteousness, which God
prescribed unto men, &amp; that certainely is the Moral Law, whereof, as
to the jewes, the Ceremonial &amp; judicial were a part, or were reduced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
&amp; particularly the Ceremonial Law, being God's instituted worship,
they were obliged to observe it by vertue of the <hi>Second</hi> command. And thus
both the Exception, &amp; all the Reasons confirming it, evanish: for (1.) we
take not the <hi>Law</hi> here so narrowly, as to exclude the other lawes, which
God gave to the jewes, seing they are all reduced there unto, &amp; comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thereunder. (2.) <hi>Paul</hi> is here mainly writting for Information of the
Gentiles, the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> &amp; though there might be some jewes among
them, &amp; what he saith may be also for their use: yet this will not prove
that by the <hi>Law,</hi> he understandeth any other, than that perfect rule of
Righteousness, which God gave unto them, comprehending these other
Lawes, as appendices thereof. (3.) The Moral Law, thus taken, if ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
could have justified even jewes, if we suppose they had not been
born sinners. (4.) Christ having fulfilled all Righteousness, His Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was an observation of this Universal Law: &amp; therefore the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof can serve for the justification both of jewes &amp; Gentiles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly</hi> He saith. <hi>The clear meaning of the place seemeth to be this, That that
justification, or way of making men Righteous, which the writings of Moses pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phefied
of long since, to wit, by faith in the Messiah, might be accomplished,
made good, and fully manifested in us, or upon us, viz in our justification, who
by an eminency of holiness in our lives, above the straine and pitch of men under
the Law, give testimony unto the world, that the Messiah, the great justifier, is
indeed come into the world, and having suffered for sin and overcome death, hath
poured out the Spirit of Grace aboundantly upon those that beleeve. Ans.</hi> (1.) To

fulfilling thereof, as is here done, is to exclude the witnessing of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
which <hi>Paul</hi> expresly mentioneth <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 21. (2.) What could this
contribute to prove, that there was now no condemnation to such, as were
in Christ Jesus, among the Gentiles? (3.) How can this be a proof of what
was said vers 3. foregoing? (4.) How can this be the end of Christ's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
sin in the flesh, as himself said it was, <hi>Except</hi> 2? (5.) He told us
before, that <gap reason="foreign">

meant by the weakness of <hi>Moses's</hi> writtings? or how could they be said to
be <hi>weak through the flesh?</hi> (7.) And how could God be said, by this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
to send His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, because <hi>Moses's</hi>

the same that <hi>upon us</hi> importeth, though it was excepted against formerly,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104357:47"/>
as we heard (9.) It seemeth by this Interpretation, that there was no Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
of holiness or walking after the Spirit, among those, who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law; which is utterly false<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (10.) Christ, by His coming, did not
only fulfill <hi>Moses's</hi> writtings, but also all the predictions &amp; prophecies,
many of which are else where to be found, than in <hi>Moses's</hi> writtings. Yet
to fortifie this Audacious &amp; groundless Interpretation.</p>
               <p>He tels us 1. <hi>That this Interpretation (as far at least, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in question,</hi> that the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us)
<hi>is confirmed by the sweet proportion between, such a fulfilling &amp;c. as the effect,
&amp; that sending of Christ &amp;c. as the cause or meanes thereof. Ans.</hi> But before this
proportion appear to be so sweet, it must be shown to us, what proportion
there is hereby kept with the manifest scope of the Apostle, which is to
cleare &amp; explaine, how there is now no condemnation to them, which
are in Christ Jesus, notwithstanding of the weakness of the Law, through
the flesh. As also it must be shown to us, what interest these words, <hi>for
what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,</hi> have, or
can have, in this Interpretation: for a proportion, that suiteth not all the
parts of the Text, is but a disproportion, being a plaine perversion of the
true meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>He tels us. 2. <hi>In this Interpretation the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>He tels us. 3. <hi>The Righteousness of the Law here must be the same with that
mentioned. Rom.</hi> 3: 21, 31. <hi>Ans.</hi> The Righteousness of the Law here, is the
Lawes <gap reason="foreign">

Satisfie the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Righteousness of the Law; &amp; so they are not the
same formally, <hi>this</hi> being the obligation, &amp; <hi>that</hi> the payment. It is true,
the Law here &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 31. is the same; &amp; that maketh for us, as appeareth
by our foregoing Vindication of that place.</p>
               <p>He tels us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. <hi>By this Interpretation, this passage is of perfect Sympathy with
those</hi> Rom. 3: 21, 22, 25. <hi>Ans.</hi> This also will make for us, as appeareth by
our foregoing Vindication, where this gloss was rejected: &amp; I wonder,
how he could imagine such a perfect agreement, seing there mention is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Law,</hi> giving countenance to Gospel
Justification: but here by his Interpretation, only the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood:
where then will he make his harmony appear? And what would
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104357:47"/>
he hence inferre? 1. (saith he) <hi>That the righteousness of God, that is, the way
that God holds for justification of men, stands in remission of sins Ans.</hi> Of this we
have hithertill seen neither peer nor peep: pardon of sins hath no affinity
with the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>legis,</hi> the righteousness of the law. 2. Saith he <hi>That
this righteousness or justification of his is witnessed, that is, asserted &amp; vindicated
by the law, that is, the writtings of</hi> Moses. <hi>Ans.</hi> Neither is Righteousness &amp;
justification one &amp; the same thing, as we said above, nor are the writtings
of <hi>Moses</hi> all the law &amp; the prophets. Neither is <hi>witnessed by the law</hi> the same,
with <hi>fulfilling of the law.</hi> 3. Saith he, <hi>That this way was not manifested, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
or fulfilled, that is, fully revealed to the bottom &amp; foundation of it, till the
coming of Christ, &amp; dying for sin. Ans.</hi> What ever truth be in this, there is
no foundation for it here, but in his Imagination; as is manifest from what
is said. And thus this place is vindicated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly.</hi> He mentioneth next, that he may except against, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 31, 32.
But why is not vers 30. mentioned? Is it because the matter is there too
clearly hold forth? The Apostle doth there expresly say, That <hi>the Gentiles,
which followed not after righteousness,</hi> That is, did not pretend to justification by
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r own works; nor once think, by their own works to patch up a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
wherein they might appeare before God, and be absolved) <hi>have
attained to righteousness. even the righteousness which is of faith</hi> (that is, have a
righteousness imputed to them, &amp; they made possessours there of by faith,
laying hold upon it) <hi>But Israel</hi> (as it followeth vers 31.) <hi>who followed after the
law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness,</hi> (That is. Isra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l,
who conceiting their own works, &amp; crying them up, and seeking after Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
justification &amp; life, by the law of righteousness, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
thereunto, &amp; that with all earnestness &amp; eager persecution, have not
attained to that, they were pursueing after) vers 32. <hi>Wherefore? because they
sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law</hi> (that is, They would
not submit to the Gospel-way of justification, through the righteousness of
Christ, laid hold on by faith; but would still be essaying the way of works;
though all they did, was rather a shadow of obedience, or of conformity to
the law, than a true performance of what was commanded.) The <hi>Aethiopick</hi>
Version, though a corrupt Translation, yet hinteth something of the true
sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, saying, <hi>But Israel, following after their law, could not be justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they did not performe compleatly the commands of the law. Wherefore? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the law doth not justifie, but only is by faith, which perfecteth the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof.</hi> And we may further notice here, that what the Apostle,
when speaking of the Jewes, calleth the <hi>law of righteousness,</hi> he called, while
speaking of the Gentiles, simply Righteousness: and what he there called
<hi>the righteousness of faith;</hi> he here, speaking of the jewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> calleth <hi>by faith,</hi> in
opposition to the works of the law. What excepteth <hi>Mr. Goodwine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He saith 1. <hi>That by the</hi> law of righteousness <hi>here cannot be meant the moral law,
or any law: for God had prevented them with the gift of all these, so that they needed not
have soughs after them. Ans.</hi> But <hi>Cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in</hi> thinketh there is an <hi>Hypallage</hi> here,
&amp; the <hi>law of Righteousness</hi> is put for the <hi>Righteousness of the law.</hi> And if we
take the <hi>law of Righteousness</hi> here for the law of that law (as he himself spoke
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104357:48"/>
above) that is that forme of righteousness and holiness, which the law cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for, will not this satisfie? But the matter is plaine, Their fault was,
that they sought after a righteousness, by their owne obedience to the law;
&amp; neglected that righteousness, which the Gentils attained by faith, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Righteousness of Christ, at whom they stumbled, vers 32. 33. And
the Righteousness of God, of which they were wholly ignorant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 3.
This was not a simple endeavour of keeping the law (as he hinteth in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words, where he would preoccupy this objection; and then tell us,
that this study could be no cause of their coming short of righteousness,
as Christians are never further off from justification, by keeping the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God) but a proposeing of that designe of attaining a Righteousness
by their own works, whereby alone they might be justified. And when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
endeavour after holiness, but not from Gospel-principles, nor upon
Gospel-grounds; but to the end they may attaine unto a Righteousness of
their owne, by their works of obedience; they prejudge themselves of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification:
for thus they do not lay hold on Christ, but reject Him, and stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at that stumbling stone, that is at Christ, who is the end of the law for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
to every one that beleeveth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 4.</p>
               <p>2. He faith, <hi>neither</hi> Calvine, <hi>nor any other restaine the law to the Moral law.
Ans.</hi> Nor do we so restraine it to that law, strikly so taken; but compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
thereby all that God prescribed for a righteousness; and this is the
Moral law, in its full sense; the ceremonial &amp; judicial being parts thereof &amp;
appendices thereto.</p>
               <p>3. He saith, <hi>There is no reason to limite this to the Moral law only, for the
jewes sought righteousness by the Ceremonial also. Ans.</hi> This is but the same
with the former; and we have told him, that the Ceremonial law was then
enjoined by the Moral law; &amp; so the Moral law did comprehend it, so long
as the Ceremonial law was unrepealed. And whatever law it was, their
seeking of righteousness by it, and their refusing of Christ and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
went together; and they so pursued after it, that they sought
Righteousness by their obedience to it; and did not seek by faith after Christs
Righteousness, nor would they submit thereunto.</p>
               <p>4. He saith, <hi>The righteousness of the Moral law alone, suppose they should have
attained to it by beleeving, could have stood them in no stead, they being bound also
to the observation of the Ceremonial law. Ans.</hi> This hath been answered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Christ fulfilled all righteousness, and satisfied that law of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which was an Universal Rule of righteousness; &amp; so comprehended
the ceremonial lawes, so long as they were in force: so that if they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
their own righteousness, and embraced by faith the righteousness of
Christ, they had been certainely saved; &amp; the Imputation of this Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
had made them up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> he saith, <hi>The clear sense is, that the</hi> law of righteousness <hi>is</hi> justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>it self, or</hi> righteousness <hi>simply and, indefinitely taken, which the jewes see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to attaine to by the works of the law, that is, by themselves, &amp; the merites of
their own doings, and not by faith in Iesus Christs, lost Gods favour and perished
in their sinnes. Ans.</hi> (1) That the jewes sought after justification by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
of their own works, otherwise than merites are included in all works,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104357:48"/>
is not manifest, in this place. (2) Otherwayes this may passe for part of the
sense, for by faith he understands the act of faith it self, as our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
&amp; not the Righteousness of Christ, which faith laith hold on, or faith
as laying hold on &amp; receiving a Surety-righteousness, which is here imported,
when the contrary is expressed of the jewes, &amp; of them it is said, that <hi>they
stumbled at that stumbling stone;</hi> &amp; in the next <hi>chapter</hi> it is said, <hi>they
would not submit themselves unto the righteousness of God.</hi> What he addeth, as
a confirmation of this interpretation, is to no purpose, for he speaketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to cleare the maine thing in doubt; but all is to prove, that by the law of
righteousness, Righteousness is meaned; which is not denied: &amp; withall
he taketh for granted, what is not proved, &amp; hath been denied, <hi>viz.</hi> That
Righteousness and Justification are one &amp; the same thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly, Rom.</hi> 10: 3, 4. A passage cleat &amp; pregnant for our purpose,
where the Apostle is but prosecuting the same purpose, as to the jewes, and
shewing whence their disappointement &amp; missing of that came, which they
so earnestly endeavoured after, <hi>viz.</hi> A righteousnss by which they might
be justified before God: <hi>for</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>they being ignorant of Gods Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted
themselves unto the Righteousness of God: for Christ is the end of the law for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to every one that beleeveth.</hi> There is a Righteousness here called <hi>Gods Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi>
which is opposite to, &amp; inconsistent with mens owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that is, all that is done by them in conformity to the law of God, as
a righteousness, whereupon to be justified: yea, so great is this opposition,
that who ever laboures most to establish &amp; set on foot his own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or to seek after a Righteousness by his own performances, is furthest
from the Righteousness of God, as being both ignorant thereof, and in
pride refuising to submit thereunto. This Righteousness of God is explained
vers 4. to be the end of the law, that is, the full righteousness, which the
law, in its primitive institution, called for, &amp; which is the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the lawes designe, as proposed to be a Rule of Righteousness, and
the condition of life promised, upon the performance thereof. And <hi>Christ
is said to be this end of the law for righteousness.</hi> He, by yeelding perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
hath brought forth a righteousness, in which the law hath its End,
And Christ is this, <hi>to every one that beleeveth,</hi> the righteousness being
made over unto them, who beleeve, and by faith lay hold on him;
which, because the Gentiles did, they therefore attained to this righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Goodwine,</hi> pag. 137. &amp;c. excepteth several wayes, 1 <hi>There is</hi> (saith
he) <hi>no coloure of Reason, that by the</hi> law <hi>here should be meaned precisely &amp; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatly
the Moral law; because the jewes never dreamed of justification by this law
only, but chiefly by the Ceremonial law. Besides, vers 5. he citeth that description,
which Moses giveth of the righteousness of the law not out of any passage of the Moral
law; but out of the heart, as is were of the ceremonial law, Lev.</hi> 18: 5. <hi>Ans.</hi> The
<hi>first</hi> part of this Exception hath been often answered: we take not the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
law so precisely &amp; determinatly, as not to include, as parts or appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
all other lawes given by God. And the <hi>last</hi> part of this Exception
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104357:49"/>
will say nothing, unless he think, this law is precisely &amp; determinatly to be
understood of the Ceremonial law, excluding all others, &amp; especially the
Moral law, taken as distinct from judicial and ceremonial. But why doth
he say, that this description of the righteousness of the law is taken out of
the heart of Ceremonials, seing in the place cited, both before and after the
words, morals are mentioned? yea that whole <hi>Chapt.</hi> is taken up, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsing
morals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except 2. Neiter is it any wayes agreable to truth, that the Righteousness of
Christ imputed to beleevers, should be called; the end of the moral Law, for no
Law, considered simply as such, is any cause or meanes of justifing a person, than
by the observation of it self; &amp; consequently justification by Christ cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be the end of the moral Law: for nothing can properly be said to be the
intent or end of a thing, but that which in likelyhood may be obtained by it. Now
it is impossible that justification by Christ should be procured by the moral Law. It
may be said, with a for more favourable aspect to truth, that Christ is the end of
the Ceremonial Law; yet not simply considered, as a Law, but as comprehending
in it such &amp; such usages &amp; rites typifying Christ. Ans.</hi> (1.) This whole Exception
looketh with a very ill favoured aspect both to truth &amp; modesty: For its
scope &amp; drift is not so much against the truth which we maintaine, as
against the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> himself, &amp; against the language of the Spirit of
Lord; for it faith this in effect; that either the Apostle spoke not truth, or
spoke not good sense, when he said, that <hi>Christ was the end of the Law:</hi> for
(to use <hi>Mr. Goodwin's</hi> reason) as nothing can be properly said to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
or end of a thing but that which in likelihood may be obtained by it;
so nothing can be said to be the Intent &amp; end of a Law, but what in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
may be obtained by it: But how can any think, that Christ can be,
in any likelihood obtained by the Law? (2.) But we say not, that justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Christ is had by the moral Law: yet, why the righteousness of
Christ, consisting in perfect obedience to the Law, &amp; in full answering of
the same, in all its demands, may not be called the end or fulfulling of the
Law, I see not; especially seing the Apostle saith expresly, that <hi>Christ is
the end of the Law for righteousness.</hi> The question being moved about a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
required by the Law, &amp; this not being to be found in Man's
obedience, but in Christ's, who was the end of the Law for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the Law hath its full accomplissement in him also when He suffered,
&amp; satisfied the Sanction of the Law, the Law had satisfaction, or the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
rather, &amp; the Law its end &amp; accomplishement, Now this Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ being imputed to beleevers, they are thereupon justified, &amp;
the Law is satisfied. And though the Law because it was weak throuw
the flesh, could not bring about this righteousness, &amp; this end, in us;
yet Christ having answered all the demands of the Law, &amp; given full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
both in point of obedience, &amp; in point of Suffering, the Law
hath its full accomplishment in Him, &amp; that End, which is here meaned
(3) We do not say, that the Righteousness of Christ, imputed to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
is, or is called, the end of the moral Law: but that Christ ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
&amp; was made under the Law, that He might answer all the demands
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104357:49"/>
thereof; &amp; both satisfie for its violation, &amp; yeeld perfect obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
its commands; &amp; so fulfill it in all points: So that it had its end &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
in &amp; through Him, &amp; what He did &amp; suffered: &amp; that
He submitted Himself hereunto, that He might make up a righteousness,
wherewith the Law should be satisfied, for the justification of Believers.
(4.) Though the Moral Law, nor no Law, considered in it self, can be any
cause or meanes of justifying a person, otherwise than by the observation
of it self; &amp; though justification by Christ cannot be conceived to be the
end of moral Law: yet in Christ's obedience &amp; Suffering, the Law may be
said to have received its Accomplishment and Satisfaction; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a compleat Righteousness may be said to be obtained for all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except. 3. The Greek Expositors make Christ in this sense, to be called</hi> the end
of the law for righteousness, <hi>because he performed, or exhibited unto them that,
which the law propounded to it self, as its end, &amp; would have performed, but could
not, to wit, their</hi> justification. <hi>Ans.</hi> Seing the law ptopounded their justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as its end, only by the perfect observation of it self, or by a full &amp;
perfect conformity unto it, Christ cannot be called the end or accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the law, unless He had performed all that, which the law required:
nor could He be called the <hi>end of the law for righteousness,</hi> unless He had fully
satisfied the law; and thereby made up a Righteousness, in the behalfe, &amp;
for the behove of Believers, to whom it being Imputed, they might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
&amp; justified upon the account thereof. And this righteousness,
where with the law was satisfied, &amp; wherin it had its full accomplishment,
is, I grant, exhibited in the Gospel, to the end, that all, who would be
justified, may lay hold on it, receive it, &amp; rest upon it, as the only righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
in and through which they desire to be accepted, and to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, the righteous judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except. 4. Some conceive, that Christ is said to be the end of the law, &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the law, by convinceing men of sin, and exacting of them a Righteousness,
which it doth not enable them to performe; &amp; againe by threatning &amp; condemning
them for the want of it, it doth as good as lead them by hand to Christ by whom they
are freely justified. But neither doth this seem to be the meaning of the place. Ans.</hi>
Seing he himself is not satisfied with this interpretation, he might have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
to have added it. But as for the interpretation it self, I judge the
thing said to be true, and that it hath a subordinat aspect unto what we have
said; &amp; holdeth forth part of the truth; though it be not a plaine and full
exposition of the place: for there is mention made here of a <hi>Righteousness of
God,</hi> which the jewes neither understood, not would submit unto: but in
opposition to this they went about to establish their own righteousness, that
is, to seek after a righteousness by their own works, or by their own obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the law; &amp; therefore did misse their end: for this righteousness,
which they were seeking after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; which they could not attaine unto, by
all their own acts of obedience; that is, a righteousness, that was a perfect
obedience &amp; conformity to the law, &amp; withall a Sufficient compensation &amp;
Satisfaction for the breaches of the law, already committed, was only to be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104357:50"/>
found in Christ, who is the end of the law for righteousness, that is, made
full Satisfaction for the breaches committed, and performed compleat and
perfect obedience, which the law did principally require (what ever other
accidental ends it might have had, or the law-giver in promulgating it, &amp;
accompanying it with other things, as to the Nation of the jewes) because
for this end was the law, as a law, given by the law-giver, that Subjects
might walk according to the same, and that they might become thereby
righteous, and have a right to the reward promised, by fulfilling this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Covenant. Now, when these ends (or this end, putting
these together as one) were onely attained by what Christ did and suffered,
the jewes, who stumbled at this stumbling stone, &amp; rejected this righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, could never be justified by all their own acts of obedience to the
law, how zealously so ever they should have sougt after a rigteousness thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except.</hi> 6. (The 5. we passe, because he laith no weight on it him self) <hi>The
plaine &amp; direct meaning is, that the law, that is, the whole Mosaical dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was for that end given by God to the jewes, that whilst it did continue, it might
instruct and teach them, concerning the Messiah, who was yet to come, and by his
death to make atonement for their sinnes, that so they might beleeve in Him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
and be justified: and further that in time, that Nation might be trained up
&amp; prepared for the Messiah himself, and that Oeconomy &amp; perfection of worship &amp;
service, which He should bring with him, &amp; establish in the world at his coming. Ans.</hi>
What was said to the two foregoing Exceptions, may serve for an answere
to this: for what ever truth may be in this; yet it is no true sense &amp; exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the place; because Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to
every one that beleeveth; &amp; so to the Gentiles, as well as to the jewes;
whereas this gloss limiteth &amp; restricketh all to the jewes. (2) There is nothing
here, keeping correspondence with what is said, vers 3. touching their
going about to establish their own righteousness and refuising to submit unto
the righteousness of God. 3. The righteousness of the law, described by
<hi>Moses,</hi> &amp; here cited vers 5. hath no interest in the Mosaical Oeconomy, as
given for the mentioned end to the jewes. (4) If Christ made an atonement
for sins, &amp; was to be bele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ved in accordingly, by such as would be justified,
then that atonement was to be made over unto them &amp; reckoned upon their
score, to the end they might be justified upon the account thereof. (5) The
Text saith, that Christ was the <hi>end of the law for righteousness;</hi> &amp; so was to
bring in everlasting Righteousness, as well as to make atonement for sins,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 9: 24. (6) The perfection of that service &amp; worship, which Christ was
to establish at His coming, was a clearer manifestation of the Gospel of the
Grace of God, whereby the Righteousness of God, or the Surety-righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, was imputed unto Beleevers, &amp; received by faith, in order to
justification, as the whole Gospel declareth.</p>
               <p>He laboureth to confirme this gloss with two reasons, 1. <hi>Because the jewes
sought</hi> Righteousness <hi>&amp;</hi> self justification, <hi>as well from the observation of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial,
as of the Moral law. 2. Because Christ is held forth; as the end of this
dispensation, 2 Cor. 3: 13. Gal. 3: 24. Ans.</hi> As to the <hi>first</hi> of the reasons, we
have often replied to it already. And the second will not prove, that there is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104357:50"/>
no other interpretation of this passage, that can have place. And beside,
That whole Oeconomy did pointe out and lead them to the Messiah, that
in Him they might find that, which they were seeking after by their own
works, &amp; all in vaine; even the Righteousness of God, which will suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
cloth all beleevers, and both keep them from wrath due for sin, &amp;
give them a right to glory. So that even this sense, if rightly understood,
doth rather strengthen than hurt imputed Righteousness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly. 1 Cor.</hi> 1: 30. Is excepted against by him <hi>pag.</hi> 162. &amp;c. To which
we may adde vers 29. &amp; 31. Which will help to cleare the matter. <hi>That
no flesh should glory in His presence: but of Him are ye in Christ Iesus, who of God
is made unto us Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification &amp; Redemption. That
according at it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</hi> All the work
of God in and about His chosen ones, is so contrived, that no flesh should
have ground to glory in the presence of God; but that he, who glorieth,
should glory in the Lord: and therefore He hath made Christ to be all things
to them, that they stand in need of, in order to their everlasting enjoyment
of Himself; and particulary, Christ is said to be made of God to us (among
other things, which our necessity calleth for) <hi>Righteousness,</hi> answering His
Name the LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23: 6. And a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
he cannot be made unto us, any other way, than by clothing us
(who are naked and have no righteousness of our own) with a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
that is, by Imputing to us His Righteousness, that we may thereby
become Righteous, &amp; be looked upon, as such, and so be accepted of God,
&amp; justified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except. 1. Christ is no other way said to be made righteousness, then He is said
to be made Wisdom, &amp;c. Therefore we may as well plead for the Imputation of His
Wisdom, or His Sanctification: there is no more intimation made of the Imputation
of the one then of the other. Ans.</hi> This is but the old exception of <hi>Socinus part.</hi> 4.
<hi>de Servant, Cap.</hi> 5. And of <hi>Volkel. De vera Relig. Cap. 21. p.</hi> 566. And it standeth
upon this onely ground, That Christ is made all these particulars to us here
mentioned, after one &amp; the same manner: and what that manner is, should
be declared: &amp; of necessity it must be a very general one, otherwise it shall
not agree to all these particulars. Therefore <hi>Socinus</hi> hath devised a very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
manner of way, saying in the place cited: <hi>That all this signifieth
nothing else, than that we have attained to that by Gods providence, through Christ,
that we are become wise, holy &amp; redeemed before Gods:</hi> &amp; that therefore <hi>Christ is
said to be righteousness to us, because through the providence of God by Christ, we have
attained to be just before God.</hi> But this general way maketh us not one white
wiser. <hi>Volkelius,</hi> in the place cited, giveth us no relief, but only tels us,
<hi>That Christ is said to be made all these to us; because he was the cause of all these;
&amp; because God, by his meanes, made us wise &amp; holy, &amp; will at length redeem us.
Bellarm.</hi> condescendeth to tell us, that <hi>He is said to be our Righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eousness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
He is the efficient cause thereof.</hi> But how that is, he doth not explaine:
But <hi>Bellarm.</hi> next answere is to some better purpose; <hi>Christ</hi> (saith he) <hi>is said
to be our Righteousness because He satisfied the Father for us; and doth so give and
communicat that Satisfaction to us, when he justifieth us, that it may be called
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104357:51"/>
our Satisfaction &amp; Righteousness.</hi> (2) Such as oppose us here, do (&amp; must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
so do) speak of this matter, as if Righteousness &amp; Sanctification
were one &amp; the same thing; &amp; so give us here a most needless Tautologie.
And others, who will not yeeld to imputed Righteousness, &amp; yet will grant
a difference betwixt Righteousness &amp; Sanctification, must tell us distinctly,
how He is the one, &amp; how He is the other, to His chosen ones. (3.) Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
&amp; Sanctification are of a different Nature from Righteousness; for
Righteousness cannot be here taken for Inherent Grace &amp; Holiness; for then
it should be the same with Sanctification, &amp; so there must needs be here a
Tautology; &amp; withall no perfect enumeration of the several great things,
we stand in need of, &amp; Christ is made to be unto us of God: &amp; seing they
are different, there is ground to say, that He is not to us Righteousness, the
same way that He is Sanctification; Sanctification is wrought in us by His
Spirit; but so is not Righteousness; for if we had a Righteousnes wrought
in us, we should be justified by vertue thereof, &amp; upon the account thereof;
&amp; if we be justified by a Righteousness within us, we are justified by our
own works, &amp; by the law, contrary to all the Apostles disput, &amp; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to what preceedeth &amp; followeth the words under consideration; for then
he who glorieth might glory in himself, &amp; not in the Lord alone. 4. Al
these particulars here mentioned, we must have or finde in Christ, as the
<hi>Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>opik</hi> version hath it, &amp; each, according to its Nature. And withall
we must be made partakers &amp; pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>essors of them all, according as the Nature
of the benefite will admit: &amp; therefore, as Christ is forthcoming to His
chosen ones, for Wisdom, so as they may really become wise; for Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
that they may become holy; &amp; for Redemption, that they may
be redeemed: so is He forthcoming to His own for Righteousness, that they
may be justified; for though Righteousness &amp; justified be not one &amp; the
same, as our Excepter often alleigeth; yet they have constant respect to other,
and are inseparable, in our case. If then we finde a Righteousness in
Christ, for justification, that Righteousness must be made ours, &amp; this being a
Righteousness, that is not our own, before it be made our own, it must be
imputed to us, that we may be there by justified.</p>
               <p>He addeth, <hi>Suppose, Christ were made Righteousness unto us by Imputation:
yet this special manner of his being righteousness to us, must be made out by
other Scriptures, than this: as because a rich man hath silver &amp; gold &amp; jewels
in possession, it will not follow, that he hath silver in one chest, and gold in
another, jewels in a third. Ans.</hi> Christs being made Righteousness to us,
who have no Righteousness of our own, in order to our justification,
saith, that the Righteousness, we have from Him, can be no otherwayes
ours than by Imputation, for it cannot be wrought in us, else it should be
the same with Holiness &amp; Sanctification. And therefore the similitude of
gold, silver &amp; jewels is not worth a straw, in this case; because the dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
is obvious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except. 2. The meaning only is this, That Christ is made, ordained of God,
to be the author, or sole meanes, by way of merite of our justification. Ans.</hi> (1) Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his former exception, it will follow hence, that He worketh
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104357:51"/>
not Holiness &amp; Wisdom in us, by His Word and Spirit; but only is the
meanes thereof, by way of merite: for he will have Christ to be all these
particulars to us, one &amp; the same way. (2) This differeth little from the
answere of <hi>Schlightingius cont. Meisnerum,</hi> p. 250. who saith, <hi>It is enough
that Christs righteousness be the cause of our justification: &amp; Christ may be said
to be made righteousness to us, because his righteousness redoundeth to our good and
justification.</hi> (3) It is not said, that Christ is <hi>made justification to us;</hi> but it is
said, <hi>He is made Righteousness to us,</hi> &amp; though it is true, that He hath me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
our justification; yet when He is said to be made of God Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to us, it is apparent, that He bestoweth a Righteousness upon us, in
order to justification, or He must be Righteousness to us, ere we be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
&amp; how shall we partake of His Righteousness, if not by Imputation?
(4) Christ can not be the Author, or sole meanes, by way of merite, of
our justification, till we have a Righteousness; that is, He must be the sole
Author &amp; Meanes of a Righteousness; for we must not say, That He hath
merited, that we shall be justified without a Righteousness, it being an
abomination to the Lord, that even a terrene judge should justifie one, that
hath no Righteousness. If then He hath merited, that we shall be justified
by having a Righteousness, that Righteousness must be within us, or without
us: if <hi>within us,</hi> then He hath merited, that we shall be justified by the
works of righteousness, which we do, &amp; by the law, &amp; by the works of
the law, contrary to the whole Gospel: If <hi>without us,</hi> then it must either
be Christs own Righteousness, or the Righteousness of some other. It
cannot be the Righteousness of <hi>any other,</hi> as will easily be granted: and
if it be Christs Righteousness, it must be imputed to us, to the end
it may be ours, and we justified thereby: and this is the thing we press.</p>
               <p>He addeth, to confirme this sense, That <hi>Righteousness is very frequently
used for justification. Ans.</hi> Thus he gaineth nothing: for. (1) That will not
prove, that it is so used here. (2) And though it did Import justification
here; yet seing there is no justification before God, without a Righteousness,
it would say, That Christ were our Righteousness too, or that He merited a
Righteousness for us: and what is that Righteousness, that He hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
that we shall have, in order to our justification? Is it the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our own works? Then He hath merited, that our works shall merite
justification; &amp; why not also glorification? Is not this to overturne th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christ, is still attributed unto His death &amp; Sufferings, &amp; never to His active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.

also what is said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 19. <hi>So by the obedience of one, shall many be made

we have oft-times heard.</p>

                  <hi>Except. 3. This will not say, That Christs active obedience only is imputed; or
that he only, by his active obedience, is made righteousness to us. Ans.</hi> I plead

not for the sole Imputation of Christs active obedience, but for the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

and further explication of what was said, vers 18, 19. Concerning
the reconciliation of a sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ul world unto God, in &amp; through Christ, and of
Gods imputing their Trespasses unto them. As if he had said, all our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
&amp; all the way how it is brought about, is of God, who, in and
through Christ, reconcileth the sinfull world of His own chosen ones to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and Pardoneth their sinnes, by laying them all on Christ, &amp; making
Him bear the guilt and punishment of all; that the chosen ones might
be made partakers of that Righteousness, and have it imputed unto them,
as their sinnes were imputed unto Christ; and so become the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God in Him, or by being in Him, and united to Him. This place is
pregnant and full of proof: so that the whole matter cannot be more clearly
&amp; emphatically expressed, than it is here hold forth. Yet <hi>Mr. Goodwine</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth
to darken it with his Exceptions, <hi>pag.</hi> 164. &amp;c. let us hear him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except. 1. Here is nothing said, touching any</hi> Imputation <hi>of our sins to Christ:
&amp; consequently here can be nothing to build a reciprocal Imputation of His</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
<hi>unto us upon. Ans.</hi> If that Expression of Gods <hi>making Christ to be sin
who knew no sin,</hi> &amp; that for us, will not enforce an imputation of our sinnes
to Christ, it must be so only with such, as will hold fast their opinion, let
Scripture speak what it will to the contrary: for when it is said, that Christ,
<hi>who knew no sin,</hi> i. e. was guilty of no sin, by committing of it, in thought,
word or deed; was yet <hi>made sin</hi> by God, &amp; that <hi>for us,</hi> what words can be
imagined, that shall more emphatically express this Imputation? And the
Greek commentators (whom our adversary doth oft cite, when he findeth it
any thing to his advantage) give the meaning to be, That <hi>he was made a
great sinner, &amp; was handled, as if he had been the worst of sinners, even very
wickedness it self.</hi> And <hi>Esaias</hi> tels us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 53: 6. <hi>That the Lord laid all our
iniquities on Him,</hi> or caused them to meet in one upon Him. And nothing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104357:52"/>
can be alleiged against this, except it be said, the meaning is, <hi>He was made
an offering or Sacrifice for sin.</hi> But this is so far from weakening the truth,
concerning the Imputation of our sinnes to Christ, that it aboundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
it: for there was a real imputation of the guilt of the sinner upon the
Sacrifie, as is expresly said, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16: 21, 22. <hi>And Aaron shall lay both his
hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all this iniquities of the
Children of Israel, &amp; all their trespasses in all their sinnes, putting them upon the
head of goat, and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not
inhabited.</hi>
And the people were to lay their hands on the head of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
to signifie their rolling of their guilt over upon the expiatory Sacrifie,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 1: 4. &amp; 3: 2, 8, 13. &amp; 4: 4, 15, 24, 29, 33. So that if Christ was made
sin, that is, a Sacrifice for sin (though the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is no where in the
New Test. so taken) it must needs be granted, that guilt was transferred
upon Him, in order to His becoming a Sacrifice for sin: justice could not
exact upon Him, if it had not been so, He having been free of all sin and guilt,
in His own person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except. 2. Some of the most judicious &amp; learned assistants of the way of this</hi>
Imputation, <hi>absolutely reject this equality or reciprocation of</hi> Imputation <hi>between
the sinnes of beleevers unto</hi> Christ, <hi>and the</hi> Righteousness <hi>of Christ unto</hi> them.
<hi>There is not the same force and power of our</hi> unrighteousness <hi>to make Christ</hi> unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;
<hi>which is of His</hi> Righteousness <hi>to make beleevers</hi> righteous. <hi>Therefore
we are not made formally righteous by such an</hi> Imputation. <hi>Ans.</hi> We willingly
grant several differences, beside what is mentioned: yet this agreement &amp;
correspondency (which is all we seek) is manifest, That, as Christ, who
knew no sin, as to Himself, was made sin, or had the guilt of sin laid upon
Him, and was handled by justice as a sinner legally; so we, who have no
righteousness of our owne, have Christs Righteousness imputed to us, and
bestowed upon us; and upon the account thereof are dealt with as legally
righteous. We do not speak of Christs obedience only; but assert the
Imputation of His Sufferings too. Nor do we say, that we are hereby
made formally Righteous, if the terme <hi>formally</hi> import inherently; but
that by the Imputation thereof to us, we are accounted &amp; looked upon by
God as Righteous formally in a legal sense; and as such are accepted of God
&amp; justified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except. 3. There is not so much, as the face or appearance, in this place of any
comparison between</hi> Christs being made sin for us, &amp; our being made the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of God, in Him; <hi>but only the latter is affirmed, as the end, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
or effect of the former. Ans.</hi> Though the latter be a consequent of the
former; yet every word holdeth forth a comparison, or correspondence;
Christ made sin, &amp; we become Righteous: Christ made sin, or a sinner for
us, and we made Righteousness, or Righteous in Him: Christ knew no
sin, and yet was made sin; &amp; we, who were sinners land rebels, standing
in need of reconciliation (as the preceeding words evidence, &amp; as is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable)
are made Righteous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except. 4. That the weight of that particle,</hi> in Him, <hi>should be by the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of His active obedience unto us, hath neither Instance or parellel expression
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104357:53"/>
in Scripture, nor rule in Grammar, nor figure in Rhetorick, to make probable in
the lowest or lightest degree. Ans.</hi> We plead not solely for the Imputation of
Christs active obedience, as is said; but for the Imputation of His whole
Surety-righteousness. And though these words <hi>in Him,</hi> that denote Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Union with Him, as the ground of their Interest in His Righteousness,
should not be asserted, to Import this Imputation: yet this words, <hi>that we
might be made the Righteousness of God,</hi> will be a rock, whereupon <hi>Imputation</hi>
may stand: for they hold this forth unto us, That as God made Christ sin
by Imputation; so He maketh us righteous, yea the Righteousness of God,
by Imputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except. 5. The clear meaning is this, that God for that end made</hi> Christ sin,
<hi>that is, an offering or Sacrifice for sin,</hi> for us, <hi>that we might be</hi> made the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of God in Him, <hi>that is, that we might be justified, or made a Society
or Remnant of Righteous ones, after that peculiar manner of</hi> justification, <hi>which
God hath established, through that Sacrifice of His Son. Ans.</hi> When Christ
was made an offering for sin, the guilt of sin was laid upon Him, even
the guilt of our sin. And if we be justified, or made a Society of justified
ones, we must be made a Society of righteous ones: and if we be made a
Society of Righteous ones, we must first have a Righteousness; seing we
have not a Righteousness of our own, we must have a Righteousness made
over to us: and seing we have this Righteousness made over to us, as being in
Christ, it must be the Righteousness of God. So that though this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
be very far fetched, and hath no countenance from the words,
and destroyeth the cohesion of these words with the former, as also the
reason, that is contained in them, adduced for confirmation of what
was said, vers 19. yet it cannot destroy the doctrine of <hi>Imputation;</hi> but
must contribute to its support, though a little more remotely.</p>
               <p>He laboureth to give strength to this his Interpretation by alleiging.
1. <hi>That it is a frequent Scripture expression, to call the sin-offering, or the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for sin, by the name of</hi> sin  <hi>simply,</hi>as <hi>Exod.</hi> 29: 14. and 30: 10. <hi>Levit.</hi> 5:
6, 16, 18, 19, &amp; 7: 1, 2, 7 &amp; 9: 7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44: 27. &amp; 45: 19. 23. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4: 8. <hi>Ans.</hi>
Though it be true, that the Hebrew words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
signify <hi>sin,</hi> &amp; sometimes, <hi>an offering for sin:</hi> yet the Greek word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth alwayes signify <hi>sin</hi> in the <hi>New Test.</hi> and the 70 do not use this
Greek word in the places cited, except <hi>Exod.</hi> 29: 14. &amp; there, in the version
that is in the <hi>Biblia Polyglot, Lond.</hi> It is in the Genitive case <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>of sin:</hi>
&amp; the <hi>chald-paraph</hi> calleth it <hi>an Expiation Targ. Ionath. &amp; Hierof.</hi> say, it <hi>is a
sin,</hi> &amp; so doth the <hi>persik</hi> version: &amp; the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Version turneth it, <hi>that
is for sin;</hi> &amp; the <hi>Arabik,</hi> an <hi>Expiation.</hi> But further, though it were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be so taken here; yet our cause would hereby suffer no prejudice; but
be rather confirmed, as was lately shown. And when the same word used
to express <hi>a Sacrifice for sin,</hi> which signifieth sin it self, we may hence be
confirmed in this, that that Sacrifice for sin hath guilt laid upon it, before it
can be Sacrifice for sin; &amp; it must be sin, in respect of this, before it be a
due Sacrifice, or oblation for sin. And therefore Christ must have been sin,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104357:53"/>
in law, by Imputation, or have the guilt of sin laid upon Him, before He
could be a fit Sacrifice for sin.</p>
               <p>He alleigeth. 2. <hi>To express a Number of justified or righteous persons by the
abstract terme of</hi> Righteousness, <hi>is very agreable to the Scripture dialect, in other
places, as</hi> poverty <hi>for poor,</hi> captivity <hi>for captives. Ans.</hi> (1) Yet no one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
can be given, where the word <hi>Righteousness</hi> hath this Import. (2) But
how ever, as was said, these justified, or righteous persons, must be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
else they cannot make up such a company; as <hi>captivity</hi> can never sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
a company of men, that are not captives; nor <hi>poverty</hi> a company of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that are not poor. So that this company of righteous ones must needs
be righteous, and that in order to justification: &amp; seing they have no Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of their own, for in themselves they are ungodly, they must
have a Righteousness by Imputation. (3) Why should they be called the
<hi>Righteousness of God,</hi> according to this Interpretation? And how is the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
here observed, betwixt <hi>Christs being made sin, &amp; their being made the
Righteousness of God in Him?</hi> But this man, by this Interpretation, transgresseth
all lines of Correspondence.</p>
               <p>He alleigeth 3. <hi>That addition</hi> of God <hi>imports, that that righteousness or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
which beleevers obtaine by the Sacrifice of Christ, is not only Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Gods free donation, but of His special procurement and contrivement for them.
Ans.</hi> (1) Righteousness and justification are not one &amp; the same, how oft
so ever he name them as Synonymous. (2) We grant, that the <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
&amp; the <hi>Iustification,</hi> which Beleevers obtaine, are both Gods free gift
&amp; His contrivement: But notwithstanding hereof, yea so much the rather,
is there a Righteousness imputed to them, &amp; the Righteousness of Christ,
who is God, and a Righteousness, which will be accepted of God, whose
judgment is according to truth, as a sufficient ground, whereupon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
such, as in themselves are ungodly, to be Righteous, &amp; so to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
them.</p>
               <p>He alleigeth 4. <hi>That by the grammatical construction &amp; dependance of the
latter clause,</hi> our being made the Righteousness of God in Christ, <hi>upon the
former, it is evident, that in the latter such an Effect must of necessity be signified,
which may answere that cause, to wit, the death of Christ for us; &amp; this is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from the guilt &amp; punishment of sin, not the Imputation of His active obedience.
Ans.</hi> As Christs death could not be separated from His Obedience, which
is thereby presupposed. His death being the Sacrifice of one, who is
made under the law, and was obedient thereunto unto death, &amp; that in
the room &amp; stead of His own; So the Imputation of Righteousness to us
should not be separated from the Imputation of His Sufferings, both being
necessarily required unto sinners, who had sinned, &amp; yet remained under
the obligation of the law, in order to their acceptance with God, and Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>He alleigeth 5. <hi>The Scriptures, when they speak of the Sufferings of Christ,
as a cause, inrespect of justification, never ascribe any other effect unto them, but
only, either the</hi> Remission of sins, deliverance from wrath, Redemption,
<hi>or the like. Ans.</hi> As the Scriptures making so frequent mention of the Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104357:54"/>
of Christ, do not exclude His Obedience; so neither do they exclude
the Imputation of His Obedience, in order to our justification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
a Right to glory: yea they make our being constitute Righteous, an
Effect of His Obedience; &amp; Righteousness or Righteous-making is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with Justification. So that though the Scriptures speak sometimes
more expresly of the Sufferings, &amp; sometimes more expresly of the obedience
of Christ, according to the exigence of the cause handled; yet both are inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable,
as a cause; &amp; so is our Righteousness &amp; Justification inseparable, as
the full Effect.</p>

in order to their Justification. These we shall not insist upon,
but only mentione in short; seing the full insisting upon them will not be
necessary, after what is said, in the Explication &amp; Vindication of foregoing
passages.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: 17. <hi>For therein is the Righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith,
as it is written, the just shall live by faith.</hi> The Apostle is here giving a reason,
proving the Gospel, whereof he was not ashamed to be a preacher of, to
be the power of God unto Salvation, &amp; that to every one that beleeveth, be
he jew, or be he Gentile; <hi>viz.</hi> Because there is <hi>a Righteousness</hi> revealed
therein, which sinners only stand in need of; &amp; that <hi>Righteousness of God;</hi>
that is, not only a Righteousness, which is devised by God, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
in His sight; but an excellent Righteousness, even the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of one, who is God; and a Righteousness revealed for faith to lay hold on
&amp; receive, &amp; that which faith leaneth to first and last, when it is weakest, and
when it is strongest; that thereby the poor sinner, who formerly was dead
by law, may live, as one reconciled to God. So that hence we see, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
have need of a Righteousness; and this Righteousness is the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of God, &amp; is revealed in the Gospel, that it may be received by
faith, and so Imputed &amp; made over to the poor sinner, in order to his Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and acceptance with God.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 11. <hi>And he</hi> (i. e. <hi>Abraham) received the signe of circumcision, a seal
of the Righteousness of the faith, which he had, yet being uncircumcised, that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
might be imputed to them also.</hi> Here is a Righteousness, and a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
called the Righteousness of faith, because received &amp; applied only
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104357:54"/>
by faith; and a Righteousness, whereof circumsion was appointed a seal,
&amp; granted to <hi>Abraham</hi> as such; and a Righteousness, which was imputed
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he might be the Father of all them, that beleeve: for it
is added, <hi>that Righteousness might be Imputed to them also:</hi> And this must be
the same Righteousness, that was Imputed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; the same way
Imputed, &amp; the same way received, that there migt be no essential diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt the way of justification of Father and Children. The <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick</hi>
Version may serve for a commentary, <hi>and he had circumsion, a signe of
his righteousness, which He gave him, and the signe thereof; that this might be
made known unto him, that God justified Abraham by faith, when he was
not at that time circumcised, that they may know, that they also are justified by
faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 24, 25. <hi>But for us also, to whom it shall be Imputed, if we beleeve
on Him, who raised up tesus, our Lord, from the dead, who was delivered for
our offences, &amp; was raised againe for our justification.</hi> Here is some thing said
to be Imputed, &amp; this must be in order to justification: And this that is
Imputed, cannot be faith it self, or our act of beleeving; for what is said to
be Imputed, is promised to be Imputed upon condition of faith, or our
beleeving on Him, who raised up Iesus our Lord. So that it must be the
Righteousness of Christ, consisting in His Mediatory work, which He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
&amp; performed for His owne: for it is added, that <hi>He was delivered
for their offences; that is,</hi> He was delivered unto the death, to make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for their sinnes; &amp; He rose againe, that He might declare, He had
given full Satisfaction; &amp; that He might apply this Surety-righteousness of
His, to the end, they might be justified. <hi>Socinus</hi> doth not understand this,
&amp; therefore <hi>de Servat. part. 4. p.</hi> 333 saith, <hi>It is most certaine, that the Apostle
doth not speak of any Imputation of the righteousness of Christ; but assert, that the
faith or credite, we give God, because He hath called Iesus Christ, our Head,
from death to eternal life, shall be accounted unto us, in the place of righteousness;
just as faith, whereby</hi> Abraham <hi>gave credite to the words of God, was Imputed
to him for righteousness.</hi> But the Text hereby is manifestly perverted: for it
saith, that some thing shall be imputed, if we beleeve, which can not be
faith; but something distinct from faith, which is to be Imputed, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of faith. And what can this be else, than the Surety-righteousness
of Christ, who is here mentioned, as dying &amp; riseing, in the place, and
for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> good of His people, that they might be justified. And further, if
it were faith it self, that were here said to be Imputed, in order to justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the justified man should not be one, that is in himself ungodly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath a Righteousness in himself; and he, who hath a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
in himself, is not ungodly: &amp; yet it is said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 5. <hi>That God
justifieth the ungodly.</hi> Againe, That, which is Imputed, must be a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
without works, vers 6. but if faith it self be Imputed, a work is
Imputed, and not a Righteousness without works: and this would also lay
down a ground of boasting, &amp; make the reward of debt, &amp; not of grace, v. 14.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 10. <hi>For with the heart man beleeveth unto Righteousness, &amp; with
the mouth confession is made unto Salvation.</hi> The Apostle had been before
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104357:55"/>
vers 4. telling us, That Christ was the end of the law for righteousness to
every one that beleeveth; &amp; thereafter he discriminateth the way of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by the law and by the Gospel, under the Notion of a Righteousness
which is of the law, and a Righteousness, which is of faith: &amp; then more
particularly he describeth the Righteousness of faith, or a Righteousness is
had unto Salvation, in &amp; through faith vers 9. <hi>If thou shalt confess with thy
mouth the Lord Iesus, &amp; shalt beleeve in thine heart, that God hath raised him from
the dead, thou shalt be saved;</hi> which he proveth in the 10. vers, now cited;
&amp; therein sheweth, how by this beleeving that God hath raised the Lord
Jesus from the dead, Salvation is brought about; <hi>viz.</hi> That by beleeving
with the heart, a Righteousness is obtained &amp; received: and this righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
must be Christs, even His Surety-righteousness; for faith looketh on
Him, as raised from the dead, &amp; that by God, as having now received full
Satisfaction from Him; &amp; thereupon bringing Him, as it were, out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
And in the Text cited, we see, that by faith a Righteousness is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
or faith is the way unto the possession of a Righteousness, as
Confession is the way unto Salvation, or as the actual possession of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is had by Confession. And as Confession it self is not Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the way thereto, and the mean thereof; so faith it self is
not the Righteousness, but the way thereunto, and the meane or <hi>medium</hi>
thereof.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 21. <hi>I do not frustrat the grace of God; for if Righteousness come
by the law, Christ is dead in vaine.</hi> Whence we see, that a Righteousness
must be had; and that this cannot be had by the law, or by our obedience to
the law; but by Christ; &amp; to deny this, is in plaine termes, to frustrat the
grace of God, &amp; to say, that Christ is dead in vaine. And if we look back
to vers 16. &amp; forward, we shall see, that the Apostle is speaking of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by faith in opposition to the works of the law; that is, by faith in Jesus
Christ, receiving a Righteousness, which He hath wrought in His estate of
Humiliation.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 21, 22. <hi>For if there had been a law given, which could have given
life, verily righteousness should have been by the law: but the Scripture hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
all under sin, that the promise by faith of Iesus Christ might be given to
them that beleeve.</hi> Whence we see, that Righteousness is required un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
life, <hi>viz.</hi> the life of justification; and by whatever way life is had, by
the same is Righteousness had: and that neither life, nor Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is had by the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ: and both are held
forth in a free promise, &amp; given to the Beleever in Christ.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4: 4, 5. <hi>But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His
Son, made of a Woman, made under the law, to redeem them, that were under
the law, that we might receive the Adoption of sones.</hi> Christ, we see, was made
under the law, &amp; that to redeem such, as were under the law, that they
might be freed from what they were liable to by the law, and by being under
the law, and withall receive the Adoption of sones, which necessarily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in His Obedience, as the <hi>Aethiopik</hi> Version explaineth it saying, <hi>He
was begotten of a Woman, &amp; was a doer of the command, in the law.</hi> And that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104357:55"/>
His Sufferings are here included, is plaine from the one end assigned, <hi>that
he might redeem them, who were under the law,</hi> or under the lawes curse. The
end therefore here being twofold, <hi>viz. Deliverance from under the law,</hi> and
<hi>receiving the Adoption of sones;</hi> the Cause must have a subtableness thereunto;
and say, That this compleat Righteousness, comprehending both, must be
Imputed unto us, for the ends mentioned.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5: 5. <hi>For we through the Spirit, wait for the hope of Righteousness by
faith.</hi> Whether we take here the <hi>hope of Righteousness,</hi> for justification, as
the <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Version doth, translating the words thus, <hi>and we in the Holy
Spirit, and in faith hope to be justified;</hi> to which also the scope may give some
countenance; or for the Recompence of glory, which is the thing hoped
for; that which we intend, will be equally confirmed; for if Justification be
immediatly here spoken of, it is manifest, that hereunto a Righteousness is
requisite, and that this Righteousness is had by faith; and so is not in our
selves; and therefore must be the Righteousness of Christs, unto whom faith
carrieth forth the soul, &amp; of whom he spoke, vers 4. Saying, <hi>Christ is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of none effect unto you, who soever of you are justified by the law.</hi> If glory be
here immediatly intended, we may see, that the Apostle, to perswade the
<hi>Galatians,</hi> not to seek after a Righteousness by the law, tels them, what he
&amp; others did, and were resolved to do; <hi>to wit,</hi> how they ventured their
whole Salvation on the truth he delivered; for they waited and looked for
heaven and happiness (which is here called, <hi>hop,</hi> by a <hi>Metonymy</hi>) not by
the works of the law (for heaven with them was not the hop of the law,
or of the works of the law) but by the Righteousness of faith; that is, by
&amp; through that Righteousness, which is by faith; &amp; therefore it is called
<hi>the hope of Righteousness by faith;</hi> that is, that which they hope for, through
the help of the Spirit, and expect in &amp; through the Righteousness of Christ;
which Righteousness is had by faith in Christ: &amp; that this Righteousness is
none else but the Righteousness of Christ, the following <hi>verse</hi> cleareth, where
he saith; <hi>for in Iesus Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. <hi>Philipp.</hi> 3: 8, 9. <hi>That I may win Christ, &amp; be found in Him, not having mine
own Righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of
Christ, the Righteousness, which is of God by faith.</hi> This place is so clear and
full, that by speaking much of it, we may rather darken it, than explaine
it. We see, what was the maine thing <hi>Paul</hi> designed, in opposition to what
he once intended and sought after: what he did formerly look upon, as gaine,
and was hote in the pursuite of, he now had no better account of, than of
as much loss &amp; dung: yea he had no better esteem of all things beside Christ,
&amp; in this judgment, he persisted, accounting all but <hi>dung, that he might win
Christ,</hi> &amp; have Him for all his gaine. And what would he make of Christ?
He would be <hi>found in Him,</hi> hid in Him, covered with Him, and united to
Him. In opposition to this, he desireth not to be found in, or having on
his <hi>own righteousness, which is of the law;</hi> thereby showing us, That it was
the Righteousness of Christ, he desired to be clothed with, and found in; &amp;
therefore addeth; <hi>but that</hi> (i. e. that Righteousness) <hi>which is through the faith
of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by faith.</hi> The he was
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104357:56"/>
seeking, is the Righteousness of God, and which is of God by faith, and is
had through the faith of Christ; and all this was said in opposition to the
way, that the dogs, the evil workers, the concision, mentioned vers 2.
were crying up, and following, <hi>viz.</hi> the observation of the law, in order to
justification.</p>

Vindicated from the Exceptions of
John Goodwine.</head>
               <p>THe truth concerning the Imputation of Christs Righteousness, hath
been hitherto asserted from Scripture; &amp; several of these passages
have been vindicated from the Exceptions of <hi>Mr. Goodwine,</hi> a maine
adversary thereunto. For further clearing of the matter, we shall see what
Exceptions the same man bringeth-in against the Arguments, which are made
use of by the Orthodox for the truth asserted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. If there be no standing in judgment before God, unless we be
endued with perfect Righteousness; then must the Righteousness of Christ
be imputed to us, in our justification. But there is no standing for us in
judgment before God, unless we be endued with a perfect Righteousness.
Ergo, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Against this he excepteth, <hi>pag. 192. Chap.</hi> 7. saying, <hi>That the consequence
of the former proposition is not good.</hi> And so doth <hi>Bellar.</hi> answere <hi>de Iustific. lib.</hi> 2.

(saith he) <hi>which is the purchase &amp; procurement of the death of Christ, is a perfect
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104357:56"/>
Righteousness, &amp; is every way able to bear us out in judgment. Ans.</hi> Remission of
sins neither is, nor can be called righteousness; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

the same with one, that hath kept the law: though by vertue of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
he is freed from the punishment, due to the transgressours of the law;
yet hath he no right to the reward, promised to the keepers of the law.
(2) Remission of sins being the purchase of Christs death &amp; Sufferings, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be had without the Imputation of the death &amp; Sufferings of Christ unto
the Beleever: &amp; so hereby one halfe of the truth must be granted. But His
Sufferings &amp; Obedience going together &amp; both making up one Mediatory
&amp; Surety-righteousness, performed by Christ in His estate of humiliation,
both most be Imputed, &amp; made over to the Beleever, to the end he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
pardon, &amp; right to Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. He that is justified by the Righteousness of another, and not by his
own, must needs be justified by the righteousness of Christ imputed; because
there is no righteousness to be found in any other, for the justification of a
person, in the sight of God. But every man, that is justified, is justified by the
righteousness of another, and not by his own. Ergo, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He excepteth 1. <hi>The</hi> Major <hi>is false, because the passive obedience of Christ
is the Righteousness of another: and men may be &amp; are throughly &amp; fully justified
by the merite hereof, communicated to them in the free pardon of their sinnes; and
so need not the imputation of His active obedience. Ans.</hi> (1) We plead not for the
sole Imputation of Christs active obedience; but for the Imputation of all,
that He did and suffered, for &amp; in the room &amp; stead of His owne. (2) Where
are Christs meer Sufferings, as distinguished from His obedience, called a
righteousness? or how can meer Sufferings, as such, or bearing of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
threatened by the law, be called a righteousness? doth not righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
denote the conformity of actions unto the law? (3) When it is
said, the merite of Christs passive obedience is communicated unto us, the
meaning must be one of these two; either that it self is properly made over &amp;
imputed to us; or onely in its effect, free pardon of sinnes. If this <hi>latter</hi> be
said, Then no other Imputation is granted, than what <hi>Socinians</hi> will yeeld
unto: &amp; how can it be said to be Imputed, as to its Effects, when it self is
not Imputed, in order to the partaking of these effects? If the <hi>former</hi> be said,
then there is something, that is in it self imputed, &amp; not meerly in its Effects.
And if Christs Passions &amp; Sufferings be imputed, abstracted from His righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
&amp; Active obedience, they shall be justified without a righteousness.
And it neither is, nor ever will be proved, that pardon of sinnes is the
whole of justification; or that a pardoned man is, <hi>

                     </gap> ipso,</hi> that he is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
a righteous man; or that a pardoned man, meerly as such, hath
right to the recompence of reward, promised to the fulfiller of the
law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except</hi> 2. to the <hi>Minor, A man may be said</hi> (saith he) <hi>to be justified by the
Righteousness of another, and not by his own, in a double sense, Either 1. by way
of</hi> merite; <hi>and then it is true, that every one is justified by the Righteousness of
another, that is, by the merite of the righteousness of another, or 2. by way of</hi>
forme; <hi>&amp; so it is altogether untrue; for that Righteousness, where with a man
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104357:57"/>
is formally made Righteous, is alwayes a mans own by donation &amp; Possession. Ans.</hi>
(1) When a man is justified by the merite of the Righteousness of another,
that Righteousness of the other must be imputed to the justified person; or
we have no other Imputation, than what <hi>Socinians</hi> yeeld to (2.) If the
righteousness, whereby one is formally justified, be his owne by donation &amp;
possession, &amp; no other possession be thereunto requisite, then we may be
said to be formally justified by the righteousness of Christ: for we affirme,
that Beleevers are possessed thereof by Gods free donation and Imputation:
&amp; thus the whole is granted; for nothwithstanding hereof, that same righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
which is made over to the Beleever, by free donation &amp; Imputation,
is Christs Inherently, &amp; so is the righteousness of another. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we see, that the members of this distinction thus explained, are not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.
Yet, we must not think, that this righteousness of Christ is so given
to us, as that it is inherent in us, &amp; wrought in us, as Faith &amp; Repentance
are: for even Remission of sinnes, whereby he will have us formally justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
is not so in us, as Faith and Repentance are in us: And through Gods
Imputation and Donation, the righteousness of Christ may be the Beleevers,
when it is received by faith, as well as Remission of sinnes: for, to speak in
his own language, that which is given unto man by God, may truely and
properly be called his own. (3) That remission of sins is formal justification,
will never be proved: and seing he will have Remission of sins to be the
pure Effect of Christs Sufferings and death; so must justification be: and
then, why saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 25. <hi>Who was delivered (viz.</hi> to
Sufferings and death) <hi>for our offences, and raised againe for our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If Beleevers have a true and real communion with Christ, then is his
Righteousness theirs by imputation. But the former is true, &amp;c. It may be, he
proposeth the Argument, in such a mode &amp; way, as may be most to His
own advantage; for who argueth thus, he nameth not. Yet it is true,
that the Union, which beleevers have with Christ, is the ground or their
communion with Him in all things, which He was made or God to be for
them, &amp; which their necessity called for; among which His whole Surety-righteousness
doth challenge a chiefe p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ace. Nor would I argue from the
Union &amp; communion in general; but from such a particular Union and
communion, as is darkly shadowed forth unto us in the Scriptures, by
such and such similitudes; such as the Union betwixt Man and Wife, who
are one flesh, as Christ and Beleevers are one Spirit; as the Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the principal debtor and the Cautioner; and betwixt the publick
Head and Representative, and the Members represented; as betwixt the
Redeemer and the Redeemed and the like. And to argue from such an
Union, for such a peculiar end, to such a communion, as we here plead for,
may stand against all his Exceptions, <hi>pag.</hi> 195. &amp;c. Which are these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except 1. The</hi> Major <hi>wants truth, because a true and real communion with
Christ may stand, without His active obedience being made theirs by Imputation.
There is a real Union and communion between the head and the feet, in the same
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104357:57"/>
Natural body; yet is not the braine, or the proper functions &amp; operations of the
head, made the braine or functions of the feet. So between the Husband and the
Wife; yet is not the holiness, strength and Wisdom of the Husband made over to the
Wife by Imputation. And.</hi> Similitudes go not alwayes upon foure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eet: and
as these Similitudes come short of expressing the Union and Communion,
that is betwixt Christ and Beleevers; so they are not appos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ely here applied:
for neither is the end of the Union and Communion between the Head and
the Feet, that the braines and operations of the Head should be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to the feet; but that the head should use its proper operations &amp; fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
for the good of the feet: nor do the feet stand in need of any other
thing from the head. And thus also is it in the other Similitude, as to
the particulars Instanced: yet in other particulars, this last Similitude will
come neerer to our business; for though the Husbands Wisdom, Holiness
or Strength (which are not communicable) be not imputable to the Wife;
yet his Honour &amp; Riches can be &amp; are imputed or communicated: for, though
before the Mariage, the Woman was in a base condition, yet being mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with on honorable person, she partaketh of his honour; and being,
before the marriage, a person in debt, her Husbands riches are so impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to her, that she may be &amp; is made thereby <hi>solvendo,</hi> and freed from her
Creditors pursuit, and her Husband and she becometh one person in law,
&amp; he becometh chargable with her debt, &amp; obliged to pay it So that as
there is an Imputation, or a real devolving by law of the debt of the Wife
upon the Husband; so his making payment &amp; Satisfaction for the same, is
by law accounted hers; &amp; she is thereupon freed from all charge &amp; trouble
from her creditours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except 2. The</hi> Major <hi>wanteth reason; for there is no coloure of truth in it,
that that Union and Communion, which beleevers have with Christ, should of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
draw after it the Imputation of His active obedience; so that this obedience
of His should become their formal Righteousness; more than the Imputation of His
Wisdom, Power and Glory. Ans.</hi> (1) If by <hi>formal righteousness</hi> he understand
with <hi>Papists,</hi> inherent holiness, or righteousness, it is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
for we assert no such Imputation. (2) That the whole of Christs Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety-righteousness
be so imputed to beleevers, as that it becometh theirs;
so that they, meerly upon the account thereof, and clothed therewith, may
be and are repute and held to be persons just, in the account of God, &amp; so
be justified in His sight, is the thing we assert: and that this doth necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flow from Beleevers Union with Him by faith, and is a part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
they have with Him, and that upon a double account, <hi>First</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
He became Surety, and undertook their debt; &amp; so was made under
the law, and obeyed and Suffered all that it could have demanded of them;
for this end and purpose, that what He thus did &amp; suffered, as a publick
person or Surety, might stand for them, &amp; be accepted on their behalfe.
<hi>Secondly</hi> because their case and necessity called for this, in order to their
justification and Acceptance with God. (3) His Wisdom and power are
other waves improven, and laid forth to their advantage, according to the
Nature of the thing, and necessity.</p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If there be no other principal End, Reason, or Necessity, why
Christ should fulfill the law; but only that His obedience thereunto might
be imputed to us for Righteousness, in our Justification, then is not the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
thereof to be denied. But the former is true. Ergo, &amp;c. And
sure, if Christs obedience to the law, was not necessary in respect of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
it must have been performed upon the account of Beleevers; and that
principally and mainely for their Justification and Salvation; and therefore
for this end, that it might be imputed unto them. Against this, <hi>pag.</hi> 197.
&amp;c. He,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except. There are diverse other ends, reasons and necessities to be assigned
hereof. Ans.</hi> This is not the maine thing, that is here denied; nor will all
this help our Adversary, unless it can be shown, that those other Ends, which
we deny not, are prejudicial unto, &amp; inconsistent with that, which we look
upon, as the chiefe, &amp; as peculiar to Him, as Mediator &amp; Surety, standing in
the room of His people, who did mainely stand in need of this. Let us now
see the particular ends he toucheth.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>One reason</hi> (saith he) <hi>might be, to procure the greater Authority &amp; deeper
reverence to the Doctrine, which he taught, Matt.</hi> 7: 28. <hi>Ans.</hi> (1) The <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
upon the same account, deny, that His death was any proper Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for Beleevers: and if this be a weak argument in their mouth, it
cannot be strong in the mouth of our present Opposites. (2) This End is but
subordinat unto, and no way inconsistent with the principal End, which
we have mentioned. (3) Though Christs Miracles had a more direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to procure this Reverence, than His Holy life; yet neither the one,
nor the other were peculiar to Him alone: for both the Miracles, wrought
by others, such as Prophets and Apostles, and their holy life, had a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to procure Reverence and Beleef to their Doctrine: And himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
this in the following words, saying. <hi>It is a truth of general acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the holiness, uprightness and unblameableness of the lives of Teachers
have a powerful Influence into the consciences of Men, to render them more obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

arrow, taken out of the quiver of the Socinians; &amp; is of no force to weaken
our argument; seing a subordinat &amp; less principal end doth not destroy a
more principal end. Was He not exemplary to us in His death &amp; Sufferings?
shall we therefore say, That there was no satisfaction for sins intended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by?
And what is there here peculiar unto Christ, as Lord Mediator, seing
the lives of other Saints are also exemplary?</p>

This is the same with the preceeding, and deserveth no further answere.</p>

                     </gap>ncy
of His Father, which was a thing of absolute necessity, for the carrying on of
the great work of Redemption: for if He had once miscarried, who should have
mediated for Him? Ioh. 15: 10. &amp; 8: 29. Ans.</hi> As to His Person, He was
God equal with the Father, in power and Glory: It were therefore blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
once to suppose, that His person stood in need of this, for any such
end: or to suppose, that He could have failed, as to any act of obedience,
&amp; thereby have displeased God. Wherefore His obedience being the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of one, who was &amp; is God over all, blessed for ever, it could not be
necessary to Himself unto any such end. Therefore it behoved to be wholly
for us, for whom He was made under the law; as He was given to us, and
borne for us.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>It was</hi> (saith he) <hi>of absolute necessity to qualify &amp; fit the Sacrifice for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and render Him a person meet by His death and Sacrifice of Himself, to
make attonement for the world, and to purge and take away the sin of it. Ans.</hi>
Shall we think that He, who was God, was not a fit enoug Sacrifice for
the world; but that He must be made fit and prepared by acts of obedience?
And as for His Humane Nature, which was no person, but did subsist in the
Divine Nature, being assumed into the subsistence thereof, was it not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
fitted to be a Sacrifice, by its personal union with the Godhead? was
it not thereby Holy Harmless &amp; undefiled &amp; separat from sinners, which
is all that the Apostle requireth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7: 26? Was not the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
personally united unto the Godhead, from the very first moment of
conception? The holiness then, that consisteth in Acts of Actual obedience,
was not required unto this Union: and after this Union it was not possible,
that He could sinne: as it is not possible, that the glorified now in Heaven
can break the Lawes, that we break here, while on earth; and yet it will
not follow, that they are under the same particular obligations to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
acts of commanded duties, that we stand under: So nor was Christ, as to
Himself, under the obligation of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rticular duties of the law, to which
He willingly submitted Himself, &amp; gave obedience; but all this was for
us: Nor was this necessarily required to make His Sacrifice Holy; for His
Humane Nature, being once united, to the Divine, could not otherwayes
be but holy and without sin; and so a sinless and holy Sacrifice. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
we would take notice, that the Actions of the Mediator, were the Actions
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104357:59"/>
of the person, and not of either of the Natures alone; &amp; therefore must
not be looked upon, as the Actions of a meer man. So that His acts of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
were the acts of obedience of God man, or of that person, that
was God. He needeth not then tell us, that <hi>the Absolute holiness and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the humanity it self was of necessary concurrence unto His obedience:</hi>
for we grant it, and this flowed from the hypostatical union: but that,
which we deny, is, That there was an Holiness and Righteousness in acts
of outward obedience to the law requisite thereunto; as if the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by vertue of the hypostatical union, had not been holy and harmless,
untecedently unto those outward acts of obedience; and so had not been a
sinless and holy Sacrifice, if He had been offered up in His Infancy, or before
He was in capacity to do any commanded acts. He needeth not say (as he
doth <hi>pag.</hi> 204.) that <hi>we conceive, that Christ-man might have been righteous
without doing the works of Righteousness, which is all one, as to say, that He
might have been Righteous, though He had transgressed; for not to keep the law, in
those, to whom the law is given, is nothing else, but to transgress.</hi> For we neither
do, nor need assert any such thing: for by vertue of the hypostatical union,
He was Righteous, and could not transgress, or do any thing contrary to
what was imposed upon Him: but we say, that by vertue of this union, as
to Himself, the Humane Nature was not under the law, as we are; but He
was under the law, that He might fulfill it for others; &amp; not to fit and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
Him to be a meet Sacrifice, as if for this His Humane Nature had not
been meet enough before. To this he saith, <hi>pag. 205. Let this Supposition be
admitted, that Christ had suffered in the womb, and that this Suffering of His had
been fully Satisfactory; yet had He been as perfectly righteous, in this case; and
consequently had kept the law perfectly, as now He hath done; for the law requireth
of Infants, during their Infancy, nothing but holiness of Nature.</hi> I <hi>Ans.</hi> (1.) This
is enoug to confirme what we say, <hi>viz.</hi> That all His after actual obedience
was not necessary to this end. (2) And beside though this holiness of Nature
was conforme to the law upon the matter, yet it was not a formal obedience
unto the law, if we speak of Him in reference to Himself; for the Humane
Nature had this Holiness by vertue of the Hypostatical union: and Christ,
when the Humane Nature was first conceived, was God-man; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was under no law; &amp; so was not under the obligation of any such law;
but was made under the law, as Mediator; and so, for us, and not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
nor it is any more to advantage, to except againe &amp; say, that <hi>His
meaning is not, that there was an absolute necessity, that he should keep the law,
upon the same termes, every wayes, which now He hath done, as that He should
performe the same Individual acts of obedience, or the same number of acts, in case
He had been called to suffer any white sooner: but that untill the very Instant, in
which He should suffer, whether it were sooner, or later, He should in all things
submit himself unto the good pleasure of God.</hi> For it doth hence sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
That all his after obedience, in all these particular acts, was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to fit Him, as a Sacrifice; &amp; so could not be necessary for Himself.
And therefore seing He had been a sufficiently holy Sacrifice, had He been
offered up before the actual performance of these commanded duties in the
law, it is manifest, that these duties were not required unto the end alleiged:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104357:59"/>
but that, as He was made under the law for us; so all His actual obedience
to the law was for us, and not for himself. The Excepter, in end, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Invalidity of all his own discourse here, closeth the matter thus,
<hi>pag. 206. But however suppose this necessity or use of the Righteousness of Christ could
not be sufficiently cleared; yet since there are many others of undeniable evidence,
the position so much contended for; to wit, that the Godhead of Christ sufficiently
qualified Him for such a Sacrifice, as He was, makes nothing at all for the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of His Righteousness. Therefore we shall not trouble either our selves, or our
Reader any further with untying an Impertinent knot.</hi> What these others of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
evidence are, we have not yet seen: and, sure, this one ground is
sufficient to demonstrat, that his obedience to the law, in all points, was
not for himself, nor to qualifie him, as a Sacrifice; but for us: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it must be imputed, &amp; made over to us and become our Righteousness,
whereby and whereupon, together with his Sufferings, made over to us
also, we are to be justified and accepted of God, as Righteous; and not
only have pardon of sinnes, but also a Right to the Inheritance, and to the
reward promised upon obedience.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>As Christ</hi> (saith he, <hi>p.</hi> 206.) <hi>was a Sacrifice; so was He and yet is, &amp; is
to be for ever, Hebr.</hi> 7: 27. <hi>&amp;c. An High-Priest; and that Righteousness of His
we speak of, qualifieth Him, that is, contributeth to His qualification for Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
as well as it did for His Sacrifice. Ans.</hi> Seing it cannot be proved, that
his actual obedience to the law (which is the Righteousness we are here spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of) was necessary to qualifie him to be a Sacrifice here on earth; much
less can it be proven, that it was necessary to qualifie him for his Priest-hood
in heaven. And all these qualifications mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7: 26, He had,
before that actual obedience was either performed, or he in a capacity to
performe it: &amp; therefore his actual obedience was not necessary thereunto.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>That holy pleasure</hi> (saith he) <hi>and contentment, which Christ himself took
in these works of Righteousness, may be looked upon, as one considerable end, Ioh.</hi> 4:
34. <hi>Ans.</hi> So took He pleasure and delight to Suffer: He had a Baptisme to
be baptized with, and how was he straitned, or pained, till it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12: 50. Shall we then say, that therefore his death was not to
make Satisfaction for the sins of his own? These are but <hi>Socinian</hi> Evasions,
that have no force to weaken the truth, in the least. And thus, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of all his Exceptions, this Argument abideth in its strength. We
proceed to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg. 5. If we be debtors unto the law, and that not only in matter of punishment,
but in perfection of obedience also; then did Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot only suffer death for us,
that we might be delivered from the Curse; but also fulfilled the law, that
so we may be reputed to have fulfilled the law in him, or by the Imputation of His
fulfilling of the law to us. Otherwise the law should yet remaine to be fulfilled by us.
But the former is true. Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The force of the <hi>Argum.</hi> lyeth here, that we
were debtors unto the law, not only as to the punishment, which we had
deserved by transgression; but also as to perfect conformity thereunto: and
therefore coming in our law-place, &amp; taking on our debt, did not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
the punishment for us, but did also yeeld perfect obedience: And
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104357:60"/>
this compleet Surety-righteousness of Christ, consisting both in doing and
Suffering, must be imputed unto us, and reckoned upon our score, to the
end, we may be justified and Accepted of God, as Righteous; &amp; have
Right not only to Impunity, but also to the Reward, promised to the
obedient.</p>
               <p>He excepteth p. 208. &amp;c. Against the <hi>Minor,</hi> upon these grounds. 1. <hi>If
the meaning</hi> (saith he) <hi>be, that we, who are beleevers, are debtors to the law in
perfection for our justification; it is false. But as for these, that beleeve not in
Christ, it may be true, in this sense; that if they mean to be justified, and to escape
the punishment, otherwise than by Christ, they must keep the whole law. Ans.</hi>
(1) We say not, that Beleevers, who are already justified, through the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Righteousness of Christ, are debtors unto the law, for this end: but
that ere they could be justified and accepted of God, as Righteous, they
were obliged to perfect obedience, as well as to suffer the penalty: and
seing this was impossible unto them, their Surety was to do it, and he did
it, and what he did was imputed unto them, and reckoned upon their score.
(2) As for Unbeleevers (ans such are all by Nature) seing it is confessed, that
they ere under this obligation, then it is necessary, that before they be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
either they, or a Surety for them, must satisfy both these demands
of the law. And though none be now under a command, to give perfect
obedience unto the law, to the end, they may be justified; but such as hear
the Gospel are commanded to beleeve in Christ, and to accept of him by
faith, that they may have an Interest in his Righteousness, &amp; so be justified:
yet that taketh not away this Imputation, but establisheth it rather; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ having satisfied all the demands of the law, both in doing
and in Suffering, and that as a Surety, Head, Redeemer and publick
Person, by beleeving in him, they receive this, and have it made over
unto them.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>If the proposition</hi> (saith he) <hi>meaneth, that Beleevers are debtors of perfect
obedience to the law, in a way of Sanctification &amp; thankfulness. This is true, but
it concerneth not the question. Ans.</hi> Nor do we speak of this, knowing that it
is nothing to the present question: But this we say, That all men by nature,
and so Beleevers, before they be justified by faith in Christ, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under the Curse, because of sin; but are under the demand of the
law, or the commanding power of the law, requiring perfect obedience,
in order to the reward: And that therefore both these demands of the
law must be satisfied by their Surety, and the same must be imputed to
them and reckoned upon their score, before they can be looked on, as
free of the Curse, and as heirs of the Reward, promised to full &amp; perfect
obedience.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>We are not</hi> (saith he) <hi>therefore exempted from keeping the law, no not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of justification it self, because we have transgressed it, but because 1. having
once transgressed it, we are utterly uncapable of such an observation, whether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally,
or by imputation, which may amount to justification, or exemption from
punishment. 2. That relaxation or release from an observation of, or dependance
upon the law by justification accrueth unto us by meanes of our dependance upon
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104357:60"/>
Christ for justification, through his death, Rom.</hi> 7: 4. <hi>Ans.</hi> (1) If our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of the law doth not exeem us from the obligation to keep it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
in order to justification, then, ere we be justified, that obligation
must be satisfied, as well, as the obligation to punishment; and so the law
must be perfectly keeped, as well as its penalty suffered: And seing we our
selves can do neither, our Surety must do it for us, &amp; that must be accepted
for us, &amp; imputed to us. (2) Nor can it be said, that our uncapableness to
keep it, so as may amount to justification, doth exeem us from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or destroy the lawes power to require that of us; more than our unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pableness
to suffer the penalty, so as may amount to a justification, doth or
can exeem us from the obligation to suffer, or destroy the lawes power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the penalty of us. It is true, that no man now is called of God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoure
this way of justification: yet all such, as live without the Gospel
have not the better &amp; more sure way, through faith in Christ made known
unto them. The obligation to perfect obedience remaining after the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
saith, that, ere a man, that was both obliged to Suffer, and to
yeeld perfect obedience, can be justified, the law, as to both these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
must be satisfied, &amp; the Sureties Satisfaction to both must be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
upon his score. (3) Justification &amp; Exemption from punishment are
not one &amp; the same, in our case, more than pardon &amp; Righteousness.
(4) The Exemption, that accrueth to beleevers, saith not, that there was
no obligation upon mankind both to suffer and to obey, in order to justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
anteriour to Christs doing both.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>God never required</hi> (saith he <hi>pag.</hi> 210.) <hi>of any man, but only of Christ,
both exactness of obedience to the law, &amp; subjection to punishment, due to the
transgression of the law</hi> conjunctim, <hi>but</hi> divisim <hi>only. He that shall perfectly keep
the law, is not bound to suffer the penalty. Ans.</hi> (1) Then our transgressing of
the law should exeem us from the obligation to obedience, contrare to what
was granted in the <hi>First</hi> Exception. (2) Though he, who perfectly keepeth
the law, is obnoxious to no punishment; yet he, who breaketh the law (as
we all did in <hi>Adam,</hi> beside our daily transgressions) is obnoxious to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
&amp; this obnoxiousness to punishment no more dissolveth his obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to obedience, than his transgression was able to do. And therefore
we are all, considered in our Natural state, obliged to both <hi>conjunctim;</hi> for
we are borne sinners, and yet born under the obligation of keeping the law
of God. (3) Gods requiring both of Christ, who was Mediator &amp; Surety,
saith, that both were required of us: for what was required of him, as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety,
was required of the principal debtors.</p>
               <p>5. He saith, <hi>In case a Man hath transgressed the law, &amp; hath suffered (whether
by himself, or by some other for him) the full punishment threatned, he is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a debtor unto the law, neither in point of punishment, nor of obedience: for
the punishment is of equal consideration to the law, with the most absolute confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:
and as no man can be obliged to fulfill the law twice for his justification;
so neither is it reasonable to conceive, that he, who hath suffered the full penalty, that
being as satisfactory to the law, as the exactest obedience, should be still bound to the
observation of the law. Ans.</hi> When the law promiseth life to the fulfillers, as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104357:61"/>
well as threatneth death to the transgressours, the suffering of death for
the transgression, is not such a fulfilling of the law, as hath the promise of
life annexed to it: Devils, though now suffering the vengeance of eternal
fire, the death threatned, yet cannot be said to be fulfilling the law, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
unto life; nor can they be said to be justified, nor to be suffering any
thing, in order thereunto. In order therefore to our justification &amp; Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
with God, as heirs of the life promised, who were both obnoxious
to punishment, &amp; also obliged to give perfect obedience to the law, the law
as to both, must be satisfied. Nor can we say, that the punishment of Devils is
of equal consideration to the law, with the conformity yeelded thereunto by
the confirmed Angels. And though the suffering of the penalty in lawes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
or such as promise no reward unto the obeyers, may be said to be of
equal consideration with the keeping of the law; yet this cannot be said in
lawes, which promise a Reward to the observers, as well as threaten a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
to transgressours: Nor can the man, that suffereth the punishment,
suppose to the full, that is threatened in the law, be said to have fulfilled
the law, and to have deserved the reward promised to obeyers. (2) Though
Christ hath both obeyed the law, &amp; suffered the punishment; yet the law
is not twice fulfilled, but once, because, as was granted, such as were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and obnoxious to punishment, were also obliged to yeeld perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
for transgression did not destroy this obligation. As when a man
is punished for breach of a law, that not only required obedience under such a
penalty, but also promised a reward to the observers, when he is put to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
what was commanded, ere he can have the promised reward, he is
not put to fulfill the law twice: for his punishment was but Satisfaction to one
part of the law, or to threatning; but it was no satisfaction of the law, as to
the reward promised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. If there be no justification, without a perfect Righteousness, &amp;
no such Righteousness to be found, but the Righteousness of Christ perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to the law, then of Necessity this Righteousness must be imputed to us
unto justification. But the former is true. Ergo, &amp;c. The ground of this
Argument is, that justification is the pronouncing of a person righteous, &amp;
justification being Gods act, the person justified must be righteous, ere God
can judge &amp; pronounce him to be such; for the judgment of God is alwayes
according to truth; &amp; no person having a righteousness of his own, all that are
justified must have a Righteousness imputed to them; and there is no
Righteousness that can be said to be imputed, but the Surety righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ, and particularly, in satisfying all the demands of the
law.</p>
               <p>He Excepteth, <hi>pag.</hi> 211. against the <hi>Minor 1. That however it be true, that
justification cannot take place, without a perfect Righteousness, being nothing
else than the making of a man perfectly Righteous: yet a Righteousness consisting
determinatly of such a tale of righteous acts, as Christ performed unto the Moral
law, is not absolutely necessary: for in reference to the jewes, there must have
been righteous acts performed unto the ceremonial law also. Ans.</hi> (1) Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not the making of a man perfectly righteous; but the judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104357:61"/>
&amp; declaring of a man to be so, through the Righteouseness of
Christ, imputed to him &amp; received by faith. (2) A perfect Righteousness,
consisting in compleat obedience the law is required: we urge not such a
determination of acts, in number &amp; tale to the moral, or to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
law: only we assert the necessity of a full obedience to the Rule of
Righteousness, which God prescribed unto men, &amp; this was the Moral law:
Though, as to the jewes there were other prescriptions proposed, than were
to others of the world; yet these same prescriptions, consisting in Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials,
or in Judicials, were reduced to the Moral law, &amp; were enjoined
thereby, so long as they stood in force, and were not repealed by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Law giver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except 2. Neither is it so absolutly true, that there is no perfect Righteousness to
be found, beside Christs. There is a Righteousness in the law as absolut &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.
And it is much more probable, that if God Imputes a legal Righteousness unto
Men in justification, He fournisheth them this way out of the law. Ans.</hi> But what
is that Righteousness in the law? doth the law hold forth any Righteousness,
but perfect obedience? and how can God furnish them with this, but by
Imputing unto them the perfect obedience of Christ, seing He hath not so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
matters, as they shall be in case, while here, perfectly to keep the law
themselves. (2) He remitteth us to what he said formerly in the same Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise;
and in that place, he maketh this compleat Righteousness to consist in
Remission of sinnes. And yet, it is certaine, that Remission is no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
nor is it a Righteousness held forth in the law; not is it any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to the law: yea, it agreeth noth with common sense, nor with
Reason to say, that by Remission of sins men are made formally Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except. 3. That perfect Righteousness, wherein justification consisteth, and
where with men are made formally Righteous, when they are justified, is nothing else
but Remission of sins, Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7. <hi>Ans.</hi> Remission of sins is not a perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
This hath no countenance, from Scripture, nor from Reason,
or common sense. Who ever thought, or said, that a pardoned Thiefe or
Murderer was a Righteous man? or that his pardon made him formally Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theous,
and an observer of the law? Though thereupon he be freed from
the penalty, or from the punishment threatned in the law against such
transgressours; yet is he nor thereupon either made or declared to be
Righteous; but his pardon is a virtual declaration, that he is not Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
but a Transgressour. How that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7. is perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
when adduced to give countenance to this fiction, is declared al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p>He addeth, <hi>pag.</hi> 215. two Reasons for this: the <hi>first</hi> is, <hi>That remission
of sins is equivalent unto, and virtually containeth &amp; comprehendeth in it, the
most absolute and entire obedience unto the law. Ans.</hi> Remission of sins, as such,
is so far from being equivalent to this, or from comprehending this in it,
that it is a plaine declaration of the contrary: for where entire obedience
is, there Remission hath no place, and Remission must presuppose a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.
The <hi>next</hi> is, <hi>Because</hi> (swaith he) <hi>it hath all these great and high
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104357:62"/>
privileges annexed to it, and depending upon it, which a Righteousness, most
strickly so called, could have, as the Love, Favour, acceptation and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God. Ans.</hi> If we speak of Remission of sinnes, in it self, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractly
considered, this is also false: for though a pardoned man be freed
from the punishment, due to Transgressours; yet, as meerly pardoned, he
hath no right to Reward, promised to the perfect observers of the law:
Nothwithstanding hereof, we grant that the man pardoned of God hath
all these high and great privileges; but not by vertue of his meer pardon;
but because there is a Righteousness, imputed to him, upon which these
privileges do depend, and Exemption from punishment dependeth upon his
pardon.</p>
               <p>He hath two other Reasons elsewhere, <hi>pag.</hi> 5, 6. to this purpose; as
1. <hi>That Remission includeth the acknowledgment of the observation of the whole
law, even as the Imputation of the law fulfilled, necessarily includeth the non-imputation
of sin. Ans.</hi> Though in our justification, this might be granted
to be true, upon the matter, because there is an Imputation of the whole
Surety-righteousness of Christ together; and the one part is not separated
from the other; so that the one consequently inferreth the other. But when
it is thus reasoned against the Imputation of the one, the Inference here must
be understood of a formal Inference, and so it is false, that Remission in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
the acknowledgment of the observation of the whole law; for it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
includeth the non-Imputation of guilt, notwithstanding that the law was
broken: yea, as is said, it manifestly supposeth the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the law was not perfectly observed, for had the law been perfectly observed,
there had been no place for pardon. <hi>Moreover,</hi> Remission as such, giveth no
Right to the reward, promised unto perfect obedience; but only impunity
from the punishment, threatned for disobedience. 2. saith he. <hi>He cannot be
said to have all this sinnes fully forgiven, who is yet looked vpon, as one that hath
transgressed, either by Omission, or Commission, &amp; intended to be dealt with all as
such. Ans.</hi> Though he, whose sinnes are fully forgiven, cannot be dealt
with, as one guilty of sin, that is, as one liable to the punishment; yet he
may be looked on, as one, that was guilty, and so did not give full and perfect
obedience: and therefore, though he cannot be dealt with as a Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour;
yet neither can he be dealt with, upon the account of his Remission,
as one that hath yeelded perfect obedience, &amp; did never transgress.
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
seing he cannot be looked upon, as one that never transgressed, he
cannot be looked upon, as one that hath a perfect Righteousness, and so, a
Right to the Reward. The similitudes taken from a phisician, restoreing
his patient to health, by recovering him from his sickness; and from the
Sun, in one act expelling darkness &amp; bringing in light, which are here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
for illustration, have no force to prove any thing here, in regard,
there is no correspondence in all points, betwixt Matters Natural, &amp; Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
meerly Moral, or Political. There is no <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt light and
darkness, or the habite and its privation; but there is a <hi>Medium</hi> here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Transgressing of the law, &amp; perfect obedience to the law unto the end,
<hi>Adam,</hi> so long as he stood, was no Transgressour; yet he had not then gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104357:62"/>
perfect obedience to the end, according to the Covenant. So there is
a <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt Freedom from the Penalty, &amp; the Right to the Reward,
as was shown above.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. If <hi>do this &amp; live,</hi> be an everlasting Rule of God, &amp; which shall
never be dissolved, then must the Active obedience of Christ be imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Men, in justification, that so they may be said to have <hi>done this,</hi> and so
<hi>live.</hi> But the former is true, Ergo, &amp;c. That these words, <hi>do this and live,</hi>
containe a determination &amp; constitution of the Lord, as unalterable, as
these words, <hi>That day thou eats, thou shalt die,</hi> cannot well be denied: and
therefore, if because of <hi>this latter,</hi> no man can be saved, unless their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety
die for them; so because of <hi>that former,</hi> no man can have right to the
reward, unless his Surety performe perfect obedience. And as the one is
imputed to the Beleever, so must the other be Imputed also, in order to his
compleat Salvation.</p>
               <p>Against this he excepteth, <hi>pag.</hi> 216. &amp;c. thus, <hi>In this sense, I grant, that do</hi>
this and live, <hi>is an everlasting Rule, that is, it is, hath been, and shall be
everlastingly true, that who so ever shall fulfill the law perfectly, shall live. But
not in this sense, that it is the only perpetual and standing Rule, whereby and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which, men must be justified, and so saved: for in this sense, it neither
is, nor ever was, nor ever shall be a rule of God: for God hath alwayes had, and
for ever will have another rule for the justification of men. Ans.</hi> (1.) Was it not
a Rule of life &amp; justification to <hi>Adam,</hi> in the state of Innocency? was he not,
according to that Covenant, where in he stood, to purchase the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
by his doing? It may be, the Excepter thinketh, with the <hi>Socinians,</hi>
that no more was promised to <hi>Adam,</hi> than what he had in possession. (2.) We
do not assert it, as a standing rule, whereby we should now expect to be <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified;</hi>
but we say, that it being a constitution of God's, as well as the other,
<hi>viz. That day thou eats, thou shalt die,</hi> It must be satisfied, as well as the
other. And as the rule of faith taketh not away Christs suffering of death,
according to what was threatened in the law; so nor doth the law of faith
take away His obedience, according to the command of the law: and as
Christs paying down of the Penalty was necessary for our freedom from
death; so His giving full obedience to the law is necessary to our life; though,
as was said, we need not nicely thus distinguish, save to shew the necessity

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg. 8. That</hi> Righteousness, which God accepteth on our behalfe, is
the Righteousness imputed to us in justification. But the Righteousness
of Christ is that Righteousness, which God accepteth on our behalf,
Ergo, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He excepteth, <hi>pag.</hi> 217. 1. Denying the <hi>Major, because God may and doth
accept that for us, or on our behalf, which yet He need not impute to us; at He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of</hi> Abrahanis <hi>prayer, in the behalf of</hi> Ismael; <hi>&amp; of the prayer of</hi> Elisha <hi>for
the Shumanites Son, and yet neither was imputed to the other. Ans.</hi> But all this, &amp;
a thousand Instances of the like nature, can evince nothing; for the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
speaketh of what is accepted of God, in order to justification, as the
ground and meritorious cause thereof; which the Instances adduced come
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104357:63"/>
not nigh unto. He addeth, <hi>In like manner, these, in whose behalf, Christs
Sufferings were accepted, receive an unspeakable benefite &amp; blessing by them; but this
operats nothing to the Inference of the Imputation pleaded for; that is, that God must
look upon these Sufferings of Christ, as if they had personally endured them, on whose
behalf they are accepted. Ans.</hi> Then it seemeth not only is the Imputation of
Christs active obedience denied; but also the Imputation of His death and
Sufferings; and no more is granted, than what <hi>Socinians</hi> will yeeld unto.
(2) The Imputation, we plead for, is not such as maketh God to look
upon these Sufferings of Christ, as if Beleevers had personally endured them:
but such, as maketh God to look upon them, as the Sufferings of Christ, as
Surety, Head &amp; Publick person, in the room &amp; stead of His chosen ones;
which Sufferings &amp; payment of the Penalty by the Surety, being made over
unto, &amp; reckoned upon the score of Beleevers, they are, upon the account
thereof, accepted &amp; dealt with, as if they themselves had so Suffered and
Satisfied, in their own persons.</p>
               <p>2. He distinguisheth thus, <hi>If by the Righteousness of Christ the proposition
meaneth, precisely that obedience, which He exhibited to that general &amp; common
law, whereunto all Men are obliged, considered apart from His obedience to that
particular law of Mediator, given to Himself alone, so it is false. If by Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be here meant that obedience of Christ, commonly called passive, or both active
and passive together; so it may be true: but then the other will be found tardy. Ans.</hi>
(1) Christs obedience to that general law, by which all men were obliged,
did as well belong to His law of Mediation, and was comprehended under
it, as His giving up Himself to Suffering &amp; to death: for as Mediator He
was made under the law, as well as suffered the Curse. (2) The <hi>Minor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
is to be understood of the whole Surety-righteousness, consisting not
only in Suffering; but also in actual obedience to the law: &amp; when this is
granted, the whole we seek is granted. Neither is the former proposition
found tardy, as appeareth from what is said; &amp; the Syllogisme is good, and
no <hi>Paralogisme,</hi> what ever he supposeth.</p>

all those that should beleeve in Him; then all that He did and Suffered, is
to be looked upon &amp; reputed by God, as done &amp; Suffered by these, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
are Imputed to them. But the former is true, Ergo, &amp;c. Sure,
if Christ was a publik person, standing in the place and room of the chosen

law and justice required of them, &amp; they were obliged unto, must needs
be imputed unto them, &amp; reckoned upon their score; and they must be
dealt with upon the account thereof, as if all had been done &amp; suffered by
themselves. We do not say, that all He did &amp; Suffered, is or must be Imputed:
but that all, which He did and suffered, in Satisfaction of the law, and in
payment of that, which we were liable unto, &amp; stood under the obligation
of, is and must of necessity be imputed, to the end we may be deliver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <p>He excepteth, <hi>pag. 220. &amp;c. 1. The publickness of Christs person, or His
standing in the place of those, that should beleeve, is no sufficient ground to build
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104357:63"/>
this Inference upon, That therefore all He did &amp; suffered, are looked upon by God,
as done and suffered by them; such as His conception, Birth, &amp;c. Ans.</hi> We
have obviated this already, by showing, that the <hi>Major</hi> is to be limited to,
&amp; understood of those things only, which the law required of us, &amp; which
we were under the obligation of, and were debtors to do and suffer, amongst
which none of the particulars mentioned, and many moe such-like, can be
reckoned. His after rambling discourse upon this mistake, is not worth the
noticeing: And who seeth not, how vaine it is for him to say, <hi>that then God
should look upon men, as having redeemed the world:</hi> For, as the law did not
require this of us; so to speak thus, destroyeth all acts of Sutetyship: for the
Sureties acts can never be so imputed to the debtor, as to make him thereby
the Surety. We know, that Sureties and publick persons may do many
things, which cannot be said to be imputed to the deb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but these things are not done by them, as such publick persons &amp;
Sureties, but in another capacity. And it is folly hence to inferre, that
therefore the Sureties payment of the debt cannot be said to be imputed to
the debtor; or that wherein the publick person was a publik person, and
which he did as such, cannot be said to be imputed to those, whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Except. Itagreeth not with Scripture expression, to say, that the Sufferings
of Christ are by God looked upon, as our Sufferings, or to conceive, that we
should suffer in Him. It is not all one to say, we were punished in Christ, and
Christ was punished for us. This last as warranted by</hi> Esai. 53: 6. <hi>But the other
cannot be affirmed; for seing in Christs death, we hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> remission of sins, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said, for the same sinnes to be punished in and with Christ. Ans.</hi> This is
wholly founded upon his own way of wording the Argument, so as he thought
it would give him most advantage: for all this looketh to these words, in
the <hi>Major propos. are to be looked upon, &amp; are reputed by God, as done &amp; suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by those;</hi> which words might have been left out, without any hurt to
our cause: the Argum. without them would have been full and concludent
for us, whether any have argued so, or he hath framed the Argum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to his
own mind, I know not. Sure, there is no necessity for adding of these words:
yet the words may admit of a candide Interpretation; for it hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy,
or dissonancy to Scripture expression, to say, that the Sufferings
of Christ are looked upon as the beleevers sufferings, when they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to him; not as if God should think, judge or conceive, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever,
in his own Physical person, had suffered, that which Christ did suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;
but that he hath a special legal interest in these Sufferings, as being in
a special manner interessed in Christ: and are now dealt with by God, no
otherwayes, than as if he himself had, in his own person, laid down that
satisfactory price. And in this sense, there is no difference betwixt the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that <hi>we are punished in Christ,</hi> &amp; that <hi>Christ was punished for us:</hi> for we

in Christ, take a way Remission of sins, but doth rather establish the
same, as being the only ground thereof: for till we have an Interest in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104357:64"/>
Christ, and in His Sufferings, by the Imputation thereof to us, &amp; our
leaning to them by faith, we can have no Remission, according to the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Except. 3. The publikeness of a person, who negatiats the affaires of others, doth
no further, nor any other wayes, interesse those, whose affaires he mannageth, in
what he doth in, or about such a transaction: buth only with reference to the issue,
&amp; success of what he doth for them, in that behalf: so that his dishonest, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscientious
way, in the miscarying, or his wisdom &amp; faithfulness, in the right
managing, are no wayes imputable to the persons, whose business is negotiated.
Ans.</hi> It is not necessary, that that special manner of managment should be
so imputed unto the persons, whose affaire is negotiated, it being sufficient,
that the persons represented be interessed in the transaction it self, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to an interest in the issue in the same affaire managed: and the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
it self is so imputed to the persons represented, in reference to the
effects, as if it had been done by themselves. So in our case, though the
Wisdom, Faithfulness &amp; patience of Christ, used in the managment of that
publick affaire intrusted to Him, as a publick person, undertaking for, and
representing all His Children, be not imputed unto them: yet the business
it self, with which He was intrusted, <hi>viz.</hi> Giving satisfaction to the law in
all points, by Suffering &amp; Obedience, which the law required of us, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to us, &amp; must be so, in order to our partaking of the benefites &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
thereof.</p>

                  <hi>Except. 4. It is not altogether so solide or sound, as is supposed,</hi> that Christ
stood in the place &amp; stead of those, that should beleeve in Him, <hi>especially in
all things, performed by Him, and which tended to the qualification of His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
To stand in the place and stead of another, implieth a necessity of his being
in the same place, &amp; doing the same things himself, wherein he stands, &amp; which
he doth, who is supposed to stand in his stead, unless they had been done by this other
for him. Ans.</hi> This <hi>last</hi> Exception is the same with the <hi>first,</hi> &amp; needeth little
more consideration. We do not assert, that He did so stand in the place &amp;
stead of beleevers, as to all things He did &amp; suffered; but only that He stood
in in our room &amp; stead, in the whole of His active &amp; passive obedience, or in
making satisfaction to the demands of the law, in His state of humiliation,
this being it, for &amp; in reference to which, He was appointed to be a publick
person: all other things He did, as His Miracles, assuming a body, and the
like, need not be said to be imputed to us; though, in that they concerned
His person, &amp; were requisite thereunto, &amp; to the work He was imployed in,
they carry a special advantage in them for Beleevers; &amp; were in a particular
manner designed for their good, &amp; were subservient to that maine designe.</p>

               <p>He excepteth p. 225. <hi>The Righteousness of Christ concurreth toward justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

only. (2) Even as to this, it was answered above, that it was not
requisite unto this end, His humane nature being sufficiently hereunto qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
by the personal union, by which His bloud became the bloud of God,
and all He did and Suffered was the deed &amp; Suffering of Him, who was God.</p>

be quickened &amp; have risen againe with Him, &amp;c. then may we truely be said
to have fulfilled the law with Christ; &amp; consequently that should be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to us. But the former is true, Ergo, &amp;c. These expressions pointe forth
the closs union, that is betwixt Christ and Beleevers, &amp; thereupon their
Interest in what He did and suffered, as Mediator, Surety &amp; publick person,
to the end they may have right to, and possession of the great benefites, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
and procured by Him. So they hold forth Christs suffering, dying,
riseing, &amp;c. as a publick person in their room &amp; in their stead, &amp; as their
Representative: so that it is r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ckoned for them, and upon their score, and
they are so interessed therein, as that they are to be dealt with, as if all these
things had been done &amp; suffered by themselves. And though, in these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
mentioned, there be no express mention made of Christs fulfilling
the law; yet they sufficiently hold forth that, which by parity of reason will
enforce this, as well as the other: for they pointe forth Beleevers their union
&amp; communion with Christ, as to His Mediatory work, to which His fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the law did belong.</p>
               <p>Against the <hi>consequence</hi> he saith, <hi>These expressions have no such Inference: for
if we could be said to have fulfilled the law with Christ, our own fulfilling it in Him
should rather be said to be imputed to us, than His fulfilling it for us. Ans.</hi>
(1) This will say as much against the Imputation of Christs sufferings; for
we are said to be dead with Christ; &amp; therefore not Christs death, but our
own death in Him should be said to be imputed to us: But the Scripture
knoweth no such thing. (2) The meaning of the expression is, we say, but
to denote emphatically the imputation of what Christ did &amp; suffered, unto
us: for our own fulfilling of the law in Him, is but His fulfilling of it for us,
&amp; the same imputed to us; so as we are dealt with no otherwayes, than if
we had done it our selves; as our being dead &amp; buried with Christ, is but
His dying in our place &amp; stead, or our having such an Interest in His death
&amp; burial, as that we are dealt with, as if, in a manner, we had died our
selves. But he supposeth, there is a difference, as to this, betwixt Christs
dying &amp; His fulfilling the law, saying, <hi>When the Scripture saith, we are dead
&amp;c. with Christ, the meaning is not, that God looked upon us, as if we had laid
down our Natural lives by death, when he laid down His; &amp; as if this laying down
our lives were a satisfaction to His justice; for then we might be said, to have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for &amp; redeemed our selves: But these expressions import either a profession of such
a death in us, which holds proportion with, or hath a likeness to the death of Christ, or
else this death it self really wrought in us, by that death of Christ. Ans.</hi> We do
not asserte the meaning of these expressions to be, That God looketh upon
us, as if we had laid down our Natural lives, &amp;c. But that beleevers have
such an Interest in Christs death, as being the death of their Surety, Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
Head, Husband and publick person, that they receive the benefites

                  </gap> thereof, no less really &amp; effectually, than if they themselves,
in their own persons, had dyed &amp; satisfied, the same being now imputed
unto them, &amp; laid hold on by faith. (2) Though these expressions, at least
some of them, &amp; in some places of Scripture, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. may &amp; do import
what is here expressed; yet the full import of these Expressions is not hereby
exhausted, as the scope &amp; circumstances of the places may cleare; as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
that expression, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 20. <hi>I am crucified with Christ:</hi> &amp; these <hi>Ephes.</hi>
2: 5. 6.</p>
               <p>He addeth against this. <hi>That Gal.</hi> 2: 20. <hi>The expression is taken in the latter
sense, importing that the natural death of Christ for Paul &amp; others, had wrought upon
him, in a way of assimilation to it self, &amp; had made him a dead man to the world.
Ans. Paul</hi> is rather clearing &amp; confirming, how he was become dead to the
law, and alive unto God, vers 19. in &amp; through the vertue of Christs death
&amp; crucifixion, in which he had such an Interest, that he accounted him self,
as it were hinging-on the cross in &amp; with Christ; &amp; did so rest upon that by
faith, &amp; owne that Sacrifice alone, that he &amp; Christ, as it were, were
become one person; &amp; he owed his being dead unto the law onely thereunto,
&amp; had it as really flowing therefrom &amp; following thereupon, as if he himself
had hung upon the cross, as a satisfactory Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>To that <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 5, 6. he saith, <hi>The meaning is not, that God looks upon them,
as quickened from a natural or corporal death, as Christs quickening &amp; riseing againe
was. Ans.</hi> Nor do we say, that this is the meaning, nor need we either think,
or say so: but this we say, that the expression holdeth this forth, that Christ
dyed &amp; rose againe, as a publick person &amp; Surety; &amp; that Beleevers have
so neer an Interest in His Mediatory work, &amp; so closs an union with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
that they are as one person in law; so that they are really made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of some of the fruites of what Christ did &amp; suffered, already, &amp; shall
as really partake of what is yet to be communicated, as if they themselves had
laid down that purchasing price. Let us hear what he giveth for the meaning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The meaning</hi> (saith he) <hi>is either to signifie the profession, that is made by us of
that newness of life, which in way of a Spiritual Analogy, answers that life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
Christ was quickened and rose againe; or else the new life it self wrought in us.
Ans.</hi> That the Apostle is not here speaking of a meer profession, is manifest:
nor is he speaking only of a new life, wrought in them; for he addeth, <hi>and
made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Iesus:</hi> Nor doth that, which
he saith, invalidate the meaning, which we give; for that effect, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrough
quickening is spoken of, as flowing from Christs dying &amp; riseing, &amp;
from their Interst in His dying and riseing, &amp; their union with Him in all
that, as being one person in law with Him; &amp; so as virtually riseing with
Him, and now sitting with Him, who is their common Head &amp; Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
All which doth abundantly confirme the Doctrine of Imputation,
which we plead for.</p>
               <p>He addeth <hi>finally, But on the other hand, as there is no such expression in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as this,</hi> we have fulfilled the law with Christ; <hi>so neither<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would it make any thing at all to salve the truth of the proposition, under question:

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104357:65"/>
with Christ's fulfilling it, or really &amp; personally to fulfill the law, after such
a manner? Ans.</hi> The expressions already mentioned do sufficiently evince
this union and communion, that beleevers have with Christ, in His media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
work, which is a solide ground of Imputation of the same unto them, as
the foundation of their partaking of the benefites flowing therefrom: for
there cannot any shew of reason be given for the one, which will not hold
good for the other also. And it is said, but not proved, that these &amp; the like
expressions hold forth no more, but one or both of these two things alleiged:
yea the scope of the places, and the Import of the words, hold forth much
more, as is said.</p>

How come they to be under grace, &amp; not under the law? Is is not by vertue
of the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ unto them, unto their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification;

&amp; taking away of all guilt, there needs no Imputation of the active obedience
of Christ. The propitiation, which He is unto them, by His blood &amp; Intercession,
hath done this service to them, before this Imputation is supposed to come at them.
Ans.</hi> We plead for the Imputation of His whole Surety &amp; Mediatory work;
&amp; say that it is wholly imputed, &amp; that at once, &amp; not one part now, and

proofs, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. &amp;c. As to the first of which, largely prosecuted <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.
we shall speak to it afterward, when we come to speak of the Interest of
faith in Justification; for thereunto it doth more properly belong, being
rather a proof of the Imputation of faith, in a proper sense, as our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
unto justification, than of the Non-Imputation of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ.</p>
               <p>Leaving therefore the examination of this to its proper place, we come
to see what other Scriptures, adduced by him against the Truth hitherto as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
do say, in this question under debate; &amp; that the more willingly,
because <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> in his late book against <hi>D. Tully,</hi> referreth us to this man for
Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> he adduceth such passages, as absolutely exclude the works of the
law from justification, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 20. We spoke
something to this matter, while we were mentioning the Mysteries, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
in justification: yet we shall here consider what he saith. He thus
reasoneth, <hi>pag. 55. If a man be justified by the Righteousness of Christ imputed
unto him, he shall be justified by the works of the law; because that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, we now speak of, consists of these works. Ans.</hi> The vainity &amp; fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of the Consequence is obvious: nor doth the reason added, make any
supply. It is true the Righteousness of Christ did consist in works of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
required by the law; yet though this be imputed to us, it doth not
follow, that we are justified by the works of the law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ccording to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
sense of that expression: for the Scripture meaneth works of the law,
which we do in our own persons, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 5. And the whole Scope, Drift
&amp; purpose of the Spirit of the Lord, in all these places cited, &amp; in all others,
evinceth this; and all the Arguments mentioned in Scripture against ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by the works of the law, demonstrat this to be the true and only
impo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of that expression, as cannot but be plaine to any considering person.
Yet he hath 4. answers, and he addeth several other things, which we must
examine.</p>
               <p>He saith I. <hi>Where the Holy Ghost delivereth a truth simply &amp; indefinitly &amp; in
a way of a General &amp; Universal conclusion, without imposeing any necessity there,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104357:66"/>
or else where, to limite or distinguish upon it; for men to interpose by distinctions
&amp; limitations, to overrule the express meaning of the words, is to usurpe authority
over the Scriptures. Ans.</hi> I grant, to adhibite distinctions or limitations,
which the Scripture giveth no warrand for, to over rule the express meaning
of the words of the Holy Ghost, is to exercise an unlawful authority
over the Scriptures, &amp; savoureth of audacious profanity. And I judge,
that there are not afew of such distinctions &amp; limitations to be found, in his
Book, making him fall under the lash of this censure. But to assert such a
general and universal sense of a Scripture expression, as neither will agree
with other Scriptures, nor with common Sense &amp; Reason; yea which so
directly crosseth the whole Gospel, and destroyeth the Scope, Cohesion,
&amp; obvious Sense of the whole purpose, and of every sentence, used by the
Spirit of the Lord in that matter, is to usurpe a Supra-papal power and Authority
over the Scriptures of truth, and a most ready way to render them
wholly useless. (2) As for our sense of this Expression, who, that will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
be ruled by the Scriptures, cannot submit unto it? Let us but look to
the very first place cited by himself, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. &amp; consider the whole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
discourse of the Apostle from <hi>Chap.</hi> I: 18. &amp; forward, &amp; particularly
<hi>Chap.</hi> 3: 19. Where the Apostle closeth his discourse, tending to evince
both jewes &amp; Gentils to be under the Curse, by saying, <hi>Now we know, that
what things so ever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law, that every
mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</hi> Is not this
to be understood, in respect of their own personal deeds &amp; works? See then
his conclusion, vers 20. <hi>Therefore by the deeds of of the law, there shall no flesh
be justified in his sight.</hi> Can any man, that hath not renounced common sense,
understand this otherwise, than that no man shall be justified in the sight of
God by his own personal works; seing this is the only native conclusion, that
floweth from the premisses; seing by their own personal works they can be
justified before men; &amp; seing the following words, <hi>for by the law is the
knowledge of sin,</hi> that is, the law proveth &amp; evinceth all, that we do, to be
short &amp; sinful, enforce this likewise? Is not this also enforced by these
words, vers 23. <hi>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God?</hi> Is it ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
that justification, through the Imputed obedience of Christ to the
law can evince, that we are not justified freely by His grace through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
that is in Jesus Christ, vers 24? If this general sense were the
true meaning, what ground was there for that vers 27. <hi>Where is boasting
then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? no, by the law of faith?</hi> Would
Justification by Christs obedience give ground of boasting? And what ground
were there for that objection vers 31. <hi>Do we then make void the law, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; in
the following <hi>Chapter,</hi> when speaking of <hi>Abraham,</hi> doth he or can any
man imagine, that the Apostle doth mean any other works, when
be denieth that Abraham was justified by works, than <hi>Abraham's</hi>
own personal works? And meaneth he, or can he meane any other
works, when he saith vers 4. <hi>Now to him, that worketh is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
not reckoned of grace, but of debt?</hi> But it were tedious to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
this matter further, that is so clear in it self to every ordinary
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104357:67"/>
Reader, that it must needs argue a desperat designe, together with unpasrallel'd
boldness, thus, with confidence &amp; peremptoriness, to assert the
contrary.</p>
               <p>He saith 2. <hi>If the Apostles charge had been, in delivering of this doctrine, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have made, or to have given allowance for any such distinction, certainly
he should have been unfaithful in his trust, in giving the honour, due to the
works of Christ, unto a thing of a far inferiour nature, viz to faith, as he doth
Gal.</hi> 2: 16. <hi>Where he saith not,</hi> but by the works of Jesus Christ, <hi>but</hi> by faith
<hi>Ans.</hi> This answere is, in a great measure, sick of the same distemper of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
with the former. We must not think, that the Apostle is still to
be blamed for unfaithfulness, when he speaketh not, as we would have him
speak: Christian sobr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ety should reach us, to search for Gods mind, in the
expressions He hath thought good to use, for signifying of His mind. These,
against whom the Apostle here wrote, &amp; whose errour, in the matter of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
he was confuting, never had a thought of such a general ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
sense, as we have here obtruded upon us; nor can it come into the
thought of any rational man; &amp; when then should we suppose, that the
Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>le should have spoken to such a thing? (2) <hi>Paul</hi> giveth not the honour,
due to the works of Christs, unto any thing of an Inferiour Nature, no not
to faith, whatever this Author, misunderstanding the Apostle's mind, &amp;
perverting his words, would make his Reader beleeve, as we shall have
occasion to shew hereafter. This Author setreth Christ and Faith at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance,
whileas the Apostle every where sheweth their agreement &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissoluble
union. (3) Taking faith, in this Authors sense, we see, That by
his own Confession, the ascribing of that unto faith, which he doth ascribe
to it, in the matter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ustification, is a giving of that honour unto it, which,
we say, is due to Christs obedience. So that the question betwixt him and
us, is, whether Christ and His obedience, or Faith of a far inferiour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
must have that honour? We see no ground to imagine, that <hi>Paul</hi>
would give the honour, that Universal obedience might call for, unto one
act of obedience, or think that he would cry up one act of obedience, that is,
faith, &amp; cry down all other acts of obedience: far less that he would cry up
faith, in prejudice of the full &amp; perfect obedience of Jesus Christ, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
and Surety.</p>
               <p>He <hi>saith 3. If Paul's intent had been, to have reserved a place in Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for the works of the law, as performed by Christ, his indefinite expression
would have been, as a snare upon men, to cause them passe over the great things of
their Iustification. Ans. Paul's</hi> indefinite expression neither was, nor could
have been a snare unto any; nor came such an imagination ever in the head
of any man, but such an one, as can stumble in the most even path, being
blinded with prejudice at the truth, &amp; drunk with love to his own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which he cannot otherwise maintaine, but by new and unheard-of
fictions. What great things of justification could, I pray, <hi>Paul's</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
cause any passe over? Why are not some of these great things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned?</p>
               <p>He saith 4. <hi>If this had been</hi> Paul's <hi>meaning, it cannot be once imagined, but
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:104357:67"/>
that he would have made use of such a distinction, or reservation, &amp; would have
been glad, if, without trenching upon some Gospel-truth, he could have come over
so neer unto the jewes, who where chiefly incensed against</hi> Paul, <hi>for passing over the
law in justification. Now had he said, that be did not exclude the righteousness of
the law by faith, but advance it rather; only he preached that they could not be
justified by their own observation of it; who seeth not how this would have taken off
great part of their opposition, Ans.</hi> It is a wonder to see, how some men can
shut their eyes, that they should not see what is most obvious, and what is
in plaine termes asserted in the Scriptures. Did not <hi>Paul</hi> say expresly enough,
<hi>Rom. 3. ult.</hi> That he did not make void the law through faith, but did esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
it? doth he not also plainly tell us, where the difference lay betwixt
him &amp; the jewes; &amp; what it was especially, at which they stumbled, when
he said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 31, 32. But <hi>Israel, which followed after the law of Righteou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sness,
hath not attained to the law of Righteousness; wherefore? Because they sought it
not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law, for they stumbled at that stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
stone.</hi> And againe <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 3, 4. <hi>But they being ignorant of God's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
&amp; going about to establish their own Righteousness, have not submitted
themselves unto the Righteousness of God; for Christ is the end of the law for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
&amp;c. Is it not hence clear, that they rejected Christ, and would not
owne Him, as the end of the law for Righteousness: &amp; that they stumbled
at Him, seeking after justification &amp; life, by their own personal following
after the law of Righteousness, &amp; by seeking to establish their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness?
How then can this man say <hi>pag. 61. That Paul was as far from
holding justification by the works of the law, as performed by Christ, as the jewes
were,</hi>
who would have nothing to do with Christ, but stumbled at Him,
while as <hi>Paul</hi> sought only to be found in Him, not having his owne Righteousness,
which is of the law; but that which is through the faith of Christ,
the Righteousness which is of God by faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9. And proclamed
Christ to be the end of the law for Righteousnes, to every one that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 4.</p>
               <p>Against <hi>Fit.</hi> 3: 5. where mention is made of the <hi>works of righteousness;
which we have done;</hi> &amp; a sufficient ground laid for the distinction mentioned,
&amp; to prevent the stumbling of such, as love to walk in the light, he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
several answers, <hi>pag.</hi> 62. &amp;c. <hi>As I. He never said, that the active righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ should be made a stander-by; but that it hath a blessed influence
into justification, as it issueth into His passive obedience, which together may be
called a Righteousness for which, but not with which we are justified, except it can
be proved to be either the Material, or formal, or instrumental cause of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp; whoever attempt to do this, will wholly dissolve the merite of it. Ans.</hi> (1) All
this maketh nothing to the purpose now in hand, which is to show, that
<hi>Paul</hi> by this expression cleareth sufficiently, what he meaneth by the works
of the law, which he excludeth from having any interest in justification,
<hi>viz.</hi> The works of the law, performed by us in our own persons. (2) What
influence the active obedience of Christ hath in justication, when he will not
admit it to be any part of that Surety-righteousness, which is imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, he showeth not; nor what way it issueth in to His passive obedience.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104357:68"/>
If all this influence be to make Him fit to be a Sacrifice, we have shown
above, that the personal Union did that; and consequently His active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
if it had no other influence, is made a meer stander by. (3.) A Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
<hi>for which,</hi> &amp; a Righteousness <hi>with which,</hi> is a distinction, in our case,
without a difference; for the one doth no way oppugne, or exclude the other,
because the meritorious cause imputed, made over to and reckoned upon
the score of beleevers, can be also that Righteousness with which they are
justified. (4) Whether it may be called the Material, or Formal cause of
justification (that any ever called it the instrumental cause, is more than I
know) is no great matter, seing it may be either, as the termes shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
which men are at freedom to do, according to their own minde,
when they apply them unto this matter, which hath so little affinity with
Effects meerly Natural, unto the causes of which these termes are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
applied: though I should choose rather to call it the <hi>formal objective</hi>
cause, if necessitated to use here philosophik termes. (3) That to
call Christ's whole Righteousness either the Material or Formal cause of
justification, is to overthrow the merite of it, is said, but not proved: It
is not these philosophical termes themselves, but the explication of them
by such, as use them in this matter, that is to be regarded: and none shall
ever show, that either of these termes, as explained by the orthodox, doth
overthrow the merite of Christ's Righteousness, both doth rather esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
it.</p>
               <p>He saith, 2. <hi>The H. Ghost may reject the works of men from being the cause of
such or such a thing, &amp; yet no wayes intimat, that the works of any other should be the
cause thereof, If the words had gone thus,</hi> not by the works of Righteousness,
which we our selves had done, <hi>this had been some what an higher ground, to have
inferred the opposite member of the distinction upon, viz. by the works of another, or
of Christ. Ans.</hi> This exception is as little to the purpose, as the former; for
these words were here brought only to show, what the Apostle meant by
the works of the law, which he excluded from justification, <hi>viz.</hi> the works
which we do: and not to prove immediatly, that the works of any other
were understood hereby. (2) It is foolish thing to imagine a distinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>works, which we do</hi> &amp; <hi>works, which we our selves, do,</hi> the same word
in the original, which vers 5. is rendered <hi>we,</hi> is rendered <hi>we our selves,</hi>
vers 3. What poor shifts are these, which men take to support a desperat
cause?</p>
               <p>He saith 3. <hi>To put the matter out of all question, that excluding the works of the
law, which we had done, he had no intent to imply the works, which another might
do, he expresseth the opposition thus,</hi> according to His mercy. <hi>Ans.</hi> The mistake is
still continued in: By these words, we onely cleare what the works are, which
are excluded; <hi>viz.</hi> our personal works, or works, which we do, or have done:
whose works else are accepted, other places prove expresly, &amp; this by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
unless the worke of a third could be alleiged. (2) The opposition
here made, destroyeth not the opposition, which we make: for when we are
justified &amp; Saved by the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ, we are
justified &amp; saved according to His mercy; as well as we are justified freely by
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104357:68"/>
His grace, when justified through the Redemption, that is in Jesus Christ,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 24.</p>
               <p>He <hi>saith</hi> 4. &amp; thereby seemeth to reply to what is last said. <hi>The Apostle
delivereth himself distinctly of that, wherein this Mercy of God, be speaks of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth,
viz. regenerating us, &amp;c. Ans.</hi> But, I hope, the Apostles men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
of Regeneration, doth not exclude the Imputation of Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
the ground thereof; nor can he suppose this, unless he plead with
<hi>Papists</hi> for justification by our good works, done after Regeneration, &amp; the
new birth.</p>
               <p>He saith 5. <hi>Such an inference is neither probable, nor pertinent to the purpose;
because the Apostle rejecteth the works of righteousness, which he nameth, from being
any cause, antecedaneously moving God to save us; &amp; not from being the formal
cause of justification: and we our selves</hi> (saith he) <hi>will not say, that the works of
the law, which Christ hath done, moved God to saveus. Ans.</hi> (1) The Inference,
which he here speaketh of, is his own, and not ours, as we have said.
(2) The Salvation here mentioned is comprehensive, and includeth Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
&amp; Adoption, as vers 7. cleareth; &amp; the Mercy, mentioned, v. 5.
comprehendeth all other subordinat causes &amp; meanes, which the Lord hath
appointed: &amp; though the obedience of Christ be no cause, moving God to
decree to save; yet it may be a cause of justification. <hi>But then</hi> (saith he <hi>pag.</hi>
65.) <hi>This will only establish the merite of Christ's Righteousness in justification,
but overthrow the formality of it.</hi> And why so? <hi>Because</hi> (sait be) <hi>it is unpossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that one and the self same thing, in respect of one and the self same effect, should
put on the different habitude both of the Formal &amp; Efficient cause. Ans.</hi> All this is
but vaine talk, &amp; a reasoning from termes of art, or philosophical notions
taken improperly, to the same taken most properly &amp; strickly; as if a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
polititical or legal effect were every way the same, with a Natural phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
effect: and yet in physical Effects, as such, meritorious causes have no
proper Efficiency: But, as to our case, we plainly say, that Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
is the meritorious cause of our justification, &amp; yet may be called
the formal cause thereof, as that terme may be adapted &amp; fitly explained, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the matter will bear; or the formal objective cause, which we
rather incline to.</p>
               <p>He speaketh against <hi>Gal.</hi> 4: 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 66. saying, that it is adduced to prove,
that <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth the works of the law, as done by Christ, in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of justification; &amp; consequently, that he had no intent to exclude the
works of the law, as done by Christ from having their part in justification.
But, as was shown above, there are many other places of Scripture evincing
this. Yet let us see what he saith. 1. <hi>The law, under which Christ was made,
is the ceremonial law, as is clear vers 5. we are not redeemed from the Moral law,
which is of eternal obligation; but from the Ceremonial law. Ans.</hi> (1) That Christ
was made under the Ceremonial law only, no reason can evince; for He
was made under that law, under the curse whereof we were, who were to
be delivered there from by Him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 10, 12. But this was not the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
law only; otherwise he should have died only for the jewes. <hi>Againe,</hi>
The law, which he speaketh of, was ordained by Angels, in the hand of a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104357:69"/>
Mediator, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 17, 19. but this was the Moral law, contained in the decalogue.
Is the ceremonial law only that law, that cannot give life vers 21.
was nothing a Schoolmaster to Christ, but the ceremonial part of the law,
vers 24. (2) To be under the law, is not only to be under the lawes obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but chiefly to be under the lawes Curse, which is the same with being
<hi>concluded under sin, Gal.</hi> 3: 22. (3) If being under the law be thus limited,
or restricked, to a being under the obligation of the ceremonial law, no
more can be meaned, by <hi>receiving the Adoptions of Sones,</hi> there mentioned,
as the opposite mercy, than a freedom from the yoke of the ceremonial law!
but this, I suppose, will be too narrow an Interpretation. (4) Though none
be redeemed from obedience to the Moral law; yet they may be delivered
there from, as the sole condition of the Covenant, &amp; as the sole way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
life. 2. He saith, <hi>hereby may be meaned His subjection to the curse of the
law. Ans.</hi> That this may be part of the meaning, may very easily be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
&amp; what then can hence follow? The expression of <hi>being under the law,</hi>
hath not alwayes this single and sole import, as we see in that same <hi>Chapter,
vers</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Chap. 4. pag.</hi> 69. He argueth from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 21, 22. thus, <hi>If the
Righteousness, of faith, which is here called the Righteousness of God, consists in
the Imputation of Christs Righteousness, then is it not, nor can it be, made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
without the law, that is, without the works of the law. But the Righteousness
of faith is sufficiently manifested without the law, that is without the works or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the law.</hi> Ergo. The connexion of the <hi>Major</hi> he thus confirmeth.
<hi>Because to such a Righteousness the law, and the works thereof, are every white as
necessary than faith it self; for faith is made only a Meanes of the derivation of it
upon men; but the body &amp; substance of the Righteousness it self is nothing else, but
the pure law, &amp; the works of it. Ans.</hi> The connexion of the <hi>Major</hi> is unsound,
and its probation is founded upon a manifest wresting, or misinterpretation
of the place: for the meaning of these words, <hi>The Righteousness of God without
the law,</hi> is this, The Righteousness of God, which is not had by our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the commands of the law, or, doth not consist therein; not,
the Righteousness of God, which is without all obedience to the law: for
there be no such Righteousness; all Righteousness being a conformity to the
law of God; &amp; if Righteousness consist not in obeying the law of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
shall it consist? The Righteousness then of God is a Righteousness consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
indeed in full obedience to the law; but yet a Righteousness consisting
in obedience to the law, performed by one, who was God (&amp; therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
called the Righteousness of God; &amp; not meerly because invented by God;
or because bestowed by Him upon men; or because such, as will only be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of by Him, as he saith; though these be also true, &amp; may in part
ground the denomination) &amp; not by ou rselves, who were properly and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
under the obligation of the law.</p>
               <p>This will not satisfie him, &amp; therefore he saith. I. <hi>This sanctuary hath been
polluted, &amp; the hornes of ibis altar broken down, in the demonstration of the former
proof. Ans.</hi> The contrary is manifest from our foregoing examination of that
supposed demonstration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:104357:69"/>
He saith 2. <hi>There is not the least intimation given, that the Apostle should have
any such by, or back meaning, as this. Ans.</hi> Nor was there any necessity, for
any express mention hereof; not only because the party, the Apostle had
here mainely to deal with, understood nothing else by the law, but our obedience
performed thereunto; knowing the meaning of the law to be this,
<hi>he that doth these things shall live by them;</hi> but also because the whole scope and
manner of argueing of the Apostle, &amp; his whole procedure in this debate,
manifest this to be the meaning: for having convinced both jewes and Gentiles
to be under the law, as guilty before God, he inferreth, that <hi>therefore
by the deeds of the law, there shall no flesh be justified, Rom.</hi> 3: 20. That is, by
their own deeds or actions: for the law to them can do nothing, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of sin, &amp; binde guilt more upon them. But it did not so to Christ,
who yeelded perfect obedience. We might also demonstrate this from the
Apostles following discourse, if it were necessary; but we said enough of
this, in answere to the foregoing objection.</p>
               <p>He saith 3. <hi>The works of the law are never the less the works of the law, because
performed by Christ. Ans.</hi> Yet when performed by Christ, they are not the
works of the law done by us, who did lye under the obligation; and by the
Imputation of such an obedience, as was performed by Christ, we have no
ground of boasting or of glorying, either before God, or Man: and it is
against such an obedience to the law, as the ground of justification, as doth
not exclude glorying or boasting, and such as consisteth in works of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which we have done, &amp; is exclusive offree grace, that the Apostle disputeth.</p>
               <p>He saith 4. <hi>This righteousness is said to receive testimony from the law, that is,
from that part of Scripture, which is often called the law; and from the Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.
Now, neither of these give any testimony to such a Righteousness, but to a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
procured or derived upon a man by faith, Gen.</hi> 15: 6. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2: 4. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is
true, this Righteousness receiveth testimony from the law, and from the
writtings of the Prophets; &amp; we plead for no other Righteousness, but such,
as is so testified of, &amp; hath the concurrent consent both of the O. and of the
<hi>N. Testament.</hi> Both law &amp; Prophets, that spoke of <hi>the seed of the Woman,</hi> &amp;
<hi>of the Messiah,</hi> &amp; of His being <hi>the Lord our Righteousness,</hi> or spoke of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
duty in reference to Him, as such, did bear witness to this Truth.
(2) What is that Righteousness, which is here said to be procured, or deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon a Man by faith? Is it the Righteousness of Christ? Then the cause
is yeelded. Is it the Righteousness of men themselves? Then justification by
works is established, &amp; the whole Gospel is overthrown. And how, I pray,
can this besaid to be procured or derived upon a man by faith? The places ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
speak of no such thing, but have a far contrary Import, as may hereafter
appear.</p>
               <p>He <hi>saith 5. This Righteousness of God is said to be</hi> unto all, &amp; upon all <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
by or through faith, <hi>by way of opposition to the works of the law: Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Faith &amp; the works of the law, there is a constant opposition; but between the
law and the works of righteousness of Christ, there is no opposition. Ans.</hi> (1) If this
Righteousness be unto and upon all, by or through faith, it must of necessity
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104357:70"/>
be the Righteousness of another, in bringing home and applying of which,
faith is an Instrument: &amp; to this way of bringing in the Righteousness of God
by faith from without, is the seeking of Righteousness by our own works, or
by our own acts of obedience to the law, manifestly opposite &amp; irreconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
&amp; this is the opposition, which the Scripture alwayes maketh, betwixt
justification by the law, &amp; by faith, as the very Scriptures, cited
by himself, make manifest, <hi>to wit, Rom.</hi> 3: 27, 28. &amp; 4: 13, 14. &amp; 9: 32. &amp;
10: 5, 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 16. &amp; 3: 5, 11, 12. &amp;c. (2) This argument &amp; all the steps of
its prosecution, make against himself, who will have our act of faith to be
the Righteousness of God, though it be no where so called; &amp; cannot be
that, which is by, or through faith; for faith is not by or through faith;
nor doth faith become a Righteousness by, or through faith: nor is faith,
as our act, against the law, otherwise it should be no act of obedience, but
a piece of willworship; and consequently no righteousness at all but an
unrighteousness, &amp; a plaine disobedience, or a work of Supererogation:
nor do the law or Prophets, any where, testify to this, as our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</p>

5: 16, 17. thus. <hi>The gift
of righteousness (as it is called vers</hi> 17.) <hi>which is by Christ, in the Gospel, &amp; is
said vers 16. to be a free gift of many offences unto justification, that is the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of many offences, cannot be a perfect legal righteousnes imputed unto vs, or
made ours by Imputation, but the righteousness which is by Christ in the Gospel, is
the gift of many offences.</hi> Ergo, &amp;c. The <hi>Major</hi> he thus confirmeth. <hi>That
righteousness, which extends unto a mans justification, by the forginess of sins, can
be no perfect legal righteousness imputed. But the righteousness of Christ, in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,

of sins.</hi> Ergo, &amp;c. The <hi>Major</hi> of this, he thus proveth. <hi>Because a legal

                     </gap>t yea such
a justification, with which forgiveness of sins, is not competible: for what need
hath he, that is legally righteous, or hath a legal righteousness imputed to him, of
forgiveness of sins, when as such a rightousness excluded all sin, &amp; all guilt of sin
from his person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all which I <hi>ans.</hi> (1) The <hi>Major propos.</hi> of the two Syllogis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, is true
only of a perfect righteousness, wrought by our selves, in conformity to
the law; and not of the Righteousness of another imputed to us; which
though it may be called <hi>legal,</hi> as to Christ, as consisting in perfect obedience
&amp; conformity to the law; yet is rather to be called <hi>Evangelical,</hi> as to us,
upon the account of its discovery and revelation, and manner of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
unto us. (2) The confirmation of the <hi>Major</hi> is likewise only true of a
righteousness performed by our selves: for that indeed excludeth all Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
and therefore if our faith be accounted our righteousness (as he faith) it
must be our justification, &amp; so, inconsistent with free forgiveness. (3) As to
the Scripture, where upon all this founded. I say, The text saith not, that
our righteousness is only free forgiveness; but that in reference to pardon &amp;
free forgiveness, there is a gift bestowed; &amp; that this gift by grace, which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104357:70"/>
aboundeth unto many, is attended with free forgiveness, as a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent.
It is <hi>the free gift, that cometh upon all men unto justification</hi> vers 18. &amp;
that, by which <hi>many are made righteous</hi> vers 19. &amp; therefore is called the
<hi>gift of righteousness,</hi> vers 17.</p>
               <p>He objecteth against himself thus, <hi>A man's sins are first forgiven him, and
then this perfect righteousness of Christ is imputed unto him; and so he is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
But this is not the thing we would say, but on the contrary,
That first the perfect Righteousness of Christ is imputed, whereupon the
beleever is justified &amp; pardoned, Let us hear his answer.</p>
               <p>1. He saith, <hi>If we will needs distinguish the effects of the active &amp; passive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Christ, so as from the active part to fetch a perfect righteousness for Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
&amp; from the passive remission of sins; yet whether it be any wayes reasonable to
invert the order, I leave to sober consideration. Christ did not first die, &amp; after death
keep the law; therefore reason requireth, that what is first purchased, should be first
received &amp; applied. Ans.</hi> I see no necessity of distinguishing, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the Effects of Christ's active &amp; passive obedience; but judge it best, to
keep as conjoined what divine wisdom hath firmerly &amp; inseparably joined
together: But though we should thus needlesly distinguish these effects; yet
there is no necessity of saying, That Christ's obedience, because first
existing, should be first imputed unto justification; and then His death to
Remission: for neither do we assigne justification to His active obedience on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
nor is the same order to be observed, in the application of the Effects,
that was observed in Christ's performance, of what was laid upon Him, and
required of Him, as our Sponsor: for the Nature of the thing required,
that Christ should first have obeyed, before He died: &amp; on the other hand,
the condition of sinners requireth, that they be first justified and pardoned,
before they have a right to all the Effects of Christ's active obedience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</p>
               <p>2. He saith, <hi>If a man hath once sinned, it is not any legal righteousness what
so ever imputed, that can justifie him. Ans.</hi> This is granted; But in order to
justification we say, That Christ's whole Surety-righteousness is imputed; &amp;
this comprehendeth both His active &amp; His passive obedience, so usually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished.</p>
               <p>3. He saith, <hi>If a mans sins be once forgiven him, he hath no need of any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
righteousness for his justification; because forgiveness of sins reacheth home,
&amp; amounteth unto a full justification with God. Ans.</hi> If justification were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, but forgiveness of sins, there would be some colour for this:
but in justification there is also an accepting of the man as righteous, &amp; to
this a meer pardon of sins will not serve: for a Righteousness is hereunto
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite; &amp; pardon of sins and Righteousness are not one thing. It is false
then to say, as he addeth, <hi>That this is all the justification, the Scripture knowes,
or speaks of, the forgiveness of sins, or acquiting from condemnation.</hi> For both
according to Scripture, and the native import, and universal usage of the
word, justification denoteth a constituting legally and declaring solemnely a
person to be righteous, or free of the accusation, given in against him; or
a pronouncing of an accused man to be righteous; &amp; therefore supposeth,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104357:71"/>
when the sentence is just, that the person is a righteous person: &amp;, in our
case, the sentence of God being according to truth, the person justified,
having no righteousness of his own, must be clothed with the Surety-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ, as Surety, Head &amp; Husband, imputed to him &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by faith.</p>
               <p>He addeth, <hi>That righteousness, which we have by Christ, and where with we
are said to be justified, is only a negative righteousness, not a positive: It is nothing
else, but a non-Imputation of sin, which I therefore call a Righteousness by Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as having the privileges, but not the nature &amp; substance of a perfect legal
righteousness, Ans.</hi> A Righteousness not positive, but meerly negative, is
no righteousness at all; for a true Righteousness is a positive conformity unto
the law, the Rule of Righteousness; and as the Righteousness is but nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Interpretatively such; so must the justification be, that is founded
thereupon. He thinketh to prove this from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7, 8. &amp; addeth, <hi>a
Righteousness without works must needs be a negative or privative Righteousness. The
Imputation of righteousness vers 6. is interpreted vers 7, 8. to be a not imputing of
sin. Ans.</hi> The place cited, as we declared above, giveth no countenance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this sense of the word <hi>justification;</hi> but evinceth rather the contrary. A
righteousness without our works (which is the Apostles meaning) may be, &amp;
is no negative, nor privative Righteousness; but a positive, full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Righteousness, being the Surety-righteousnes of Christ, the Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor:
and the Text saith, not, That this Righteousness is nothing else, than
a non-Imputation of sin, but inferreth rather the Imputation of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
as the cause, from the Non-Imputation of sin, as the Effect;
and all this to prove, that justification is not by the works of the law.</p>
               <p>He tels us, <hi>that we have the like description of this Righteousnes, 2 Cor. 5. that
which vers 19. he calls in God, the</hi> not imputing of our sins unto us, <hi>he calls in
us vers</hi> 21. a being made the righteousness of God in Him. <hi>Ans.</hi> This is a
plaine perversion of the scope of the meaning of the words: for vers 21. the
Apostle is giving the ground &amp; reason of what was said vers 19. &amp; showing
how this Reconciliation &amp; Non-Imputation of sin is founded, &amp; what is
the special ground thereof; as appeareth by the particle <hi>for</hi> vers 21. <hi>for He
hath made Him sin,</hi> &amp;c. He saith, <hi>This is most plaine, Act.</hi> 13: 38, 39. <hi>where
forgiveness of sins is immediatly thereafter called justification. Ans.</hi> All that can
be hence inferred, is, that in justification sins are pardoned; or that such
as have forgiveness of sins are justified; or that these do inseparably go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But no appearance of proof here, that they are both one thing; or
that in justification there is no more, but pardon of sins.</p>
               <p>He prosecuteth this purpose yet further, saying, <hi>This is the most usual &amp; proper
signification of the word,</hi> justifie, <hi>not to signify the giving or bestowing of a compleat
positive righteousness; but only an acquiting or discharging &amp; setting a man free from
guilt &amp; penalty, due unto such things, as were laid to his charge. Ans.</hi> (1) Nor
do we say, that <hi>justification</hi> signifieth such a giving &amp; bestowing of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
positive Righteousness; but that it signifieth a declaring &amp; pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of a person to be righteous: &amp; therefore presupposeth this giving or be
stowing of a compleat Righteousness; for the man, whom God declareth
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104357:71"/>
&amp; pronounceth to be Righteous, must be Righteous; &amp; seing he hath no
Righteousness of his own, he must have his Suretie's Righteousness imputed
to him. (2) And so, in this sense, justification is an acquitting, or setting
a man free from the guilt &amp; penalty, due to such things, as were laid to his
charge; for he is pronounced Righteous. But it is not a simple discharge of
the person from the guilt and penalty, upon a pardon &amp; Remission: for a
pardoned man is not a justified man, but rather is supposed to be guilty, &amp;
is pardoned, because guilty.</p>
               <p>He proceedeth, <hi>In the Scripture, it is usually opposed to condemning Prov.</hi> 17:
15. <hi>Where, by justifying the wicked, nothing is meart, but the making of them
just, in the rights &amp; privileges of just men, which are freedom from censure, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
&amp;c. So that by</hi> justifying the wicked, <hi>nothing else is meant, but the
not condemning of him, Rom.</hi> 8: 33, 34, &amp; 5: 19. <hi>Therefore by</hi> justifying <hi>nothing
else is meant, but acquitting from condemnation; &amp; so to be justified &amp; live are
equipollent, Gal.</hi> 3: 11, 21. <hi>Esai,</hi> 53: 11. <hi>Ans.</hi> (1) That <hi>justifying</hi> is opposed
to <hi>condemning,</hi> is granted; but this maketh for us; for condemning is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing-else,
than a not pardoning, even a pronouncing or declaring of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
guilty; &amp; therefore an adjuging of him to the punishment, due for the
guilt; and therefore justification must be something else than pardon. (2) Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
is more than not condemning; for not condemning may be a meer
suspending of the sentence of condemnation; &amp; while the Process is under
tryal, or the guilty person not yet convicted in law, he is not condemned;
yet he is not therefore justified. (3) When <hi>justification &amp; life</hi> are said to be
equipollent, it is manifest, that justification is more than pardon, even an
adjudging of one to the reward promised: for <hi>life</hi> here is not a meer Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
or privative life, but a positive life, called a <hi>Reigning in life, Rom.</hi> 5: 17.
&amp; <hi>the blessing of Abraham Gal.</hi> 3: 14. the <hi>promise of the Spirit, ibid.</hi> &amp; all the <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of the Covenant vers</hi> 17. &amp; the <hi>Inheritance vers</hi> 18. Here then is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt justification in our case, &amp; justification among men: for among
men, justification is usually in reference to the Accusation given-in; &amp; the
accusation beareth a reference only unto the sin committed &amp; to the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due to such or such transgressours: so that the justified man is declared
not guilty, &amp; therefore not liable unto the penalty; but there is no word
here of a Reward, due to the observers of the law, unless in cases, where a
reward is expresly promised. And yet, even where there is no more, but
a simple declaring of the person not guilty, &amp; so not liable to the punishment,
justification is more than meer pardon. But in our case, when the Lord justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the Beleever, He not only declareth him not liable to the punishment,
due to transgressours of the law; but also adjudgeth him to the Reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to the observers: and therefore here the person is declared and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
righteous, having a right to the reward, through imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourhtly,</hi> He objecteth from <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9. This objection must be hard-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
&amp; sheweth, with what confidence, some men, once in love with
their own darling conceipt, can abuse the most plaine passages of Scripture:
for what can be more plaine &amp; full against our Adversaries, than is this
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104357:72"/>
Text? The Apostle is here shewing, upon what ground he desired to stand,
in his appearing before God, &amp; expresly renounceth all his former privileges,
&amp; what once he had an high esteem for; &amp; particularly also his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
of whatsoever kind, that consisted in his obedience to the law; &amp;
he saith not, <hi>which consisteth in my full obedience to the law;</hi> but, <hi>in mine own
righteousness, which is of the law.</hi> And, in opposition to all this, he desireth
to be found in Christ, stated &amp; hid in Him, which includeth Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness: for Christ &amp; His Righteousness are not separated; &amp; the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
he also expresly mentioneth, calling it, that <hi>which is through the
faith of Christ,</hi> &amp; againe, <hi>the Righteousness, which is of God by faith.</hi> By which
he cannot meane the act of faith, for that is his own righteousness, all which
he renounced; for it was conforme to the law &amp; commandement, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
by the law of God, otherwise it had been no act of obedience. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over;
Faith is not through faith, nor by faith; but this Righteousness,
which <hi>Paul</hi> sought after, is a righteousness, that is through faith &amp; by faith,
as an Instrument laying hold upon it, &amp; applying it; Faith cannot be that
Righteousness, which is through faith, or by the faith of Christ; for if so,
Christ should be rendered useless, &amp; the nature of faith in Christ should be
changed, seing true faith in Christ carrieth the soul out of it self to Christ,
to the end a Righteousness may be had. Faith, sure, is not the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which is of God, wrought by God, &amp; imputed by Him. So that when
<hi>Paul</hi> desired to be found in Christ, having the Righteousness, which is
through faith in Christ, even the Righteousness, which is of God by faith,
what can be more plaine, than that he desired to be found in the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, which is imputed by God, &amp; received by faith?</p>
               <p>As to this place, our Adversary frameth no formal argument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
but hath some observes, tending rather to make it useless to our
point, than directly to confirme his own <hi>Chap. 6. pag.</hi> 84. I shall only
take notice of such things, as he alleigeth to darken the glorious light
of the grace of God, shineing with a meridian brightness in this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</p>
               <p>He (i. e. <hi>Paul) doth not say</hi> (saith he) <hi>that he may be</hi> found in His righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<hi>much less in</hi> His righteousness imputed to him; <hi>but simply</hi> in Himself;
<hi>which is an usual expression in Scripture of the Spiritual state &amp; condition of a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Ans.</hi> (1) To be found in Christ, who is the publick person &amp; Surety, is
to be found in His Surety-righteousness: for Christ &amp; His Righteousness are
no more separated, than a Surety, as such, and his Surety-payment
and satisfaction: And therefore, when <hi>Paul</hi> spoke of being <hi>found in
Him,</hi> he emphatically enough expressed what we say. (2) It is true, the
expression, <hi>in Christ,</hi> doth else-where denote a spiritual state, but here
<hi>Paul</hi> speaketh not simply of being in Christ, but of being in Him, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the having of a Righteousness, wherewith to appear before God; in
order to which, he had renounced all his former privileges and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What it is</hi> (saith he) <hi>to be found in Christ, he expresseth, negatively thus,</hi> not
having mine own righteousness, <hi>yet not simply &amp; altogether, no righteousness,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104357:72"/>
that may in no sense be called his own; but precisely &amp; determinatly no</hi> such righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
<hi>as his own, which stands</hi> in works of the law; <hi>such he must be sure,
not to have; i. e. not to trust to, or to shroud &amp; shelter himself under, from the
stroke of Gods justice. Ans.</hi> Then faith, considered as an act of obedience, must
not be that Righteousness, under which he could think to shelter himself
from the stroke of justice: for that stands in one work of the law; &amp; if that
righteousness be renounced, which standeth in works of the law; much more
must that be renounced, which standeth in one work of the law. (2) The
Righteousness of Christ, imputed &amp; received by faith, may in some sense be
called the Beleevers own: but that Righteousness, which the Apostle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
his own here, is opposed to the Righteousness of another, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
all his own acts &amp; works, done in obedience to the command of
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next</hi> (he saith) <hi>affirmativly thus,</hi> but that, which is through the faith of
Christ, &amp;c. <hi>Here is not the least jot or title of any Righteousness, he should have
by Imputation, no nor of any Righteousness by or through tht Righteousness of Christ;
but only such a Righteousness, as is through the faith of Christ. Ans.</hi> (1) When all
that Righteousness is excluded, which is in mans self, or in any acts of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the law, which he doth; &amp; yet a Righteousness mentioned as the
only refuge &amp; sheltering place, what can this Righteousness be else, than an
Imputed Righteousness? &amp; what can this Imputed Righteousness be: if it
be not the Righteousness of Christ? Is there any other that will do our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
(2) A Righteousness through faith in Christ is most clearly a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
obtained, possessed &amp; laid hold on by faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Apostle addeth</hi> (saith he) <hi>by way of commendation of this Righteousness, that
it is</hi> the Righteousness of God i.e. <hi>a righteousness, which God himself hath found
out, &amp; which He will owne &amp; countenance, even the righteousness of God, which is

(1) It is not only a Righteousness, which God himself hath found out, and
which He owneth &amp; countenanceth; but a Righteousness also, which is in
God, or is in Him, who is God, &amp; is derived from Him to man; for it is
a Righteousness, that is not to be found in man, or in any thing he doth, in
conformity to the law of God, all such Righteousness being already renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the Apostle. (2) The Righteousness of God, which is by, or through
saith, &amp; cometh, accrueth, or is derived upon a man in &amp; by faith, must
needs be some thing else, than faith it self, even the Righteousness, that is
without a man, &amp; is derived unto him from another, <hi>viz.</hi> from Him, who
is God, &amp; on whom faith laith hold, that is, Jesus Christ, in whom alone the
Apostle was seeking to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly, Chap. 7. pag. 88. &amp;c.</hi> He abuseth to this end all those Scriptures,
wherein justification is ascribed unto faith, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5: 1. As to the
Interest of faith, in the matter of justification, we will have occasion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to speak of it, at some length: here we are only enquiring after that
Righteousness, upon the account of which, we are justified, which our
Adversary, as it would appear, placeth only in faith: and so, in stead of
making faith the meane of applying &amp; bringing home the Surety-righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:104357:73"/>
of Christ, he maketh it the very formal righteousness it self, upon the
account of, and because of which we are justified. Let us hear what he
saith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When men say</hi> (saith he) <hi>that</hi> faith justifieth, <hi>I demand, what is it, they
meane by faith? do they not meane their beleeving of act or faith? Ans.</hi> When the
Scripture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith, That we are justified by faith, faith is taken for our act of
faith, laying hold on Christ &amp; on His Righteousness, it being the mean ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of God for this end, by interessing us in &amp; uniting us with Christ,
&amp; applying that Surety-righteousness of His. But this can no way prove, that
therefore faith it selt is that Riphteousness, upon the account whereof we
are declared Righteous in the sight of God, in order to justification; or is
the formal objective Reason of our justification. Though faith be said to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie,
as an Instrumental cause (as this Author himself afterward confesseth)
it will not follow, that therefore it justifieth as a principal cause, or as the
formal objective cause. The hand receiving riches doth instrumentally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich;
but is not the principal cause of the mans riches. The producing, in
face of court, of the Surety's payment, by the principal debtor, now pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
by the creditor, is not the formal ground of the debtor's absolution
from the charge, but the payment it self, which is instructed, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
formal ground, though the Instruction of that payment by the debtor,
in face of court, be requisite in its place, and a mean to the debtor's abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>he conceiveth not of faith as divided, or severed from its object, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christ in person, or Christ in promise. Ans.</hi> It is true, the act cannot be
conceived without its object; &amp; all the consideration of the object
here had by him, is by vertue of the act reaching the object, &amp; so the act is
only considered by him no further, than as a commanded duty, or as any
other act of the Soul, which is commanded: and beside, this faith, thus
acting on Christ, is but an historical faith: for if he consider faith, as acting
on Christ, according to the Gospel, &amp; as it is called Justifying or Saving
faith, in distinction from the faith of Miracles, &amp; from Historical faith, he
must look upon it, as the soul's fleeing out of it self to Christ for refuge; and
as laying hold on His Righteousness as only sufficient; and as receiving, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceing,
leaning to and resting upon Christ and His Righteousness; whence
it is manifest, that it cannot be conceived, nor looked to, nor rested upon,
as our Righteousness, its use &amp; work being to bring-in and receive another
gifted Righteousness, and to rest upon that for life, Justification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ls us <hi>next,</hi> That <hi>he also confesseth, that saith justifieth instrumentally, &amp;
not otherwise; &amp; that he hath neither said, nor intended to say any other thing. Ans.</hi>
But how this can agree with what he hath said, &amp; with what hereafter we
shall hear him saying, let men of understanding judge. Did ever man before
acknowledg faith, to justifie instrumentally, &amp; yet deny the Imputation of
the Righteousness of Christ, as he doth? and yet assert that this Instrument
faith is imputed for our Righteousness, for our only Righteousness, and as
the only formal ground of our justification, as he doth? Did ever man assert
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104357:73"/>
this Instrumentality of faith, to shoulder-out the chiefe and principal Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
that the Surety-righteousness of Christ hath, in the business? This
therefore must be looked upon, as inconsistent with his only designe, in
this whole book; and as an unwary expression overturning all; or else that
he must have said all this in an hid sense, not yet understood.</p>
               <p>To that, That faith justifieth, as it taketh hold of Christ's Righteousness,
he answereth, <hi>That yet it is the act of faith that justifieth. Ans.</hi> And did ever
any meane otherwise, when they spoke of faith as an Instrument, or mean?
But that is not our present question: we are now enquireing after that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
for which, &amp; upon the account of which we are justified; and
not after the Instrument, or Mean, by which we are possessed of that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
upon the account of which alone we are justified, &amp; by which
we are put into a state of Justification. So that all this waste of words is to no
purpose.</p>
               <p>He moveth another objection against himself, thus, <hi>If it be said, that</hi>
when we are justified by faith, <hi>the meaning is,</hi> we are justified by that,
which faith apprehendeth; <hi>&amp; this is far from saying,</hi> that faith is imputed
for Righteousness.</p>
               <p>Here I can observe nothing but confusion, &amp; a jumbling together, as one,
these two far different Questions, <hi>viz.</hi> What is that Righteousness, for,
because and upon the account of which we are justified: &amp; what is that way,
Mean, or Instrument, by which we partake of Righteousness, unto Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
&amp; are justified. Here is a manifest confounding of the principal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
cause, &amp; the Instrumental cause: of the formal objective cause
(which some call the <hi>Formal,</hi> others the <hi>Material</hi> cause) and the Inferiour
Meane, or Instrumental cause. Here also these two are confounded &amp; made
one, <hi>viz. We are justified by faith; &amp; faith is Imputed unto Righteousness.</hi> That
these are far different, shall be cleared hereafter. But what answereth he?
He saith 1. <hi>If their meaning be simply so, that we are justified by that, which
faith apprehendeth, they speak more truth, than they are aware of. But that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
faith apprehendeth should justify, is not true. Ans.</hi> Who speaketh thus,
I know not; yet I see little danger in it, their meaning being only this, in
that expression, <hi>we are justified by that, which faith apprendeth,</hi> that Christ &amp;
His Righteousness, which justifying faith, in the act of justifying, laith hold
on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the formal objective cause, or that upon the account of which we are
justified: &amp; this no way saith, that our faith is that Righteousness, for which
we are justified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next</hi> he saith, <hi>If men ascribe justification, in every respect, to that, which
faith apprehendeth, they destroy the Instrumental Iustification of faith. Ans.</hi> No
man, that I know, doth or will ascribe Justification, in every respect, unto
that which faith apprehendeth, &amp; so, they need not destroy the Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
use of faith in Justification; for as to the Instrumental justification of
faith, I understand it not; it seemeth to be a very catachrestick expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion.</p>
               <p>In end, he addeth, <hi>If faith justifieth any way, it must of necessity be by</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
<hi>or</hi> account <hi>from God,</hi> for righteousness; <hi>because it is all that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104357:74"/>
of men to their justification, in stead of the</hi> righteousness of the law.
<hi>Therefore if God shall not</hi> impute, <hi>or</hi> account <hi>it to them for this</hi> righteousness, <hi>it
would stand them in no stead at all to their justification; because there is nothing
useful, or available to any holy, or saving purpose, but only to that, whereunto God
hath assigned it. If God in the New Covenant, requires faith in Christ, for our
justification, in stead of the</hi> righteousness of the law, <hi>in the old, &amp; this faith
will not passe in account with him for such righteousness, but his command and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
for beleeving, and the obedience it self of beleeving, will both become void,
&amp; of none effect, the intire benefite of them being suspended upon the gracious plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
&amp; purpose of God, in the designation of them to their end. Ans.</hi> Whatever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
or place Faith hath, in the <hi>New Cov.</hi> &amp; in the matter of justification,
it hath it from Gods sole appointment &amp; designation, &amp; it is all that, which
is now required of us, in order to our justification, &amp; entering into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God: yet unless we change &amp; alter its true nature, and assigne
another place &amp; power to it, that God hath, the Crown is keeped on the
head of the Mediator, &amp; His Righteousness is only owned, received, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the sinner, as it were, in face of Court, &amp; rested upon by faith, in
order to justification. But when faith is said to be imputed for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
that is, when our act of beleeving is made our Righteousness, &amp; said
to be so accounted &amp; esteemed by God; &amp; all this to shoot out the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ, and to take away the Imputation thereof to us, as the
only ground of our justification, not only are the native &amp; kindly actings of
justifying faith destroyed; but the very nature &amp; gentus of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is altered, &amp; it is made to be the same, in kinde, with the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
with this gradual difference, that the <hi>first</hi> Covenant required full &amp;
perfect obedience; the <hi>second</hi> one act of obedience only, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith, as a
Peppercorn (as some speak) in stead of a great rent, &amp; our whole Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:
for no other Righteousness will our adversaries grant to be really
imputed to us, save what they grant of the Imputation of Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
only as to Effects, and thus they make the Lord to repute (for that
is the meaning of <hi>imputing</hi> with them) that to be a Righteousness, which,
at best, is but imperfect, &amp; not every way conforme to the command of
God, enjoining it. Whereby thus one imperfect act of obedience, <hi>viz.</hi>
Faith, is made that, whereupon the wakened sinner is to rest, and lay his
whole weight, &amp; wherein he is to refuge himself from the wrath of God, &amp;
which he is to hold up, as his legal defence, against all accusations, coming
in against him: and all this use is to be made of faith immediatly, in stead
of Christ, &amp; His Surety-righteousness. Whence we see, that it is false to
say. (1) <hi>That if faith justifieth any way, it must of necessity be by Imputation
for righteousness:</hi> For it justifieth as the mean appointed of God, to lay hold
on an Imputed Righteousness, and to carry the soul forth thereunto. The
reason added is vaine, for though it be all that God requires of men to their
justification, it is not that Rightheousness, which is imputed unto Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the ground thereof; but the Mean or Instrument of a soul's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of that Righteousness of Christ, which is the only ground, or formal
objective reason. (2) It is false to say, <hi>That if God shall not account it to them
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104357:74"/>
for righteousness, it shall stand them in no stead to justification.</hi> For it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as the meane, whereby the Sinner is married unto Christ, &amp; partaketh
of His Righteousness, in order to justification; and is as the legal produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the righteousness of the Surety, in face of court, as the ground of
absolution to be pleaded &amp; stood unto. The reason he here addeth is of no
force, because faith is assigned of God to this end &amp; purpose, as the Gospel
cleareth; &amp; only to this end, that so the Mediator alone may weare the
Crown, &amp; beare the weight of sinners; &amp; nothing in us, or from us may
share with Him, in that glory. It is false (3) to say, or suppose (as his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words intimate) <hi>That faith in the New Covenant hath the same place,
force &amp; efficacy, which the righteousness of the law had, in the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi>
For then Faith should be Meritorious <hi>ex pacto,</hi> &amp; should give ground
of glorying before men. It is (4) false to say, <hi>That if faith hath not this place, force
&amp; efficacy in the New Covenant, the command for beleeving, &amp; beleeving it self shall
be vaine.</hi> Seing it hath another use designed to it of God; and it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for another end, as is said, according to the gracious pleasure &amp; purpose
of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly Chap.</hi> 8. pag. 93. &amp;c. he argueth from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 12. thus, <hi>If the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
do not only no where establish, but in any place absolutely deny a possibility of
the translation or removing of the Righteousness of Christ from one person to another,
then there is no Imputation of Christ's Righteousness. But the former is emphatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true from this place.</hi> Ergo, &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> This, upon the matter, is but what
<hi>Socinus</hi> said <hi>lib. 3. cap. 3. viz.</hi> That one mans deed can no more be the deed of
another, than one mans death, or paine can be the death or paine of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
&amp; that in deeds of the law, the deed it self is not simply called for,
but the proper deed of every one, who is under the law: &amp; that nothing
can be more ridiculous, than to say, that one mans righteousness can be the
righteousness of another, who is unrighteous in himself: &amp; that it is against
common sense, to say, that one may obey for another. But howbeit we
easily grant, there neither is, nor can be any physical translation or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Righteousness from one to another: yet to deny all legal translation,
is to deny all Suretiship &amp; cautionry; yea and all Satisfection: &amp; therefore
the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who see the force of this consequence, do peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that Christ made any Satisfaction to justice, or payed the debt of the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
ones, as their Surety: &amp; such, as deny this legal translation of Christ's
Righteousness, would do well to consider, if they do not hereby weaken
the truth, concerning Christ's Satisfa&amp;ion, &amp; His dying in the Room, place
&amp; Stead of the Elect. As for the thing it self, every one, that knoweth
what a Surety is, knoweth that his payment of the debt is by law reckoned
on the score of the principal debtor, &amp; so transferred upon him, as he is no
more liable to the charge of the Creditor, or to the execution of the law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him for non-payment, than if he himself had laid down the full
Summe.</p>
               <p>He would prove, what he alleigeth, thus, <hi>This Scripture doth not barely and
simply deny a possibility of translation of the Righteousness of the law from one person
to another; but denieth it emphatically. Ans.</hi> Howbeit it be a truth, that no
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104357:75"/>
meer-mans righteousness is derivable from him to another: set this Text
proveth no such thing; but only telleth us the nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of works, <hi>viz.</hi> that it required personal and perfect obedience of him,
that would have right to the promised reward. Which speaketh nothing
against the new contrivance of the Gospel, wherein the Supream God and
Law-giver, &amp; the great Rector of the world did, in Mercy &amp; Love, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
Jesus Christ to be the Mediator &amp; Surety for the chosen ones, to pay
their debt, &amp; suffer for them; &amp; did ordaine a way, how they should, in
due time, come to have an Interest in, &amp; to partake of that Surety-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ Jesus, that so they might be justified, &amp; dealt with as
Righteous persons, having Christ's Surety-righteousness imputed to them,
&amp; reckoned upon their score, when by faith they close with Him, and lay
hold on it.</p>
               <p>He addeth for proof, <hi>for it denies a possibility of it to be done even by faith,
which was the likeliest hand to have done it, if the nature of the thing had not resisted
the doing of it. Ans.</hi> The meaning of these werds, <hi>the law is not of faith,</hi> is,
only to shew, That the way of justification by faith &amp; by the law, are so far
different, that they cannot agree together: but not to show, that by faith
Beleevers are not made partakers of the Righteousness of Christ, or have it
not imputed unto them &amp; reckoned upon their score; as the whole scope
&amp; circumstances of the place show. That therefore is not true, which he
addeth, <hi>By which it appeareth also, that be</hi> (i.e. the Apostle) <hi>had an Intent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
to make the righteousness of the law, as performed by Christ himself, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of this translation, or Imputation.</hi> For though the law should be against
the Imputation of the Righteousness of one man, who is Naturally and every
way under the law, &amp; obliged by his being, to obey the law, unto another:
yet it is not against the Imputation of the Righteousness of one, who is God;
&amp; so under the law only by voluntary Submission, &amp; is appointed thereunto
by the Supream Law-giver &amp; Rector, unto all such, as were committed &amp;
given to Him to save that way, in a way condescended upon by Jehovah, and
the Mediator.</p>
               <p>He proceedeth, <hi>The meaning of these words,</hi> the law is not of faith, <hi>must
be this, that the righteousness of the law doth not arise, or come upon any man, out
of his faith, or by his beleeving: &amp; this is proved because the very doer shall live in
or by them, Ans.</hi> It is true, the law-way of justification, or the way of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
revealed in and by the law, and hold forth in the old Covenant,
saith only, that the man that doth these things shall live in them: and
doth not prescribe the way of justification through faith. But the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
revealeth, how the righteousness of the law, which was part of
our debt, being performed and payed by the Lord Jesus, the Surety,
appointed of God, is transferred and imputed unto those, He did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present.</p>
               <p>He addeth further, <hi>The word law here is put for the Righteousness or fulfilling
of the law. Ans.</hi> And why also shall not the word be taken in that sense in the
following <hi>vers,</hi> where it is said, <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the
law;</hi> &amp; so the meaning will be, <hi>from the curse of the righteousness or fulfilling
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104357:75"/>
of the law?</hi> Againe, what though the word had that Import here? can
any thing more hence follow, than that personal Righteousness is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivable
now from one man to another, so as to stand for his personal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness?
But how shall this sense of the words make them a proof or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of what was said in the former verse?</p>
               <p>He answereth to this, saying, <hi>The Apostle in the former verse had delivered
it for a truth, that no man could be justified by the law i.e. by the righteousness or
works of the law; because the Scripture saith,</hi> the just shall live by faith. <hi>Now
because this consequence might seem doubtful, upon this account, that it might be
said, why may not the just live by faith, &amp; by the works of the law too? may not
the righteousness of the law be made over to them by faith? No, saith the Apostle,
The law is not of faith, there can be no legal rigteousness drawn upon men by faith, &amp;c.
Ans.</hi> This confirmation is manifestly perverted: for there was no occasion
for that question, whether the righteousness of the law could be made over by
faith, whether it be taken in his sense, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Righteousness of
Christ, performed to the law could be made over and received by faith;
as appeareth from what he had said of the Gospel-way <hi>vers</hi> 8, 9. Or whether
it be taken in this sense, that the righteousness of the law, performed by a
meer-man, only for himself, according to his obligation, can be now made
over to another by faith; for no man over dreamed of such a thing. But
enough of this froathy trash.</p>
               <p>What he talketh afterward of the opposition betwixt the <hi>law</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi>
in the matter of justification, is utterly impertinent; because quite mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
and misunderstood by him: for he only understandeth the difference
thus; That faith hath nothing to do with the Righteousness of Christ, but
must be considered alone, as our act of obedience; &amp; wherever the law, or
the righteousness thereof is excluded in the matter of justification, there the
righteousness of Christ is as well to be understood, as our own personal acts
of obedience. But how crosse this is unto the whole doctrine of the Gospel,
is already abundantly shown; and we may have further occasion to touch
upon this matter hereafter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 1. That Righteousness, which will not furnish all Beleevers with all points
or parts of that righteousness, which the law requireth of them, cannot be imputed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104357:76"/>
to them unto justification. But such is the Obedience, that Christ performed unto
the Moral Law. Therefore &amp;c. Ans.</hi> (1.) We plead not only for the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ's Obedience to the Moral Law; but for the Imputation of His
whole Surety Righteousness, that is, of all He both did &amp; Suffered, as the
designed &amp; appointed Surety. (2.) This Argum, though it be levelled only
against the Imputation of Christ's Obedience; yet it equally wageth warre
against the Imputation of His Sufferings: for as to the Satisfaction &amp; pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the old Covenant, or His Suffering of death, it may be also said. The
payment of the penalty must be such, as they, for whom it was laid down,
were otherwise lying under, &amp; under a necessity to pay it themselves. But
Christ's death &amp; payment was not such; for He did not suffer the same, as to
duration, nor as to concomitant despaire, &amp; other evils, that would neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
attend the same in Man, &amp; doth attend it in the damned. Which
consideration is enough to render this Argument suspected of falshood, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all such, as are not bred in the School of <hi>Socinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us see, how he confirmeth this Argum. &amp; particularly the <hi>first proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
thereof. <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>a compleat legal righteousness requireth a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
through-obedience unto all things in the Law, in reference to each mans place
&amp; Calling. Ans.</hi> But we may distinguish the proposition thus. That righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
which will not furnish all beleevers with every specifick &amp; indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
act of obedience, which is required of them, in their places &amp; Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
i.e. Is not made up of, nor expresly &amp; explicitly comprehendeth in
it all these particular Acts, specifically &amp; numerically considered, cannot
be imputed unto them in justification; It is false in this sense. But if it be
thus taken. That righteousness, which neither did comprehend in it, not
was made up of every specifick &amp; numerical Act, required of them, nor
yet was infinitly transcending &amp; exceeding the obedience of all men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somever,
in all their distinct and particular occasions, Relations, places,
&amp; Callings, &amp; brought more glory unto God, the Law-giver, and was a
fuller proclamation of the holiness of the Law and of the Law-maker, and
acknowledgment of His Authority; and with which the great Rector of the
world and Law-giver was fully satisfied in all points, cannot be imputed; in
this sense it may be granted. But then the <hi>Minor</hi> is palpably false; and so
the <hi>Conclusion</hi> is null. And as to the first sense, or branch of the distinction,
it is no way touched, let be weakened by the confirmation mentioned, as
every one may see. And so the Argument is null. And as for the ground &amp;
relevancy of the distinction, it is clear from what is said, touching the
Sufferings of Christ; so that it can be denied by none, who are not profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Socimans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To confirme the <hi>Minor,</hi> he tels us of duties of <hi>Servants, Masters, hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
wives, judges &amp;c. Ans.</hi> The distinction given maketh all this useless,
and to no purpose. Christ obeyed perfectly the same Law, we were lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
&amp; that as made under the Law, and as willingly subjecting himself
thereunto, in our room and stead, as Surety and Sponsor; and this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of His was full, perfect end Compleat, for He fulfilled all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 3: 15. He was, dureing His life, holy, harmeless, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:104357:76"/>
and separat from sinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7: 26. He knew no sin 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 21.
No man could convince Him of sin. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8: 46. Yea the father was well
pleased in Him <hi>Mat.</hi> 3: 17-&amp; 17: 5. And this perfect and full obedience,
which Christ gave unto the Law, which He came to fulfill <hi>Mat.</hi> 5: 17. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the obedience of one, who was God, equal with the Father, had in it
a Supereminent excellency, worth and dignity, to the full Satisfaction of
the Law and of the Law-giver, and to the repairing of that loss, and to the
recovering of that Glory, which was wronged by mans violation of the Law.
So that howbeit He performed not all duties, which were required of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of the Chosen ones, in their several Sexes, Ages, Relations, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
and Callings, which was Impossible and not needful: Yet He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that obedience to the Law of God, which was required of Him, as
standing in the room and stead of the given ones, and that in all points, yea
and full obedience, wherewith the Supream Law-giver was fully Satisfied.
And, Sure, every unprejudiced person may easily see and be convinced,
that this perfect and compleat obedience of Christ is moreable to furnish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
with all points of Righteousness, which the Law requireth, than
the single act of faith, which our Adversaries Substitute in the place thereof.
Shall we think, that God accepteth of, in place of all, and imputeth that
unto beleevers for their Righteousness, rather than the Full and perfect
Obedience of Christ? Shall one imperfect Act of obedience be of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
than the Full and perfect obedience of Christ? W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence we see, that
whatever shew our Adversary maketh with this Argument against us; yet it
is of no weight with himself; for as He useth it against the Imputed Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Christ, so we may use it, with much more strength of reason, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Imputation of our Faith for Righteousness, as is obvius.</p>
               <p>We need not take notice of that <hi>objection,</hi> which He moveth against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>pag. 101. viz. That love is the fulfilling of the Law;</hi> nor of his Replies
made thereunto: for we assert Christ's fulfilling of the Law in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and upon other grounds: He fulfilled all righteousness, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
all particular acts of obedience, required of Him as our Surety, so
that the Father was well pleased with Him: and what more is requisite!</p>
               <p>He moveth another <hi>objection pag. 103. viz.</hi> That it is not necessary, that
men should have all particular Acts of Righteousness, qualified with all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
imputed to them, it being Sufficient, that such a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be imputed, which is equivalent; yea and more than equivalent, as
bringing more glory to God, and as much worthy in it self. He answereth.
1. <hi>The Law will not know any thing by way of proportion, but must have its jot
for jot, title for title, or else it will curse. Ans.</hi> (1.) We are to regard here
more what the Law-giver and Supream Rector will know, than what the
letter of the Law will acquiesce in. (2.) This taketh away the Satisfaction of
Christ, and all His Sufferings, as Mediator, and destroyeth that ground of
our hope and Salvation: for the Law, as to its letter, saith, <hi>the Soul that
sinneth to it shall die;</hi> and hath not one jote or title of the Satisfaction and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of a Mediator. (3.) What shall our Adversary now do with faith?
doth any jote or title of the Law countenance the Imputation of faith, for
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104357:77"/>
a proportionable Righteousness? doth faith answere every jote, title, point
and letter of the Law? He answereth. 2. <hi>To impute acts of Righteousness to a
Man, which are proper to another calling, is rather to impute sin, than righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
Ans.</hi> Christ was a publick person, appointed of the Father to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
all the chosen ones, &amp; did, in their place &amp; room, fulfill the law,
in all points, according as was required of Him, by the Supream Lord Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
&amp; Law-giver; &amp; this perfect &amp; compleat Obedience is made over to
all those, who are His; &amp; not one part to this particular Beleever, and
another to another, or some acts to this man, &amp; some other acts to that
man: &amp; therefore this reply is groundless.</p>
               <p>As to that <hi>viz.</hi> That God inflicted on Christ, not the circumstantiat cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
threatned, but its equivalency, he saith. 1. <hi>That in these words,</hi> Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalt
die the death, <hi>there is no necessity to meane precisely &amp; determinatly eternal
death, according to the letter. Ans.</hi> If that was not threatned in the Law, no
man shall suffer it, for the breach of the Law; and so there shall be no eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
death even to such as perish, which yet himself granteth. (2.) It was a
spiritual death, and such as includeth many circumstances, which Christ
neither could, nor did suffer. He saith 2. <hi>Gods meaning there was not, to
threaten eternal death in one kinde, or other; but to have the word death understood,
as it indifferently signifieth that evil of punishment, which was known by that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
for eternity is not of the essence of the punishment, due unto sins. Ans.</hi> The
doubt remaineth concerning other circumstances, &amp; ingredients of that
death, as threatned to man. And whether eternity be of the Essence of the
punishment, threatned for sin, or not; this is sure, that all, for whom
Christ hath not suffered, shall perish eternally; &amp; all had perished eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if Christ had not suffered: And when God threatned death to man, he
know, that if that threatning did overtake him, his death would be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
He saith 3. <hi>Though God should take liberty to vary from the letter of the
Curse; yet it followeth not, that the creature, who was bound to obey the precepts
of the Law, might take the like liberty to do one thing, in stead of another; or that
God should accept any such payment for them. Ans.</hi> We assert no liberty for
man: but why should not this liberty be allowed to the Supream God? All
the reason he giveth, I finde to be this. <hi>That God accepteth on any mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
as a perfect legal righteousness, the performance of such things, which are
not required of him, hath no correspondence with any of the Covenants. Ans.</hi> If
God could accept that, as a perfect Satisfaction, which did not every way
answere to &amp; correspond with that, which Man himself was to suffer; why
might He not accept of that, as a perfect legal righteousness, which did not
in all particulars, answere to, &amp; correspond with that, which every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
was obliged unto? What reason is, or can be given for the one,
which will not hold for the other? The answere he hath given, is no answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
unto this. Perfect obedience was required of all by the first Covenant, &amp;
Christ did performe perfect obedience for all His owne; &amp; this being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
legal Righteousness, is sufficient for all; &amp; is not the performance of
such things, as are not required of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 2. Chap. 10. pag. 107. That Righteousness, which is exactly and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104357:77"/>
fitted to the person of Him, that is Mediator between God &amp; man, cannot be
imputed unto any other man. But such is the Righteousness of Christ.</hi> Ergo. The
<hi>Major</hi> he thus confirmeth. <hi>He that assumeth this Righteousness of Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
himself to God, in the glorious attire of him, who maketh men righteous,
&amp; may conceue himself as great in holiness, as Iesus Christ himself &amp;c. Ans.</hi>
Christ's Righteousness was indeed the Righteousness of a Mediator &amp; Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
&amp; therefore was imputable to all, who by faith should be married to
Him, &amp; have union with Him, as their Head, &amp; Husband, &amp; are beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
one person in Law with Him, as their Representative &amp; Surety; though
not as it was subjected in Him, but according to the nature of the thing, &amp;
to their necessity. Hereby therefore is no wrong done to Christ, no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of Him of His mediatory glory; but, on the contrary, a more clear
&amp; manifest ascribing of the same unto Him, by acknowledging Him for
the only Mediator, &amp; by resting on Him, &amp; on His Righteousness, as our
only Righteousness and ground of Acceptance. We cleare the matter thus.
When the payment of a Surety is imputed to the debtor, and he pleadeth
the same in court, for his own absolution, he doth no injurie unto the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner;
but rather declareth himself unable to pay, &amp; ascribeth the honour
of the payment unto the Surety: for he doth alleige or produce that pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as if he would thereby declare, that he himself; as Surety, had paid
the summe for another; but only produceth the payment of a Surety, in
reference to himself, as a ground sufficient in Law, whereupon he should be
absolved from the Charge, giuen-in against him by the creditor. So when
the beleever applieth to himself the Righteousness of Christ, he doth not
make himself a Mediator or Surety; but only applieth the Righteousness &amp;
payment of his Surety, Head &amp; Husband, for his own use, to answere
the charge given-in against himself, and in reference to his own particular
case &amp; necessity. Hereby the beleever doth not assume to himself an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Righteousness with God himself; but only assumeth that Mediatory
&amp; Surety-righteousness, which He wrought, who was equal with God, &amp;
was God, so far as their own case &amp; necessity requireth. We dream of no
such imputation, as would give ground to us to conceite our selves to have
done &amp; said all that He did &amp; said. This is the fiction of the Adversary, not
our Assertion.</p>
               <p>Against the consideration of the Union betwixt Christ, as the Head, &amp;
beleevers as the Members, which is the ground of this Imputation &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
He saith <hi>pag. 113. 1. Christ &amp; Beleevers are a mystical body,
&amp; therefore an universal agreement, in all things, with a natural body, cannot be
thought on; one difference is this, what one member of the body natural doth, the
whole may be said to do. But not so in the mystical body; the body of Christ cannot
be said to have wrought miracles &amp;c. Ans.</hi> Nor de we asserte an agreement
betwixt this mystical body &amp; a natural body, in all points: But yet, as
Christ accounteth Himself a sufferer, when the members of His body are
suffering, as such: So what Christ did, as an Head to His mystical Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and Spiritual Kingdom, according to the designation and appointment of
God, who made Him both King &amp; Lord, must redound to their advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:104357:78"/>
according to their necessity; and therefore what He did, as a publick
Head &amp; Representative, must be imputed unto them, who are of His Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
&amp; were undertaken for &amp; represented by Him.</p>
               <p>He saith, 2. <hi>Though the benefite of what the head doth, be communicated to the
whole body; yet what the head doth, is no wayes to be imputed to hand, or to foot.
Ans.</hi> The hand or foot needeth no imputation of what is done by the head,
but a community, or political body, and every member thereof, needeth
an Imputation of what is done for their good, &amp; in their Law-place, by
their Head &amp; publick Representative. And in this matter, we look upon
Christ, as such an Head.</p>
               <p>Against the Marriage Union betwixt Christ &amp; Beleevers, mentioned as
another ground to cleare this Imputation, he saith 1. <hi>It is true, the wife by
marriage, comes to be endowed with all that is her husbands, but this endowing is
no ingredient into the marriage it self, but a fruit thereof; so the right, which a
beleever hath to the Righteousness of Christ, accrueth unto him by &amp; upon this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
marriage; and therefore it cannot be imputed to him. The marriage must
be first made up, before the right be had unto this Righteousness. Ans.</hi> If the right
unto Christ's Righteousness accrue unto Beleevers by &amp; upon their Spiritual
marriage with Christ, this Righteousness must be imputed to them, and
reckoned upon their score, or made over unto them, as the dowrie is made
over to the wife and reckoned hers, upon her marriage. We grant the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is first made up, and that this is done by faith; and yet at the very act
of beleeving, this Righteousness is imputed. This marriage Union is first in
order of nature, but no time interveeneth betwixt this Union and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Righteousness. He saith 2. <hi>all that is the husbands is not every
way the wifes, nor for every use &amp; purpose, but only in a way of expediency and
beneficialness; as his clothes are not hers to put on: so the beleever must take heed
of assuming the glorious rob of His Righteousness to himself, otherwayes than in the
benefite and comfort of it. Ans.</hi> All that is the husband's becometh the wifes
by Marriage, for every use and purpose, that her necessity calleth for, and
the nature of the thing admitteth; as his riches becometh hers to her main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance,
and to the paying of her debt; and his honour becometh hers, to
the exalting of her to a Sutable state of honour; even so must Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
become the Beleevers, that his debt may be payed, and he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
out of the hand of justice, &amp; advanced to a state of life, and have right
to glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 3. Chap. 11. pag. 118. If God hath sufficiently provided otherwayes for
the justification of his people, He doth not impute this Righteousness of Christ for
that end. But God hath provided otherwayes for this end.</hi> Which he thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.
<hi>He that is compleatly justified by having his sins forgiven, is justified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this Imputation. But a beleever is sufficiently justified before God by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of sins.</hi> Ergo. <hi>Ans.</hi> Though a person justified is pardoned, yet justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
includeth more, than meer pardon of Sins. Justification is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
and accepting of a person as Righteous; and therefore the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
so justified and accepted must be righteous: and seing he is not inherently
righteous, he must be righteous by Imputation. What he said to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:104357:78"/>
before <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. of his book (to which he here remitteth us) hath
been examined already. What he addeth here, shall now be considered, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
mens Sayings, wherewith I purpose not to medle here. He citeth agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
to this purpose <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7. to which we spoke above. He supposeth,
that the Apostle here did intend a full description of justification; But this
he cannot clearly evince, &amp; he forgetteth, that the Apostle maketh mention
of <hi>Imputed Righteousness;</hi> and that not as one and the same thing with free
Remission, but as inseparable from it. The Apostles designe was not to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
here a full Definition or description of Justification, it being Sufficient to
the purpose he had in hand, to mention so much thereof, as did clearly &amp;
irrefragably confirme the same <hi>viz.</hi> That the blessed state of justification is
not brought about, or had by the works of the Law: yea, (as is said) that
very Imputation of Righteousness is not only included in the word <hi>blessedness,</hi>
by which this State of justification is expressed; for a blessed man is one,
who not only is freed from guilt and punishment, but hath also a right to
the Crown, and to the rich recompense of reward, which is not had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Righteousness; but is plainly also expressed, when he saith, <hi>Even as
David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
without works.</hi> Here is a Righteousness, even a positive Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
mentioned, and a Righteousness imputed, and a Righteousness with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
our works of obedience to the Law. Hence we need not assert any <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche</hi>
here; or say, that a part is put fot the whole, which yet is no unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
thing in Scripture; and might be admitted here, even in this matter,
without any absurdity; seing where one part of this business is mentioned,
the other is necessarily understood, because of the necessary &amp; inviolable
connexion, that is betwixt them.</p>
               <p>He saith further <hi>pag. 130. If forgiveness of sins be but a part, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
half of our</hi> justification, <hi>then when the Scripture saith,</hi> we are justified by
His blood (Rom. 5: 9.) <hi>the sense must be, we are justified by half through his
blood, but the better halfe of our justification must come another way; for by his blood
we cannot have his active Righteousness imputed to us.</hi> (1.) We use not to make
such comparisons betwixt these things (here called parts) had in justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as to call the one the better part, and the other the worser part, both
being requisite to make up our state of blessedness, and necessary thereunto.
(2.) When the Scripture saith, <hi>we are justified by His blood,</hi> the meaning is
not, we are justified by the half through His blood: for half justification is
no justification. (3) Nor is the Reason added of any force: for <hi>by blood</hi> here,
we may as well understand, by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> His active Righteousness, as
all His passive, both being but integral parts of His Surety-righteousness, &amp;
emphatically expressed by His death, or blood, the most remarkable piece
thereof, &amp; expressive of His love and condescension, and terminating point
of Surety-obedience; for He said, <hi>it was finished,</hi> when He offered up
Himself, &amp; gave up the Ghost.</p>
               <p>He addeth, <hi>So where it is said againe Chap. 5. vers</hi> 16. that the gift (<hi>viz.
of Righteousness by Christ</hi>) is of many offences unto justification: <hi>If the gift of
many offences, i.e. the forgiveness of Mans Sinnes, will not amount to a justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:104357:79"/>
without the Imputation of a legal Righteousness, we must give a check to
Paul's pen. Ans.</hi> This is but vanity: we need give no check unto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's
pen: for though He said not in this <hi>verse</hi> expresly, that there was a gift
of Righteousness also imputed; yet he said it expresly vers 17. &amp; 18. &amp; 1.
And shall we think, that in such a continued discourse, as this is, wherein
the Apostle is explaining the whole mystery by its parts, he should mention
all things, in one verse?</p>
               <p>He proceeds to prove, that Remission of sins is the whole of justification
<hi>pag. 131. Because the end</hi> (saith he) <hi>for which this Imputed Righteovsness of
Christ is thus brought in to the business of justification, viz. to be the Right to the
Inheritance, is supplied in a way more evangelical, &amp; of more sweetness &amp; dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Children of God, to wit, by the grace of Adoption, Ans.</hi> To this we
have said enough above, &amp; will have occasion to speak againe to it, in the
next objection.</p>
               <p>He addeth further 4. <hi>That if we thus separat and divide the benefite of Christ's
Active and passive Obedience, in Iustification, we take a course to lose &amp; destroy
both. Ans.</hi> Not to transcribe his tedious discourse, on this accout, I only
say, That it is wholly founded upon a mistake, as if our showing the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of the Imputation of both, were a separating or dividing of the benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
of both, whileas the whole Effect floweth from the whole cause, both
Christ's Active &amp; His passive obedience making up one compleat Surety-righteousness;
and so producing one whole blessedness to beleevers, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
in Remission of Sins, &amp; in a Right to Glory: we say with him, that
neither of them separated or abstracted from the other can profite us; and
therefore we assert the Imputation of both, as one compleat Surety-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
answereing our necessity in all points. His own words <hi>pag.</hi> 132.
133. make clearly for us. <hi>I would not have</hi> (saith he) <hi>the</hi> active <hi>obedience of
Christ separated from the</hi> passive, <hi>nor againe the</hi> passive <hi>from the</hi> active, <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the common &amp; joint effect,</hi> justification, <hi>arising from a concurrence of
them both; yet would I not have Christ in his mystery tumbled up together on a heap;
for this would be to deface the beauty and excellency of that wisdom, which shines
forth gloriously, in the face thereof. I would have every thing, that Christ was,
did-and suffered, to be distinguished, not only in themselves; but also in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and immediat Effects, respectively ariseing and flowing from them severally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly.</hi> He tels us, <hi>If the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness must be added,
as another part of justification, then must the formal cause of one &amp; the same Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
be double; yea one &amp; the same formal part of the thing shall be compounded
of two things, of a diverse and opposite consideration. Ans.</hi> We make the Imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Christ's Righteousness not a part of justification; But the cause of
it; and yet the formal cause of one and the same Effect is not made double<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for as the Cause is one compleat Cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the Surety-righteousness of
Christ, so the Effect is one compleat Effect, though both Cause and Effect
may be considered, as consisting of several Integral parts. There is no ground
here to say, That one and the same formal part of a thing is compounded of
diverse or opposite things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 4. Chap. 12. Pag. 136. &amp;c. That which dissolveth and taketh away the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104357:79"/>
necessity &amp; use of that sweet evangelical grace of</hi> Adoption, <hi>cannot hold a streight
course with the thruth of the Gospel. But this is done by the Imputation of Christ's
Righteousness.</hi> Ergo. The <hi>Minor,</hi> which is only here to be denied, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth
to prove, because we say, The Righteousness of Christ must be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
in order to our obtaining Right and Title to Life; &amp; that by Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Sins a man is only delivered from death, but receiveth no Right to
the Kingdom of heaven. But what can he hence inferre for confirmation
of the <hi>Minor? Now</hi> (saith he) <hi>this being the direct &amp; proper end, use, office,
purpose &amp; intent of</hi> Adoption, <hi>to invest a beleever with a capacity with heaven;
it followes, that whosoever shall attempt to set any thing else upon this throne,
seeks to dissolve</hi> Adoption. <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>Consequence</hi> is null. The Imputation of
Christ's Righteousness will no more take away Adoption, than justification;
for it is the ground and Cause of both. He might as well say, That becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
in and by justification, we have Remission of Sins, to assert the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ's death and Sufferings for this end, is to dissolve justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But the truth is clear, as was explained above <hi>Myst.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>He thinks both cannot stand together, <hi>because either of them is a compleat
&amp; entire Title within itself; perfect Righteousness is a perfect title alone; so is</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
<hi>or</hi> Sonship. <hi>Ans.</hi> (1.) This will say as much against the Imputation
of Christ's death and Sufferings, as against justification: for either of these
is a compleat Title (according to our Adversary) to Immunity from death:
perfect Satisfaction is a perfect title alone to this Immunity, as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Righteousness is a perfect title to the Inheritance: &amp; Justification or
Remission of Sins, (which are one with him) is also a perfect Right to <hi>this,</hi>
as well as Adoption is a perfect Right to <hi>that.</hi> (2) But as Justification is
founded upon the Imputed Righteousness of Christ; so is Adoption. As
Christ's death and Satisfaction is not formall pardon, or Right to Impunity,
but is, when Imputed, the ground and cause of justification, wherein the
Beleever is solemnely brought into a state of freedome from death: So
Christ's Obedience and Fulfilling of the Law is not a formal Right unto the
inheritance, but, when Imputed and received by faith, the ground and
cause of Adoption, whereby the Beleever is, as it were, solemnely infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offed
of the Inheritance. Here then is nothing in vaine; but all things so
ordered, as may most commend the riches of the wisdom &amp; Grace of God;
&amp; may most ensure life and all to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eleever. So that his following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is meer froath and vanity: for, as God may appoint moe meanes for
the same end, as He pleaseth; as His promises, oath &amp; Sacraments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the faith of beleevers; so there can be no reason given, why it may
not be so here: &amp; yet, to speak properly, Adoption is no mean, or Cause
of the Right and Title to Glory, being the solemne Collation of that Right
to the beleever, or the solemne stating of him in that Right; as justification
properly is no Meane to or Cause of pardon and Acceptation of Sinners, but
rather the solemne bringing of them into or placeing of them in that state of
peace, Pardon and Reconciliation, who beleeve in Jesus and lay hold on His
Righteousness. What he speaketh of the opposition betwixt the Law and
the promise, in giving of life from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 21. is most Impertinent; so also
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104357:80"/>
is that, which he saith from <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 21. for though it be an abrogating and
making void of the ordinances of God, when another thing, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
&amp; expresly excluded by the Lord from that office &amp; work, is set up
with it, to bring the same end to passe, or to serve in the same place and
office: yet is there not the least coloure of ground to say, <hi>That if our Right
&amp; Title to heaven be by Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, then doth God give
the grace of Adoption in vaine:</hi> for the Righteousness of Christ is the Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
procuring Cause of this Right and Title to heaven; and when this is
Imputed &amp; made over to the beleever, he receiveth the Effect and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fruit of
that purchase <hi>viz.</hi> an Actual Right to glory, &amp; is solemnely infeofed (as it
were) thereof. What ignorance &amp; folly would it discover in a man, to
say, That the legal installing of a man by publick seasing &amp; Infeofment in
the legal Right to &amp; possession of such a Land, or House, is that which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the man Right; and therefore the price he hath laid down, to purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
that Land, or house, hath no Interest or Consideration in that purchase,
for these two cannot consist, the one must necessarily render the other use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;
if he hath made a purchase of the Land &amp; house by his money, he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
no Charter or Infeofment thereof: or if his Charter &amp; Infeofment gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
him Right to possesse the same, the price laid down is of no use? would
not every one smile at such Non-sense? And yet so reasoneth this learned
Adversary, who will have the Righteousness of Christ laid by, which is the
only price and purchasing Merite of our Right to Heaven; or the Grace of
Adoption, whereby the beleever becometh legally (as it were) infeofed
of the Inheritance. It is vaine, if he should think to escape by saying. That
he acknowledgeth the price of Christ's Righteousness; but speaketh of the
Imputation of that Righteousness, in order to this Right; For the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Righteousness is but the Interessing of the beleever in that price,
as the price of such a purchase, to the end he may receive the legal infeofment
of the Inheritance purchased, in Adoption.</p>

is not prescribed in the Gospel, for any such use or end, for which the
Imputation of Christ's Righteousness is called for. <hi>If</hi> Adam (saith he)
<hi>had kept the Law, he had needed: no Repentance, more than Christ himself needed;
&amp; those that kept the Law in him, as exactly &amp; perfectly as he did, what more

                     </gap>d of Repentance have they, than he had, Ans Adam,</hi> it is true, had needed
no Repentance, if he had kept the Law: But the Imputation of Christ's
Righteousness &amp; obedience to us, though thereby we come to enjoy the
Effects &amp; purchase thereof, as really as if we had Fulfilled the Law oursel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves;
yet it maketh us not to have been no sinners; nor doth it exeem us from
the Law, in time coming, nor put us out of case of sinning any more; and
consequently prejudgeth not the true &amp; lively exercise of that grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>He addeth. <hi>He that is as righteous, as Christ is, (which those must needs be,
who are righteous with His righteousness) needeth no more Repentance, than He
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104357:80"/>
needed. Ans.</hi> We do not love to say, that beleevers, through this Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
are as Righteous, as Christ was: for that expression might import
that thereby they become as Righteous inherently, as He was; which is
false: But that thereby they are legally accounted Righteous, to all ends
&amp; purposes, as if they themselves, in their own persons, had Fulfilled the
Law: And therefore, though thereby they become, in Law-sense, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;
yet they are inherently ungodly &amp; unrighteous, till sanctifying grace
make a change here; &amp; therefore stand in need of Repentance.</p>
               <p>To that That Beleevers need Repentance for their daily &amp; personal fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
he saith, <hi>But they that have an entire &amp; perfect</hi> Law-righteousness <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to them, have no such need, in any respect; because in the</hi> Imputation <hi>of a
perfect Righteousness, there is an universal</hi> non-Imputation of sin <hi>apparently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.
Besides, if God doth Impute a</hi> perfect Law-righteousness, <hi>it must be
supposed, that the rights &amp; privileges, belonging to such righteousness do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
it, in the Imputation—Now, one maine privilege hereof is to invest with a
full &amp; entire right unto life, out of its own intrinsecal &amp; inherent dignity &amp; worth,
which is a privilege, wholly inconsistent with the least tincture of sin, in the person
that stands possessed of it. Ans.</hi> Where there is an Imputation of a perfect
Righteousness, there there is an universal Non-Imputation of sin, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to actual condemnation, or to the prejudging of the person, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of this Imputation, of the reward of life; but as this Imputation of
Righteousness maketh not a sinner to have been no sinner; so neither doth
it make their future sinnes to be no sinnes, or them to be no sinners, in time
coming; because it is imputed for no such end. (2) It is true, the Rights
&amp; privileges, belonging to this Righteousness, do accompany the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
thereof; &amp; that thereby beleevers become invested with a full &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Right to life, because of its intrinsecal &amp; inherent dignity; but it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
false, to say, That this full &amp; entire Right to life is inconsistent with
the least tincture of sin, in the person possessed of it: &amp; hereby he must say
one of these two; either that there is no full Right had to life, while per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are in this life; or that there is a full and sinless perfection attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and had by all beleevers; so that they sinne no more, Both which are
most false.</p>
               <p>But what will he say of Faith, which he will have imputed for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
seing this must bring alongs with it the same privileges; &amp; so exclude
Repentance too? To this he saith. <hi>The meaning is not, as if God either Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
or accepted, or accounted faith for the self same thing, which the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness
of the Law is intrinsecally &amp; formally; or as if God, in this Imputation,
either gave or accounted unto faith any power or privilege to justifie, out of any
inherent worth of it. But the meaning only is, that God, upon Man's faith, will
as fully justify him, as if he had perfectly fulfilled the Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> He that fulfilled the
Law &amp; thereby is justified, is justified out of the inherent dignity of that, which
justifieth him; but he that is justified by faith, is justified by the free &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
acceptation of it by God; for that, which is justifying in its own Nature,
&amp; by vertue of its inherent worth &amp; dignity. Ans.</hi> What God Imputeth &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth
to be a Righteousness, in order to justification, must be accounted
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104357:81"/>
such, or a man shall be justified, without all consideration of a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and so be pronounced &amp; declared Righteous, though he be not Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
upon any account, or in any manner of way: And if faith be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for the self same thing, or for the equivalent with the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Law, how shall it be accounted a Righteousness, in order to
the justification of a sinner, who is under the Curse of the Law, &amp; who,
because of the breach of the Law, hath no right to life? wherefore faith
must have that inherent worth, that the Righteousness of the Law should
have had, else it cannot be a Righteousness, whereupon a sinner can be
justified before God, who is Just and Righteous, and will not pronounce
such to be Righteous, as are not Righteous. (2) If God, upon a man's
faith, will as fully justify a man, as if he had fulfilled the Law, either that
faith must be a Righteousness, and so accounted, which he here denieth;
or the man must be declared Righteous, who hath no Righteousness; and
so the judgment of God should not be according to truth; or upon his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
he must be justified, as being Righteous by an Imputed Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
which is the thing he peremptorily denieth. (3) When one is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by faith, by God's free &amp; gracious Acceptation of it, this act of grace
must either import, that faith is accepted as a Righteousness, &amp; so accounted
of God; or still the beleever shall be declared and pronounced Righteous,
though he hath no Righteousness; or the meaning of this Acceptation must
be, that God hath graciously condescended to appoint this mean &amp; way of
sinners having an Interest in the Righteousness of Christ, whereby he may
be accounted Righteous &amp; justified, as really, as is he had performed that
Righteousness himself, in his own person: &amp; in this sense, it is most true,
but utterly destructive of his designe. (4) If faith be accepted for that,
which is justifying in its own Nature, &amp; by vertue of its Inherent worth &amp;
dignity, it must either be that, which is of such inherent worth, or it must
be accepted for that, which it is not, &amp; so a man must be judged by God
to have that, which he hath not.</p>
               <p>He concludeth thus. <hi>Wherefore, the Imputation of faith for righteousness
may well stand with personal sins, in him, to whom this Imputation is made, in
respect of which sins he remaines obliged to repent: but the Imputation of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
legal Righteousness makes a man perfectly righteous in the letter &amp; formality of
it. Ans.</hi> Then it seemeth that by the Imputation of faith for Righteousness,
a man standeth not invested &amp; possessed of a full &amp; entire right unto life: for
that, he said before, was a privilege wholly inconsistent with the least tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of sin. (2) If by a perfect legal Righteousness, he meane a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
required of the Law &amp; performed by us personally, we plead not for
the Imputation of any such: but if he mean a Righteousness consisting in full
conformity to the Law, performed by Christ &amp; graciously imputed to us,
&amp; received by faith, that is well consistent with inherent &amp; personal sins.
What he meaneth by <hi>making a man perfectly righteous in the letter &amp; formality
of it.</hi> I know not, till some be pleased to explaine it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 6. Another argum. he prosecuteth <hi>pag. 149. &amp;c.</hi> thus. <hi>If men be as
Righteous as Christ himself was, in his life, there was no more necessity of His
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:104357:81"/>
death for them, than for himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the just should not have died for the unjust,
but for the just. Ans.</hi> If we had not transgressed the Law, there had been
no necessity, that either we, or any for us, should have died; but having
transgressed the Law, &amp; thereby fallen under the Curse, &amp; wanting all
right to life, we must have a Surety-righteousness, whereby not only the
Curse shall be taken away, but the blessing of <hi>Abraham</hi> may come upon us,
&amp; we may have a full right to life: &amp; therefore both the Active &amp; passive
Righteousness of Christ is necessary (2) Christ died for the unjust, because
His death, which was the period &amp; terminating act of His obedience, and
Surety righteousness, which He undertook to performe in our room and
Law-place, was for sinners, lying under the Curse, &amp; void of all right &amp;
title to life. He imagineth, that first Christ's Active Righteousness is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
&amp; thereby the person is constituted Righteous; &amp; then inferreth the
non<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> necessity of Christ's death: By we say, that Christ's whole Surety-righteousness,
consisting in what He did &amp; suffered, in His state of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
in our room, and as Cautioner, is at once imputed, and not in parts;
that so the necessity of sinners may be answered in all points.</p>
               <p>He thinks to prove this consequence by these words <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 21. <hi>If righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
be by the Law, then Christ died in vaine;</hi> rejecting the sense of the
word <hi>Law, viz.</hi> as importing the works of the Law, as performed by us,
in our own person, &amp; thereby doing violence to the whole Scope of the place,
&amp; to the constant acceptation of the expression; &amp; supposing that
the Consequence will be strong, though the works of the Law, as perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by Christ, be here understood; &amp; that meerly upon this false ground,
<hi>Because the Righteousness of Christ's life imputed had been a Sufficient, &amp; every
wayes a compleat Righteousness for us.</hi> Nor need we say, as he saith in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
<hi>That there was a Necessity, that Cbrist should did, that so the righteousness
of His life might be imputed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> For the necessity of His death arose from
our transgressing of the Law, &amp; being under the Curse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 7. Chap. 14. pag.</hi> 151. He alleigeth, that this Imputation evania<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
Remission of Sins, saying, <hi>for if men be righteous with the same righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
wherewith Christ was righteous, they have no more need of pardon, than He
had. Ans.</hi> We spoke to this above. <hi>Chap. 6. Mystery</hi> 11. &amp; therefore need
say no more here, then that the <hi>Consequence</hi> is null, &amp; that the probation
is insufficient, for though we be constituted Righteous through the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ's Righteousness; it is but a Surety-righteousness, &amp; not our
own inherently: &amp; the Surety not being of our appointing or fitting &amp; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
our pardon is a Consequent &amp; Effect of this Imputation. (2) The
consequence is no more valide from the Imputation of the Active Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ, than from His passive and Satisfaction: and so with
<hi>Soci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ians,</hi> he must also hereby deny Christ's Satisfaction, that he may esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
his free Remission. But Gospel free forgiveness is rather established,
than any way weakened by our Assertion of the Imputation of Christ's who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
Surety-righteousness.</p>
               <p>He addeth, <hi>Christ hath taught us to pray for forgiveness of Sins: now to pray
for that, and yet to conceite ourselves as righteous, as Christ was, is rather to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:104357:82"/>
mock, than to worship. Ans.</hi> This expression <hi>to conceite ourselves as righteous
as Christ was,</hi> is none of ours; &amp; though it may admit of a good sense as
being true, <hi>quoad veritatem,</hi> though not <hi>quoad modum:</hi> yet because it is so
ambiguous, &amp; liable to misconstruction, I chose rather to forbear it, seeing
no necessity touse it. And to conceite our selves legally &amp; juridically righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
with the Imputed Surety-righteousness of Christ, is very consistent
with praying for pardon: for Christ's Surety-righteousness is not, nor yet
said to be, imputed for this end immediatly, that all our after actions
should be sinless; but to this end rather, that we may have actual pardon of
by past sinnes, &amp; of future sins too, after the methode of the Gospel; and
that none of our sins should actually procure our Condemnation, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
us of eternal Felicity; but that notwithstanding thereof, we should
not come into condemnation, but enter into life.</p>
               <p>He saw, that what he here objecteth against the Imputation of Christ's
Righteousness, will militat as much against the Imputation of Faith, which
must derive a righteousness upon the person, as perfect and compleat, as
the Righteousness of the Law; &amp; so can leave as little place for Remission,
as what we plead for; and therefore to obviat this, he tels us. <hi>That when faith
is imputed, another thing is imputed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the righteousness of the Law it self, to
wit, faith, by name, in stead of it: Now any other righteousness, or any other
thing imputed for righteousness, besides the righteousness of the Law, will bear a
consistency of sin with it, &amp; of remission. Ans.</hi> If by the righteousness of the
Law here, he only meaneth that, which we performe in our own persons, it
is true, that is inconsistent with sin or pardon: but it is false, if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
thereby, the righteousness of the Law, performed by another, Christ
our Surety. And sure, if his faith be accounted a Righteousness, it must
be a Righteousness, or God's estimation is not just: &amp; if it be a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
it must be accompanied with all the privileges of a Righteousness (as
himself saith) and consequently exclude all Sin &amp; Remission, if these be
such concomitans of an Imputed righteousness.</p>
               <p>He addeth, <hi>when a perfect Sanctification is imputed to a man for his justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that man can be no more reputed to have sin in him, than to be obnoxious to
death, which is opposite to justification. Ans.</hi> And no wonder; for perfect
Sanctification being a perfect inherent holiness, cannot, without a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
but exclude sin. But who speak of such an Imputation of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?
We know no such thing; for Sanctification is wrought &amp; inherent
in us, &amp; not imputed to us. If he meane by this perfect Sanctification,
the perfect Obedience and Righteousness of Christ imputed to us, we say,
though that perfect Sanctification or Righteousness could be consistent with
no sin in Christ; yet, when imputed to us, it can consist with sin inherent
in us, &amp; with pardon of sin also; as we have already cleared.</p>
               <p>Further saith he. <hi>But when that, which either is no Sanctification, or at
most, but an imperfect Sanctification, is imputed for Righteousness in a mans
justification, place is left for inherencie of sin, &amp; consequently for the forgiveness
of it. Ans.</hi> That which is no Sanctification, or at most, but an imperfect
Sanctification, must either be no Righteousness, or at most, an imperfect
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:104357:82"/>
righteousness; and therefore cannot be reputed or accounted a perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
and so cannot be imputed to a person, in order to justification.
Or if we should suppose, that God did make it, &amp; really repute it to be a
righteousness, it must be a compleat righteousness; &amp; consequently inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with pardon, because it shall hereby become a compleat inherent Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
&amp; Righteousness.</p>

as Christ is, in him God can see no sin. But every beleever (saith this opinion,
which we impugne) is as perfectly &amp; compleatly righteous, as Christ himself is.
Therefore &amp;c. Ans.</hi> How false this consequence is, was manifested above
<hi>Chap. 6. Mystery</hi> 15. And now, waving that expression of <hi>being as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
as Christ himself is.</hi> I distinguish the <hi>Major</hi> thus, Whosoever is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
righteous with an inherent Righteousness (taking perfection here not
for kind, but for degrees) in him God can see no sin, true: but in this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
the <hi>Minor</hi> is false. Whosoever is perfectly Righteous with an Imputed
righteousness, in him God can see no sin, or order to actual condemnation,
it is true, but then the Conclusion containeth nothing but truth. It is true,
God could see no sin in Christ, because there was no sin existing in Him; yet
He can see sin in beleeves, in whom sin existeth, notwithstanding they be
clothed with the perfect Righteousness of Christ, which only maketh, that
God can see no sin in them, for which He will actually bring them into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
and this is consonant to Scripture <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 1.</p>

for the sole Imputation of faith, as our Gospel Righteousness, to which
some adde other works of obedience, do turne the Gospel into a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works: for if faith, properly taken, alone, or conjunct with
other works of Righteousness, which we do, be all our Gospel-righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
we are justified by our own personal obedience &amp; righteousness; and
this was the plaine tenor of the Covenant of works: The variation of the
obedience, now required from what was of old, though now it be but as a
pepper corne, in comparison of the greater rent formerly required, doth
make no alteration in the Nature and Essence of the Covenant: for justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
&amp; life is still by works of righteousness, which we do, and which
are our owne. But when the Righteousness of a Surety is imputed, &amp; we
are upon that account accepted, though the righteousness, wrought by the
Surety, be obedience to the same Law, that was in force under the first
Covenant, &amp; which we were obliged unto, &amp; lying under the Curse of
(as it must needs have been, seing He did substitute himself in our place, &amp;
took our debt upon Him) the Covenant is altered: for the first Covenant
knew no Righteousness, but what was our owne &amp; personal; &amp; did not
admit of a Surety. Thus these two Covenants are not confounded by us,
but kept manifestly distinct; &amp; we cannot owne their Gospel-way of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:104357:83"/>
as being a way to bring us back againe to the old Covenant of
works, with a meer pretext of some ease, as to the Conditions, or
Termes.</p>
               <p>Yet he would prove, that the two Covenants are made one by us, thus,
<hi>where the parties Covenanting are the same; &amp; the things covenanted for are the
same; and the Conditions or agreement the same, there the Covenants are every way
the same. But if the Righteousness of the Law imputed to us be the agreement, or
Condition of the New Covenant, all the three, persons, things, &amp; Conditions are
the same. Ans.</hi> (1) It may be questioned, if either the persons Covenanting, or
the things Covenanted for, in both Covenants, be the same every way;
but to speak of this is not our present purpose (2) The Covenants do not
agree, as to their Conditions; for the condition required in the Covenant
of works, was a proper antecedent condition, which is a cause of the thing
promised; but the Condition of the New Covenant is only a consequent
condition, denoting nothing else, than a connexion, or order betwixt the
thing promised, &amp; the condition required. (3) The Righteousness of the
Law imputed to us, is no condition required of us, in the New Covenant;
but it is required of us, that by faith we close with Christ, &amp; thereby come
to have an Interest in Christ, &amp; in all His Righteousness, to all ends and
purposes; which our case and necessity calleth for. (4) This Righteousness
of the Law was called for from us, in our own persons, in the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
but in the New Covenant, the righteousness is Imputed to us, when
we beleeve in Him. And this, as is said, is enough to distinguish these
Covenants.</p>
               <p>But he thinks. <hi>The Righteousness of the Law imputed from another, &amp; wrought
by ourselves do not much differ, the substance being the same. Ans.</hi> Yet this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
may make a substantial difference in the two Covenants: for when
the Covenant of Works did not admit of the performance of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by a Surety, as himself proved by foure Arguments <hi>pag.</hi> 155. And the
Covenant of Grace holdeth forth justification only through the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of another, imputed to us, &amp; received by faith: Though the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
mentioned in both, consist in conformity to the same Law; yet
the Covenants cannot but substantially differ, as is obvious to every one. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
that the righteousness imputed consisteth in more, than in Obedience
to the Law; for it comprehendeth his whole Surety-righteousness; &amp; that
took in His Sufferings also. The following objection, which he preoccupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
is purely his owne, &amp; so I leave it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 10. Chap. 17. pag. 158. &amp;c. That for which Righteousness is imputed to
those that beleeve, cannot be imputed to them for righteousness. But the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ is that, for which righteousness is imputed to those that beleeve.</hi>
Ergo. The <hi>Assumption</hi> he thinks none will deny, but such as deny the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
to be the Meritorious Cause of that Righteousness or justification,
which is conferred upon men. The <hi>Major</hi> he thus proveth <hi>If it be Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the thing merited should be the same thing, with that, which is the
Meritorious Cause thereof, then it is not only not true, but impossible, that the
Righteousness of Christ should be the Righteousness of a beleever. But the former is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:104357:83"/>
true</hi> Ergo &amp;c. <hi>Aus.</hi> This is nothing but a pure fallacy, founded upon a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
mistake <hi>viz</hi> of confounding righteousness &amp; justification as if they were
one &amp; the same. To discover this, let us put <hi>Iustification</hi> for <hi>Righteousness</hi> in
the first Argument, thus. That for which beleevers are justified, cannot be
imputed to them for righteousness, But the Righteousness of Christ is that
for which beleevers are justified. Therefore &amp;c. Who seeth not now, how
false the <hi>Major propositions</hi> is; &amp; how impertinent &amp; ridiculous the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof is? justification, which is the Effect, or the thing merited,
is not the same thing with the Righteousness of Christ, the Meritorious cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 11. pag.</hi> 160. If the Righteousness of Christ be imputed to a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
for righteousness, in his justification, then the meritorious cause of
his justification is imputed. But that cannot be imputed. Ergo &amp;c. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the <hi>Minor,</hi> which is denied, thus, <hi>Because the Meritorious cause, being
a kind of Efficient can not be either the matter, or the forme of that, whereof it
is Efficient—It is an Inviolable Law amongs the foure kindes of causes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,
Formal, Final &amp; Efficient, that the two former do only</hi> ingredi composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>or</hi> effectum, <hi>&amp; are</hi> partes rei constitutae; <hi>&amp; that the two latter are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
extrinsecal, &amp; stand without. Ans.</hi> All which is but vaine argueing,
grounded upon this palpable mistake, that justification is a physical Effect,
like the whiteing of a wall; (which is the example, whereby, he illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats
the matter) &amp; therefore he thinketh, that these termes are used,
in this matter, in as proper a sense, as when they are applied to physical
causes &amp; Effects; whileas the matter is quite otherwise; &amp; many of these
termes are here used, but in a metaphorical sense. But to the matter,
whether Imputed Righteousness, be called the Material cause, with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
or the formal cause, with others, of justification, is no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
seing every one hath liberty to explaine, in what sense he useth these
termes, in this matter; &amp; I should rather choose to use the terme (if
such like termes must be used) of the <hi>formal objective cause,</hi> or <hi>Reason;</hi> This
is enough to us, That it is that, whereby they become juridically righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;
&amp; that, upon the consideration whereof, now imputed to them,
they are pronounced Righteous &amp; justified; &amp; so is the meritorious cause
of their justification, &amp; that Righteousness, which covereth them, &amp;
upon the account of which, they are declared &amp; pronounced Righteous:
as the payment of the Surety, is as the meritorious cause in Law of the
absolution of the debtor, &amp; the ground upon which he is absolved, being
accounted his payment, because the debtor &amp; Surety are one person in Law.
As in a juridical sentence of Absolution of an accused debtor, there is no
proper formal, or material cause; so neither in the matter of justification,
which is God's juridical Act &amp; Sentence.</p>
               <p>Yet I cannot acquiesce to what he addeth, saying <hi>That only remission of
sins or absolution from punishment, is as the forme applied unto, or put upon the
matter, &amp; the matter or subject it self, where unto this forme is applied;</hi> Not
only because, according to his own argueing, one thing cannot be both
matter &amp; forme of the same thing; but because Remission of sins in hereby
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:104357:84"/>
made the whole of justification; whereas to speak properly it is but an
Effect or consequent, or at most a part thereof; &amp; the person justified is
properly absolved from the accusation &amp; declared to be Righteous; &amp; so
is legally constituted or put into a state of Righteousness, or of Righteous
persons, whereupon followeth freedom from guilt, or punishment, &amp; a
Right to the reward: &amp; as to this State, whatever we shall conceive as
the forme thereof, it must be a Righteousness; &amp; consequently the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ imputed; for sinners can have no other.</p>
               <p>Obj. 12. <hi>If the meritorious cause of our justification be imputed unto us, thon
the Effects themselves of this cause may be imputed to us also; &amp; so we may be
said to have merited both our own justification, &amp; salvation: for if I may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
or reputed to have wrought that Righteousness, which is meritorious, why
may I not be conceived as well to have merited? Nay further, if I may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to have wrought that Righteousness in Christ, whereby I am justified my self,
I may as well be conceived to have wrought that Righteousness, by which the
whole world is justified. Ans.</hi> This is but a meer sophisme, founded upon
a mistake: The <hi>consequence</hi> is false, &amp; the proof thereof standeth only upon
this rotten bottome. That to say, That Christ's Righteousness is imputed
to us, is to say, that we are reputed, esteemed, or accounted to have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
or wrought that Righteousness our selves; whileas the true meaning of
Imputation is this. That the Righteousness of Christ is made over by grace
unto Beleevers, &amp; reckoned upon their score, where by they are dealt
with now, no other wayes, than if they had fulfilled all Righteousness,
in their own person. Whence it is clear, that the Effects cannot be said to
be imputed to us; but only that we partake of the Effects thereofs, so far
as our own Necessity requireth: As the Ransom payed for the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so many captives, is imputed to each of the captives, in order to
his owne Redemption, &amp; to none of them as Redemption of others: &amp;
without this Imputation, or reckoning it upon their score, as the price of
their Redemption, no man could have right to the Effects thereof in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to himself, or could be redeemed thereby. So that it is manifest,
that through the meritorious cause, or the righteousnes of Christ imputed
to us, we obtaine justification &amp; Salvation; but do not merite them: our
Redeemer &amp; Surety meriteth them for us, &amp; we enjoy what He merited
for our own happiness. It is false then to say, That by Imputation we are
conceived to have wrought that righteousness in Christ, whereby we are
justified: &amp; therefore it cannot but be most false to think, That we may
be conceived to have wrought that righteousness also, by which others are
justified; for it was only our Head, Husband, Surety &amp; Redeemer, who
wrought it, &amp; free grace imputed it to, or reckoneth it upon the score of
Beleevers.</p>

                  <hi>Obj, 13. chap. 18. pag. 165. If the active Righteousness of Christ be in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
&amp; formality of it imputed unto me, in my justification, then I am reputed
before God, to have wrought that righteousness in Christ. But this is false</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Ans.</hi> Neither proposition is true: The <hi>Major</hi> is denied, unless by these
word, <hi>letter and formality,</hi> he understand such an Imputation, as we do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104357:84"/>
&amp; his words would seem to import this: <hi>for</hi> (saith he, in
confirmation of the <hi>Major) to have any thing imputed to a man, in the letter
of it, is to be reputed the doer of what is so imputed to him:</hi> And if this be the
only sense of his <hi>proposition,</hi> the <hi>conclusion</hi> maketh not against us: for we
asserte no such Imputation, as inferreth such a Reputation, Nay, to say,
That God should repute things so, were to destroy all Imputation, for
what God (whose judgment is according to truth) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eputeth us to have
done, we must have done it; &amp; if we have really done it, &amp; be reputed
to have done it by the Lord, it cannot be said to be imputed to us, in the
sense we take Imputation; for Imputation with us, is of that, which we
have not, or did not, &amp; which God knoweth &amp; judgeth we did not; &amp;
yet is by Imputation so made over to us, &amp; put upon our score, &amp; rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
upon our account, as that we are as really made partakers of the
Effects thereof, that is, of justification &amp;c. As if we had done it oursel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
or it had been ours, without &amp; before any Imputation. Hence the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
is made the righteousness of God in Christ; &amp; not reputed, or
esteemed to have been the righteousness of God, but now, through the
gracious Imputation of God, &amp; through faith made to be so.</p>
               <p>Hence we see, that the proof of his <hi>Minor</hi> goeth upon the same Mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
<hi>if</hi> (saith he) <hi>I be reputed before God to have wrought Righteousness, in
Christ in my justification, then is Christ, in His Sufferings, reputed before God
to have sinned in me. Ans.</hi> We say neither the one, nor the other. Christ did
not sinne in us, nor did the Lord repute Him to have done so. But he
was <hi>made sin,</hi> by Imputation; the guilt of sin being laid upon Him; or
our sinnes, as to their guilt, being caused to meet on Him. Whence it
came to passe, that He suffered as really the punishment of sin, as if He had
sinned in us, whileas, as to His own person, He knew no sin, neither was
deceit found in His mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 14. pag. 166. If the Active obedience of Christ be imputed, then His Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
is imputed also. Ans.</hi> And why not? <hi>If the death &amp; Sufferings of Christ</hi>
(saith he) <hi>be imputed unto me; then may I be accounted or reputed to have died
or suffered in Christ. But this cannot be: because in Christ, we are justified &amp;
absolved from punishment; &amp; therefore cannot be said to have been punished in Him.
Ans.</hi> This whole Argument is of a piece with the foregoing: Though the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
it be upon the matter answered already: Yet we shall adde this word
further. That though in one sense it is false, to say, That we are reputed to
have died &amp; Suffered in Christ <hi>viz physically;</hi> yet in a <hi>legal</hi> sense, it may
be admitted, as a truth, that Beleevers, who now by faith are in Christ,
&amp; of His Body, are accounted &amp; reputed to have suffered in Christ, their
Head, Surety &amp; Publick person; &amp; therefore are now dealt with, as, such.
Hence they are said to be crucified with Christ, to be dead &amp; buried with
Him, &amp; to be risen with Him <hi>Rom.</hi> 6: 4, 5, 6. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 5, 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2: 12.
Yet it will not follow hence, that in a legal sense Christ can be said to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
sinned in us; for we were not His Representative or Head. Though the
debtor may be said, in Law sense, to have paid his creditor, in his Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys
payment; Yet the Surety cannot be said to be contracting debt, in the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:104357:85"/>
debtor, for the debtor's deed cannot affect him, untill he voluntarily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himself to be Surety, where may be after the debt is already contracted
by the debtor. And to say, in this <hi>Law sense,</hi> that Beleevers Suffered in
Christ, doth not weaken the ground of our justification, absolution, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
&amp; Healing, as is manifested above, unless we turn. <hi>Socinians;</hi>
&amp; then upon this same ground, we may deny all the Satisfaction of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 15. pag. 168. If the Righteousness of Christ be imputed to us, then
are we justified, at least in part, by the ceremonial Law; because part of that
Righteousness, which Christ wrought, stood in obedience to the ceremonial Law.
But this is not true.</hi> Ergo &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> We are not said to be justified either by
the Moral, or by the Ceremonial Law; But by the righteousness of Christ,
which consisted in yeelding perfect obedience to the Law of God, &amp; in
answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the demands of the Law, in the behalf of His owne. And
so, though the Law doth not justifie us, because we are sinners; yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can the Law now condemne us, because Christ, our Surety, hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
fulfilled it, &amp; given full Satisfaction to the Law given, for our vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
thereof. And, in this matter, the Ceremonial Law is not to be
separated from the Moral, it being but a branch, or an Appendix thereof,
&amp; enjoined thereby: for the Moral Law saith, that God must be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
only that way, which Himself hath prescribed, &amp; that Ceremonial
worship being the then Instituted worship of God, whosoever knowing this
did not worship God after that manner; did violat the Second of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law, which became not Him to do, who came to fulfill all righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And thus the righteousness of obedience, that is Imputed, is Moral,
or righteousness consisting in obedience to the Moral Law. And this is
wholly imputed to all beleevers, whether of Jewes, or of Gentiles, in
reference to their own Redemption, or delivery. The <hi>objection,</hi> which
he frameth against himself. <hi>viz. That the Moral Righteousness is Sufficient, &amp;
the other needeth not be imputed,</hi> is none of ours, as appeareth by what is said;
for we do not exclude the Ceremonial, But reduce it to the Moral, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to <hi>that</hi> being enjoined by <hi>this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 16. Chap. 19. If the Righteousness of Christ be imputed to us, then are
our sinnes imputed to Christ, the same manner. But this is not so.</hi> Ergo. The
<hi>Minor</hi> he proveth thus <hi>If the sinnes of Men be imputed to Christ, then God looks
upon Him, &amp; reputes Him, in His Sufferings, as one that truly &amp; really
had provoked Him, &amp; sinned against Him. Ans.</hi> This consequence is denied;
for no such Reputation, or Estimation followeth upon the Imputation,
which we assert, as hath been already cleared: only this will follow, that
Christ being, through His own willing consent, in our Law-place, as
our Surety, &amp; having undertaken to pay our debt, He was exacted upon,
&amp; dealt with by Justice, as if He had been the true sinner, though He
knew no sin; as Beleevers, having Christ's righteousness imputed to them,
are dealt with, as if they had kept the Law, &amp; made Satisfaction by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
But as God doth not look upon them, nor esteem, nor consider them,
nor repute them, as having really fulfilled the Law in their own Physical
persons; so nor doth He look upon, esteem, consider or repute Christ to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104357:85"/>
have been truely &amp; really a Transgressour of the Law, in His person.
Hence we see, that his proof, that God did not look upon Christ so, is
impertinent; for we do not say so, knowing that to look upon Christ, as
one that had truely sinned, were to look upon Him, as deserving in Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
what was inflicted upon Him; &amp; that God's judgment is alwayes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to truth; &amp; that Christ knew no sin in Himself, but was made sin,
as having the guilt of our sinnes imputed to Him, when He put Himself
in our room &amp; Law-place; &amp; so He died &amp; Suffered for us, in our
stead, &amp; became a Sacrifice for sin, having the guilt thereof laid on
Him.</p>

                  <hi>Obj. 17. pag. 173. If the Righteousness of Christ be imputed unto us, in our
justification, then God doth look upon us, as worthy of that justification. But
this is an unclean saying.</hi> Ergo. The <hi>Major</hi> he thus proveth. <hi>If God reputes
me to have kept the Law, as perfectly as Christ did, He must conceive of me,
as worthy of my justification; for as the fulfilling of the Law, &amp; deserving ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
are the same Rom.</hi> 4: 4. <hi>So the reputing of a man to have done the one,
is the reputing of him to have deserved the other.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> he thus confirmeth,
<hi>Because then God should show us no grace or favour in our justification. (Rom.</hi> 4:
4. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 6) <hi>But if any favour be shewed, it is only in this, that He
reputeth us worthy to be justified, or puts a worthiness upon us for justification;
whereas the Scripture expresly affirmeth, that God justifieth the ungodly, that is the
unworthy Rom.</hi> 4: 5. <hi>Ans.</hi> Unto all this, I say (1.) We say not, that God
imputeth to us the righteousness of Christ, in justification; But that He
doth it in order to justification. (2.) Though Christ's Righteousness be
imputed to us; Yet it will not follow; that God looketh upon us, as
worthy of our justification, <hi>viz</hi> in ourselves: &amp; it may be yeelded, that
He looketh on us, when clothed with Christ's righteousness, a worthy of
justification, <hi>viz</hi> in Christ our Surety <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> with whose righteousness we are
now covered, when it is imputed unto us. But then the conclusion will
make nothing against us. (3.) If the meaning be, that therefore God loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
upon us, as worthy of justification in our selves, the <hi>consequence</hi> is
false; &amp; the Reason adduced for confirmation is invalide: for the Text
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 4. speaketh of him that worketh, &amp; so hath the ground of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
in himself: he indeed that fulfilleth the Law in himself deserveth to be
justified. And let our Adversaries see to this, who will have no Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
imputed, but our own faith, which is in us, &amp; is our own, &amp; is,
in their account, as good as the fulfilling of the Law, &amp; is accepted for
that end: for Sure, such as have this faith, which is in them, reputed
for their righteousness, upon the account of which they are justified, must
have the reward reckoned to them, not of grace, but of debt; &amp; so must
merite &amp; deserve their justification, in full &amp; proper sense. (4.) It is not
to be admitted, as a truth, without the forementioned distinction, to say,
that <hi>the reputing of a man to have done the one, is the reputing of him to have
deserved the other,</hi> for to repute a man to have done the one, in his own
person, is indeed a reputing of him to have deserved the other. But we
assert no such Reputation in God; for His judgment is according to truth;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104357:86"/>
But only assert an Imputation, which taketh away this Reputation, these
two being inconsistent: &amp; from this Imputation can no such thing be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
(5.) It is true, if we deserved justification, justification should be no act
grace; but we deserve no such thing, being in our selves, &amp; as to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
indeed ungodly; yet when justified, we are looked upon as clothed
with the Righteousness of Christ, imputed to us, &amp; received by faith: &amp;
so, though our justification be merited by Christ, &amp; be an Act of justice
&amp; truth in God, in reference to Christ; yet as to us, it is of free grace;
&amp; so much the more of free grace, that the righteousness of Christ is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to us for that end. And such as understand not this, are more principled
with <hi>Socinian</hi> abominations, than with the doctrine of the Gospel of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of God.</p>

from the question now in hand; so it is but a meer exhaling of vapores out

which men explaine after their own pleasure, knowing no Law, constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

which is imputed, whether it be called the <hi>Formal,</hi> or the <hi>Material</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of our justification, it is but a nominal debate, having no ground, or
occasion, in the Word of God, by which alone we should be ruled in
our thoughts &amp; expressions, in this matter. Nor do they, who say, we are
formally just by Christ's righteousness, say, we are formally just by God's
Act imputing that righteousness; But by the righteousness it self imputed
by God &amp; received by faith. Nor do they say, that men become formally
sinful by the like act of God, imputing <hi>Adam's</hi> sin unto his posterity, but by
<hi>Adam's</hi> sin imputed: though God's Act be the cause of this effect, it is not
the effect it self. <hi>Adam's</hi> sin imputed doth constitute the posterity sinners,
that is guilty &amp; obnoxious to wrath: so Christ's righteousness imputed doth
constitute beleevers Righteous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 19. pag. 175. If justification consists in the Imputation of Christ's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
partly in Remission of sins, then must there be a double formal cause
of justification, &amp; that made up &amp; compounded of two several natures, really dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the one from the other. But this is impossible,</hi> Ergo. <hi>Ans.</hi> (1.) This
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104357:86"/>
Argument is founded upon another School-nicety, or notion, <hi>viz</hi> the
Simplicity &amp; Indivisibility of Natural formes: &amp; this Philosophical Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is here adduced to darken the mystery, we are treating of. It were a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
answere then to say, That the <hi>Minor,</hi> though it be true in natural
formes; Yet will not necessarily hold, in the privileges of Saints, which
may be single, or compounded, as the Lord thinketh meet to make them.
And can any reason evince, that the Lord cannot conferre &amp; bestow, in
the grand privilege of justification, moe particular favoures than one? Can
He not both pardon sins, &amp; accept as, &amp; declare to be Righteous? Can
He not both free the beleever from the condemnation of hell, &amp; adjudge
him to the life of glory? or cannot these two be conceived as two things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
distinct, though inseparable? (2.) But I shall not say, That Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Christ's righteousness is a part of justification; But rather that it
is the ground thereof, &amp; necessarily presupposed thereunto. Nor shall I
say, that Remission of sins is the forme, or formal cause of justification;
a pardoned man, as such, not being a justified man. It is true, pardon
of sins doth inseparably follow upon, &amp; is a necessary effect of our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
&amp; a certaine consequent of God's accepting of us, as righteous in
His sight, upon the account of the righteousness of Christ, imputed to us
&amp; received by faith. I grant also that justification may be so described, or
defined, as to take in that Effect, without making it thereby a formal part
thereof, when strickly considered. (3.) But he will have Remission of
sins to be the whole of justification, &amp; nothing more included therein, or
conferred thereby, abusing to this end (as we heard above) <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7,
8. Where the Apostle is citing the words of the Psalmist &amp; is not giving
us a formal definition of justification; nor saying, that justification is the
same with Remission; nor that Remission's the formal cause of justification:
but only is proving, that justification is not by our works, as the ground
thereof, &amp; that by this reason, Because that would utterly destroy free Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
which is a necessary Effect &amp; consequent of Gospel-justification,
&amp; cannot be had without it; in order to which justification, he there as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serteth
expresly an Imputation of righteousness: Now, an Imputation of
righteousness is not formally one &amp; the same thing with Remission of sins;
nor can Remission of sins be-called a righteousness, or the Righteousness
of God, or of Christ: yet the Man is a blessed man, whose sins are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
because that man is necessarily covered with the righteousness of
Christ, whose sins are covered: for Imputation of righteousness &amp; free
pardon do inseparably attend one another. Nor is it to the purpose to say.
That pardon is a passive righteousness, though not an Active righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
for all righteousness, rightly so called, is conformity to the Law,
&amp; that is not a passive or Negative righteousness, which may be in a beast,
that transgresseth no Law, &amp; consequenly hath no unrighteousness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 20. pag. 176. If such Imputation be necessary, in justification, this
necessity must be found either in respect of the justice of God, or in respect of His
Mercy, or for the salving or advancing of some other attribute. But there is no
necessity in respect of any of these.</hi> Ergo. <hi>Ans.</hi> (1) This same man tels us, that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104357:87"/>
there is a necessity for the Imputation of faith, as our Righteousness, not
withstanding of all that Christ hath done; and why may he not grant the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
necessity for the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ? will it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
him, that we found the necessity of Imputation of Christ's Righteouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
on the same ground? (2) Though we should not be in case to assigne the
real &amp; just ground of this necessity; yet, I judge, it should satisfie us, that
the Lord, in His wisdom &amp; Goodness, hath thought fit to appointe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
this methode &amp; manner of justification; &amp; so far should we be from
disputing against this Truth, with such Arguments, &amp; from rejecting of it
untill we be satisfied, as to the grounds of necessity requiring this, that we
should receive it, close with it, and embrace it with all thankfulness, as a
Mystery of Love, free Grace &amp; wisdom, that Angels may wonder at. (3)
Yet, accrding to the Scriptures, we may say, that the Truth &amp; Justice of
God require this: for His judgment is alwayes according to truth <hi>Rom.</hi> 2: 2.
and it would be an abomination in His eyes to justifie one every way wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Therefore, if He pronounce a person righteous, in His sight, which
He doth when He justifieth a person, that person must be a Righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
but when no man can be justified, or pronounced Righteous, as being
inherently Righteous <hi>Psal.</hi> 130: 3. &amp; 143: 2. all, who are justified, must
be clothed with an Imputed Righteousness: for God must be just, even when
he justifieth him, which beleeveth in Jesus <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 26.</p>
               <p>In reference to the <hi>justice of God,</hi> he saith, <hi>That there is nothing at all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be done either by God himself, or by man, about justification of a sinner,
by way of Satisfaction to the justice of God, since that one offering of Christ of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon the cross. Ans.</hi> We plead not for Imputation, upon any such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
nor do we see the least ground to think, that this should derogat any
thing from the full &amp; compleat Satisfaction of Christ, made to justice, or
from the price, laid down by Him, as if this Imputation were required, to
supply some thing wanting there: Yea our doctrine of Imputation doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confirme &amp; establish the same, it being an application of the Sponsor's
Surety-righteousness, or payment &amp; Satisfaction unto the debtors, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their Absolution &amp; freedome from the sentence. Though the Surety
hath paid the creditor; yet the Law may require, that when the debtor is
charged or challenged for the debt, the payment of his Surety be instructed
&amp; made manifest unto the judges: And yet it will not hence follow, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the Satisfaction or payment, made by the Surety, was defective and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient.</p>
               <p>He further saith. <hi>That God can as well and as truely pronounce that Man righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
that wants a literal or legal Righteousness (especially supposing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hath
another Righteousness, holding any Analogy or proportion thereto) as he may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
any Mans uncircumcision circumcision</hi> Rom. 2: 26. <hi>Ans.</hi> That the Lord
may deal with one uncircumcised, that keepeth the Law, no less than if he
were circumcised; and so thereby declare, that He valueth not outward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
so much, as the jewes were ready to dream, who questieneth?
But what is this to the business in hand? shall we therefore think, that the
Lord, whose judgment is according to truth, shall account any Righteous,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104357:87"/>
who have no righteousness? Shall we think, that the Righteous judge shall
pronounce &amp; declare him to be Righteous, who is not so? (2.) He may
think to warde this of by his parenthesis; But, I pray, what is that other
righteousness, that holds any analogy or proportion to the righteousness,
required by the Law of God? Is that the single Act of faith? Sure, that
must hold a very unproportionable proportion &amp; a poor analogy unto
Obedience to all commands of God! I need not take notice of that word
<hi>legall righteousness literally so called;</hi> for he hath many such of little other use,
than to amuse the Reader, &amp; darken the matter (3.) If by this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
righteousness, he mean the righteousness of Christ, which may
be said to hold an analogy to the righteousness of the Law, which man was
obliged to performe, which possibly he understandeth by <hi>a legal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
literally &amp; properly so called,</hi> he speaketh truth, &amp; yeeldeth the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se;
for that is it, we contend for.</p>
               <p>But afterward he seemeth to tell us, what he meaneth by analogical righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
saying <hi>So may God, with as much righteousness &amp; truth, pronounce,
&amp; call or account a man righteous, that is not strickly, properly or literally, such,
if he hath any qualification upon him, that any way answereth, or holdeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
in any point, with such a Righteousness, as he should do, in case this
man had this legal righteousness upon him, in the absolutest perfection of the letter.
Ans.</hi> And who may not see the folly of this Reddition, to inferre this from
the Lord's calling <hi>Iohn Baptist Elias</hi> &amp; the like? Will he make the Lord's
pronouncing sentence, in judgment, as a righteous judge (as He doth in
the matter of justification) to be such a figurative speach, as when <hi>Iohn
Baptist</hi> was called <hi>Elias,</hi> because he had some resemblance to <hi>Elias,</hi> when
he came in his Spirit &amp; power? Will he be accounted a righteous judge,
upon earth, who in judgment should pronounce that man righteous,
who, in stead of the righteousness he should have had, hath only one
poor qualification upon him, that some way or other holdeth proportion
with it, in any point? If so, it will be a great question, if ever any wicked
man can be condemned, seing it will be rare to finde one, that hath never
all his dayes done some thing, that answereth to the Law, in some poor
way or measure, as to same one point or other. Yea, if we might drive
this further, it might be made probable, that hence it would follow, that
all the world should be justified even in the sight of God. But enough of this,
which is too too gross. Yet wo heare not what that qualification is.</p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>when God pronounceth a man righteous, it is sufficient to beare out
the</hi> justice <hi>&amp;</hi> truth <hi>of God, if his person be under any such relation, &amp; condition,
as belongeth to a legal righteousness, or which a legal righteousness would cast upon
him. Ans.</hi> What before was called a Qualification, is here called a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or condition; &amp; these seem not to be one &amp; the same thing: But what
if that Relation, or condition have no foundation, how shall the Lord,
upon that account, pronounce such a person righteous? or, though it be
not founded upon a legal righteousness, performed by the mans self in his
own person, yet may it not be founded upon a Surety-righteousness im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:104357:88"/>
But what is this? He addeth, <hi>Now, one special privilege or benefite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to a perfect legal righteousness, is to free the person, in whom it is found,
from death &amp; condemnation, &amp; he that hath his sins forgiven him, is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
with him in the fulness of this privilege, is as free of condemnation, as he
Ans.</hi> But he hath not yet proved, that any man is pardoned, without the
Imputed righteousness of Christ: &amp; beside, righteousness bringeth with
it, as a special privilege or benefite, right to the promised Inheritance of
Glory: But a pardoned man, as such, hath not this Right, nor yet can
challenge it, as was showne above. <hi>Moreover,</hi> if God pronounce a Man
righteous, because he is pardoned, then the man must be pardoned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he be justified; for in justification he is declared &amp; pronounced Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
&amp; not made such: &amp; if he be pardoned, before he be justified par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
is not the forme of justification, nor the whole thereof, as he saith,
but rather something antecedent thereto.</p>
               <p>What in fine he saith, is but what we have often heard <hi>viz That forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of sins, is a</hi> true &amp; compleat righteousness, <hi>in the kind,</hi> a passive righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
<hi>as absolute &amp; perfect in the kind of it, as any</hi> Active righteousnest:
<hi>And for him that hath once sinned, there is no other righteousness applicable to him,
but only this, which for all other ends, purposes, advantages, privileges what
som ever, is as offectual as the</hi> active righteousness <hi>it self could be. Ans.</hi> (1.) No
Scripture calleth pardon of sins a righteousness (2.) A passive righteons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is no righteonsness, as we lately made appear. (3.) That another righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
even the positive Surety-righteousness of Christ, is applicable
unto a sinner, hath been hithertil evinced. (4.) pardon, as such, can
give no Right to the reward, promised to obedience; &amp; therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be as effectual, as an active righteousness, to all Ends, purposes, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
&amp; privileges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 21. Chap. 20. That, which having been dhne, in our own person, could
not have been our justification, nor any part of the righteousness, by which we
could have been justified, cannot be made our justification, nor any part of it, by
Imputation from another. But such is the righteousness of the Law, pretended to
be imputed from Christ.</hi> Ergo &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> (1.) We do not call the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ our justification; nor do we say, that it is made our
justification or any part of it, by Imputation unto us: nor yet do we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
it a part only of the righteousness, by which we are justified; for His
righteousness is the whole of that righteousness: Nor by His Surety-righteousness
imputed to us, do we understand only His Active obedience
to the Law. (2.) He here Supposeth that we say, there is nothing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to us, in order to our justification, but Christ's Obedience to the
Law, without His Satisfaction by Suffering: And thus we see, the maine
pilla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of this Argument are weak, &amp; its whole foundation being sandy, it
cannot stand.</p>
               <p>He confirmeth the <hi>Major</hi> thus. <hi>If a personal fulfilling of the Law could ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
been no justification, nor part of justification to us, certainly an Imputative
fulfilling of it could not have been either. The Imputation of a thing from another
cannot adde any strength to it, above a personal acting, yet the Nature of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104357:88"/>
is only to supply the defect of personal performance, &amp; therefore cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
it. Ans.</hi> Though obedience to the Law cannot availe us, now we are
sinners, even though it were perfect (which is in effect a supposition of
what is impossible yea &amp; self contradictary, &amp; therefore can lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of no truth, in an Argument) yet it could have availed <hi>Adam,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
standing, &amp; us in him. (2.) The Righteousness, which is now imputed,
is not the Righteousness of a sinner; &amp; so cannot be called the same with
that Rightoeusness, which is supposed to be done by us, who are sinners:
for the Righteousness in the supposition had been no righteousness at all,
not being compleet &amp; perfect. Now, who seeth not, that the Imputation
of a perfect righteousness hath other strength &amp; vertue, then that hath
which is personal &amp; Imperfect? (3.) The Imputation of an Obedience,
perfect &amp; compleet, can availe such, as are recocciled by the death of
Christ, when personal obedience, suppose it never so full (if the supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
could be made) cannot availe such, as are under God's curse because
of sin already committed.</p>
               <p>He confirmeth the <hi>Minor</hi> thus, <hi>Man being once fallen &amp; made obnoxious to
condemnation, can never be recovered againe by ten thousand observations of this
Law. Ans.</hi> Though the observation of the Law, could it now be done by
fallen man, which is impossible, cannot availe unto justification; yet, as
is said, it could have availed man, while standing: &amp; man remaining still
under the obligation, it is his debt: &amp; seing it is now impossible for him to
pay this debt, his Surety must pay it for him, &amp; the Surety's payment must
be reckoned on his score.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 22. That which men are not bound by any Law, or command of God, to
do, in their own persons, for their justification, cannot be imputed from another to
any such and. But men are not bound, by any such Law, to observe the Law,
for their justification.</hi> Ergo &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> I distinguish thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That
which men neither now are, nor never were bound to do, in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for their justification, by any Law, or command of God, cannot be
imputed from another, to any such end; this is granted: but the <hi>assumption</hi>
speaketh only of what men now are obliged unto; &amp; so the Argument is
inconcludent. That which men, though once obliged unto, in their own
persons, in order to justification, yet now are not obliged unto by the Law
of God, cannot be imputed from another, to any such end: this is false.
Let us hear his proof. <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>Imputation is found out &amp; ordained
by God to supply personal defects: But where there is no Law, there can be no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
defect. Ans.</hi> Imputation is not found out &amp; ordained by God, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the want of that, which men are now obliged unto by the Law of God;
but to supply what once they were obliged unto, &amp; is not yet done: and
the reason is, because the Law, being not abrogat by the breach thereof,
continueth in force to oblige to perfect &amp; Exact Obedience; &amp; every vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
thereof is a sin before God: &amp; because it must be satisfied, even as
to this, ere any can think to enjoy the reward promised to perfect obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce;
&amp; no man can satisfie the demands of the Law by himself: therefore
every one, who would have the Reward, &amp; partake of Life, must have
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104357:89"/>
a perfect obedience imputed to him to the end, that, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing
of the Law, the sinner may be-justified, &amp; the Law established.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Minor</hi> I only say, That albeit no Man be under any command of
God, now to observe the Moral Law perfectly, that thereby they may
be justified, the Lord having now provided another way, in the Gospel
which all, to whom it is revealed, are bound to take: Yet all, out of
Christ, &amp; who have not yeelded obedience unto the Gospel, are still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the old covenant, being not as yet brought in into the New: &amp; so,
while they abide there, have no other way, whereby to expect justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the old way, hold forth in the old covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
which is now become Impassible: for till they beleeve in Christ,
they are still in Nature, &amp; are not translated into the Kingdom of Jesus
Christ, though, as to such as hear the Gospel, there is a command to
beleeve in Jesus Christ, to the end they may be justified: But as to such,
as either hear not the Gospel, or hearing it would not yeeld obedience
thereto, they have no other way, whereby they can expect justification,
but doing of the Law <hi>Rom.</hi> 2: 13. &amp; that is also a desperat &amp; Impossible
way, when the Law is already now broken. The meaning of these words
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2: 13. <hi>The doers of the Law shall be justified,</hi> is not, what he imagineth
<hi>pag. 184. viz.</hi> That God will accept, justifie, &amp; save only such, who out
of a sincere &amp; sound faith to wards Him by His Christ, address themselves
to serve &amp; please Him, in a way of obedience to His Lawes: for this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of the words keepeth no correspondence with the scope of the Apostle
there, nor with the Circumstances of the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 23. If God requires only faith of men to their justification, then He imputes
this faith unto them there-unto. But God requires only faith to justification.</hi> Ergo
&amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> (1.) The conclusion is not directly the thing, that is now in
question, but another question, of which hereafter in due time. (2.) The
<hi>Minor</hi> is false to some of his own party, who joine works with faith. (3.)
The <hi>Major</hi> is denied; for though God require faith of men to their justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
Yet that faith is not imputed unto them <hi>viz.</hi> as their Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
It may be, he meaneth no more by the word <hi>Impute</hi> here, but to
accept of it, when performed, according as it is prescribed: and indeed
his proof annexed can evince nothing else; <hi>because</hi> (saith he) <hi>to impute unto
justification, &amp; to accept unto justification are nothing differing at all, in sense &amp;
signification: Now if God should require faith of Men, &amp; only faith to their justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
&amp; not accept it thereunto, he should make a bargaine, &amp; not stand to it:</hi>
for hereby it is manifest, that to Impute faith unto justification, is but to
accept it, in order to justification, in the place, &amp; for the end, which
God hath fixed to it, &amp; required it for; that is, to be a Mean &amp; Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the business, &amp; to be the way of Interessing us in the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, the sole Righteousness for which, &amp; ground upon which,
we are justified. This then being the meaning of his <hi>Major Proposition,</hi> for
any thing that yet appeareth, his whole Argument is but a meer sophistical
evasion. (4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) It is true, God requireth of us only faith, as an Instrument &amp;
mean to lay hold upon the Righteousness of Christ, in order to our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104357:89"/>
but this is so far from proving that therefore there is no necessity
for the Righteousness of Christ, that, on the contrary, it establisheth that
truth more firmly: for the faith, that is required unto justification, is
not a bare historical faith, but such a faith, as carrieth the beleever out of
himself, to seek a Righteousness in Christ, &amp; declareth his full Satisfaction
therewith, &amp; his resting thereupon, in order to his Acceptance with God,
&amp; being justified &amp; absolved from the sentence of the Law, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of which he was lying. (5) The scope and drift of this <hi>Objection</hi> is to
separat these things, that God hath most firmly and manifestly conjoined,
<hi>viz.</hi> God's Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ, and our Receiving
that gift of Righteousness by faith, and the atonement through faith. But,
as was shown above, the Scripture holdeth forth the necessity of both, and
what God hath conjoined, let no man separate.</p>
               <p>To this he saith. <hi>If the Righteousness of Christ be that, which is imputed,
&amp; not the faith, that is required of them, then may this Righteousness be Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to this end, before, yea &amp; without the faith of any man; for this faith adds
no vertue, or value to that Righteousness. Ans.</hi> This being God's free Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
His will should serve us for a Law; and in stead of too curious enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
whether this might be, or not be without the other, or before the
other, we should rest satisfied with God's Method; &amp; therein carry more
like Christians, than in making such objections against His express determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
What though it were granted, that God might, if it had so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Him, impute the Righteousness of Christ unto sinners, before, or
without their faith; will it therefore follow, that now faith is unnecessary;
or, if faith be asserted to be necessary, that therefore the Imputation of
Christ's Righteousness must be denied? Why? what ground can be given
for such fictions? Nay, will not this be as strong against the objecters, if
Christ made full Satisfaction to Justice, what necessity is there for the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of faith unto Righteousness? Thus we see, the objecter must either tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
fully <hi>Socinian,</hi> or reject this way of argueing.</p>
               <p>But he will not rest satisfied with the good pleasure of God, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for he addeth <hi>pag. 186. If the will &amp; pleasure of God be to make no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the Righteousness of Christ, but upon the Condition of faith intervee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
then it is evident, that this Righteousness is not imputed</hi> unto justification,
<hi>to any man, because the Condition of faith must necessarily interveen, so that if
this Righteousness of Christ were imputed unto men, yet it must be only</hi> towards <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
not unto it; for faith hath the next &amp; most immediat connexion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.

&amp; himself faine to shelter himself under such fig leaves, to cover his nakedness,
than evidenceth any apparent probability of a real ground of Scrupling here.
We say, That the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, which is God's
Act, hath as immediat a connexion with justification, as Faith hath, which
is our Act: for there is no priority or posteriority here, as to time; for
whensoever a Man beleeveth, in that same instant, Righteousness is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted;
and in that same Instant, the beleever is justified; We cannot say,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104357:90"/>
a Man is a beleever, and yet hath not the Righteousness of Christ imputed
to him, or is not justified; as we cannot say, a Man hath the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ imputed to him, and yet is not justified. Nay, the very
Argument will conclude as well, that the Imputation of Righteousness hath
a more neer connexion with justification, than faith hath; for we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
say, though a man beleeve, yet without imputation, cannot be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.
But the truth is, all such argueings are but the Cavils of men, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to darken that, which they cannot destroy; &amp; are meer sophismes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beseeming
Christians, in such a concerning business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> (saith he further) <hi>faith doth not take hold of the Righteousness of Christ
Imputed; but first takes hold of it, &amp; then the Imputation followeth &amp; then a man
may have the Righteousness of Christ upon him by faith, &amp; yet not be justified by it.
Ans.</hi> Though faith at first doth not take hold of the Righteousness of Christ,
already imputed; but of the Righteousness of Christ hold forth in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:
yet faith may leane to that Righteousness imputed, and rest upon it
(2) We assert no such Conditions, as this argument would say are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
understood by our Adversaries, that is, such Conditions, as are
like a price, that may be, for some time, in the buyers hand, before the
bargane be made; and may also be paid down some time before he obtaine
the purchase. We owne only such consequential conditions here, as are
but the means and Methods appointed of God, for such and such ends, &amp;
which have an immedial connexion with the end here intended. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we neither say, nor imagine, that a man may have the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, or Faith, &amp; yet not be justified; for in the very moment, as
was said, that a Man acteth true Gospel-and so justifying faith, he hath the
Righteousness of Christ imputed to him, and is justified: Every priority
in order of Nature doth not conclude also a priority, as to time; far less can
a man be supposed to have the Righteousness of Christ, without God's Act
of Imputation. But <hi>Finally</hi> all these Argueings returne upon his own head;
for when he saith, that faith is Imputed for Righteousness, meaning by
<hi>faith</hi> our act of beleeving, he must also say, that a man may beleeve,
and yet not be justified, untill his faith be Imputed unto Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by God, whose work alone this is: and his reply to this will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 24. That which was Imputed to</hi> Abraham <hi>for Righteousness, in his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
is imputed to other beleevers also. But the faith of</hi> Abraham <hi>was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him for Righteousness.</hi> Ergo &amp;c. And for proof of all, he referreth
us to what he hath said <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. upon <hi>Rom. 4. Ans.</hi> We shall not here antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pat
the consideration of that place, and of this Argument founded there
upon; seing afterward we will have a fitter occasion to speak hereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 25. Here is his last argument, which he largely prosecuteth <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.
<hi>pag. 188. &amp;c.</hi> and it would seem, that it is here adduced againe (for we had
it once, if not oftner before) that he may take occasion to vent his mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Imputation of <hi>Adam's</hi> sin to his posterity. Thus he Argueth. <hi>If
the Righteousness of the Law be not imputable, or derivable, in the letter and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
of it, from one mans person to another, then cannot the Righteousness of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104357:90"/>
Christ be imputed to any man, in justification. But the former is true, therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
&amp;c. Ans.</hi> What may be answered unto this <hi>Argum.</hi> the Reader may see in
the foregoing <hi>Chapter. Object last</hi> &amp; I shall not here repeat, but go on to
take notice of what he saith to that objection, which he moveth against
himself, and proposeth thus, <hi>If the transgression of the Law be imputable from
one Mans person to another, then may the Righteousness of the Law be imputed
also. But the former is hence evident, because the sin of</hi> Adam <hi>is imputed to his
posterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He <hi>first</hi> excepteth against the <hi>Major,</hi> and denieth the <hi>Consequence</hi> thereof,
and giveth reasons of his denial. 1. <hi>There is</hi> (saith he) <hi>no such Emphatical
restraint of the guilt and punishment to the transgressour, as there is of the reward
to the performer of obedience: for</hi> Gal. 3: 12. <hi>the very man that hath done them
shall live by them; which is no where said of the Transgressour. Ans.</hi> But all this is
loose reasoning: for as the Law saith, God will <hi>visite the iniquities of the
Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth Generation;</hi> so it saith, that
<hi>He will shew mercy to thousands of them that love Him, and keep His Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
and here the one is as Emphatick, as the other. (2) As he readeth
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 12. that <hi>the man that doth them, shall live in them;</hi> so we read <hi>Ezek.</hi>
18: 3. <hi>the soul that sinneth, it shall die.</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27: 26. <hi>Cursed
is every one, that abideth not in all things, which are written in the Law to do
them;</hi> which words do Import as emphatical a restraint, as the other. But
of that <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 12. we have said enough above, we might also mentione
that, which was said to <hi>Adam, in the day thou eats, thou shalt die,</hi> which
seemeth to have no less an Emphatick Import.</p>
               <p>But 2. he mentioneth this difference. <hi>Sin</hi> (saith he) <hi>is ever greater,</hi> in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
demerity, <hi>than obedience is,</hi> in ratione meriti: Adam <hi>might by his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
merite condemnation to himself and posterity, &amp; yet not have merited by
his obedience Salvation to both; because, if he had kept the Law, he had only do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
his duty. Luk.</hi> 17: 10. <hi>&amp; so had been but an unprofitable servant. Ans.</hi> All
this saith nothing, where a Covenant is made, promising life to the obeyer,
as well, as threatning death to the transgressour. Albeit <hi>Adam</hi> could not be
said to have merited life, by his obedience, in way of proper and strick
merite; yet in way of merite <hi>expacto,</hi> he could have been said to have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited;
for the reward would have been reckoned to him, not of grace, but of
debt; and there would have been ground of boasting and glorying. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 27.
<hi>&amp;</hi> 4: 2, 4. How beit he had done but his duty, when he had obeyed to the
end; yet the condescending love of God, promising the reward to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
in obedience to the end, was sufficient to found this. Whether
<hi>Adam</hi> had merited Salvation to all his posterity, if he had kept the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the end, or not, is not our present question to enquire j this we
know, <hi>that by one man sin entered into the world, &amp; death by sin, &amp; so death
passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. Rom.</hi> 5: 12. And upon the other
hand, this we know, that Christ was made sin for His, as a publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and all His promised Seed and Children are made the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God in Him. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 30. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 21. and those are sufficient for
our purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:104357:91"/>
3. He saith. <hi>The Imputableness of the transgression of the Law rather over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth
the Imputation of the obedience of it, than any wayes establisheth it: for
the more Imputable, that is, punishable, the transgression is, the less imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that is rewardable, is the obedience of it. Ans.</hi> This is very true, when
we speak of the same man, as of <hi>Adam,</hi> in both: for he could not both be
a Transgressour, and a Final Observer of the Law; and so both obedience
and Transgression could not be imputed to himself, Let be to any other; &amp;
the Imputation of the one did quite evacuat the other. But what maketh this
meer shift to his present purpose, which is to show (if he could) that the
Righteousness and obedience of the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> the Lord from heaven, is
not as imputable to His Spiritual Seed &amp; Issue, as the Sin and Transgression
of the <hi>first Adam,</hi> who was of the earth earthy. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15: 47. was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to his Natural Seed.</p>
               <p>Next, he cometh to the <hi>Minor,</hi> and denieth the Imputation of <hi>Adam's</hi>
sin; and this seemeth to be his maine buliness, wherein he complieth with
the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and others. Let us hear him, <hi>first</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Scripture
no where affirmes either the Imputation of Adam's sin, or of the Righteousness of
Christ. Ans.</hi> The contrary is sufficiently proven above; &amp; all his reasons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
evince what he saith. He tels us, that <hi>neither is the phrase, nor manner
of such speaking any wayes agreable to the language of the Holy Ghost: for still in
the Scriptures, wheresoever the word,</hi> imputing, <hi>is used, it is only applied unto
or spoken of something of the same persons, to whom the Imputation is said to be
made; &amp; never to or of any thing of anothers. Ans.</hi> Though it be true, that
some things are said to be imputed, in Scripture, unto persons, which are,
or were theirs, before the Imputation: (though that Instance of faiths
being imputed to <hi>Abraham Rom.</hi> 4. which he adduceth, doth not belong to
this head, as shall be evinced in due time) whether it be good, or evil, as
2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19: 19, <hi>Act.</hi> 7: 60. where this Imputation is deprecated. So 2.
<hi>Chron.</hi> 24: 22. <hi>Gen.</hi> 30: 33. <hi>Psal.</hi> 106: 31. Yet it is also true, that we read
of an Imputation of Something, that did not belong to, or was not possessed
by the person, before the Imputation was made; as when <hi>Paul</hi> desireth
<hi>Philemon,</hi> to impute to him what <hi>Onesimue</hi> was oweing; and that he would
reckon both the debt and the injury, whereof <hi>Onesimus</hi> might beguilty,
upon his score, and require it of him. <hi>Philem. vers</hi> 18. Thus do Sureties
take upon themselves what formerly was not theirs; and so make that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
to themselves, which formerly was not so, as we seen <hi>Gen.</hi> 43: 9. &amp;
44: 32. and the Sureties payment or Satisfaction, according to what he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
undertook, is according to Law and equity, imputable &amp; to be
imputed unto, or reckoned on the Score of the debtor, to the end he may
be dealt with, by vertue of that imputed payment &amp; Satisfaction, as if he
himself had made the payment, or given the Satisfaction. And this is the
very Nature &amp; End of this Imputation; not that the person, to whom the
Imputation is made, should be accounted one, who had that before the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
was made; but that the thing Imputed may become his, to whom
it is imputed, and he thereupon be dealt with, as now an owner &amp; possessor
of that thing by Imputatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:104357:91"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> he saith, <hi>When a thing is said simply to be imputed, as sin, folly
or righteousness, the meaning is not to be taken concerning the bare acts of things;
as if to impute sin signified to repute the man to have committed a sinful act, but
to charge the guilt or demerite of sin upon his head, of purpose to punish him for it.
Ans.</hi> This is true of such things, as are either really or falsly by injustice sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be in the person, before that imputation be made. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
hereof, there is, as we have seen, &amp; as all acts of Suretiship do
further cleare, an imputation of what was not the persons before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the thing it self, that is imputed, is legally made over unto them, &amp;
reckoned upon their score, &amp; thereupon they are dealt with, as being now
possessed of that, which is imputed; as when a person voluntarily becometh
Surety for another, as <hi>Paul</hi> for <hi>Onesimus, Iudah</hi> for <hi>Benjamin;</hi> first the
debt it self is made their &amp; reckoned upon their score, &amp; then they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
undergo the consequences thereof, that is, the payment or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thridly pag.</hi> 198. he cometh home to the point, saying. <hi>The expressions</hi>
(i.e. of Christ's Righteousness &amp; of <hi>Adam's</hi> sin) <hi>are unknown to the Holy Gost
in Scripture. Ans.</hi> This is but the old exception of <hi>Bellarmin de Iustif. lib.
2. chap.</hi> 7. &amp; of the <hi>Socinians;</hi> See <hi>Volkel do Vera Relig. lib. 5. pag.</hi> 564, 565.
who, upon this same ground, reject several other fundamental points, as
the <hi>Trinity</hi> &amp; others. But we have already shown Scripture-proof enough
of this matter; &amp; himself in the following words granteth, that there are
expressions in Scripture, concerning both the Communication of <hi>Adam's</hi>
sin, &amp; of Christ's Righteousness, that will fairly enough bear the terme of
<hi>Imputation.</hi> So that all the difference betwixt him &amp; us is about the sense of
the word.</p>
               <p>Now, we come to the matter. He speaketh to <hi>Rom.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19, giving this
for the only meaning thereof, that <hi>the demerite or guilt of</hi> Adam's <hi>sin, is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on his posterity, or that the punishment ran over from his person to them, i a maine
part of which punishment lyeth in that original defilement, wherein they are all
conceived &amp; borne, &amp; whereby they are made truely and formally sinners before
God. Ans.</hi> But, if that sin of <hi>Adam</hi> be imputed, in its curse &amp; punishment,
the sin it self must be imputed, as to its guilt; else we must say, that God
curseth &amp; punisheth the posterity, that is no wayes guilty, which to do
suiteth not the justice of God, the righteous Governour of the world. We
do not say, (as he supposeth, when he setteth down our sense of the words)
that that sinful act of eating the forbidden fruit, in the letter &amp; formality
of it (an expression that on all occasions he useth, &amp; whose sense, is not
obvious, but needeth explication, &amp; is excogitated meerly to darken the
matter) &amp; as it was <hi>Adam's</hi> own personal sin, is imputed to the posterity:
but it is enough for us, to say, with the Scripture, that by <hi>Adam's</hi> disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
his posterity became guilty; &amp; that all sinned in him; &amp; therefore
death passed on all, &amp; that guilt was by that one sin to condemnation <hi>Rom.</hi>
5: 12, 15, 16, 18, 19. &amp; so that the posterity sinned legally &amp; originally,
though not formally, because not existing in <hi>Adam</hi> actually, but legally &amp;
originally; &amp; became thereby obnoxious to the punishment threatned,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:104357:92"/>
that is, death both in body &amp; Soul, here &amp; hereafter: Whence it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that punishment being relative to sin, such as are punished becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of sin, must be sinners, &amp; judged to be sinners &amp; so guilty, before they
be punished for sin, <hi>Adam</hi> being the Head &amp; Root of Mankind, &amp; God
entering into Covenant with him, as such, &amp; therefore with all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
in him, when he broke the Covenant &amp; transgressed, all Mankind
descending from him by ordinary generation, being comprehended with
him in the Covenant, became actually partakers of that guilt, so soon as
they did partake of Nature actually; &amp; being really guilty when existing,
they were justly punished. But if this guilt were not imputed to them, they
could not be justly punished for it.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, he thinks they might be justly punished for that sin,
though not guilty thereof: &amp; he laboureth to establish this upon three pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
1. <hi>The demerite</hi> (saith he) <hi>&amp; sinfulness of that sin which had so many ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations,
and in this regard, was beyond the sin of devils, that Adam had the
estates of all his posterity in his hand, &amp; knew, that if he sinned, he should draw
all their souls after him into the same perdition. Ans.</hi> But if by <hi>Adam's</hi> having
the estates of all his posterity in his hand, this truth be not included, that
his sin should become their sin, &amp; they should be looked upon as guilty
thereof, &amp; chargable therewith; how could he know, that by his sin he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>should
draw the souls of all his posterity after him into the same condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!
And how could they be punished for that same guilt, if it was not
some way theirs, by the just &amp; righteous Judge &amp; Governour of the world?
The posterity can no more be justly punished for the great &amp; hainous sins
of their progenitors, than for their lesser sinnes, if they have no interest in
these sinnes, nor partake of the guilt thereof: But as to Original sin, the
Scripture giveth the Sin, as the ground of the punishment, &amp; maketh the
one to reach all, as well as the other, telling us <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 12. that <hi>by one Man,
sin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntered in to the world, &amp; death by sin; &amp; so death passed upon all Men, for
that all have sinned;</hi> or, <hi>in whom all have sinned.</hi> See <hi>vers</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The Narrownese or scantisness of</hi> Adam's <hi>Person, who could not beat that
fulness of punishment, which God might require for that great sin; &amp; we cannot
think, that God should sit down with loss. Ans.</hi> This is his second pillar. But
neither is it sufficient; for God could have punished <hi>Adam</hi> condingly for
his sin: but when the posterity is punished for that sin also, that sin must
be theirs. Though for great crimes, as Treason &amp; the like, the Posterity
suffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth, when the guilty is forfeited I yet the posterity are not properly
punished for that sin; nor can be said to be so; as we are punished for Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
sin, because it is ours, &amp; we sinned in <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. His 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. &amp; maine pillar is, <hi>the peculir &amp; near relation of the posterity of</hi>
Adam <hi>to his person; for then they were in it, &amp;, as it were, a part, or some what
of it; so that</hi> Adam was us all, &amp; we were all that one Adam, <hi>as</hi> Augustine
<hi>speaketh; &amp; the whole generation of mankind is but</hi> Adam, <hi>or</hi> Adam's <hi>person,
expounded at large. Ans.</hi> This is sufficient for us; for it will hold forth the
Covenant relation, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> stood, as representing all his posterity;
&amp; so they were as well in him, &amp; a part of him, in his sin, as in his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104357:92"/>
which is all we desire, for hence it appeareth, that all sinned in
that one <hi>Adam,</hi> as well, as they were all punished in him.</p>
               <p>Then he tels us, that <hi>all these three are jointly intimat R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 5: 12. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
first there is the</hi> demerito, <hi>Imported, when</hi> death is said to enter; &amp;
<hi>the</hi> scantiness of Adam's person, <hi>when it is said,</hi> to have passed upon all
men;
&amp; <hi>the</hi> relation of his posterity to him, <hi>in that all</hi> are said to have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in him. <hi>Ans.</hi> But the maine thing, which he denieth, is there also im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
when it is said, <hi>that all men sinned in him,</hi> or became guilty of his
sin: for thereby it is manifest, that only they had an interest in his person,
but that they had such an Interest in &amp; relation to his person, as so stated,
&amp; as standing in a Covenant-relation to God, that they sinned in him, or
became guilty of his sin, &amp; therefore suffered with him the demerite there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of.
Whence it is evident (howbeit he seemeth confident of the contrary
<hi>pag.</hi> 207.) That the Imputation of Adam's sin, or of his sinful Act as sinful,
or as it was a sin; &amp; not of the act as such (for that himself faith once &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
was directly &amp; efficiently from God himself, &amp; therefore was good)
is the ground, or cause of punishment, that cometh on his posterity.</p>
               <p>But he saith <hi>pag. 208. If any Imputation be in this case, it is of every mans
own sin, in</hi> Adam; <hi>for is was</hi> Adam <hi>alone that sinned, but all sinned in him:
It is not said, that</hi> Adam's sin is Imputed to his posterity; <hi>but rather that his</hi>
posterity themselves sinned in Adam. <hi>Ans.</hi> If he wil stand to this, we need
not contend with him, about the word, <hi>Impute;</hi> this expression of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
comprehending &amp; plainely holding forth all that we would say. And
if he will grant as much, in reference to the Imputation of Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teousness,
as is here said of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the type of him that was to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
he must, I judge, retract all that he hath said, against the same.</p>
               <p>What followeth in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> being but founded upon what is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
mentioned &amp; examined, needeth not here againe be repeated or expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
&amp; considered.</p>
               <p>Thus we have taken notice of all, which this voluminous Adversary hath
said, upon this matter, both against the Truth, &amp; for his own Errour:
&amp; no doubt, he hath scraped together all that he could finde, giving any,
seeming contribution unto the Notion, which he hugged; &amp; hath labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
after his usual manner, to set of with a more than ordinary measure of
confidence, &amp; with an affected pedantrie of language, supplying, with
bombast expressions, the want of reality of truth &amp; solidity of reasoning.
What remaineth in that book, concerning the Imputation of faith, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ shall be examined,
when we come to the <hi>second part</hi> of our Text, &amp; to speak of the matter of
justification. And as for other things, we may take notice of them elsewhere.</p>

               <p>THere being so frequent mention made, in Scripture, of <hi>Imputation
of Righteousness;</hi> or <hi>of Righteousness Imputed;</hi> &amp; <hi>of Christ's being our
Righteousness;</hi> or of <hi>our being Righteousness,</hi> or <hi>Righteous in Him,</hi> &amp; the
like, many, that even plead much against the Doctrine of the Imputation
of the Righteousness of Christ, maintained by the orthodox, must yet yeeld
to it, in some sense or other; at least in such a sense, as may, in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions,
not cross their other <hi>Hypotheses</hi> &amp; <hi>Dogmes:</hi> Yea &amp; sometimes
grant this Imputation in that sense, at least in words, which overthroweth
or weakeneth all their Disputations to the contrary. <hi>Schlightingius,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>Socinus</hi> against <hi>Meisnerus pag.</hi> 250. will grant, That <hi>Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
may be called &amp; accounted ours, in so far, as it redoundeth to our good
&amp; righteousness, &amp; is the cause of our justification.</hi> And <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> will also say
(<hi>de just. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 10.) That <hi>Christ is said to be our Righteousness, because
He satisfied the father for us; &amp; so giveth &amp; communicateth that Satisfaction to
us, when He justifieth us, that it may be said to be our Satisfaction &amp; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> though he seemeth not satisfied with what is commonly hold
by the Orthodox, anent the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ; yet
will not professe himself an Enemie to all Imputation; but on the contrary,
saith, he owneth it in a right sense: And it is true, men have their own
liberty, in expressing their sense &amp; meaning of Truths; &amp; where there
seemeth to be some considerable difference, as to words &amp; expressions; yet
there may be little, or none upon the matter. And it is not good, I confess,
to make real differences of these, that are but verbal; nor is it good to be
so tenacious of our own expressions, as to exaggerat the expressions of
others, whose meaning may be good, because not complying with our own,
in all points,</p>
               <p>Let us therefore enquire after <hi>Mr. Baxter's</hi> sense, &amp; see wherein he
really differeth from us, in this matter. In his late <hi>Treatise of justifying Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>
against <hi>D. Tully.</hi> The first part (as the Title page sheweth) is of
<hi>Imputed Righteousness, opening &amp; defending the true Sense, &amp; confuting the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.</hi>
Here then belike we shall finde his meaning, as to this question.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>preface</hi> to this book, he giveth us his sense, in these words, <hi>That
Righteousness is imputed to us, that is, we are accounted Righteous, because for the
merites of Christ's total fulfulling the conditions of his Mediatorial Covenant with
the Father, by His Habitual Holiness, His Actual perfect Obedience, &amp; His
Sacrifice, or Sati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>factory Suffering for our sins, in our stead, freely without any
merite, or conditional act of mans, God hath made an act of oblivion &amp; Deed of
Gift, pardoning all sin, justifying &amp; Adopting &amp; giving Right to the Spirit &amp;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104357:93"/>
Life eternally to every one, that beleevingh accepteth Christ, &amp; the gifts with, &amp;
by, &amp; from Him; &amp; when we accept them, they are all ours by vertue of this
purchased Covenant-gift.</hi> But this, I Judge, cannot give satisfaction, for
upon the grant of the Act of Oblivion, (as he calleth it) which, in his
judgment, is extended to all Mankind, no man in particular can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
or accounted Righteous, or have Righteousness imputed to him, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
than another; &amp; so upon this account, all are equally Righteous, &amp;
have equally Christ's Righteousness imputed to them, that is, no man hath
it. As for these Effects, pardon, justification, Adoption, &amp; Right to the
Spirit &amp; to Life, they cannot be called the Righteousness of Christ; no
more than the Effect can be called the cause: And though they become ours,
when we accept them, or rather when we accept of Christ; yet upon that
account meerly, it can not be said, that the Righteousness of Christ is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to us, &amp; no otherwayes: for that is nothing but the <hi>Socinian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
formerly mentioned, &amp; it cannot Satisfie the orthodox. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin
is about the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, &amp; the Answer given
is concerning the Effects thereof given to us; But these Effects are not the
Righteousness of Christ; nor are they to be called a Righteousness; nor are
they in Scripture so called, unless we say with <hi>Ioh. Goodwin,</hi> that <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
Imputed is nothing but free justification.</hi> Yea these Effects must presuppose
a Righteousness in the persons receiving them, either Inherently, or by
way of Impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation: for God will justifie no man, or declare no man to be
Righteous, who is not Righteous: And concerning this Righteousness is
our question: And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> giveth us nothing here for this, unless it be
our beleeving: &amp; this is that which <hi>Servetus, Socinians &amp; Arminians</hi> say.</p>
               <p>In opposition to this, which he calleth <hi>a short &amp; plaine explication of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
he setteth down what others say, as necessary to go in to our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity;
&amp; so tels us, that according to them, we must say, <hi>That Christ
was habitually &amp; actually perfectly Holy &amp; obedient, imputatively in our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
persons; &amp; thath each one of us did perfectly fulfill that Law, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
perfect habites &amp; act: in and by Christ imputatively; and yet did also in &amp; by
him suffer ourselves imputatively for not fulfilling it, &amp; imputatively did oursel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
both satisfie God's justice, and merite heaven; and that we have ourselves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively
a Righteousness of Perfect holiness &amp; obedience, as sinless; &amp; must be
justified by the Law of Innocency, or works, as having ourselves imputatively ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
it in Christ. And that this is our sole-righteousness: &amp; that faith it self is not
imputed to us for Righteousness, no not a meer particular subordinat Righteousness,
answering the conditional part of the new justifying Covenant, as necessary to our
participation of Christ, &amp; His freely given Righteousness.</hi> As touching the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of this discourse, about the Imputation of Faith, &amp; its being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
our particular subordinat Righteousness, it is true, Several of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
have appeared against it, &amp; we shall also speak our judgment of it
hereafter. But as to the former part (which is only pertinent to our purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
now in hand) I know not, if ever any Orthodox person uttered his min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
after this manner: Yea, I wote not, if <hi>Antinomians</hi> themselves have
at any time expressed themselves, in all points, as is here set down. But
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104357:94"/>
be it so, that they have thus expressed their meaning, &amp; that these expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
here set down, are not meer Consequences &amp; Inferences, drawn
by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself, from their opinions &amp; assertions: yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
cannot but know, that the Orthodox are against them, in these assertions,
as well as he: &amp; to me it appeareth no faire, to set down these words, as
containing that opinion, which all must hold, who cannot fully embrace
<hi>Mr. Baxter's</hi> owne judgment; as if there were no <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
or <hi>Arminian</hi> judgment, on the one hand, &amp; the <hi>Antinomian</hi> opinion on
the other hand; whileas he cannot but know the contrary. Nether is this a

                  </gap>t &amp; sure way to cleare up the true sense of the Imputation of Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
at least, that sense, which we owne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Book</hi> pag. 24. <hi>he againe setteth down his own judgment, or sense
of Imputation, which he taketh to be the true healing middle way; Part
whereof is as followeth.</hi> That as Christ suffered in our stead, that we might
not suffer, and obeyed in our Nature, that perfection of obedience might not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to our justification; and this in the person of a Mediator and Sponsor, for
us sinners; but not so in our persons, as that we truely, in a moral or civil sence,
did all this in and by him: Even so God reputeth the thing to be, as it is, and
so far Imputeth Christ's Righteousness and Merites and Satisfaction to us, as that
it is reputed by Him the true Meritorious Cause of our justification; &amp; that for it
God maketh a Covenant of Grace, in which he freely giveth Christ, pardon and
life to all that accept the gift, as it is; so that the Accepters are by this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and Gift, as surely justified and Saved by Christ's Righteousness, as if
they had obeyed and satisfied themselves. Not that Christ meriteth, that we
shall have grace to fulfill the Law ourselves, and stand before God in a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our own, which will answere the Law of works, and justify us; but that
the Conditions of the Gíft, in the Covenant of Grace, being performed by every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
Beleever, that Covenant doth pardon all their sins (as God's Instrument)
and giveth them a Right to life eternal for Christ's merites. <hi>As to this though
it may seem faire &amp; a far advancement: yet I shall crave leave to say these
few things against it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. When he saith, That <hi>Christ suffered in our stead,</hi> I would know, in
whose stead it was? Whether it was in the stead of some select persons, or in
stead of all? If in the stead of some select persons only, then these select
persons, must have another Interest, in the death of Christ, than all others;
&amp; it being done in their stead, must needs be accepted in their behalfe, as
it was undergone for them, &amp; in their stead &amp; place: &amp; if it be accepted in
their behalfe, they must necessarily be freed from Suffering, after God's
Methode; &amp; that upon the account of Christ's Suffering in their stead; and
if so, must not that Suffering of Christ, in a Law-sense, be accounted theirs,
and imputed unto them, &amp; they as really &amp; effectually freed from what they
were under, and obnoxious to, &amp; made partakers of was purchased there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
as if they had suffered all that, in their own persons? If it be in stead
of all, then all must, upon the account of it, be delivered from Suffering,
which cannot be said; or not one shall be delivered from Suffering, meerly
upon the account of it, but upon the account of some other thing Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veening,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:104357:94"/>
which he calleth, in the following words, the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> &amp;
the performance of the Conditions thereof: And if so, all Christ's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<hi>in our stead,</hi> will be but a Suffering <hi>for our good,</hi> as say the <hi>Socinians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. When he saith, <hi>That we might not suffer,</hi> is that meaned <hi>eventually viz.</hi>
That none of us should ever be put to suffer the penalty? or is it only meaned
<hi>potentially,</hi> that is, that it might be possible, that we should not suffer?
If the <hi>former</hi> be said, then either all of us shall be saved, or the <hi>us</hi> must be
restricked to the Elect. If the <hi>Latter</hi> be said, then this <hi>dying in our stead,</hi> is
really but a dying <hi>for our good,</hi> which the <hi>Socinians</hi> grant.</p>
               <p>3. When he saith, <hi>&amp; obeyed in our Nature,</hi> this, <hi>in our Nature,</hi> must either
be the some with <hi>in our stead,</hi> which he mentioned before; or some thing
different, if <hi>the same,</hi> then it seemes, when he said, <hi>Christ suffered in our
stead,</hi> his meaning only was, that <hi>Christ suffered in our Nature.</hi> And will
not all <hi>Socinians</hi> grant, that Christ Suffered thus in our stead, that is, in our
Nature? If <hi>different,</hi> I would know, why he putteth such a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Christ's Suffering and His obeying, seing both belonged to that Law
(as he speaketh in the foregoing words) which was His Covenant Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and both were Satisfactory and Meritorious, though the one more
primarily Satisfactory, &amp; the other more primarily meritorious?</p>
               <p>4. When he saith, That Christ obeyed in our Nature, <hi>that perfection of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
might not be necessary to our justification,</hi> I would ask, if this end did,
or could flow from, or follow upon Christ's Obedience, meerly because it
was performed in our Nature? Had we no other Interest, or ground of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in it, or in Him, but that it was performed in our Nature? or did all
the Benefite &amp; Advantage, that we received, or are to receive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
flow from it meerly upon this account, that it was performed in our
Nature?</p>
               <p>5. As to this end of Christ's obeying <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>perfection of obedience might
not be necessary to our justification,</hi> I suppose his meaning is, that this perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of obedience might not be required of us, in order to justification: but
yet he doth not say (as he should) that this was our debt; and that Christ
paid this perfect obedience as our debt, in order to life: for if he shall say
this, then it will follow, that this payment must, in Law-sense, be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to those, for whom it was paid. How ever these words do plainely
insinuat, that howbeit Christ obeyed in our Nature: that perfection of
obedience might not be necessary to our justification; yet notwithstanding
an Imperfect Obedience might be accounted necessary to our justification;
and thus the New Covenant be supposed to be of the same kind and Spece
with the old; and Christ be supposed to have obeyed, only that the termes
of the Old Covenant might be abated, as to the rigour of perfection of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
required.</p>
               <p>6. That Christ Obeyed and Suffered in the person of a Mediator &amp; Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
(as he saith) that is, that person God-Man, who was Mediator and
Sponsor, did obey &amp; suffer, is very true; but notwithstanding hereof, yea
so much the rather, he obeyed and suffered, as a Publick Person, that is,
for others, and not for Himself personally considered. And therefore tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:104357:95"/>
for whom He thus Obeyed and Suffered, must, in a just and consequent
sense, be accounted as Obeying &amp; Suffering in Him, that is, there was
such a Relation betwixt this Mediator, or Surety, and those, for whom He
was a Mediator and Surety (in the purpose &amp; designe of God appointing
Christ hereunto, &amp; in the purpose &amp; designe of Christ undertaking, and
actually performing what He undertook) as gave them fundamentally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Interest in His Obedience &amp; Suffering, then others had, or could ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,
to &amp; for whom He was no Mediator &amp; Sponsor.</p>
               <p>7. Whence Christ may be said to have Obeyed and Suffered legally, in
the person of, and as representing others; that is, in the construction of
the Law &amp; Law-giver, not for Himself, but for others, in whose Law-place
He did substitute Himself, undertaking their debt, in order to their
Redemption. And though Beleevers, who now come to have an actual
Interest in Christ, cannot be said to have done all this in and by Him, that
is, as by their delegat and Servant (as <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> else where expresseth it)
yet they may be said to have done it in and by Him, Civilly, juridically or
legally, as the debtor is by Law said to have Satisfied the Creditor, in and
by the Surety, who yet physically paid the debt by himself only, but le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
in the person of the debtor, the debtor and Surety being in Law-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
but as one person, in so far as, they concurre in, and are both
obliged by, one and the same Obligation; just as the heir succeding <hi>in jus
defuncti,</hi> is <hi>eatenus</hi> repute &amp; said to be <hi>una &amp; eadem persona</hi> with him; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
it is evident, that one payment made by either must be accounted as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
by both, and doth in effect dissolve the whole obligation; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the debtor is as effectually &amp; justly absolved from all charge or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Law, upon the account of that debt, as if he had paid the money
out of his own purse. But whether the terme of <hi>Morally,</hi> or <hi>Civilly,</hi> or
<hi>Legally,</hi> or the like, be most apposite, is of no great weight to occasione
a debate, especially seing the thing it self is so well known to all, who know
what it is to have a friend paying their debt, or Satisfying the Creditor for
them, and in their behalfe; and thereupon bringing them out of prison.
Though I know, the case of pecuniary debts doth not in all things quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
with our case; yet it is sufficient to explicat what we are now upon.</p>
               <p>8. We grant, <hi>That God reputeth the thing to be, as it is;</hi> and therefore it
is very true, that God reputeth Christ to have obeyed and suffered, as being
in the Law-place of others, and as making Satisfaction for them; and
them, for whom He satisfied, to be in another manner in Him, than any
others whatever.</p>
               <p>9. He addeth, <hi>&amp; so far imputeth Christ's Righteousness, as that it is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Him, the true Meritorious cause of our justification.</hi> But it was reputed
and estimate so to be, before this Imputation; for it was accepted as such:
therefore Imputation must denote something more, than this Reputation,
even a reckoning of it (as it were) now upon their Scoce, and accounting
it theirs, or them to have a full, special and actual Interest therein, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their justification and absolution from the charge of guilt and death
brought in against them, whereby they are accounted and reckoned to be
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:104357:95"/>
Righteous, because of that Imputation, &amp; therefor pronounced such in
justification: so that now it is the <hi>objectum formal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> or the <hi>ratio formales ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectiva</hi>
of our justification.</p>
               <p>10. When he addeth <hi>&amp; that for it God maketh a Covenant of Grace,</hi> if those
words mean, that in this also Christ's Righteousness is said to be imputed,
then, it seemeth, it is equally imputed unto all <hi>Adam's</hi> poste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity: for with
him, all are comprehended within this Covenant. But this were as much
as to say, it is imputed to none in particular. Moreover, it may be thought
that this is explicative of what went immediatly before: &amp; so Christ's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
shall be repute the true Meritorius Cause of our justification, in
that it was the Meritorious cause of the Covenant of Grace: now hereby the
immediat ground of justification will be the Gospel-righteousness, he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of, that is our performance of the conditions of the New Covenant of
Grace; &amp; Christ's Merites, Satisfaction &amp; Righteousness shall be only a
remote ground. But we shall show hereafter, how groundless it to say.
That Christ procured the New Covenant by His Merites &amp; Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>11. He saith, <hi>in which</hi> (i.e. Covenant of Grace) <hi>He freely giveth Christ,
pardon &amp; Life, to all that accept the gift, as it is.</hi> That all these are hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
in the Covenant, &amp; that such as receive Christ, receive pardon and
Life, is true. But what is that, <hi>to accept the gift, as it is?</hi> &amp; what is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by this gift?</p>
               <p>12. He addeth, <hi>so that the accepters are by this Covenant &amp; Gift as surely justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and saved by Christ's Righteousness, as if they had obeyed &amp; Satisfied themselves.</hi>
But this is not by vertue of any immediat of that Righteousness unto them,
whereby they are looked upon as Righteous in the sight of God; but by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of faith, whereby the gift is accepted, that is offered in the Covenant,
which faith is indeed immediatly imputed to them according to him, &amp;
reputed their Gospel-righteousness, &amp; they thereupon are reputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
&amp; so justified, as such: for the Righteousness of Christ is only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
in that it is reputed the meritorious cause of the New Covenant.</p>
               <p>13. Though Christ hath not merited, that we shall have grace to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
the Law ourselves &amp;c. Yet he will say, that Christ hath merited, that
faith shall be the Condition of the New Covenant, &amp; consequently, that
we may stand before God, even as the great Law giver, &amp; so before His
Law also, in that Gospel-righteousness (as he calleth it) of our own, which
will justifie us.</p>
               <p>14. In end, when he saith, <hi>the Covenant of grace doth pardon &amp; give right
to Life for Christ's Merites,</hi> I suppose (because of what is already observed) it
is only upon the account that Christ's Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ites have purchased this Covenant;
&amp; not because they become our Immediat Righteousness, whereupon we
are justified &amp; have pardon: &amp; he should rather say, conforme to what went
before, that this Covenant doth Pardon &amp; give Right to Life, for faith, our
Gospel-righteousness, the condition thereof.</p>
               <p>These are my Exceptions against this supposed healing middle way; &amp;
the grounds why I cannot acquiesce therein, as the right way. He tels us
againe <hi>pag. 45. Note 3. That it is ordinarily agreed by Protestants, that Christ's
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:104357:96"/>
Righteousness is imputed to us, in the same sence, as our sins are said to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Him.</hi> And to this I also heartily acquiesce; &amp; hence inferie. That
as Christ was made sin by that Imputation, so we are made righteous by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of this Imputation: as our sins were laid on Him (as the sins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were laid on the scape goat, the type) so His Righteousness is put on us,
as He came in our Law-place, so we come in His: As our sins imputed
to Him were the immediat procuring cause of His stripes &amp; punishment or
suffering; so His Righteousness imputed to us is the Immediat procuring
cause of our justification &amp;c. As Christ was repute legally or juridically,
though not inherently, a sinner, because of this Imputation of our sins to
Him, &amp; therefore dealt with, punished &amp; chastened, as if He had been
a real sinner, because He stood in our Law-place; to His Righteousness being
imputed to us, we are repute legally &amp; juridically, though not inherently;
Righteous, &amp; thereupon are dealt with, justified &amp; accepted &amp;c. as if we
had been really Righreous, because now standing in His Law-place. So that
if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will stand to this, that ordinarily protestants agree unto, I
am fully Satisfied: &amp; had he done so from the beginning, many of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
would have been forborne: And whether he, or others who owne
what protestants agree unto, be to be reckoned among the self conceited
wranglers, as he speaketh in the following <hi>page,</hi> indifferent men may judge:
&amp; I conceive, if he would yet stand to this, he should alter that, which
he gave us, in the fore-mentioned words, as the only healing middle way;
For that middle way (as he calleth it) giveth us a far other sheme, than
can be drawn out of this, wherein protestants are commonly agreed as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.</p>
               <p>He tels us <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. (where he cometh to state the question) <hi>pag.</hi> 51. that
we must distinguish of Imputation, &amp; giveth us six senses thereof; five whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof
are such, as I know not, if even <hi>Antinomians</hi> did owne them. They
are these. 1. <hi>To repute us personally to have been the Agents of Christ't Acts, the
Subjects of His Habites &amp; passion, in a physical sense.</hi> I know not, who in their
wits would affirme this: &amp; to me, it is not a fit way to end, or clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
to raise so much dust needlesly, &amp; imagine senses out of our
owne heads, as if they were owned &amp; maintained by some, what is the 2?
<hi>Or to repute the same formal relation of Righteousness, which was in Christ's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to be in ours, as the Subject.</hi> But this is only a consequent of the foregoing
3. (saith he) <hi>or to repute us to have been the very Subjects of Christ's Habites &amp;
passion, &amp; the Agents of His Acts, in a Political, or Moral sence (&amp; not a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical)
as a man payeth a, debt by a Servant, or attornay, ordelegate.</hi> If this be
the only meaning of his <hi>Political &amp; Moral sense,</hi> I suppose no man will owne
it either: for no man will say, That Christ was our Servant, Attornay, or
Delegate. The 4. is but a consequent of this; <hi>and consequently,</hi> (saith he)
<hi>to repute a double formal Righteousness to result from the said habites, acts &amp; passions,
one to Christ, as the Natural Subject &amp; Agent; &amp; another to us, as the Moral,
Political or reputed Subject &amp; agent (&amp; so His formal Righteousnese not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to us in it self, as ours, but another to result from the same matter.</hi> This is
too Philosophical for me to owne, or follow. The 5, is, <hi>or else that we are
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104357:96"/>
reputed both the agents &amp; Subjects of the matter of His Righteousness, morally, &amp;
also of the formal Righteousness of Christ himself.</hi> All these are but the <hi>effuvia</hi> of
a braine floteing &amp; swimeing in ill digested Philosophical Notions &amp; School
dregs, &amp; contribute nothing to the clearing of Gospel-Truth, which hath
little or rather no affinity with aery Philosophical Notions, but tende ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
to the darkening of the same. But now, when all these Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Notions &amp; Relations are at an end, &amp; we can proceed no further, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is that Imputation, which is legal, &amp; plaine to every ordinary Man <hi>viz</hi>
whereby the Satisfaction made to a judge &amp; Governour for a crime commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by the delinquen'ts friend; or that payment &amp; Satisfaction made to
the creditor, for the debtor, by a friend Interposing, is in Law-sense ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the delinquent's &amp; debtor's; &amp; he as really &amp; effectually delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
out of prison therefore, as if he had made Satisfaction in his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
person, or had paid the summe out if his own Substance? If any Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,
after Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> manner here, should, with such Philosophical
Whimseyes, (I call them so, for they are no other in this case) laboure to
disprove any such Imputation, &amp; say, it must be in one of those five senses
&amp;c. would not any countrey man smille at this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>But now let us see Mr. <hi>Baxter's sixt</hi> sense, wherein he granteth the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Christ's Righteousness. <hi>Or else</hi> (saith he) <hi>by</hi> Imputation <hi>is meant
here, that Christ being truely reputed to have taken on the Nature of sinful Man,
&amp; become an Head for all true Beleevers, in that undertaken Nature &amp; office, in
the person of a Mediator, to have fulfilled all the Law imposed upon him, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
Holiness &amp; obedience, &amp; offering <hi>himself on the cross</hi> a sacrifice for our
sins, <hi>voluntarily suffering in</hi> our stead, <hi>as if He had been a sinner (guilty of all
our sins) as soon as we beleeve, we are pardoned, Iustified, Adopted, for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
&amp; Merites of this</hi> Holiness, obedience &amp; Penal Satisfaction <hi>of Christ with
as full demonstration of divine Iustice, at least, &amp; more full Demonstration of
His wisdom &amp; Mercy, than if we had suffered our selves what our sinnes deserved
(that is, been damned) or had never sinned. And so Righteousness is imputed to
us, that is, we are accounted or reputed Righteous (not in relation to the Precept,
that is, innocent or sinless, but in relation to the Retribution, that is, such as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
right to impunity &amp; Life) because Christ's foresaid perfect</hi> Holiness, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
&amp; Satisfaction, <hi>meritedour pardon &amp; Adoption and the Spirit; or merited
the New Covenant, by which, as an Instrument, Pardon, justification &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
are given to Beleevers, and the Spirit to be given to Sanctifie them; and
when we beleeve, we are justly reputed such, as have right to all these purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
gifts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to this I shall only note a few things (1.) Christ's fulfilling of the Law
imposed on Him, doth not hinder, but that He paid our debt, &amp; so came
in our Law-place, &amp; substitute Himself in our room, to do what we should
have done &amp; to suffer what we should have suffered according to the Law, in
all the essentials &amp; Substantials of that punishment: for had He not done
this, He could not be said to have suffered in our stead: for he only suffereth
in the room &amp; stead of another, who suffereth what that other should have
suffered. If one be condemned to suffer death, another that suffereth only
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104357:97"/>
Imprisonment for his delivery, cannot be said to suffer in this stead, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for his cause &amp; good, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> say, Christ suffered for us. (2.)
Christ not only suffered in our stead, as if he had been a sinner &amp; guilty, but
as sinner legally &amp; juridically guilty, having sins imputed to Him, though
He was most free of all sin inherently, and knew it not: &amp; the reason is
manifest; for otherwayes Divine justice should not have shined forth in His
sufferings, it being no Demonstration of justice to punish one, who neither
inherently, nor Imputatively &amp; legally, is or can be accounted &amp; reputed
a sinner. (3.) Wee cannot, with right, be reputed Righteous, except we
be either inherently righteous, or righteous by Imputation; &amp; so legally,
juridically, &amp; in Law-sense righteous, by vertue of the Imputation of the
Surety-righteousness of Christ, our Sponsor. (4.) Righteousness must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
respect the Commands &amp; Prohibitions of the Law, &amp; but seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
the Retribution, if not most Improperly; as unrighteousness is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the Law, as commanding or forbidding, &amp; very improperly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to any in reference to the punishment threatned. And therefore,
if we be accounted Righteousness, it must be in relation to the precept, at
least, in the first place: Nor can we be accounted Righteous, in reference
to the Retribution, that is, have a Right to Impunity &amp; life, in the sight
of God, who judgeth &amp; reputeth according to equity &amp; right, unless we be
first accounted Righteous, in reference to the precept; for this is the only
just &amp; legal foundation of the other. (5.) Upon this it doth not follow
that we are Innocent or sinless inherently, far less, that we never trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed;
but on the contrary, it clearly saith, that we were sinners; but
now are legally, or juridically innocent &amp; sinless by the Imputation of the
side jussorie Righteousness of Christ; &amp; therefore are not obnoxious to the
penalty, or to punishment; but have right to Impunity &amp; life. (6.) When
he speaketh of what Christ merited, he expresseth himself dubiously, not
being positively clear, whether Christ merited our pardon &amp;c. or the New
Covenant: &amp; the disjunctive particle <hi>Or,</hi> saith He did not merite both, in
his judgment: but before, we heard him plainly affirming, that Christ me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
the New Covenant, &amp; consequently He did not purchase pardon, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
&amp; the Spirit to any immediatly, but only mediatly, in purchasing
the Covenant, which promiseth these to such, as performe the Conditions
thereof. (7.) By this way, Beleevers are repute such, as have right to all
these purchased gifts, not immediatly by vertue of Christ's Merites &amp; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
imputed to them &amp; bestowed upon them, but by vertue of their
being inherently Righteous with that Gospel-righteousness, faith, which
is the potestative Condition of the Covenant, &amp; is now imputed to them,
&amp; accounted their Righteousness, according to his judgment.</p>
               <p>Speaking afterward <hi>pag.</hi> 55. of Christ, as an Head &amp; Root, he tels us,
that He was no Natural Root or Head; which is undeniable; Yet He was
a Super-Natural &amp; Political Head. But he saith, <hi>He was not</hi> actually <hi>such an
Head to the Redeemed, when He obeyed and suffered; but as an Head by</hi> Aptitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
office, power &amp; Vertue. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true, as to such, as were not then
Beleevers, He was not a Supernatural Head <hi>actually,</hi> that is, by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104357:97"/>
actually Physical and supernatural influences of Spiritual life: Yet He
was, as to all given to Him, actually <hi>a Political Head,</hi> or an Head in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
sense, that is, by God's Appointment, and His own voluntary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
He obeyed &amp; Suffered for them, &amp; in their stead; paying their
debt answering for all that the justice &amp; the Law did require of them, and
so purchasing all Grace &amp; Glory for them, to be certainely bestowed in
due time. In this respect, that must be denied, which he addeth (<hi>n.</hi> 12.)
<hi>Therefore they were not Christ's members Political, when He obeyed &amp; dyed:</hi> for
they may as well be said, to have been then His members Political, as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
not yet within the sold, but that were to be brought in, &amp; were to
hear His voice, were by Himself called <hi>His sheep Ioh.</hi> 10: 16. Whence, I
pray, come the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fluences, whereby they are made to beleeve, if not from
Him, as their Political-head, or Surety-head, standing ingaged for them?
But possibly the ambiguous use of the word <hi>Political</hi> may occasione his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Natural Head</hi> (saith he n. 14.) <hi>being but a part of a person, what it doth,
the Person doth. But seing a contracted Head and all the members of his Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
or Politick, are every one a distinct person, it followeth not, that each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
did really, or reputatively what the head did. Nay, it is a good consequence,
that if he did it, as an head, they did it not (numerically) as head or members.
Ans.</hi> Passing the Impropriety of the expression <hi>contracted head,</hi> whereby, it
is like, he meanes a <hi>Conventional Head.</hi> I say, Though a Conventional
Head and all the members of that Body, be every one a distinct person <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically;</hi>
Yet considered as such, they are all but one person <hi>Politically</hi> &amp; in
<hi>Law-sense:</hi> &amp; so in Law-sense &amp; Politically (as all lawyers know, &amp; even
Men of Common sense can acknowbedge) every distinct Physical person is
supposed to have done what their Political Head &amp; Representative hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
as such. And though it be a good consequence, that <hi>if the Head did it,
as an Head, they in their in their Physical persons did it not:</hi> Yet it were a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Consequence, to say, <hi>They therefore, as Political Members of that
Political conventional body, did it not</hi> viz <hi>Politically</hi> (not Physically, or nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ</hi> (saith he n. 15.) <hi>suffered &amp; obeyed in the Person of the Mediator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God &amp; Man, &amp; as a subject to the Law of Mediation. Ans.</hi> Though He
suffered in the Physical Person of the Mediator; Yet because Suffering &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
as a Mediator &amp; Surety. He Suffered &amp; obeyed, as a Political Head,
&amp; in a Political person. (2.) Though He was Subject to the Law of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Yet by vertue of that same Law of Mediation, He was subject to the
Law, under which we were, both as to its Duty &amp; Penalty: for Suffering
&amp; obeying, as a Mediator &amp; Surety, He, in Suffering &amp; obeying, did pay
out debt, for He came into our Law-place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ may be said</hi> (saith he n. 16.) <hi>to suffer, in the person of a sinner, as it meaneth
His own person, reputed &amp; used as a sinner, by His persecutors; &amp; as He was one, who
stood before God, as Undertaker, to suffer for mans sins. Ans.</hi> Seing He was one, who
stood before God, as an Undertaker for sinners; &amp; not only to suffer for mans
sin, did he not suffer as a sinner (not inherently, but) legally &amp; juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically?
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104357:98"/>
and did He not represent and stand in the room of sinners, as their
Political Head &amp; Representative? These things can not be handsomly, with
any shew of reason, contradicted, or denied. Nay, himself addeth (n. 17.
<hi>pag.</hi> 56.) <hi>that Christ suffered in the place &amp; stead of sinners, that they might be
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>livered, though in the Person a Sponsor.</hi> Whence we see, that though He
suffered in the person of a Sponsor. Physically taken; Yet He suffered in
the person of others, Politically &amp; legally, because He suffered as a Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
in their stead, that they might certainely &amp; eventually be delivered,
&amp; not possibly only.</p>
               <p>But then (n. 18.) he cometh to an Accomodation, saying, <hi>When we are
agreed that the person of the Sponsor &amp; of every particular sinner are diverse</hi> (if the
word <hi>Person</hi> be here understood in a Physical, or Numerical sense, &amp; the
word <hi>sinners</hi> be understood of the Elect only, I agree) <hi>and that Christ had
not suffered, if we had not sinned:</hi> (true) <hi>&amp; that he as a Sponser, suffered in our
stead, &amp; so bore the punishment; which not He, but we deserved</hi> (adde also,
<hi>&amp; obeyed,</hi> &amp; I agree: <hi>If any will here, in stead of a Mediator, or Sponsor, call
Him our Representative, &amp; say, that He suffered even in all our persons reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely,
not</hi> simpliciter, <hi>but</hi> secundum quid, &amp; in tantum <hi>only, that is, not
representing our persons simply &amp; in all respects, &amp; to all ends, but only so far as
to be a Sacrifice for our sins, and suffer in our place and stead, what He suffered,
we take this to be but</hi> lis de nomine. And why is not His <hi>obeying</hi> also added?
But againe, if He suffered, as a Mediator &amp; Sponsor, in our place &amp; stead,
He must needs have been our Political-Representative, according as we use
to speak and understand these termes; &amp; so must have suffered in all our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
reputatively, so far as was necessary to our Redemption &amp; Salvation,
&amp; for more we enquire not. And seing this is what the orthodox assert, Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> is much to be blamed, for troubling the church so long by his opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hereunto, &amp; his own new Notions.</p>
               <p>He proceedeth (n. 19.) <hi>Christ did not suffer, strictly, simply, absolutly,
in the person of any one Elect sinner, much less in the millions of Persons of them all
in Law-sense, or in God's esteem; God did not esteem Christ to be, Naturally, or
as an absolute Representer,</hi> david, Manasseh, Paul, <hi>&amp; every such other sinner,
but only a Mediator, that suffered in their stead. Ans.</hi> Till we understand what
is meant by these termes, <hi>Strickly, Simply &amp; Absolutly,</hi> we cannot know
well what to say to this. We grant, He suffered in the person of no Elect sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
so as to become <hi>David, Manasseh</hi> &amp;c. Yet, when He suffered in their
stead, as Mediator &amp; Surety, both in Law-sense, &amp; in God's esteem, He
did represent them; &amp; did &amp; suffered what He did &amp; suffered, as a Surety
for them, &amp; as representing their Persons, in a Law-sense &amp; Politically,
simply &amp; absolutely, to all ends necessary for their Redemption &amp; Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>He addeth (n. 20.) <hi>God did make Christ to be sin for us, that is, a Sacrifice
for our sins, &amp; one that by man was reputed, &amp; by God &amp; Man was used, as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are &amp; deserve to be. Ans.</hi> Christ could not be made a Sacrific for sin, till
He had the guilt of sin laid upon Him by Imputation, as the Sacrifices of old
had typically. His being reputed such, &amp; handled as such by man, is of no
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:104357:98"/>
consideration here: And by God He could not be used, as a sinner, or as
sinners are &amp; deserve to be, unless our sins had been first caused to meet upon
Him, &amp; imputed to Him, to the end, He might properly be said to Suffer
&amp; become a Sacrifice for sin. We say with him (n. 23.) <hi>that God did not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
or repute Christ to have committed all, or any of the sins, which we all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
Nor to have had all the wickedness in His Nature which was in ours;
nor to have deserved what we did deserve; nor did in this proper sense impute our sins
to Christ.</hi> For indeed this had not been in a prope sense, to impute our sins
to Him, but plainly to confound His Physical person with ours; &amp; to
speak thus, I should account to be horrid blasphemy: Yet it may be &amp; must
be said, that Christ, being made sin for us, &amp; made to suffer for sin, in the
room of sinners, had their sins laid upon Him; &amp; so, was a sinner, not
Inherently but legally by Imputation; that is, had the guilt of our sins, in
order to punishment, imputed to Him, &amp; He put to suffer for that guilt,
or because a sinner by Imputation. And when the Scripture saith, that
<hi>God made Christ sin for us 2 Cor.</hi> 5: 21. &amp; <hi>Laid on Him the iniquity of us all,
Esai.</hi> 55: 6. It is as emphatick (&amp; to me more) as to say, God did impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
our sin to Christ, which he some-way excepteth against (n. 23. <hi>pag.</hi> 57.)</p>
               <p>He addeth (n. 26. <hi>pag.</hi> 58.) <hi>Though Christ suffered in our stead, and in a
large sence, to certaine uses, and in some respects, as the Representer, or in the
persons of Sinners: yet did He not so far represent their persons, in His habitual
Holiness and actual obedience, (no not in the obedience of His Suffering) as He
did in the Suffering it self. He obeyed not in the</hi> person of a sinner, <hi>much less of
millions of sinners, which were to say, in the person of sinners, he never sinned.
He suffered to save us from suffering; but He</hi> obeyed not <hi>to save us from obeying,
but to bring us to obedience: yet His perfection of obedience had this end, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
obedience might not be necessary in us to our justification and Salvation. Ans.</hi>
Seing Christ was appointed Mediator &amp; Sponsor to take on mans debt and
come in his Law-place, what reason can be given, why He should not, as
well be said to represent them, in the paying of the one part of that debt,
as in the paying of the other? We were under the Law and obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
perfect obedience, in order to the obtaining of the reward promised;
and because of sin we were under the Curse. Now when the Surety come
to pay our whole debt, He did as much, and as well represent us, in
paying of and in performing obedience, as in Suffering. And why may
we not say, that He obeyed in the juridical and Law person of a sinner, as
well as that He suffered? Though I should not use such improper and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
expressions, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here doth; yet I must tell him, That Christ's
obeying in the person of a sinner, saith no more than that, He being the
person representing sinners, His obeying was and is repute, in Law-sense,
their obeying. He Suffered, it is true, to save us from suffering of the
Curse of the Law; But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not say, that He suffered to save us
from all Suffering: He obeyed, it is true, to bring us to obedience, as
He died also for that end, that we might haue the Sanctifying Spirit bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon us: yet notwithstanding He obeyed to save us from obeying <hi>viz.</hi>
after that manner, that we were obliged to obey under the old Covenant,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104357:99"/>
that is to obey perfectly, or never enjoy the crown, and to obey for that
end, that we might enjoy the crown, as the legal reward of and due debt
for our labour. And seing Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> granteth in the following words,
that Christ's perfect obedience had this end, that perfect obedience might
not be necessary in us to our justification; why may he not say, that to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
uses, and in some respects, Christ obeyed, to save us from obeying?
Or why will he not say, that He obeyed for us, that we, who could not
obey of our selves, might be repute to have obeyed perfectly in Him? This
is all we desire.</p>
               <p>He saith next (n. 27.) <hi>It was not we our selves, who did perfectly obey, or
were perfectly holy, or suffered for sin, in the person of Christ, or by Him: nor
did me (naturally, or morally) merite our own Salvation by obeying in Christ:
nor did we satisfie God's justice for our sins, nor purchase pardon or Salvation to
ourselves, by our suffering in and by Christ. Ans.</hi> However, Christ doing all
this for us, as our Sponsor and Surety, we are so taken-in in a Law-sense,
that the same is imputed unto us, and we enjoy the fruits thereof, pardon
and Salvation; no less than if we had done and suffered all in our own physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
persons.</p>
               <p>As to what he saith (n. 29, 30.) it is nothing to the purpose (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall not set down his words) for we are not here speaking of Relations
and Accidents, physically, or metaphysicall rather considered, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pass from one Subject to another: nor do we speak of Christ, while
speaking of the Imputation of His Righteousness, <hi>physically</hi> considered, but
<hi>politically</hi> &amp; <hi>legally,</hi> as a Sponsor and Surety some way representing us. I
assent to him, that the meaning of this <hi>Imputation</hi> is not, <hi>That we ourselves,
in person, truely had the habites, which Christ had, and did all that Christ did,
and suffered all that he suffered, as by an Instrument, or legal Representer of our
persons, in all this,</hi> meaning that we in our physical persons should have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
all this, by Him, as our physical Instrument. But why He addeth he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
<hi>or legal Representer,</hi> unless he meane thereby that which elsewhere he
hath expressed to be, as <hi>our delegat,</hi> or <hi>Servant,</hi> I know not. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it seemeth not to me appositely here annexed, if ingenuous and plaine
dealing be designed. But there is another sense, in which he will yeeld to
<hi>Imputation,</hi> &amp; he thinks there cannot be a <hi>third.</hi> Let us hear what this other
sense is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Christ's Satisfaction</hi> (saith he) <hi>Righteousness and the Habites, Acts &amp;
Sufferings, in which it lay, are imputed to us, &amp; made ours, not rigidly in the
very thing it self, but in the effects and benefites. Ans.</hi> But if he shall yeeld to
no other Imputation, than this, he shall grant no Imputation: for that
Imputation, as to effects, is no Imputation at all: unless the meritorious
cause be imputed, in order to the receiving of these Effects, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
imputed; for they Effects are never said to be imputed. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a <hi>Third</hi> sense, wherein neither Christ's Righteousness, that is, His
Habites, Acts &amp; Sufferings are said to be physically translated, and put in
us, or upon us; nor are they said to be Imputed to us meerly in their Effects;
as <hi>Socinians</hi> say; but wherein Christ's Surety-righteousness, consisting in His
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:104357:99"/>
Obedience &amp; Suffering, is in a Law-sense, made over to beleevers, &amp;
put upon their score, &amp; now accounted theirs; &amp; they, because thereof,
accounted Righteous, legally and juridically; and have therefore the Effects
bestowed on them. This being so obvious, I wonder that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> cannot
see it. When a debtor is lying in prison, for debt, and a friend cometh &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth
the creditor for him by paying the summe, in his place &amp; stead; the
Law doth not impute that payment to the debtor meerly in the effects; but
imputeth the payment it self, not in its Physical acceptation, as if it judged
that he was the man, that in his own Physical person, told the money with
his own hands, &amp; brought it out of his own purse, as the other did, but)
in its legal force, vertue, &amp; efficary, unto him, &amp; accounted him, in this
Legal sense, to be no more a debter unto the creditor; &amp; therefore one
that hath right to his liberty, &amp; must therefore be set free from prison. So,
in our case, the Righteousness of Christ, in a legal sense, as to its efficary
&amp; vertue, is made over to the Beleever, &amp; he thereupon is accounted Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and no more a debtor, and therefore free of the Penalty. <hi>Further,</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he say, that <hi>Christ's Righteousness is imputed to us in the Effects;</hi> Yet he
knoweth, that that is (in his judgment) but very remotely; and that real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
these effects are more proximely the effects of Faith, which he calleth
our Gospel-righteousness; and that the Immediat effect and product of
Christ's Righteousness is the New Covenant; and this New Covenant being
made with all Mankind (as he thinketh) Christ's Righteousnes is, in this
immediat Effect, imputed to all flesh, Reprobat, as well as Elect. And
this is, in part, cleared from the words Immediatly following, when he
saith, <hi>In as much, as we are as really pardoned, justified, Adopted by them, as
the Meritorious Cause by the Instrumentality of the Covenants Donation, as if we
ourselves had done &amp; suffered all that Christ did.</hi> For this Instrumentality of the
Covenant includeth the performance of the Condition thereof, i. e. faith;
&amp; this Faith is properly imputed for Righteousness, as he saith: And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore,
as the Covenant is the Effect of the merites of Christ; so pardon
and Salvation must be the Effects of Faith; and the Effects of Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
only, in that he did procure the Covenant, which conveyeth these
to us, upon Condition of our performing of this faith, which is therefore
called, by him, our Gospel-Righteousness.</p>
               <p>He giveth us next <hi>foure</hi> wayes (n. 31. <hi>pag.</hi> 60.) wherein the <hi>Lord</hi> is said
<hi>to be our Righteousness</hi> (an Expression that doth emphatically &amp; more than
sufficiently express the meaning of the <hi>Imputation of Christ's Righteousness</hi>)
1. <hi>In that</hi> (saith he) <hi>He is the meritorious cause of the pardon of all our sins,
&amp; our full justification, Adoption &amp; Right to glory: &amp; by His Satisfaction and
Merites only our justification by the Covenant of Grace, against the Curse of the
Law works, is purchased. Ans.</hi> He cannot be said, by him, to be the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Cause of pardon, &amp;c. But in as far as He is the Meritorious cause
of the Covenant, in which these benefites are promised, upon Condition
of faith, our Gospel-righteousness, which properly and only is our Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Righteousness, according to him; and so Christ is our Righteousness,
in meriting that faith shall be repute our Gospel-righteousness in order to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:104357:100"/>
our obtaining of Pardon and Right to glory. But moreover, where is our
Righteousness? For Pardon is no Righteousness; neither is justification,
Adoption, or Right to Glory properly a Righteousness; But do presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
a Righteousness, after which we are enquiring, and cannot finde that
Christ is made to be that to us; and consequently, either faith must be it,
or there is none.</p>
               <p>The other senses are 2. <hi>In that He is the legislator, Testator &amp; donor of our
Pardon &amp; justification by this new Covenant. 3. In that He is the Head of Influx,
King &amp; Intercessour, by whom the Spirit is given to Sanctifie us to God, &amp; cause
us sincerely performe the Conditions of the Iustifying Covenant. 4. In that He i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the
righteous judge &amp; justifier of Beleevers by sentence of judgment. Ans.</hi> All these
three will make the Father to be our Righteousness, as well as the Son: for
He is legislator; He draweth to the Son &amp; sendeth the Spirit to Sanctifie us,
&amp; He judgeth by the Son &amp; justifieth. (2.) But none of these, nor all of
these give us the true Import of that glorious Name, according to the true
scope of the place <hi>Ier.</hi> 23: 6. of which we have spoken above.</p>
               <p>In like manner (n. 32.) he giveth us <hi>four</hi> senses of these words, <hi>we are
made the Righteousness of God in Him.</hi> The 1. is, <hi>In that, as he was used like
a sinner for us (But not esteemed one by God) so we are used like innocent persons,
so far as to be saved by Him. Ans.</hi> As He was used by God like a sinner, so
was He legally accounted a sinner, otherwise God would not have used Him
as a sinner. Therefore if we be used like innocent persons, we must be in
God's esteem, legally &amp; juridically innocent, through Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
imputed; &amp; so must be saved by Him. The 2. is, <hi>In that through His
Merites, &amp; upon our union with Him, when we beleeve &amp; consent to Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
we are pardoned &amp; justified, &amp; so made</hi> Righteous <hi>really, that is such,
as are not to be condemned, but glorified. Ans</hi> As I said, neither pardon, nor
justification maketh us Righteous, but suppose us to be Righteous; and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore,
in justification we are declared &amp; pronounced Righteous, &amp; the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reupon
pardoned. Moreover, all our Righteousness, that we have, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to justification &amp; pardon, is, according to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> our Faith, which
is, &amp; is reputed to be, our Gospel Righteousness; &amp; is said to be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Imputed to us: &amp; thus Christ suffered in our stead, that our faith might
be accounted our Righteousness. Though pardon will take away condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
yet (as we have cleared above) more must be had, in order to
Glorification. His 3. &amp; 4. are. <hi>In that the divine Nature &amp; Inherent Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
are for His merites. In that God's justice &amp; holiness, truth, wisdom &amp; mercy
are all wonderfully Demonstrated, in this way of Pardoning &amp; justifying of sinners
by Christ. Ans.</hi> This last hath no ground, as the sense of the words; And
as for the. 3. Before he make it the sense of the place. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 21. he must
say, That Christ was a sinner inherently (which were blasphemy) for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes
that beautiful correspondence, that is betwixt the <hi>First</hi> &amp; the
<hi>Last</hi> part of the verse, must be laid a side, contrary to the manifest scope of
the place.</p>
               <p>He tels us (n. 36. <hi>pag.</hi> 61.) <hi>It is an errour, contrary to the scope of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
to say, that the Law of Works, or of Innocency, doth justifie us, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:104357:100"/>
either by our selves, or by Christ: for that Law condemneth &amp; curseth us;
&amp; we are not efficiently justified by it, but from, or against it. Ans.</hi> I shall not
say, that we are justified by the Law of works efficiently; yet I hope, Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> will not say, that upon the fall, that Law, or Covenant was qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
abolished &amp; annulled; &amp; if it was only disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nsed with, in order to the
admitting of a Surety, which it did not provide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or give place to, in its
primitive Institution, we may saifly say, That it must be satisfied both as to
the commands, &amp; as to the penalty, ere we can escape wrath &amp; obtaine
Life: for this Law said (as himself confesseth <hi>pag.</hi> 63.) <hi>Obey Perfectly &amp;
Live, sinne &amp;</hi> dye. And though it condemne &amp; curse us sinners; Yet it
hath nothing to say against our Surety; nor against any clothed with His Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety-righteousness,
whereby all the demands of this Law and Covenant
were Satisfied.</p>
               <p>Hence he inferreth (n. 37.) <hi>Therefore, we have no Righteousness, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,
or Reputation formally ours, which consisteth in a conformity to the precepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
part of the Law of Innocency: we are not reputed</hi> Innocent; <hi>But only a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
which consisteth in Pardon of all sin, &amp; right to Life (with sincere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the condition of the Covenant of Grace, that is, true faith) Ans.</hi> If by
<hi>formally ours,</hi> he mean Inherently ours, I grant what he here saith: but I
deny it, if by <hi>formally ours,</hi> he meane that, by which we may be denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
formally
Righteous: for by Imputation we have a Righteousness,
whereby we are formally righteous, legally &amp; Juridically; &amp; this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
must needs consist in conformity to the Lawes commands. It is
true, we are not repute inherently Innocent; Yet we are repute non-sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
legally; &amp; hence cometh our Pardon &amp; Right to Life, which of it
self is no Righteousness, but the Result of a Righteousness. So that with
him Beleevers have no Righteousness, in order to justification, but faith,
the Gospel Righteousness, as was said above, &amp; this he saith here in effect,
&amp; yet more plainely &amp; fully <hi>pag.</hi> 64.</p>
               <p>He addeth (n. 38. <hi>pag.</hi> 62.) <hi>our Pardon puts not away our guilt of fact or fault,
but our guilt of and obligation to punishment. God doth not repute us such, as never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinned,
or such, as by our Innocency merited heaven; but such as are not to be damned
but to beglorified, because pardoned &amp; Adopted, through the Satisfaction &amp; merites
of Christ. Ans.</hi> Though pardon, as pardon, will do no more, than he here
granteth; Yet Righteousness &amp; justification presupposing Righteousness will
take away the <hi>Reatum culpae;</hi> not as if it would make us such as never sinned,
for that is Impossible; but because by Righteousness imputed, we are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
sinless <hi>Legally,</hi> that is, not guilty of the fact in order to punishment,
&amp; this must be, that we may not only not be damned, but may be glorifeed,
according to the Constitution, that said, <hi>Obey perfectly &amp; live.</hi> And though
now every pardoned man shall be glorified; Yet that is not meerly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
upon the account of Pardon; but because no man is pardoned, till he
have the compleet Righteousness of Christ, consisting in obedience and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Suffering, imputed to him, whereby beside pardon, he obtaineth a right
to glory.</p>
               <p>He cometh to cleare the matter of Imputation of Christ's Righteouss, by
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:104357:101"/>
the Imputation of <hi>Adam's</hi> sin, which is a good Medium, the Apostle going
before us herein <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. And though he saith somethings (n. 41. p. 65.)
wherewith I am not Satisfied, yet I passe, because not much to our present
purpose, &amp; come to (n. 42. <hi>p.</hi> 66.) where he saith, <hi>As</hi> Adam <hi>was an head
by Nature, &amp; therefore conveyed guilt by Natural Generation: so Christ is a Head
(not by nature, but) by Sacred contract, &amp; therefore conveyeth right to pardon.
Adoption and Salvation, not by Generation, but by Contract, or Donation. So
that what was to be Naturally in</hi> Adam, <hi>seminally and virtually, though not
personally in existence; even that it is, in order to our benefite by Him, to be in
Christ by contract, or the New Covenant, virtually, though not in personal exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
when the Covenant was made. Ans.</hi> As <hi>Adam</hi> was an Head by Nature,
so was he by Covenant; and as Christ is an head by Covenant, so is He an
Head by supernatural Influences, and conveyeth His blessings by Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as well as by Covenant; And therefore what was to be Naturally in
<hi>Adam,</hi> seminally and virtually, though not personally in existence, that is,
to be in Christ by supernatural Regeneration virtually. And as his Effects of
<hi>Adam's</hi> fall are conveyed by Natural generation, so that we are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
thereof actually, by actual partaking of our Natural being; so the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Christ's Righteousness are conveyed by Spiritual Regeneration, &amp;
we are actually made partakers thereof, when we partake of this Spiritual
being.</p>
               <p>He proceedeth (n.43.) <hi>They therefore that look upon justification, or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
as coming to us immediatly by Imputation of Christ's Righteousness to us,
without the Instrumental Intervention, and conveyance or Collation by this deed of
Gift, or Covenant, do confound themselves, by confounding and overlooking the
causes of justification. That which Christ did by His merites, was to procure the New
Covenant. Ans.</hi> Though the Instrumental Intervention of a Covenant be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged;
Yet Righteousness must come to us immediatly by Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ's Righteousness; For His Righteousness imputed is our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and is only that Righteousness, whereby we become formally
Righteous in order to justification. The difference lyeth here betwixt us:
<hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> thinketh, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Christ's Righteousness is imputed, in that it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
the New Covenant (and consequently is euqlly imputed to all; for
the Covenant, with him, is equally made with all) and in and through the
new Covenant, which conveyeth pardon and life to such, as performe the
conditions thereof, i.e. beleeve, &amp; so are inherently Righteous, these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
are bestowed; &amp; so Christ's Righteousness is not the immediat ground
of our justification and Right to Glory; but our own Personal Righteousness,
Faith, called our Gospel-righteousness: Christ's Righteousness is only the
immediat ground of the Covenant, being the Meritorious cause thereof;
&amp; the immediat ground, whereupon our faith is so far advanced. But our
judgment is, that though Christ convey the blessings purchased covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
yet the Covenant it self is not purchased by His Merites; &amp; the way
of conveyance is this, that He first by His Spirit worketh the soul up to faith
in Christ, &amp; then communicateth Christ &amp; His Righteousness unto the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever;
&amp; upon that immediat ground of Christ's Imputed Surety-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104357:101"/>
whereupon they become Righteous, in the sight of God, they
are justified, pardoned &amp; receive a right to the Crown. And though the
difference here may appear to be but small, yet to me it is such, that by Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi>
way, the whole frame of the Gospel is changed; &amp; such, as hold
it, do in my judgment, not only confound, but alter the causes of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
If that, which Christ did by His Merites, was to procure the New
Covenant, what was there in <hi>Adam,</hi> that can be said to answere this, or
hold correspondence with it? With us, the Parallel runneth smoothly and
clearly, thus. As by vertue of first Covenant, whereof <hi>Adam</hi> was the head,
engaging for all his Natural Posterity, so soon as they partake of Nature,
&amp; thereby become actual members of that Political Body, partake of <hi>Adam's</hi>
guilt, or breach of the Covenant, which is imputed to them; &amp; there upon
share of the consequences thereof, as immediatly resulting therefrom, <hi>to
wit,</hi> the corruption of the whole Nature, Privative &amp; positive, wrath &amp;
the curse &amp;c. This himself asserteth <hi>pag.</hi> 34. So by vertue of the Second
Covenant, whereof Christ, the <hi>Second Adam</hi> is Head, engaging for all His
Spiritual posterity, they, so soon as they come to partake of His spiritual
Nature, &amp; so become members of His mystical body (which is by a Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
supernatural operation, conveyed morally and Covenant wayes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Good pleasure of His will, &amp; according to His wisdom, who
doth all things well &amp; wisely) are made partakers of Christ's Righteousness,
which is imputed unto them; &amp; thereupon do share of the Consequences,
which do immediatly result theref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp; Right to Glory.</p>
               <p>He addeth (n. 44.) <hi>Though the person of the Mediator be not really, or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively,
the very person of each sinner (nor so many persons as there are sinners, or
beleevers) yet it doth belong to the person of the Mediator, so far (limitedly) to
bear the person of a sinner, and to stand in the place of the persons of all sinners, as
to bear the punishment they deserved, &amp; to suffer for their sins. Ans.</hi> We do not
imagine, that the Physical pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>son of the Mediator is, either really or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively,
the Physical person of each sinner. It is enough for us to say, that
the Mediator is an Head, Surety &amp; publick person; and so, that He &amp; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
are one legally and juridically. And we judge also, that it belongeth
to the person of the Mediator, being Surety, to Satifie for the whole debt
of these, for whom He is Surety: &amp; therefore must not only so far stand in
the place of sinners, as to Suffer for their sins, &amp; bear the punishment they
deserved; But also give that perfect obedience, which they were obliged
unto, and were not able to performe, or pay.</p>
               <p>He granteth (n. 45. <hi>pag.</hi> 67.) that Morally it may be said, that Christ's
Righteousness was given to us, in that the thing purchased by it was given to
us, as the money, given for the ransome of the Captive, may besaid mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to be given to the captive, though Physically it begiven to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.
But neither this similitude, not yet the other, of a mans being said

                  <hi>Next</hi> Christ was in our Law-place, and undertook to do what He did,
as our Surety; neither is this supposed in the cases proposed; &amp; againe, the
benefite here following <hi>viz.</hi> Justification &amp;c. doth presuppose us to be Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
&amp; consequently we must have a Righteousness imputed, because we
have none of our owne; for we may not admit Faith to that high dignity.
We have mentioned more apposite &amp; fit Similitudes above.</p>
               <p>I cannot assent to what he saith (n. 47. <hi>pag.</hi> 68.] <hi>That Christ is less impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
said to have represented all mankind, as newly fallen in Adam, in a general
sense, for the purchasing of the universal gift of pardon &amp; life, called the New
Covenant, than to have represented, in his perfect holiness and sufferings, every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever,
considered as from his first being to his death.</hi> For of His representing all
mankind newly fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> I read not in the Scriptures: nor yet of His
purchasing the New Covenant. Whether these be not additions to the
word of God, let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (who oft chargeth others herewith) consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Nor do I know, what Scripture warranteth him to say. <hi>pag. 69. That
Christ, the second Adam, is in a sort, the root of Man, as Man, as He is the
Redeemer of Nature it self from destruction;</hi> Nor what truth can be in it, unless
he think to play upon the word, <hi>in a sort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He seemeth to come neerer us, when he saith (n. 48. p. 70.) <hi>The summe
of all lyeth, in applying the distinction of giving Christ's Righteousness, as such
in it self, &amp; as a Cause of our Righteousness, or in the causality of it; as our sin is
not reputed Christ's sin in it self, and in the culpability of it (for then it must
needs make Christ odious to God) but in its causality of punishment. So Christ's
material or formal Righteousness is not by God reputed to be properly and absolutely
our own in it self as such, but the causality of it, as it produceth such &amp; such effects,
Ans.</hi> How Christ's Righteousness should be the cause of our Righteousness,
if we speak properly, I know not; for we are here speaking of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in order to justification, &amp; in this case, I know no other Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but Christ's Surety-righteousness, imputed to us, and bestowed
upon us: &amp; it is improper to say, that Christ's Righteousness is the cause
of it self, as given to us. But it may be, he meaneth, that it is the cause
of our Faith; &amp; this I grant to be true, but I deny, that this faith is our
Righteousnese, whereupon we are justified, or the <hi>ratio formalis objectiva</hi> of
our justifications. When we mention the Imputing of Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
we mean the Righteousness of Christ it self, not Physically, but le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
&amp; juridically, &amp; that is its worth or legal causality; not as it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,
but in order that it may produce such Effects. Our sin is reputed Christ's
legally, in its demerite of punishment, or in its <hi>reatus culpae,</hi> that He might
be legally thereby <hi>reus culpae</hi> and yet He was not odious to God, because
it was not His Inherently, but only legally &amp; by Imputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> in his following <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. fearing, that by all that he had said,
he had not made the state of the controversie plaine enough to the unexerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Reader, goeth over it againe, in a shorter way, that he may make it
as plaine, as possibly he can. And yet, I judge, (such is my dulness) that
he never made the matter more obscure, at least, to the Unexercised Reader,
nor possibly could, than he hath done here; for if any man, how under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

so ever shall understand his Expressions, let be the matter by them,
that is not very well versed both in <hi>Aristotles</hi> Logicks or Metaphysicks, and
the termes thereof, and in <hi>justinian's</hi> Lawes and the termes thereof, I am
far deceived. He that would understand this plaine discovery of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
must understand what <hi>Relations</hi> are; what <hi>Reatus culpae &amp; poenae;</hi> what

And if all Unexercised Readers shall be able to understand this, I doubt:
And sure I am, many a poor soul, that understands nothing of these termes,
gets grace of God to understand the thing, better than all this explication
(how plaine so ever it be called) shall ever make him do. And if this be the
plainest way, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> can chose to make us understand this so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and fundamental a truth, I shall never choose him for my Teacher, as
to this. It could therefore tend o no edification, at least unto his Unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
Readers, (whose edification, I judge, should be sought by us
all, in handling of this matter) to fall upon any examination of, or debate
with him about what he hath here said, seing it would necessarily end in a
debate about logical and Law termes; which I shall rather leave to others,
who have delight therein. And beside, the matter it self, delivered by
him in more plaine &amp; intelligible termes, (as I judge) both to exercised &amp;
more unexercised Readers, is already examined.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding (as we have seen) his opinion be different from what
the orthodox do commonly hold, in this question; yet <hi>Chap</hi> 4. he stateth
the question, against which he purposeth to disput, so as he may be sure,
none of these will oppose him: yea and it may be doubted, if <hi>Antinomians</hi>
themselves will contradict him; for thus he proposeth what he denieth. <hi>That
God did so impute Christ's Righteousness to us, as to repute, or account us to have
been holy with all that habitual holiness, which was in Christ, or to have done all
that He did, in obedience to His Father, or in fulfilling the Law; or to have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
all that He suffered, &amp; to have made Satisfaction for our sins, &amp; merited
our own Salvation &amp; justification in &amp; by Christ; or that He</hi> was, did, suffered
&amp; merited <hi>all this strickly in the person of every sinner, that is saved. Or that
Christ's very individual Righteousness, material or formal, is so made ours in a
strick sense, as that we are Proprietors, Subjects or Agents of the very thing it self
simply and absolutely, as it is distinct from the effects; or that Christ's individual
formal Righteousness is made our formal personal Righteousness; or that, as to the
Effects, we have any such Righteousness imputed to us, as formally ours, which
consisteth in perfect Habitual and Actual conformity to the Law of Innocency; that
is, that we are reputed perfectly holy and sinless, and such as shall be justified by
the Law of Innocency, which saith,</hi> perfectly obey and live, or sin &amp; dye.

betwixt the Sponsor, or Surety, and the person for whom He is spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
with the ends, for which he engageth himself, who is a Sponsor, is
manifestly hold forth; for the word Importeth one, who of his own accord
engageth for another, taking upon him, the Cause and Condition of that
other, &amp; promising to do or pay what the other was obliged unto, or to
see it done, and, thus engaging and promising, becometh the just &amp; legal
debtor for what he hath engaged, and obliged unto the performance. And
this sense is both obvious and generally received by all men; which should
Satisfie us, as to the acceptation of the word here, untill it be demonstrat,
that of necessity it must be taken in a peculiar &amp; distinct sense, in this place;
which yet the scope and circumstances of the place will not admit; but
rather confirme the usuall and generally received signification &amp; Import of
the word.</p>
               <p>This is also confirmed by the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

that there is a neer and closs Union betwixt Christ and Beleevers; so as they
(to speak so) become one person in Law; for a Sponsor, as such, standeth
engaged with and for the debtor, as if they were both but one; for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety
maketh himself the debtor; &amp; the Creditor may pursue either of them
for payment, and when payment is made by the one, both are free of the
obligation: so that if the Surety pay the debt, the creditor cannot reach
the Principal debtor. These things are clear and universally known and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
And hereby, we see how Christ, being a Surety, and Beleevers
become one person, in Law-sense; so that as He did voluntarily engage for
them, and put Himself in their Law place; so His payment and Satisfaction
is accounted theirs, and justice cannot reach them, for that, which He,
as their Surety, hath paid.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his book ag. <hi>Doct. Tully. pag.</hi> 108. in answere to the
first <hi>objection,</hi> which he there moveth, tels us, That <hi>when Christ is thus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the fidejussor of a better Covenant, it seemeth plaine, that it is God's Covenant,
as such; and so God's sponsor, that is meant.</hi> And for this he citeth <hi>Grotius</hi> &amp;
D. <hi>Hammond,</hi> in their <hi>Annot. Ans.</hi> This is the very same answere, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi>
give, with whom both <hi>Grotius</hi> &amp; <hi>Hammand</hi> do too well agree: and
it is not much for Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> honour, nor for the credite of his cause,
that he will forsake all the Orthodox, and embrace rather the <hi>Socinians,</hi> &amp;
such, as joine with them, than abandon what he thinketh contributive to
his Hypothesis. Whether Christ was at all a Surety, upon God's part, or
not, needeth not here be discussed; some Orthodox being of the judgment,
that He was, as we see in Mr. <hi>Gillespie's</hi> late Piece <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. others thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
that He was not, as may be seen in <hi>D. Owen's</hi> book of the <hi>Doctrine of
justification by faith.</hi> It is Sufficient against <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> &amp; the <hi>Socinians,</hi> to
prove, that He was a Surety and Sponsor for man to God; &amp; this is aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
made good by what both these forementioned Authors have said, in
the books mentioned, that more needeth not be added. But what doth <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi>
Baxter</hi> mean by <hi>God's Covenant?</hi> He can meane nothing here, but God's
part of the Covenant; &amp; so make Christ only a Surety for that part. But
what ground is there for this in the Text, or context? The Apostle is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that Christ's Priesthood (which respecteth not God towards man,
but man towards God; for every Priest is ordained for men in things to God,
that he may offer both gifts and Sacrifices for sin <hi>Hob.</hi> 5: 1.) is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than the levitica, He being made a Priest by oath, &amp; a Surety of a better
Covenant, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp; therefore his suretiship &amp; His Priesthood must both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectmen,
&amp; the things of men to God; or the one should not be a fit <hi>Medium</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:104357:104"/>
to prove the other; nor should there be any Coherence in the words; Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> we should pervert the Nature of Christ's Priestly
office, &amp; make it to be for God, in things pertaining to Men, contrary
to <hi>Heb.</hi> 5: 1. and all the use of Priests from the beginning; as they do, when
they make Christ's Priesthood to consist, in His making effectual to us the
promises of God; or in his effectual Communicating to us the good things,
promised to us of God; from which Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi> doth not much differ, when
he saith (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> citeth his words) <hi>That a Priest doth undertake to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from God both the confirmation and performence of the Promises to the people; &amp;
to that end mediats between both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He saith next, That <hi>Calvin</hi> seemeth to Intimate that, which he thinketh is
the truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of God's Covenant, from the
<hi>Sacerdotal appropinquation,</hi> mentioned vers 19. But no such thing appeareth
in <hi>Calvin's</hi> Comment. And that appropinquation, mentioned vers 19. is the
people their privilege now under the <hi>New Testam.</hi> He tels us further, that
<hi>Marlorat</hi> and others by <hi>Sponsor</hi> mean a <hi>Mediator.</hi> And it is true, that the
Sponsor here is a Mediator: But that the word <hi>Sponsor</hi> here shall denote no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, than what the word <hi>Mediator</hi> signifieth, I shall not readily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
without clearer grounds, than any I see yet adduced; for I cannot
think, that the Apostle would make use of a word, which no where else he
useth, &amp; which is no where to be found in the <hi>N. Test.</hi> but here, in a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
that it is never found to have, neither in Scripture, nor in the common
use of men. And how-ever; Yet it must be granted, that He is such a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
as is a Priest, &amp; so must offer Sacrifices to God for men, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must as well be a Mediator and Sponser on mans part, as on God's. He
saith, that <hi>Pareus</hi> on the place, calleth Christ a Sponsor of the Covenant,
<hi>quia novum foedus sanguine &amp; morte sua obsignavit.</hi> But for answer, he may
read the same author on <hi>Chap.</hi> 8: 1. saying, <hi>est &amp; Sponsor foeder is spondens
Deo populi nomine fidem &amp; obedientiam, non verbis modo sed &amp; victimis.</hi> And
thus he distinguisheth a <hi>Sponsor</hi> from a <hi>Mediator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> granteth (<hi>pag.</hi> 109.) that a Mediator is not of one, but doth
some what on the behalf of both parties: but addeth. <hi>That as Mediator, He
is, Hath, Doth, Suffereth, Meriteth, Satisfieth, so as the Representer or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of such a Beleever, as that every such person is supposed in Law, to have Been,
Done, Suffered, Merited, thus in and by the Mediator, is neither signified by this,
or any other Text. Ans.</hi> Though this cannot be said of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> who is only
a Mediator, strickly so taken, &amp; no more; yet it may be said of him,
who not only is a Mediator, but also a Sponsor and Surety, as we have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times explained it. He addeth 2. <hi>They that distinguish of a Natural &amp;
Political Person, do but darken the case, by an ill expressed distinction, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is not of two sorts of persons, but between Reality &amp; Acceptation, taking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
properly for a Natural person: It is one thing to be such a person; and another
thingh to have the Act, Passion, Merite &amp;c. accepted for that other person: And
this latter signifieth either, 1. That it was done by the other person raediatly, as
being a chiefe cause acting by his Instrument. 2. Or that it was done for that other
Person by another; the first is our denied sence, &amp; the second our affirmed sence.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:104357:104"/>
Ans.</hi> And I think (such is the discordance of Mens apprehensions) that
his explication darkeneth what is clear enough by the distinction given. His
<hi>Reality</hi> &amp; <hi>Acceptation,</hi> is, in our case, as darkning a distinction, as the
others, if not more, and is against the Common sense of the Law, &amp; the
plaine Common sense and understanding of men, when speaking of Law-matters.
Who doth not understand how the Suretys payment is really, in
the sense of the Law, the payment of the debtor, &amp; not meerly accepted
for him? If the payment were purely accepted, neither could it be said,
that the Surety was anteriourly obliged, nor that the Creditor might not
refuse that payment, neither of which can be affirmed. As for the <hi>first</hi>
sense of his Acceptation, we owne it not, more than he: &amp; the <hi>second</hi> is
true, but not full &amp; plaine, being only general; nor is it, as thus general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expressed, any sense of his Acceptation: for when two persons are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for a summe conjunctly &amp; severally, &amp; the Creditor may distress either
for the whole; when one payeth the whole, he may be said to pay for the
other; &amp; yet Common sense will not Suffer us to say, that his payment was
only accepted for the other.</p>
               <p>He tels us afterward, that <hi>Sponsors</hi> &amp; <hi>Sureties</hi> with us, <hi>are of several Sorts,</hi>
&amp; that <hi>they, who lay all upon the very name of a</hi> Surety, <hi>as if the word had but one
signification, &amp; all Sureties properly represented the Person of the Principal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
person, do deal very deceitfully. Ans.</hi> But there is no remedie against so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Mens censures. Some will possibly think, that his dealing is not faire,
to speak, in the Answere, of Sureties representing the principal debtors,
when the Objection, as himself set it down, speaketh only of their being
one person in Law sense; &amp; these two are not every way the same; every
one that representeth another, is not his Surety, or Sponsor; nor doth
the Surety, in every case, represent the Principal debtor; neither is he said
so to do. But, sure, it is plaine dealing to take the word <hi>Surety,</hi> or <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi>
in that sense wherein it is alwayes taken by Men that use it, untill he
demonstrat, that of necessity it must have a peculiar sense, in this matter,
&amp; in this place; and it is not faire, to object deceitful dealing to us, in this,
untill he hath first discovered the deceit. He reckoneth up, three or foure
various things, in which persons may become Sureties, as Debt, Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Duty, &amp; the like; But to what purpose, I know not. Doth he
think, that we make Christ such a Surety, as agreeth in all things with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Surety, among men? We know, there never was, nor never will be
such a Surety, as our Lord Jesus is: A Surety, notwithstanding, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
Him to be; because He is so called; &amp; in what respects He is a
Surety, we know from the Scriptures, where that is aboundantly declared,
&amp; not from the simple name of a Surety: The name tels us, that that must
be said of Christ, which agreeth to all Sureties, or is commonly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to agree unto them; &amp; that is, that they, in so far as they are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
or have obliged themselves, whether before or after the Principal
Debtor stood obliged (for this maketh no difference as to the obligation
<hi>Instit. fidejus. &amp; ff.eod. l. &amp;</hi> II.) are one person in Law-sense with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Debtor; so that their payment &amp; Satisfaction is acknowledged in Law,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:104357:105"/>
as the payment &amp; Satisfaction of the Principal Debtors. His Novices, that
look into <hi>Calv. Lex. Iurid.</hi> for <hi>Fidejussor</hi> &amp; <hi>Sponsor,</hi> will finde nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this; Yea they will finde, that <hi>fidejussor dicitur, qui pro alio fidem
suam obligat, &amp; fide sua, id est, periculo suo esse jubet, quod alius debet;</hi> &amp;
that, <hi>fidejussor proprie decitur debitor;</hi> &amp; that even <hi>fidejussor conditional is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
debitoris continetur;</hi> &amp; <hi>fidejussorem proprie esse debitorem fere omnes tradunt,
quia jura eum plerumque appellant debitorem.</hi> The same is to be seen in
<hi>Spigelius.</hi> As for that, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> addeth, that <hi>fide juffor non est con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniendus,
nisi prius principali debitore Convento,</hi> it neither altereth the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
nor was it universally so, but only in some certaine cases, as he
migt have read in the same place. So that it still holdeth true, that the
<hi>Sponsor</hi> &amp; the <hi>Debitor</hi> are one person in Law; &amp; that so, that if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitor
pay, the Sponsor is free; &amp; if the Sponsor pay the Debitor is free.
See <hi>Instit. lib. 3. Tit. 30. quibus modis tollitur obligatio</hi> &amp; l. 13. § <hi>si. fide jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor;</hi>

                  <hi>There must be</hi> (saith he) <hi>some what more than the bare <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, once used of
Christ, as Mediator of Gods Covenant; or the name of a</hi> Surety <hi>as now used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, that must go to prove, that the Mediator &amp; the several sinners are
the same legal Persons in Gods account. Ans.</hi> What he meaneth by <hi>God's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
he would do well to explaine. That the name <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is used of
Christ, as Mediator, if he take this <hi>as</hi> reduplicatively, he should prove.
When he saith, <hi>the Mediator &amp; the several sinners are the same Legal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
it is ambiguously uttered, &amp; no clear Declaration of our minde.
But as to the thing, we would faine know a reason, why we may not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
this word, in its common acceptation among men, seing there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Scripture to the contrary? yea, though this greek word be but
here only found; yet, as we saw, we have an hebrew word of the same
Import, several times used in the <hi>old Test;</hi> &amp; the whole matter, that we
seek after, clearly held forth thereby, if the places be but lookt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</p>
               <p>To put a close to this, we would call to mind that five fold <hi>Law-iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi>
&amp; <hi>sameness,</hi> that is betwixt Christ the Surety &amp; Sinners, for whom He
satisfied, mentioned by worthy Mr. <hi>Rutherfoord,</hi> in his <hi>Treatise</hi> of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
part 2 pag.</hi> 251. which are these.</p>
               <p>1. Though Physically the Surety &amp; the Debtor be two different Men;
yet in Law they are one &amp; the same Person, &amp; one &amp; the same legal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
&amp; the same object of justice, who so in Law pursueth the Surety, doth
also pursue the Debtor.</p>
               <p>2. The Debt &amp; Summe is one; not two Debts, not two Ransomes,
nor two Punishments; nor two Lives to lose, but one.</p>
               <p>3. It is one &amp; the same Solution, &amp; Satisfaction; there cannot in Law-justice
come another Reckoning, Dying, &amp; payment asking, after the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety
hath payed.</p>
               <p>4. There is one &amp; the same Acceptation, upon the creditor's Part; if
he accept of Satisfaction in the payment made by the Surety, he cannot but
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:104357:105"/>

upon him, as no debtor &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. It is one &amp; the same legal effect. Christ crucified in the Spirit &amp; risen
againe 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3: 16. &amp; we in Him, as in the Meritorious Cause, are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally

               <p>Mr. <hi>Gillespy</hi> in his late <hi>piece Chap.</hi> 21. hath several things, which will
both cleare up &amp; confirme what is said; we shall mention only a few, <hi>pag.</hi>
373, 374. He tels us, [that 3. Suretiship imports not only a voluntary
obligation for another person, but also union of parties, &amp; Assumption of
the Condition of that person, in the lawes sense; so that the Surety &amp;
debtor are but one party in Law: therefore say the <hi>Iurists, fidejussor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie

upon Him, but He took our condition upon Him. He put His name
in our Bond, that the Law migt reach Him for our debt. 4. It imports
a Communion betwixt the debtor &amp; the Cautioner, whereby as the debt
of the Principal debtor, becometh the debt of the Surety &amp; affecteth him;
so also the Satisfaction &amp; Payment of the Surety &amp; his Discharge &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
becometh the Satisfaction, Discharge &amp; Reliefe of the principal
Debtor, Christ's Suretiship imports not only an Union of Parties &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of interests &amp; Condition with His People; but also a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Debtful broken Man, resulting from His Bond of Suretiship;
whereby as upon the one part our Debt becometh His intirely, as the <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists
say</hi> of all Sureties, <hi>Singuli, in solidum tenenter;</hi> so upon the other part
His Satisfaction &amp; Discharge become ours 2. <hi>Cor. 5. last Gal.</hi> 3: 13. 5. It
imports a Commutation, Surrogation, or Substituting of one in the room of
another; &amp; soo Christ was substitute in our stead &amp; room, as <hi>Iudah</hi> was
in <hi>Benjamin's. 1. Pet.</hi> 2: 21. <hi>Rom. 4. last</hi> &amp; 5: 8. <hi>Gen.</hi> 44: 33.] So <hi>pag.</hi> 381.
His <hi>Assert.</hi> 5. is [Christ the Surety &amp; broken man the Debtor are one in
Law, but not intrinsecally one <hi>Esai.</hi> 1. They are legally one or in the

<hi>Asserts</hi> Neither the creditor, nor the Law can exact Satisfaction from both
the Surety &amp; the Debtor; but the Surety having paid all &amp; Satisfied,
the broken debtor can say, I have paid all, I am free; he may plead, my
friend &amp; Surety hath done all for me, &amp; that is as good <hi>in fore,</hi> in the
court of justice, as if I had paid all in mine own Person. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 13. <hi>Rom.</hi>
4: <hi>last, 1. Pet.</hi> 2: 24. The debt, that Christ paid, is our very debt, &amp;
the beleever can say, when Christ my Surety was judged &amp; Crucified for
my sins, then was I judged; &amp; what would you have more of a man, than
his life? <hi>Esai.</hi> 53: 6, 7, 8.] So thereafter <hi>pag.</hi> 422. he saith [Among men

two he will seize upon, the Surety, or the debtor, as he seeth it best for
his Satisfaction: but it is not so here, for the Lord, the Creditor hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that He will take Him to Christ for all; &amp; hath Determined, that
all the Satisfaction shall be made by Him: and Christ the Surety is content
that it shall be so, and that the poor broken Creature shall go free, and no
execution of the bloudy Bond of the Law shall passe against him, he being a
bankrupt creature, which hath obtained a liberation, as where there is <hi>ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio

usually the Principal Debtor is first conveened for the debt, before the Surety
be pursued: But it is not so here, the curse of the Law, and the execution
of the bond thereof doth not first strick upon us, and then afterward upon
Christ, to seek from Him what it cannot finde in us: But the Lord, the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor,

not finde compleet Satisfaction in our Surety, which is Impossible <hi>Esai.</hi> 53:

his obligation and Bond is the Principal obligation; &amp; the Sureties obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is but an accession to it, for strengthening the Security: but here the
Surety is the Principal debtor; and by His Bond of Suretiship, He hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Nature of the Beleevers Bond and Obligation, and put His own
name in it, so as He is become the Principal Debtor. His Suretiship hath
swallowed up the Debtor's Obligation to satisfie justice, the Surety being
the Head and Husband of the poor broken Debtor <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: 4. and having
changed the Bond of Satisfaction. and put out our Name, and put in His
own, whereby He hath transferred the debt upon Himself, as Principal
Debtor <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 7.—9. Among men, usually the broken Debtor's
Name stands still in the Bond, even after the responsal Surety hath intervee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
But here Jesus, the Surety of the New Covenant, when He put in
His own name, He puts out our names, that the Law might reach Him,
and might not at all reach us. He wrote Himself the sinner legally, and wrote

               <head>Mr. Baxter's Answers to some of our Argum. for Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
examined.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his book against <hi>D. Tully</hi> proposeth some Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that he may make answere unto them, according to his own
Grounds: Though some things, here repeated in his answers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
been already considered by us; yet we shall examine briefly his answers,
as here given.</p>
               <p>His answere to the first <hi>Objection</hi> hath been examined, in the foregoing
<hi>Chapt.</hi> The 2. is this. <hi>Christ is called tht Lord our Righteousness, &amp; He is made
Righteousness to us, &amp; we are made the Righteousness of God in Him. 2 Cor.</hi> 5: 21.
&amp; <hi>by the Obedience of one many are made Righteous.</hi> He answereth to this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>And are we not all agreed of all this? But can His Righteousness be ours no way, but
by the foresaid personating R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>presentation. Ans</hi> And will not <hi>Socinians;</hi> who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn
all the foundations or Christianity, and ought not be called, or
accounted Christians, say the same, as to the Scripture-expressions? are
we therefore agreed with them in judgment? or is there no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us: His not agreement in the words, but in the sense of Scripture, that
maketh a true agreement (2.) Christ's Righteousness may be, and is <hi>Ours</hi>
another way, than by that Personating and Representating, which he sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as the butt of his arguments &amp; another way also, than he proposeth as
his own judgment, as we saw.</p>
               <p>He rels us <hi>next,</hi> how Christ is our Righteousness, &amp; how His obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
maketh us Righteous, in his judgement, in 8 or 9 particulars. 1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the very Law of Innocency, which we dishonoured &amp; broke by sin, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
fulfilled &amp; honoured by Him, as a Mediator, to repaire the injurie, done by
our breaking it. Ans.</hi> The Law, which the Devils dishonoured &amp; broke
by sin, was perfectly honoured &amp; fulfilled by the Angels, who stood;
is therefore their Righteousness to be called the devils? But he will say; <hi>They
obeyed not, as Mediator;</hi> True: But then the ground of Christ Righteousness,
becomning <hi>ours,</hi> must be some other thing, than His honouring that Law by
fulfilling it, which we dishonoured by breaking. But he saith, <hi>Christ repaired
the injurie, done by our breaking it</hi> True; yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> there be no more, that will
not make His Righteousness <hi>ours;</hi> because, as is obvious, ere this be, we
must have an Interest therein; &amp; this obedience must be performed by Him,
a our Mediator &amp; Surety, undertaking &amp; Satisfying the demands of the
Law for us, &amp; in our stead.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>In that</hi> (saith he) <hi>He suffered to satisfie justice for our sin. Ans.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is suffering, as such, Righteousness; Nor could He satisfie justice for
our sin, in &amp; by suffering, if He had not done it in our stead, &amp; as one
Person with us in Law. If <hi>Titius</hi> steal from <hi>Sempronius</hi> a 1000. Pound;
&amp; <hi>Maevius givius Sempronius a</hi> 1000. Pound upon some distinct account. <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:104357:107"/>
receiveth no satisfaction, for what <hi>Titius</hi> stole from him, but if
he come &amp; give it for <hi>Titius</hi> &amp; he be satisfied there-with, then there is
a Law Union &amp; oneness betwixt <hi>Titius</hi> &amp; <hi>Maevius,</hi> whereby the Satisfaction
given by <hi>Maevius,</hi> becometh the satisfaction of <hi>Titius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. He saith, <hi>in that hereby He hath merited of God the Father all that
Righteousness, which we are truely the Subjects of, whether it be Relative or
qualitative, or Active; that is, our right to Christ in union, to the Spirit, to
Impunity &amp; to glory, 2. the grace of the Spirit by which we are made holy, &amp;
fulfill the conditions of the Law of grace: we are the Subjects of these, &amp; he is
the Meriter; &amp; the Meritorius Cause of out life is well called our Righteousness,
&amp; by many the material Cause (as our own perfect obedience would have been)
because it is the matter of that merite. Ans.</hi> That Righteousness, which he
saith here Christ hath merited, is not that Righteousness unto justification
of life, as the Apostle speaketh <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 18. And which we have by the
Obedience of Christ, made ours by Imputation <hi>vers</hi> 19. whereof we are
here speaking, &amp; in respect of which Christ is said to be our Righteousness
(2.) Our right to Christ is not our Righteousness, in order to justification;
nor is our Right to Impunity &amp; Glory that Righteousness, but a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
thereof (3.) In respect of the Graces of the Spirit, which follow
justification, &amp; do not preceed it, Christ is called <hi>our Sanctification:</hi> &amp;
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knoweth, there is a difference betwixt Righteousness &amp; Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
(4.) The Meritorius Cause of our life is well called our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
when it is Imputed to us &amp; put upon our score, as the Ground of
our justification &amp; Absolution; &amp; upon this account only is it by many cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Material Cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>And also</hi> (saith he) <hi>Christ's jntercession with the Father still procureth all
this, as the fruit of His Merites. Ans.</hi> Of Christ's procuring our holiness we
make no Doubt: but that upon this account, He is called our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
is denied: for this is not His Obedience &amp; Righteousness, whereby
we become Righteous unto justification of life.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>And we are related</hi> (saith he) <hi>as His members (though not parts of His
person, as such) to Him, that thus merited for us. Ans.</hi> if we be related to
Him, as members, in order to our partaking of His Righteousness &amp; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,
we must be parts of His legal Persons though not of His Physical
Person<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for by <hi>Members</hi> here I suppose, he meaneth Members of His My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
body or members of His Ransomed &amp; Redeemed body: And head
&amp; Members here make one Political body, &amp; become one Political Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or one in Law-sense.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>And</hi> (saith he) <hi>we have the Spirit from Him, as our Head. Ans,</hi> This
is but what what was said before in the 3. place. And this Spirit is given
for holiness: but Christ is our Righteousness, as well as our Sanctification;
&amp; it is of His being Righteousness, that we are speaking.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>And he is our Advocat</hi> (saith he) <hi>&amp; will justifie us, as our judge. Ans.</hi>
His being our Advocat, is the same with His Intercession spoken of in the
4. place. (2.) The Father will judge us, &amp; justifie us by Him; therefore
God the Father shall be our Righteousness, as well as Christ; &amp; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:104357:107"/>
shall have merited all for us, by His blood &amp; Sufferings, &amp; that in
a more principal manner, according to this Reason.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>And all this</hi> (saith he) <hi>is God's Righteousness, designed for us, &amp; thus
far given us by Him. Ans.</hi> But all this is not that Righteousness, which
God hath designed for us, in &amp; through Christ, in order to our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
nor that Righteousness, by which we become formally Righteous
in Law-sense; &amp; thereupon are justified &amp; pronounced Righteous in the
sight of God; for this is Christ's Surety-Righteousness, imputed to us,
&amp; none else can be it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly</hi> saith he. <hi>And the Perfect justice &amp; holiness of God is thus glorified in us,
through Christ. And are not all these set together enough to prove, that we justly
owne all asserted by these Texts. Ans.</hi> It remaineth to be cleared, how the
Perfect justice &amp; holiness of God can be said to be glorified in us, through
Christ, if Christ's Righteousness &amp; Satisfaction be not imputed to us &amp;
accounted ours, &amp; Christ &amp; we be not looked upon, as one Person in
Law: for all that is wrought in us, is far from being answerable to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
justice &amp; holiness of God, because of its Imperfection. And becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth not grant the Imputing of Christ's Surety-righteousness
(which is only answerable to the Perfect justice &amp; holiness of God) unto
us, in all that he hath here said, he cannot be said to owne all, that is
asserted by these Texts.</p>
               <p>The 3. <hi>object,</hi> is. If Christ's Righteousness be ours, then we are righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
by it, as ours; &amp; so God reputeth it, but as it is. But it is ours 1. by
our Union with him. 2. by his gift, &amp; so consequently by God's Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
To this he answereth. 1. That he hath told before, in what sense
it is ours, &amp; in what sense not. Shortly here he giveth us his mind againe,
saying. <hi>It is truely Imputed to us, or reputed, reckoned, as</hi> ours; <hi>but not
in their sense, that claim a strick Propriety in the same Numerical Habites, Acts,
Sufferings, Merites, Satisfaction, which was in Christ, or done by Him, as if
they did become subjects of the same Accidents; or as if they did by an Instrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
second cause. But it is ours, as being done by a Mediator, in stead of what
we should have done, &amp; as the Meritorious Cause of all our Righteousness &amp; Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites,
which are freely given us for the sake thereof. Ans.</hi> This is but what we
heard, when he was clearing the state of the question; &amp; there (<hi>Chap.</hi> XIII.)
we shewed, that his sense was not satisfying: for in his judgment, as we
found, there is no Righteousness truely ours, in order to justification, but
our Faith, which he calleth our Gospel-righteousness, which by Christ's
Merites is advanced to this dignity of being the potestative Condition of
the New Covenant, wherein pardon &amp; Right to life is promised upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Faith; &amp; so faith is our Immediat Righteousness, in order to the
obtaining of these favoures; &amp; Christ's Merites have only procured them
remotely, in procuring this Covenant. But we hear no mention made by
him of any such Imputation, as whereby Christ's fide jussory or Surety-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
is really made over and Imputed to Beleevers, that they thereby
may become formally Righteous, in the sight of God, and be justified as
such, &amp; so pardoned and have right to life, immediatly upon the account
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:104357:108"/>
of this Surety-righteousness made theirs. Nor hear we any clear ground
laid down by him, whereupon Christ's Righteousness can be called <hi>Ours,</hi>
&amp; we thereupon be reputed of God legally Righteous, &amp; dealt with as such.
We hear of Benefites bestowed because of His Merites; But we hear not
that Pardon and Right to Glory are made the Immediat result and effect of
Christ's Merites &amp; Righteousness, but only mediat, by the Interveening of
the New Covenant, whereby our Faith, the condition thereof, called our
Gospel, Personal Righteousness, is made the Immediat cause of our posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
these benefites; whereby he giveth occasion, at least, to judge, that
he maketh our faith the Immediat procuring &amp; Meritorius Cause of Pardon
and Right to life. However between his way, &amp; that, which he here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth
(which we also reject, neither asserting, that Christ was our Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Second cause: nor claiming a strick propriety in the same Numerical
Habites &amp;c. which were in Christ, as if we became Subjects of the same
Accidents, speaking of what Christ did &amp; suffered, in a Physical sense) we
know, &amp; owne a Midway, whereby Christ's Obedience &amp; Suffering, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
not Physically, but legally &amp; juridically, are transferred &amp; commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
unto us, not as Physical accidents, from one Physical subject to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but in a Law &amp; juridical sense. And though this Imputing &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
of Christ's Surety-righteousness cannot be explained by, nor
appear consistent with Logical or Metaphysical Notions, applicable only
to Physical Entities, &amp; as considered as such (to wich <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> in all
his Explications of this matter, doth so frequenily laboure to restrick us,
contrary to all Reason, Yea and to Common sense) Yet we must owne it for
a truth, knowing that these fundamental truthes, recorded in Scripture,
and held forth to us only by divine Revelation, stand in no need of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle's</hi>
learning, in order to their being Savingly understood &amp; practified:
And that Law-termes are more fit, to help us to some understanding in this
matter, which is hold forth in Scripture, as a juridical act, than Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical
termes; and yet we see no ground to say, that this matter, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof
we treat, must, in all points, keep even a resemblance unto <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian's</hi>
modes, knowing that it is a divine Mystery, and unparallelable.</p>
               <p>He saith 2. <hi>He that is made Righteousness unto us, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> also made wisdom, Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
&amp; Redemption to us, but that</hi> sub genere causae Efficientis, non

Holiness, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Christ, plainly the Question is, whether Christ or His Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
Holiness, Merites and Satisfaction, be our Righteousness constitutivly,
or only efficiently. The matter and forme of Christ's personal Righteousness is</hi> ours,
<hi>as an efficient cause; but it is neither the neerest matter, nor the forme of that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
which is</hi> Ours, <hi>as the subjects of it, that is, it is not a Constitutive
cause, nexly material, or formal of it. Ans.</hi> (1.) It is true, He, who is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
Righteousness to us, is also made Sanctification, &amp;c. and that He is
made Sanctification by being an Efficient cause: but it will not follow, that
He must be also the Efficient cause, and no other of our Righteousness,
which is of a far other Nature, and is no Inherent inwrought thing, as is
Sanctification. (2.) It is true, we are not the Subjects of the same nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:104357:108"/>
Wisdom and Holiness, which is in Christ, neither can we be, if they
be considered Physically: but yet we can be Subjects of the same Numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Righteousness, Legally and juridically considered; &amp; thus we are to
consider it here, &amp; not Physically, however Mr. <hi>Baxter, ad nauseam usque</hi>
inculcat this; for we consider it, and must consider it, as a Surety-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
&amp; we know that that same Individuat payment and Satisfaction,
made by the Surety, is in Law-sense the Debtor's, and imputed to him,
as the ground of his liberation from trouble and distress, at the hands of
the Creditor. (3.) Hence we see, that Christ's Surety-righteousness,
consisting in His Obedience and Sufferings, is that whereby we are consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Righteous in the sight of God, in a legal sense: and need not enquire,
whether it be the neerest matter, or forme or both, of our Righteousness:
for these Metaphysical termes have no place here, though <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> can
never hold of them. We are made Righteous in a Law-sense, &amp; not Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically,
by Christ's Imputed Righteousness, and upon this account, it is
ours legally: &amp; it is folly, to enquire for Physical matter, and forme or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive
causes of Moral or juridical Beings, or Effects, as Phylosophers
do, when speaking of Physical, or of Metaphysical beings.</p>
               <p>He saith 3. <hi>If our Union with Christ were Personal (making us the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
then doubtless the accidents of his person would be the accidents of ours: &amp; so
not only Christ' Righteousness, but every Christians, would be each of ours. But
that is not so, nor is it so given us by him. Ans.</hi> We acknowledge no Union
with Christ, making us the same person with Him Physically (&amp; it seemeth
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will understand it no otherwayes) But we acknowledge an Union
legal, Political, &amp; foederal, whereby we become one person juridical, in
Law-sense: and as to this, Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> accidents have no substantial place
or Consideration.</p>
               <p>The 4. <hi>Object</hi> is, you do seem to suppose, that we have none of that kind
of Righteousness at all, which consisteth in Perfect Obedience &amp; Holiness;
but only a Right to Impunity and Life, with an Imperfect Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
in our selves. The Papists are forced to confess, that a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
we must have, which consisteth in a Conformity to the preceptive part
of the Law, &amp; not only the Retributive part. But they say, it is in our selves,
and we say, It is Christ's Imputed to us. Thus he proposeth it, but if I were
forming the objection, I would say, That Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> Supposeth, we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
no Righteousness at all, in order to justification, beside our Act of Faith:
for as for his Right to Impunity and life, it is no Righteousness: &amp; beside,
I hope he will not say, that that is given before justification; &amp; of a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
preceeding (in order of Nature, at least) justification, we are
speaking, &amp; enquireing after it.</p>
               <p>What he answereth to this <hi>Objection,</hi> in the first place, because it only
concerneth Papistes, &amp; their Misapprehensions, in the matter, I passe.
But 2. he saith, <hi>If any of them do, as you say, no wonder, if they &amp; you contend:
If one say, we are</hi> Innocent, <hi>or</hi> sinless, <hi>in reality; &amp; the other, we are</hi> so by
Imputation, <hi>when we are so no way at all, but sinners really, &amp; so reputed. Ans.</hi>
If by <hi>Innocent,</hi> or <hi>sinless,</hi> he mean such, as never sinned, never Man,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:104357:109"/>
Protestant or Papist, dreamed of such a thing. If by these termes, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
such, are now not guilty legally, of the charge brought in against them;
this we acknowledge, and must acknowledge, or we know not, how any
shall ever be justified; for God will not pronounce sinners, as such, really
and legally to be righteous, His judgment being according to truth: &amp; the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
because we have no righteousness within us, whereupon we can be
pronounced not guilty, we must have a Righteousness imputed to us, even
the Surety-righteousness of Christ. But Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> it seemeth, will not
understand, what this legal non-guiltiness is; &amp; yet in matters among men it
is very clear and manifest. If <hi>Paul</hi> had fully Satisfied, according as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook,
<hi>Philemon,</hi> for the wrongs and injuries done him by <hi>Onesimus;</hi> If
Onesimus had been convented before a judge for these same crimes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
&amp; had produced the Satisfaction made by his Surety <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by the creditor <hi>Philemon,</hi> would not the judge have had ground in Law
&amp; equity, to pronounce <hi>Onesimus</hi> not guilty, &amp; therefore not to be punis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed,
according as was libelled against him? And yet though <hi>Onesimus</hi> had
been pronounced Innocent, that is, not-guilty, as to Crimes and Injuries
alleiged against him, in this case, in a legal sense, it would not follow, that
he had never committed these wrongs; nor had the evincing of that been
necessary to his Absolution and justification. His Legal Innocency or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
by vertue of the Satisfaction made by his Surety, now judicial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accounted &amp; reputed his, being Sufficient. These things are plaine to
such, as will but open their eyes: but all the world cannot make them plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
to such, as will understand nothing, but what is cast into <hi>Aristotelian</hi>
Metaphysical Mould. Were it not lost laboure for any to enquire, what
is the <hi>Matter</hi> &amp; <hi>Forme</hi> of this legal Righteousness of <hi>Onesimus?</hi> Whereof is
it constitute? How came <hi>Paul's</hi> righteousness to be his, and so one acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to go from subject to subject? whether was <hi>Paul's</hi> satisfaction the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
or Constitutive cause of <hi>Onesimus</hi> his Innocency, or non-guiltiness,
and the like?</p>
               <p>The 5. <hi>Object</hi> is, How can God accept him, as just, who is really &amp;
reputedly a sinner? This dishonoureth His Holiness and Justice. To this he
saith. <hi>Not so: cannot God pardon sin upon a valuable Merite, &amp; Satisfaction of
a Mediator? &amp; though He judge us not</hi> perfect <hi>now, &amp; accept us not, as such;
Yet. 1. Now he judgeth us holy. 2. And the members of a perfect Saviour. 3. And
will make us perfect and spotless, and then so judge us, having washed us from
our sins, in the bloud of the Lamb. Ans.</hi> All this giveth no satisfaction to
the objection; for the objection speaketh of acceptance in Justification, &amp;
consequently of that acceptation, that preceedeth Sanctification. (2.) It
is true, God can &amp; doth pardon sins; but meer pardon of sins is not justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
the person must be accepted, as righteous; and yet by Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's</hi>
way, the man hath no righteousness, to ground such a judgment and
acceptation: and God's judgment being alwayes according to truth, the
justified man must be righteous, that he may be accounted &amp; accepted as
Righteous, in Justification. Therefore either Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> must grant, that
he is Righteous through the Imputed Righteousness of Christ; or that he is
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:104357:109"/>
Righteous inherently by his faith, or by his fulfilling of the Conditions of
the New Covenant; for there is not a third: or that he is prononnced Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
without a Righteousness.</p>
               <p>The 6. <hi>object.</hi> Thus you make the <hi>Reatus culpae</hi> not pardoned at all, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Reatus poenae.</hi> To this he saith 1. <hi>If by</hi> Reatus culprae <hi>be meaned the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of a sinner, as he is</hi> revera peccator, <hi>&amp; so to be</hi> reus <hi>is to be</hi> revera ipse
qui peccavit, <hi>then we must consider, what you meane by Pardon: for if you mean
the nullifying of such a guilt (or</hi> Reality) <hi>it is impossible; because</hi> necessitate
existentiae, <hi>he that hath once sinned, will be still the person that sinned, while
he is a person, &amp; the relation of one that sinned will cleave to him. It will eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
be a true proposition,</hi> [Peter <hi>&amp;</hi> Paul <hi>did sin.</hi>] <hi>But if by pardon you mean
the pardoning of all the penalty, which for that sin is due</hi> (damni vel sensus)
<hi>so it is pardoned; &amp; this is indeed the</hi> Reatus poenae; <hi>not only the penalty, but the
dueness of that penalty, or the obligation to it is remitted and nullified. Ans.</hi> The
nullifying of the <hi>Reatus culpa</hi> physically or metaphysically is indeed Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
for it will be alwayes true, that such &amp; such persons did sinne: but this
<hi>Reatus culpae</hi> may and must be nullified legally and juridically, otherwise ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
shall man be justified: for in justification this <hi>Reatus culpae</hi> is declared to
be taken away; for the man is declared <hi>non reus,</hi> &amp; accepted as not-guilty,
or Righteous; not physically, or Metaphy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ically, but legally: a man must
be legally Righteous before he be justified, according to equity; &amp; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be legally Righteous, as long as the <hi>Reatus culpae</hi> doth legally remaine;
for a man legally guilty, is not legally Righteous. Now, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> must
yeeld to this, or he shall destroy his own ground, and take away all pardon,
as well as justification: for as it will be eternally true, that <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> did
sinne, &amp; so were <hi>rei culpae;</hi> so it will be eternally true, that punishment
was due unto them, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were <hi>rei poenae:</hi> &amp; therefore, if because
it will be eternally true, that <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> sinned, therefore the <hi>Reatus cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae</hi>
cannot be annulled; so because it will be eternally true, that <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi>
were obnoxious &amp; liable to punishment, therefore also the <hi>Reatus poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae</hi>
cannot be annulled. But the truth lyeth here, that though neither the
<hi>Reatus culpae</hi> nor <hi>poenae</hi> can be annulled physically, or metaphysically, that is,
so taken away, as if they never had been; yet both are taken away legally &amp;
juridically, and a pardoned man is legally and juridically <hi>non puniendus,</hi> &amp;
thus the <hi>Reatus poenae</hi> is taken away: and a justified man is legally and juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically,
<hi>not-guilty</hi> of the offence charged against him, &amp; thus the <hi>Reatus
culpae</hi> is taken away. As it is inconsistent with pardon, to say, that the
person pardoned doth legally remaine obnoxious to punishment, though it
will be eternally true, that he is the man, that did contract that dueness &amp;
onbnoxiousness: so it is inconsistent with justification, to say, that the
person justified is legally chargable with the offence, though it will be
eternally true, that he is the man, that did contract that guilt &amp; sin.</p>
               <p>He saith. 2. <hi>Therefore if by</hi> Reatus culpae, <hi>you meane an obligation to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
for that fault, this, being in deed the</hi> reatus poenae, <hi>is done away. So
that we are, I think, all agreed de</hi> re; &amp; de nomine; <hi>you may say, that the</hi>
Reatus culpae <hi>is done away or remitted, or not, in several senses;</hi> in se <hi>it is not
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:104357:110"/>
nullified, nor can be, but as dueness of punishment followeth that is pardoned.
Ans.</hi> The <hi>Reatus culpae</hi> is the ground of the obligation to punishment, &amp; not
the same with <hi>Reatus poenae;</hi> it is a being chargable with such a crime &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
and this, as we said, much be as well done away, in a legal sense,
as the obligation to punishment: Nay, in our case, the obligation to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
cannot be taken away, untill first this chargableness with the sin
be removed. The Lord will not declare that man <hi>non-obliged to punishment,</hi>
who remaineth legally and Juridically <hi>reus culpae</hi> &amp; chargable with the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
And so long as we differ herein, we are not agreed <hi>de re,</hi> nor <hi>de nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</hi>
The <hi>Reatus culpae, in se,</hi> is as well nullified, in a legal sense, as the Reatus
poenae; and neither the one, nor the other can be otherwayes nullified. But
I see, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is so for pardon, as to destroy all Justification, or he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that Pardon and Justification are all one thing, and by both nothing is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, but the obligation to punishment; and thus the pardoned and
justified person is still chargable with the sin; &amp; the obligation to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is taken away, where the charge of guilt remaineth: and thus God is
supposed to justifie a person, that is not justifiable, except by an iniquous
sentence. Yea, hereby we have the <hi>Socinian</hi> pardon owned, but not the
orthodox pardon: for the <hi>Socinian-Pardon</hi> can well consist with this charga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of guilt, because they acknowledge no Satisfaction, to remove the
<hi>Reatus culpae:</hi> but the orthodox pardon doth presuppose the removal, in a
legal sense, of the guilt or chargableness of sin, and is a Native consequent
thereof: for because of Satisfaction made by the Surety, Christ, and the
same now imputed to the sinner, and made his, guilt is taken away, &amp; he
is no more chargable with that guilt, but looked upon as Righteous; and
therefore all obligation to punishment is actually removed, &amp; he is no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
obnoxious thereto in Law, being <hi>rectus in curia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. 7. You have said, that though we are not personally, but semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in <hi>Adam,</hi> when he sinned, yet when we are persons, we are persons
guilty of his actual sin. And so we must be persons, that are partakers of
Christ's actual Righteousness, and not only of its effects, as soon as we are
beleevers; for Christ being the second <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; publick person, we have
our part in His Righteousness, as truely, and as much, as in <hi>Adam's</hi> sin.
His answere to this is long. He saith. 1. <hi>Our Covenant Union &amp; Interest sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
our Natural Union &amp; Interest, &amp; it is an adding to God's word &amp; Covenant,
to say, that He Covenanted, that</hi> Adam <hi>should personat each one of his posterity,
in God's Imputation, or account, any further than they were naturally in him, &amp;
so that his innocency or sin should be reputed theirs, as far, as if they had been
personally the Subjects &amp; Agents. Ans.</hi> If the Covenant Union &amp; Interest sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
the Natural Union &amp; Interest, then there is a Covenant Union and
Interest here to be considered: and therefore it can be no adding to God's
word or Covenant, to say, That <hi>Adam</hi> did personat each one of his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<hi>foederally,</hi> as well as <hi>Naturally:</hi> Yea, to deny this, were a corrupting
of truth, &amp; a denying of all Covenant-Union &amp; Interest. Whence it is
manifest, that in a Federal or legal sense, we must needs say, that Adam's
Innocency, or sin is reputed ours, as far as if we had been personally (not
physically, but legally) the Subjects &amp; Agents. If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> shall prove,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:104357:110"/>
that the Foederal Union &amp; Interest, which he saith is superadded to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
will admit of no other Consideration of the posterity Interessed, than
what is physical &amp; Natural, &amp; followeth upon the Natural Union, he shall
then lay a ground for what he would say here, but till then he shall but beat
the aire; &amp; when he hath done that, he shall destroy what he hath grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>viz.</hi> all Foederal Union &amp; Interest: for a Foederal Union &amp; Interest
will ground a foederal &amp; legal Consideration of the persons interessed; as
well as a Natural Union and Interest will ground a Natural and physical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the same persons. And Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> not adverting to this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth
all; for hence it is, that he will have all things here considered
only physically, and according to <hi>Aristotle's</hi> notions, with which we have
nothing to do, while speaking of a Foederal Union and Interest, and of
what followeth thereupon. This being premitted, we may quickly dispatch
the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The person of Peter</hi> (saith he) <hi>never was in reality, or God's reputation, the
person of</hi> Adam (<hi>nor</hi> Adam's <hi>person the person of</hi> Peter) <hi>but</hi> Peter <hi>being vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
&amp; seminally in</hi> Adam, <hi>when he sinned; his person is derived from</hi> Adam's
<hi>person; &amp; so</hi> Peter's <hi>guilt is not numerically the some with</hi> Adam's, <hi>but the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
of another Subject, &amp; therefore another accident, derived with the person
from</hi> Adam, <hi>&amp; from neerer parents. Ans.</hi> All this is only true, in a physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Natural sense; but notwithstanding, if we consider <hi>Adam</hi> and his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
in a legal &amp; foederal sense, as we must, if there be (as is granted) a
foederal Union &amp; Interest, then all runneth in another channel. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Peter</hi> is foederally and legally, in the person of <hi>Adam;</hi> yea God repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them both to be one Federal person: and the person of <hi>Peter</hi> was thus
actually in the person of <hi>Adam,</hi> and not virtually and seminally: for these
notions have no place here. And hence Peter's original guilt is numerically
the same with <hi>Adam's:</hi> and in this sense <hi>Peter</hi> had as neer a Relation to
<hi>Adam,</hi> as <hi>Abel</hi> had; for here <hi>Adam</hi> is considered, as the Head &amp; Center,
and all his posteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, as equal members of this Political &amp; Foederal Body,
and as Lines coming equally from the same Centre.</p>
               <p>He addeth. <hi>The</hi> fundamentum <hi>of that</hi> Relation (<hi>of guilt) is the</hi> Natural
Relation <hi>of the pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>son to</hi> Adam (<hi>&amp; so it is</hi> relatio in relatione fundata) <hi>The</hi>
fundamentum <hi>of that</hi> Natural relation <hi>is</hi> Generation, <hi>yea a</hi> series of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<hi>from</hi> Adam <hi>to that person. And</hi> Adam's <hi>Generation being the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of a guilty Nature with personality, to his Sones &amp; Daughters, is the</hi> fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum
<hi>next following his personal fault &amp; guilt, charged on him by the law.
So that here is a long series of efficient causes, bringing down from</hi> Adam's <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
&amp; guilt, a distinct numerical person &amp; guilt of everyone of this later posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Ans.</hi> 1. The <hi>fundamentum</hi> of that relation of guilt is more properly &amp;
proximely, the foederal relation of the person to <hi>Adam,</hi> than the Natural
relation: and the <hi>fundamentum</hi> of this foederal relation is not Generation,
but the free Ordination and Constitution of God. (2) What he meaneth by
these words, <hi>and Adam's generation being the communication of a guilty nature
with personality to his Sons and Daughters, is the fundamentum, next following
his personal fault and guilt, charged on him by the Law,</hi> I do not know: If his
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:104357:111"/>
meaning be, that the Communication of a guilty Nature, by the <hi>peccatum
originale originatum,</hi> is the <hi>fundamentum</hi> of the following personal fault and
guilt, by reason of the <hi>peccatum originale originans;</hi> that is, if he say, that
the corrupted Nature is the ground of the Imputation of <hi>Adam's</hi> transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
it is not consonant to truth, nor to what himself said above <hi>pag.</hi> 34.
against <hi>Placeus.</hi> But if he meane, that <hi>Adam's</hi> Generation being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of a guilty Nature, is the <hi>fundamentum,</hi> that next followeth
his personal guilt, charged on him by Law, I must say, I do not understand
what he would be at, though the words seem to express some such thing. But
the truth, that I shall lay down, is this; That all <hi>Adam's</hi> posterity, being
federally in him, sinned in him, and fell with him, in his first transgression;
by vertue whereof, when they come physically, by natural Generation, to
partake of his Nature, they are first, in order of Nature guilty of <hi>Adam's</hi>
transgression, and then have a corrupt Nature communicated, as a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and consequent of the other; &amp; this Corrupt Nature being sin, hath
its own guilt attending it also. (3) Though this long series of Efficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
be requisite to the production of a distinct numerical person from <hi>Adam's</hi>
person, in a physical and natural sense; yet every one of these physically
distinct numerical persons do immediatly derive from <hi>Adam</hi> their legal and
foederal personalities, that is, these same persons, considered foederally,
are equally and alike neer to <hi>Adam,</hi> their federal Head and Representative:
And therefore the guilt of <hi>Adam's</hi> sin cometh from him immedratly to each
one of them, foederally considered; and is consequently, the same nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
guilt: and all this is founded upon their Federal Union with, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He saith. 2. <hi>And it is not the same sort of guilt, or so plenary, which is in
us, for</hi> Adam's <hi>act, as was on him; but a guilt</hi> Analogical, <hi>or of another sort,
that is, he wes guilty of being the</hi> wilfull sinning person, <hi>&amp; so are not we; but
only of being</hi> persons, whose being is derived by Generation from the wilful
sinning persons (<hi>besides the guilt of our own inherent pravity) that is, the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is such, which our persons have to</hi> Adam's <hi>person, as makes it just with God
to desert us, and to punish us for that &amp; our pravity together. This is our guilt
of original sin. Ans.</hi> (1) Hereby that original sin, whereof we are speaking
here, <hi>viz, Adam's</hi> breach of Covenant, seemeth quite to be taken away:
for not only is it said, that original sin, as in us, is another sort of thing,
than what it was in <hi>Adam;</hi> and so not only not the same numerically (as he
formerly said) but not the same specifically: but moreover it is said to be
only an <hi>Analogical guilt:</hi> yea in end it is made just nothing; for it is said,
that we <hi>are guilty of being persons, whose being is derived from the wilfull sinning
persons,</hi> and this is no guilt at all; no mans simple being, let it be by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the most prodigiously guilty and wicked persons, that can be,
can be imputed to him for guilt; for his receiving a being is contrary to no
Law. And beside, when he addeth by way of Explication, that <hi>the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is such, which our persons have to Adam's person, as makes it just with God
to deserte us,</hi> he must either make the simple Relation to be the guilt, or the
ground of guilt, and its Imputation. The Simple Relation, without some
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:104357:111"/>
guilt following it, and founded upon it, cannot make it just with God to
desert us &amp;c. For sin only can do this, &amp; that Relation is not sin. If he say,
That guilt is Superadded, &amp; upon this account, it is just with God thus to
punish. I would ask, what is this guilt: It is not <hi>Adam's</hi> sin, but some
analogical thing, which Scripture knoweth nothing of, and Reason can gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
us no account, whence it came. He cannot say, that it came from <hi>Adam's</hi>
sin, for if we be federally united to &amp; Interessed in <hi>Adam</hi> (as we are, &amp; as
he confessed we were) and if upon that account we be reputed guilty, the
same Individual guilt, which was on <hi>Adam,</hi> must be upon us; and if our
guilt be of another sort, he must give us another <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom that
other analogical sort floweth. The Scripture saith, that <hi>we all sinned in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
Rom.</hi> 5: 12. which were not truth, if his individual sin were not ours,
or if ours were of another sort, and only analogical. But this is the fruit
of Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> casting all these things in <hi>Aristotle's</hi> mould. But moreouer
(2) It hath a foule aspect towards <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> to make our guilt another,
than <hi>Adam's,</hi> because that <hi>Adam</hi> was the wilful sinning person, and so are
not we: for this is to confirme the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who say, that that sin was
only <hi>Adam's,</hi> because he was the only wilfully sinning person, &amp; we had no
will therein.</p>
               <p>3. He saith. <hi>And this guilt cometh to us by Natural propagation, and resultan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
from our very Nature so propagated. Ans.</hi> It is true, we come to be actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charged with this guilt, &amp; to have it imputed to us, when we partake of
our beings by Natural Generation or propagation; and that because of our
federal Union with &amp; Interest in <hi>Adam;</hi> and exclusive of this, it cannot be
said to come to us by resultancy from our very Nature so propagated: for the
guilt of all <hi>Adam's</hi> after-Transgressions should as well be said to come to us,
after this manner, as the guilt of that one Transgression &amp; Disobedience,
of which only the Scripture maketh mention <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>He cometh next to consider our contrary Interest in Christ, &amp; tels us 1.
<hi>Our persons are not the same as Christ's person (nor Christ's as ours) nor ever so
judged or accounted of God. Ans.</hi> Physically this is true; but it is not true le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally:
for when he came in the Law-place of the Elect, &amp; become Surety
for-them, they and he became one person in Law. He saith 2. <hi>Our persons
were not Naturally seminally &amp; virtually in Christ's person (any further than He
is Creator &amp; Cause of all things) as they were in Adam's. Ans. Adam</hi> was a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Head, our Lord is a Spiritual &amp; Supernatural Head: &amp; as to this, we
willingly grant a difference; but both were Federal Heads &amp; Publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
&amp; their agreement in this satisfieth us. He saith 3. <hi>Therefore we deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
not Righteousness from Him by Generation, but by His voluntary donation and
contract. Ans.</hi> We derive it from Him by Regeneration; that is, as we
partake of <hi>Adam's</hi> guilt, when by Generation we partake of a Natural being;
so we partake of Christ's Righteousness, when by Regeneration we partake
of a spiritual being in Him. And there is no new formal contract made here
anent, but what is sutable to the Nature of this privilege, in order to its
conveyance. He saith 4. <hi>as He became not our Natural parent, so our persons,
not being in Christ, when He obeyed, are not reputed to have been in Him natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:104357:112"/>
or to have obeyed in &amp; by Him. Ans.</hi> We say only (and we seek no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re)
that Christ was our Federal Head; and our persons Federally (not phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically)
were in Christ, when He obeyed: we are reputed to be in Him not
Naturally, but Foederally, and so to have obeyed in &amp; by Him.</p>
               <p>He saith 5. <hi>If Cbrist &amp; we are reputed one person, either He obeyed in our</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>or we in</hi> His, <hi>or</hi> both; <hi>if He obeyed, as reputed sinner, in the person of each
sinner, His obedience could not be Meritorious, according to the Law of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which required sinless perfection; &amp; He being supposed to have broken the Law
in our person, could not so be supposed to keep it. If we obeyed in His person, we
obeyed as Mediators, or Christ's. Ans. Aristotle's</hi> Notions, to which Mr.
<hi>Baxter,</hi> contrary to all sense &amp; reason, will have this whole matter restrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in its explication, are the cause of all this ridiculous Confusion. But
for answere, I say, Christ &amp; we are reputed one person, not physically,
but in Law-sense &amp; federally; &amp; therefore both he obeyed; as taking on
our Law-place, &amp; coming in to our Law-condition: and to say, that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
His obedience could not be Meritorious, is ridiculous: as if forsooth
His coming into our Law-place, would make Him to be supposed, to have
broken the Law, in His physical person, as if one would say. The Surety
cannot pay the debtor's debt, because by coming in to his Law-place, he
becometh a bankrupt. Himself saith, that Christ suffered in our stead; &amp;
this cannot be in our Physical stead, but in our Law-stead; now will it not
as well hence follow, that He suffered as a sinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; then, how could He,
who suffered, as being supposed to have broken the Law, make Satisfaction
for us; or how could His death be Meritorious? Thus indeed good service
shall be done to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> but bad service to the Truth. <hi>Finally,</hi> we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
as Federally in Him, &amp; yet were no Mediators, or Christ's, but
redeemed Saints; as the debtor satisfied the Creditor, in Law-sense, when
his Surety did it; and yet became no Surety thereby.</p>
               <p>He saith 6. <hi>But as is oft said, Christ our Mediator undertook in a middle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to reconcile God and Man (not by bringing God to judge erroneously, that He, or
we were, what we were not, or did whas we did not, but) by being, doing and
suffering for us that, in His own person, which should botter answere Gods Ends
&amp; Honour, than if we had done and suffered in our persons, that hereby he might
merite a free gift of pardon &amp; life (with himself) to be given by a Law of Grace,
to beleeving penitent Accepters. Ans.</hi> I doubt there be one word here said, to
which a <hi>Socinian</hi> will not subscribe. But for answer, I say, Christ our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
so undertook, in a middle physical person, to reconcile God &amp; man,
that He became our Surety, &amp; came in our stead &amp; Law-place, to do and
suffer what we were obliged unto by the Law: and when God judged Him
to be, and to do thus, He judged not erroneously, but truely, according
to His own gracious Appointment, and Ordination, making Him a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
person, representing all such, as He gave Him to save. We have
shown elsewhere, that Christ merited something else, than a Law of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
to Convey a free gift of pardon &amp; life upon New Conditions, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
His death could not be called a Ransome, a Redemption, or a price;
nor could He be said to have died in the stead of any person, or to have born
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:104357:112"/>
their Iniquities, or the punishment thereof; far less to have been made sin
for us. But more of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>Object 8. As Christ is a sinner, by Imputation of our sin; so we are Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
by the Imputation of His Righteousness. But it is our sin it self that
is Imputed to Christ. Therefore it is His Righteousness it self, that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to us. To this he saith. 1. <hi>Christ's person was not the subject of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
relative guilt, much less of our habites, or acts. 2. God did not judge Him
to have been so. 3. Nay Christ had no guilt of the same kind reckoned to be on Him,
else these unmeet speaches, used rashly by some, would be true, viz. That Christ
was the greatest murderer, Adulterer &amp;c. and consequently more hated of God, for
God must needs hate a sinner, as such. Ans.</hi> (1) Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will understand
nothing here, but according to his Philosophical &amp; Metaphysical Notions:
&amp; in this sense, we may grant him all that he saith: And yet adde, That
Christ was the legal, juridical, and federal subject of our guilt; for our
sins did meet together on Him, and He was made sin (2) and God doing all
this, could not but judge Him to have been so. (3) Christ inherently had
no guilt neither of the same kind, nor of any other: but that our very sins
were imputed to Him, &amp; reckoned upon His score, must be granted, or we
must deny, His dying or satisfying in our stead; &amp; so plainely embrace <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianisme</hi>
(4) Those speeches are but unmeet to such, as mistake them, as
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth here, who supposeth that their meaning is, That He was
the greatest sinner Inherently (which were indeed blasphemy, but far from
their thoughts) for he inferreth, that consequently he must have been more
hated of God; while as God's hatred (if we take it not for meer punishing
of sin) is only against such, as are inherently sinners. What saith he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reover?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To be guilty of sin, as we are, is to be reputed truely the person, that committed
it. But so was not Christ; &amp; therefore not so to be reputed, Christ was but the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
that undertook to suffer for our sins, that we might be forgiven, &amp; not for
His own sin, really or justly reputed. Ans.</hi> No man saith, that Christ was
guilty of sin, as we are, that is, Inherently. But if He undertook to suffer
for our sins, unless we turn <hi>Socinians,</hi> in expounding this sentence, we must
say, that the guilt of our sins was laid upon Him, otherwise He could not
suffer for them, in our place &amp; stead; &amp; we must say, that He, so suffered
for them, as that all they, in whose stead He suffered, should certainly be
forgiven; &amp; not have a bare <hi>may be</hi> of forgiveness, by a New Covenant,
offering the same upon new termes. What next?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Expositors</hi> (saith he) <hi>commonly say, that to be</hi> [made sin for us] <hi>is but to
be made a</hi> [Sacrifice for sin] <hi>so that Christ took upon Him, neither our numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
guilt of sin it self, nor any of the same species, but only our</hi> Reatum poenae,
<hi>or debt of punishment, or (left the wranglers make a verbal quarrel of it) our</hi>
Reatum culpae, non quâ talem, &amp; in se, sed quatenus est fundamentum
Reatus poenae. <hi>Ans.</hi> Yet some Expositors will say more, and that in full
consonancy with the Scriptures, as <hi>Esai.</hi> 53: 6. And however, all we say,
is hereby sufficiently confirmed; for if He be made a sacrifice for our sins,
our sins must necessarily be imputed to him, as the sins of the people were
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:104357:113"/>
typically laid upon the Sacrifices: and therefore Christ must have taken on
Him, not physically but legally, our very numerical guilt, without which
he could not be accounted <hi>reus poenoe,</hi> or obnoxious to our punishment.
What he meaneth by the <hi>reatus culpae qua talis,</hi> &amp; <hi>in se,</hi> he would do well
to explaine: If his meaning be, that Christ was not legally accounted guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
this is denied; for then he could not have been a Sacrifice for our sins,
to have died in our stead. Wrangling is not good: <hi>Yet Turpe'est Docto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>He addeth, <hi>And so His Righteousness is ours not</hi> numerically, <hi>the same Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he was the subject of, made that Relation to us; nor yet a Righteousness of
the same species as Christ's is given to us at all. Ans.</hi> Though Christ's nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Righteousness be not ours physically; yet that same is made over to us
legally: as it is one &amp; the same Individual payment, that is made by the
Surety, and made over in Law unto the debtor. And therefore what he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
is to no purpose. <hi>But</hi> (saith he) <hi>His Righteousness is the</hi> Meritorious
cause &amp; reason <hi>of another Righteousness or justification, (distinct from His) free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given us by the Father &amp; Himself by His Covenant. Ans.</hi> Righteousness and
justification are not one and the same, more than the cause is the same with
the Effect. As Christ's Righteousness is the Meritorious Cause of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
so it must be legally made ours, in order to our Justification,
otherwayes we cannot be accounted Righteous, and legally free of the
Charge, brought in against us. And this is not granted us by a Covenant
with new Conditions, in Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> sense, as hath been evinced already.
Therefore he is in a great mistake, when he concludeth, that <hi>they that will
not blaspheme Christ, by making</hi> guilt of sin it self, <hi>in its</hi> formal relation <hi>to be
His own; &amp; so Christ to be</hi> formally <hi>as great a sinner, as all the Redeemed set to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
&amp; they that will not overthrow the Gospel, by making us</hi> formally <hi>as Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
as Christ, in kind &amp; measure, must needs be agreed with us, in this part
of the controversie.</hi> For we have shown, how far we are from Blasphemy, &amp;
how groundless his Insinuation is, founded only on his Physical or Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
acceptation of things here, which we understand only legally and juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically,
according to all right and reason. And as for subverting of the
Gospel, it is one of our choise grounds of Reason against his way, because
by it the Gospel is indeed changed, and the true and native Gospel-way of
Salvation is indeed removed, and a <hi>Sociniano-Armintan</hi> Gospel substitute in
its room, which is daily more and more confirmed, by books coming out,
wherein <hi>Mr. Baxter's</hi> grounds are owned, and more <hi>Socinianisme</hi> &amp; <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianisme</hi>
vented, than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself hath yet had the confidence to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
in his own books; witness Mr. <hi>Allens discourse of the two Covenants,</hi> ushe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in with Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> preface; and others of that kind much commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and cryed up by Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. <hi>Object.</hi> When you Inferre, that if we are reckoned to have perfectly
obeyed in and by Christ, we cannot be againe bound to obey ourselves after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
nor be guilty of any sin: you must know, that it is true, that we
cannot be bound to obey to the same ends, as Christ did (which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
us, or to fulfill the Law of works) but yet we must obey to other ends
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:104357:113"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> in gratitude and in love to God, and to do good, and the like. Though
I think the objection is not so favourably proposed, as it might be, seing
that end to <hi>Redeem</hi> should not here be mentioned; for though it was the end
of Christ's coming in to our Law-place, yet it cannot be said to be properly
the end of that Obedience, he performed, while he was in our Law-place,
proximely. Let us see how ever, what he saith to it. 1. <hi>Hence</hi> (saith he.)
<hi>it clearly followeth, that Christ obeyed not in each of our persons</hi> legally, <hi>but in the
person of a Mediator, seing His due obedience &amp; ours have so different ends, and a
different</hi> formal-relation (<hi>His being a conformity proximatly to the Law, given
Him, as Mediator) that they are not so much as of the same</hi> species, <hi>much less
numerically the same. Ans.</hi> I think rather, that hence it clearly followeth,
that Christ did indeed obey the Law, as it was the Condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of works, in each of the Elect's person legally: for though His Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and ours now, after faith, have far different ends; yet His Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
as Obedience to the Law of works, had the same end that our
Obedience should have had by that Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the fulfilling of the same, in
order to the obtaining of a Right to Life; and if not, to lose all. The Law,
given Him as Mediator, taken in its latitude, is not the Law, whereof the
objection speaketh; for it speaketh of the Law of works, under which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
was, and all his posterity in him, and under the breach of which we
lay. And Christ's obeying, in the person of a mediator, doth not hinder
His representing His own legally; for He was such a Mediator, as was a
Sponsor and Surety, and came in our Law-place, and undertook our debt.
Therefore, though Christ's Obedience to the special Law, given to Him,
as Mediator, was not of the the same kind, with the obedience, required
of us; yet the obedience He performed to the Moral Law, in our place &amp;
stead, and as our Surety and Sponsor, was the very same debt, we were
oweing.</p>
               <p>He saith 2. <hi>Either this Obedience of</hi> Gratitude, <hi>is a duty, or not; if not, it
is not truely obedience, nor the omission sin: If yea, then that duty was made a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by some Law: And if by a Law, we are now bound to obey, in gratitude,</hi>
(<hi>or for what ends so ever) either we do all that we are so bound to do, or not; if
we do it (or any of it) then to say, that we did it twice, once by Christ &amp; once
by ourselves, is to say, that we were bound to do it twice, &amp; then Christ did not
all, that we were bound to, but half. Ans.</hi> We distinguish betwixt the Law,
as the Condition of the Covenant of works; and as a Rule of Obedience:
A duty may be duty now, as required by the Law still in force, as to its
commanding regulating power, and yet not be a part of the Condition of
the Covenant of works, wherein we had failed, which Christ fulfilled, by
giving perfect obedience to that Law, as the Condition of Life, to which
we neither did, nor could give perfect Obedience: and all our Obedience
now, though commanded by the same Law, is no fulfilling in whole, or
in part, of the Condition of the Covenant of works; and therefore can
not be said thus to be done twice, but once, and that by Christ alone. He
addeth, <hi>But what man is he, that sinneth not? Therefore, seing it is certaine,
that no man doth all, that he is bound to do by the Gospel (in the time &amp; measure
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:104357:114"/>
of his faith, hope, love, fruitfulness &amp;c.) it followeth that he is a sinner, and
that he is not supposed to have done all that by Christ, which he failed in, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was bound to do it himself, &amp; because he is a sinner for not doing of it. Ans.</hi>
As there is a difference betwixt obedience to the Law, and the performing
the Condition of the Covenant of works; so there is difference betwixt sin
or failing in Obedience, and Violation of the Condition of the Covenant of
works: as our Obedience now is not the performance, so our sinning is not
the Violation of the Conditions of the old Couenant. Beleevers performed
the Conditions of the Covenant only in Christ, which they could not do in
themselves; and therefore their sins now, though transgressions of the Law,
are not counted Violations of the conditions of the Covenant of works, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they are not.</p>
               <p>He saith 3. <hi>Yea the Gospel bindes us to that, which Christ could not do for us,
as to beleeve in a Saviour, &amp;c. Ans.</hi> And what then? were these part of the
Conditions of the Covenant of works? If they were, Christ hath perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, for He gave perfect Obedience; and thereby hath freed us from
that obligation. If they were not, neither can they now be required, as
part of that Condition.</p>
               <p>He saith 4. <hi>The truth, which this Objection intimateth, we all agree in, viz.
That the Mediator perfectly kept the Law of Innocency, that the keeping of that
Law might not be necessary to our Salvation (and so such Righteousness necessary in
ourselves) but that we might be pardoned for want of perfect Innocency, &amp; be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon our sincere keeping of the Law of Grace, because the Law of Innocency was
kept by our Mediator, and thereby the grace of the New Covenant merited, and by
it, Christ, Pardon, Spirit &amp; Life by Him freely given to beleevers, Ans.</hi> The
truth expressed in the Objection, is very far different from this <hi>Sociniano-Arminian</hi>
Scheme of the Gospel, which we have had often times proposed
to us by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> but never yet confirmed; nor do we expect ever so see
it confirmed. We have also, at several occasions, given our reasons against
it, and need not therefore here repeat, or insist upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Last object.</hi> The same person may be really a sinner, in himself, and yet
perfectly Innocent in Christ, and by Imputation, How or upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
this objection is used, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth not show, and therefore we
cannot certainely know the true meaning and Import thereof. In one sense
it may be very true, and yet in another sense it cannot be admitted. It is
true, in this sense, The same person may be Inherently a sinner, and yet le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
Innocent, through the Imputation of the Surety-righteousness of
Christ. But it cannot be admitted in this sense, The same person is legally
Innocent in Christ by Imputation; for this were a Contradiction. What
saith Mr. <hi>Baxtor</hi> to it? <hi>Remember</hi> (saith he) <hi>that you suppose here the person
&amp; Subject to be the same Man; &amp; then that the two contrary relations, of</hi> perfect
Innocency <hi>or</hi> guiltlesness, &amp; guilt of any (<hi>yea</hi> much) sin <hi>can be consistent in
him, is a gross contradiction. Ans.</hi> There is no contradiction, unless the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be <hi>ad idem:</hi> &amp; here it is not so; for he may be guilty Inherently, as to
himself, and yet innocent legally, as to his Surety. But if both be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of a person, legally considered, I grant, it is a Contradiction; for
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:104357:114"/>
he, that is legally Innocent, cannot be legally guilty, in so far as he is le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
Innocent, whether the Charge be particular for one sin, that is brought
in against him, or for moe, or for all.</p>
               <p>He saith 2. <hi>But if you meane, that God reputeth us to be perfectly Innocent,
when we are not, because that Christ was so, it is to Impute error to God. Ans.</hi>
This cannot be their meaning: for they know, that God reputeth no man
to be other-wayes, than he is. But yet it must be said, that God reputeth
Beleevers, who have the Righteousness of Christ imputed to them, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
as to the Violation of the Covenant of works, I mean, <hi>legally</hi> Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and so, not guilty of the charge of sin, &amp; death upon that account,
brought in against them; for they are so, being justified; &amp; therefore there
is now no condemnation to such <hi>Rom,</hi> 8: 1. &amp; none can lay any thing of that
Nature to their Charge vers 33.</p>
               <p>He addeth, <hi>But He</hi> (i. e. God) <hi>doth indeed first give, &amp; then Impute a
Righteousness evangelical to us, in stead of perfect Innocency, which shall as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
bring us to glory. Ans.</hi> That God doth indeed Impute, that is, give
&amp; put upon our score an Evangelical Righteousness, that is, the Surety-Righteousness
of Jesus Christ, revealed in the Gospel, in stead of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
&amp; personal Innocency, which we neither had, nor could attaine to,
&amp; which shall certainely bring us to glory, being the Meritorious Cause
thereof. But Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> sense hereof is a manifest Perversion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel:
for thus he senseth it. <hi>And that is, He giveth us both the Renovation of
His Spirit (to Evangelical obedience) &amp; a Right by free gift to pardon &amp; glory,
for the Righteousness of Christ, that merited it, &amp; this thus given us, he reputeth to
be an acceptable Righteousness in us. Ans.</hi> Now that this is a clear perversion of
the Gospel is manifest from these particulars (beside several others else whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
touched) (1) Hereby the Covenant of Grace is changed into a Covenant
of works, only with a Mitigation of the Conditions. (2) Christ's Surety-righteousness
is not Imputed to us, neither as our legal Righteousness, nor
yet as our Evangelick-righteousness; for at most it is only granted to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
as to its Effects. (3. We have no other Righteousness hereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
imputed to us, but our own Inherent Righteousness. (4) Christ is he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby
made of God unto us Righteousness, by being made of God Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to us. (5) Hereby the immediat ground of our Pardon &amp; Right to
Glory, is not Christ's Surety-righteousness, but our own Inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
(6) Christ hereby me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ited neither Pardon, nor Glory to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as the Immediat fruites of His merites; but He only merited the New
Covenant, wherein these favours are offered upon new Conditions. (7) Thus
Christ is made only a far off Mediating person, procureing new and easier
termes (which yet are as Impossible to us, till we be renewed by grace, as
the old) but no Redeemer, or Surety, suffering and obeying in the room
and stead of any. (8) Thus are we justified by our own works of Evangelical
Obedience (9) God is made hereby to repute a Right to Pardon &amp; Glory, &amp;
our Imperfect Evangelical Obedience, to be an acceptable Righteousness,
&amp; the all of our Righteousness: all which are against the Gospel of the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of God, revealed to us in the Scriptures, as hath partly been disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

pag.</hi> 179. he hath these words. <hi>I have still acknowledged the Imputation of
Christ's Righteousness,</hi> sanosensu. And what found sense is, he tels us in a
parenthesis, <hi>that is</hi> (saith he) 1. <hi>per Donationem ejus fructus</hi> and 2. <hi>per adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicationem
justitiae nobis inde promeritae,</hi> that is to say, by giving us the fruits
thereof &amp; 2. by adjudging to us Righteousness, thereby purchased: which
two seem to me, to be but one, the <hi>last</hi> being comprehended in the <hi>first:</hi>
&amp; so all the Imputation by him granted, is only in respect of the fruits the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof,
which are given. And will not <hi>Papists, Socinians</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminians</hi> yeeld
unto this Imputation: Nay doth not <hi>Bellarmine</hi> come a further length, in

               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Catholick Theol. part 2. of Moral morks,</hi> giveth us here &amp;
there, while speaking of other things, without any apparent Connexion
(choosing this way rather, than to give us his whole sense of that matter, in
one place together, which might have been some' ease to such, as were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to know the same: but I know, he is at liberty to follow his own
wayes &amp; methods) some hints of his mind; and that rather of his dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
with the orthodox, and their manner of expressing their Thoughts
&amp; Conceptions, in this matter, than any full &amp; positive declaration of his
own Thoughts about the question. We shall, having seen &amp; examined his
own judgment, shortly here examine what he is pleased to say, in one pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
or other of that Book, so far as we can finde, &amp; may be done without repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,

Only we shall premit some few of his own words, in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to the
<hi>Premonition</hi> p. 2. whereby we may see, how small the difference would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be; &amp; how little cause he had to write so much against the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
as he doth. He there saith. [14. No man is saved or justified, but by
the <hi>Proper Merite</hi> of Christ's <hi>perfect obedience;</hi> Yea and His <hi>habitual holiness</hi>
&amp; <hi>Satisfactory Sufferings,</hi> advanced in dignity by His <hi>Divine Perfection:</hi> 15.
This Merite, as related to us, supposeth that Christ, as a <hi>Sponsor,</hi> was the
Second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Root of the justified, the Reconciling Mediator, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed
perfectly with that Intent, that by His obedience, we might be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
&amp; who suffered for our sins, in our room and stead; &amp; so was, <hi>in tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
our <hi>Vicarius poenae,</hi> as some phrase it, or <hi>Substitute,</hi> &amp; was made a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
for us, that we might be healed by his stripes; as He was Obedient, that
His Righteousness might be the reason, as a Meritorious Cause, of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
which Supposeth the relation of an <hi>Undertaking Redeemer in our
Nature,</hi> doing this, &amp; <hi>in our stead,</hi> so far forth, as that therefore, <hi>perfect
obedience</hi> should not be necessary to be performed by ourselves. And Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
therefore is Imputed to us, that is, we are truely reputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
because we, as beleeving members of Christ, have right to Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
&amp; life, as merited by His righteousness, &amp; freely given to all peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
beleevers. And Christ's own Righteousness may be said so far to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to us, as to be reckoned &amp; reputed the Meritorious cause of our Right
&amp; justification, as aforesaid.] One might think the difference now to be
little, or none; but all this is but Sutable to what is already examined,
and what might here further be animadverted upon, will occurre hereafter.</p>
               <p>He beginneth <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. n. 119. to speak against the Doctrine of Imputation,
taught by the Orthodox. I shall yeeld to him, that <hi>Christ's personal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Divine or Humane, Habitual active, or Passive, is not given to us, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
ours, truely and properly, in a Physical sense;</hi> as if the same were transfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

to be <hi>inherent in us,</hi> or <hi>done by us, in our own proper persons;</hi> or that in <hi>a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
Natural we did all these things ourselves, or that God judgeth us so to have done,</hi>
or <hi>that all the Benefites of Christ's Righteousness shall as fully and Immediatly be
ours, as if we bad been, &amp; done &amp; Suffered, merited and Satisfied, in and by
Christ.</hi> But we say, that Christ being a Surety, &amp; putting himself in our
Law-place, &amp; putting (as it were) His name in our Obligation, being
thereunto Substitute by, and accepted of the Father, His Satisfaction &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
being performed by Him, in our Law-place, as a Surety volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
taking on the obligation, is accounted, in Law and justice, to be ours,
who beleeve in Him, to all ends and uses, that is, in order to justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
pardon, and Right to Glory; and that, as effectually, as if we our
selves, in our own persons, had done and Suffered all. When Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:104357:116"/>
confoundeth and jumbleth these together, as if they were the same, he
neither befriendeth Truth, nor us.</p>
               <p>Nor will it follow from our assertion, (as he suppseth n. 123.) <hi>that then we
could need no Pardon:</hi> for though he, who is reputed to be Innocent, by ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
all the Law, in his own physical person, be reputed never to have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Omission, or Commission; &amp; consequently to need no pardon: yet
he, who is a transgressour, &amp; consequently hath forfeited all right to the
Reward, &amp; is obnoxious to the Penalty, hath need of a Remission, through
his Suretie's making Satisfaction; &amp; of a new Title to Glory, through his
Suretie's Obedience. So that the Non-necessity of Pardon will no more fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from our doctrine of Imputation, than from our doctrine of the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Christ, whatever <hi>Socinians</hi> think, who plead as vehemently from
free Remission against this, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth, upon the same ground,
against Imputation.</p>
               <p>But when any say, that Christ's Sacrifice satisfied for all our sins, that they
may be forgiven; &amp; His Righteousness is Impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed, that we may also be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
just, he thinketh, (n. 122.) that <hi>this is but either ambiguity; or the
fore-detected gross contradiction.</hi> And why so: <hi>for</hi> (saith he) <hi>if by justice,
they meane reputed sinlesness, or perfection, then these two cannot stand together;
for he that is supposed a</hi> sinner <hi>is supposed</hi> not sinless, <hi>or</hi> perfect; &amp; <hi>he that is
supposed</hi> sinless, <hi>cannot be supposed</hi> pardonable. <hi>Ans.</hi> By justice, or being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
just we mean Righteous, or <hi>rectus in curia,</hi> in order to the Reward
promised: and when full obedience is imputed to this end, we do not say,
that God reputeth such sinless, that is, such as, in their own physical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
gave perfect obedience; for such indeed need no pardon: but that
now God reputeth them such as are Righteous, and have Right to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
through the perfect Righteousness of Christ Imputed: and this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
no shew of Repugnancy to pardon of sins, through the Satisfaction of
Christ.</p>
               <p>But (n. 123.) he tels us, that some think to avoid the Contradiction by
distinguishing only of the <hi>moments of Nature,</hi> &amp; <hi>double respect of the same
Mans Actions,</hi> saying, that <hi>we are first in order of Nature supposed to be</hi> sinners
<hi>&amp;</hi> pardoned, <hi>&amp; then to be such, as moreover need the Reputation of</hi> Innocency,
<hi>or</hi> Righteousness, <hi>which is added to pardon.</hi> What necessity there is for this
curious distinguishing of Order &amp; Priority, whether in respect of <hi>Nature</hi>
or of <hi>Time,</hi> I do not yet see. And whether we say, we are first pardoned,
&amp; then reputed Righteous; or first reputed Righteous, &amp; then pardoned
(which would seem most rational of the two) it is all one to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
who equally argueth against both. But though I see no necessity of asserting
any of these orders (Save that though the first thing, that a wakened sinner
is pardon &amp; freedom from the Curse; Yet it is more rational to say,
the <hi>Reatus culpae</hi> first taken away, and not the <hi>Reatus poenae</hi>) yet I see a
necessity of asserting both the Imputation of Christ's Satisfaction, in order
to our pardon; &amp; of His Obedience, in order to our obtaining Right to
the Inheritance (and both these Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> comprehendeth in justification,
as we shall hear) or of both His Satisfaction and obedience, or of His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:104357:116"/>
Surety-righteousness, in order to our obtaining compleat justification,
&amp; its Effects, or consequents, Remission of sins &amp; Right to the Crown. But
saith Mr. <hi>Baxter 1. He that is pardoned of all sins of Omission &amp; Commission, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted</hi>
Innocent <hi>&amp;</hi> Righteous, <hi>as to</hi> any guilt of punishment, <hi>either</hi> of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
<hi>or</hi> loss. <hi>Ans.</hi> True he is accounted Innocent, or Righteous, as to guilt
of punishment of sense; yea or of loss, in so far as it is a punishment, or
belongeth to the punishment threatned. But he is not accounted Innocent,
that is, one that hath never sinned; or one that hath never lest right to the
reward: &amp; therefore beside this pardon, he must have a Righteousness, in
order to the Reward promised. He saith 2, <hi>He that is after accounted</hi> Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>&amp;</hi> just <hi>from his first being to that houre, is judged never to have needed Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
Ans.</hi> But by the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, there is no such
account made, as if the man were reputed, or accounted one, that never
sinned, from his first being to that hour; but that now hath as good right
to the Reward, as he could have had, if so be, he had never siuned, not
only from his first being to that hour, but from the first to the last moment
of being. We need not then notice what followeth, when he saith. <hi>And
so they make God come with an after act, and condemne His own foregoing act of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
&amp; injurie; or at least to contradict it, and in the first instant to say</hi> [I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
this sinner] <hi>&amp; in the second to say,</hi> [I now repute him one, that never
sinned, nor needed pardon] for, as we have seen, the Imputation of Christ's
Righteousness hath no such Import.</p>
               <p>He tels us (n. 125.) of some, that say, that the Law, since the fall,
obligeth us both to <hi>obey</hi> &amp; to <hi>suffer,</hi> &amp; not to one only; else a sinner, bound
to <hi>suffer,</hi> should not be bound to <hi>obey.</hi> Therefore Christ must do <hi>both</hi> for us.
And this would seem to be a very Innocent assertion, &amp; consonant to truth:
yet he saith, <hi>This is too gross for any man to utter, that ever know what Law or
Government is. Ans.</hi> And I had thought, that it had been too gross for any
Christian to have denied this, who would not outstripe all the <hi>Antinowians,</hi>
that ever were: for if it be thus, one of two must follow; either that now
after the fall, <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; all his posterity are loosed from all obligation to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Law of God; or that they are not under the curse. Neither
of which, I suppose Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> dar say: But, what saith he: <hi>do they mean,
that as to the same act &amp; time, the Law bindeth us to obey and suffer; or for diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
acts and Instants of time? Ans.</hi> In regard that, since the fall, nothing can
be done, in perfect conformity to the Law, both may be said. <hi>Do they mean</hi>
(saith he further) <hi>that the Law bound man both to</hi> perfection, <hi>&amp; to</hi> suffering
for perfection, <hi>or to</hi> suffering for sin? <hi>Ans.</hi> We are speaking of the Lawes
obligation now, since the fall: &amp; it is certaine, that because the Law is
now broken, we are obliged to suffer; &amp; that, because of that constitution,
<hi>do &amp; live,</hi> no man can have life, untill that Law be perfectly obeyed: but
because this is Impossible for man, therefore it must be done by his Surety.
He querieth againe, <hi>did the Law binde</hi> Adam, <hi>to obey &amp; suffer, before he sinned? Ans.</hi> No. <hi>Did it binde him</hi> (saith he againe) <hi>both to obey &amp; suffer for
his new sin, the next Instant? Ans.</hi> What himself addeth is a sufficient ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were
to this, <hi>viz.</hi> That it did binde him to suffer for his old sin (adde, &amp;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:104357:117"/>
also for his new sin) &amp; yet the obligation to obey for time to come remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But all this is beside the purpose; for the maine thing is not yet noticed
by Mr. <hi>Baxter viz.</hi> That <hi>Adam</hi> by his sin was obliged to suffer, &amp; that yet
there was no way for him to come to the promised Crown, but by perfect
obedience to that Law: &amp; that therefore neither he, or any of his posterity,
can enjoy life, untill their Surety fulfill that Law for them, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to do it: as they cannot be freed from Suffering, untill their Surety
suffer the penalty for them, or undertake to do it. We need not speak so
unaptly, as he supposeth we do, that is, say, <hi>that the Law commandeth
lapsed man, not to have sin, or imperfect man, to have been perfect;</hi> for we know,
that were to binde to an Impossibility in Nature; for sin existent cannot but
be existent. But this we say, That by vertue of that Law &amp; constitution,
there was no way for lapsed man, to enjoy the Reward-promised, but by
yeelding perfect obedience unto that Law; and as this was Impossible in
Nature; so was it impossible for lapsed man to enjoy the Reward, &amp; the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
the Lord provided a Surety, who should yeeld perfect obedience
unto that Law; &amp; this perfect Obedience is made over unto the Beleever,
&amp; put upon his score, as well as the Sureties Sufferings are. But saith he,
<hi>if Christ's perfect Obedience and holiness be imputed unto them from their first being,
then they are reputed</hi> not lapsed, <hi>nor</hi> sinners <hi>from the beginning, &amp; so</hi> not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable.
<hi>Ans.</hi> There is no necessity for such a Reputation; for this is not
the end of that Imputation: It is Imputed, in order to their obtaining a
Right to the Reward, which was lost; &amp; by vertue hereof, they do obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
the Reward, as certainly, as if they had never sinned.</p>
               <p>Others (he saith n. 126,) would come neerer the matter, &amp; say, that
we are reputed Righteous, as <hi>fulfillers of the Law;</hi> &amp; yet reputed sinners <hi>as
breakers of the Law:</hi> &amp; that though there be no <hi>medium</hi> in Naturals betwixt
light &amp; darkness, life &amp; death; yet there is betwixt a <hi>breaker of the Law</hi> &amp; a
<hi>fulfiller of it, viz. a Non-fulfiller;</hi> &amp; between <hi>just</hi> &amp; <hi>unjust,</hi> that is, <hi>not just.

to Time &amp; Subjects; yet they are really distinct, both as to their proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions,
their proxime Causes, &amp; proper Effects: &amp; in clearing of the
difference, as to their definitions, he tels us, that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>not just</hi> &amp; <hi>just; not just</hi> &amp; <hi>unjust; not unjust</hi> &amp; <hi>just:</hi> &amp; that

partly contrary; &amp; that <hi>not just,</hi> &amp; <hi>unjust;</hi> &amp; <hi>unjust</hi> &amp; <hi>just</hi> are diverse: as
also, that <hi>unjust</hi> &amp; <hi>just</hi> are not immediatly contrary; for there is <hi>Medium</hi>
betwixt them <hi>viz. Innocent,</hi> who is such an one, as is neither unjust, nor
yet just: and that though now these two do not differ, as to Subjects; yet
of old they did; for <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, before he fell, was innocent, but
was not just; for he was to obtaine this by perfect Obedience. Now. what
saith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to this?</p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>this is meer darkness.</hi> As it seemeth all things are, that agree
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:104357:117"/>
not to his Notions. But why? <hi>There is</hi> (saith he) <hi>a Medium negative in a
person, as not obliged, but none between positive &amp; private, in one obliged as
such, A stone is neither just, nor privatively unjust, nor a man about a thing
never commanded or for bidden him. But what is this to the matter? God's Law
is presupposed: we talk of nothing, but</hi> Moral Acts. <hi>The Law forbideddeth omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Commissions; both are sin. Ans.</hi> Though there be no medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
positive and privative, in a person obliged, as to particular acts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
or forbidden; yet there is a Medium, in such a person, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the <hi>Reatus poenae,</hi> &amp; <hi>meritum praemii.</hi> In reference to every moral
act, <hi>Adam</hi> was either just, or unjust, i. e. either one, that obeyed, or one
that transgressed; but in reference to the punishment threatned &amp; to the
Reward promised, before he fell, he was neither <hi>unjust,</hi> that is, one that
was a Transgressour, &amp; <hi>reus culpae &amp; poenae</hi> nor was he <hi>just,</hi> that is, one
that had purchased the Reward; but was in his way thereunto: &amp; himself
saith little less (as I judge) in his <hi>premonit p.</hi> 19. saying [3. But that Law
giving life eternal only to <hi>obedience to the end of his time of trial,</hi> he merited
not that life by <hi>Initial obedience.</hi> This was <hi>Initial Imperfect Righteousness,</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

unjust,</hi> as to the <hi>future yeers work;</hi> but as to what he was <hi>presently obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
unto,</hi> he was either <hi>Righteous,</hi> or <hi>a sinner.</hi>] Here upon the matter, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all I desire, or say. When a command is given to a person, to run so
many miles in an hour, &amp; a Reward is promised in case he do it, &amp; a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
threatned, in case he do it not; while he is running, as to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
acting, he is not disobedient, but obedient; &amp; so, in so far is <hi>just,</hi> &amp;
not <hi>unjust;</hi> yet in reference to the Reward, he cannot be called just, untill
he hath finished the course, in the time appointed. So <hi>Adam,</hi> while stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
though he sinned not, yet he had not merited the Reward. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
replieth 1. <hi>He merited what Reward he had, viz. the Continuance of his blessings
first freely given. Ans.</hi> That was not all the Reward, which was promised,
whereof we are speaking; for <hi>Adam</hi> was not yet <hi>in Patria:</hi> &amp; howbeit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was not clear, as to this, when he wrote his <hi>Aphorismes;</hi> yet afterward,
in his Book against Mr. <hi>Cartwright, pag.</hi> 19. he tels us, he became convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
hereof. 2. He raiseth dust to darken the aire by saying. <hi>That it is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved,
what that was, by which</hi> Adam <hi>must merite Immutability &amp; Glory:
whether 1. Once obeying or Consent to his full Covenant. 2. Or once loving God.
3. Or conquering once. 4. Or eating of the tree of life. 5. Or persevering in perfect
obedience to the end, that is, till God should translate him.</hi> But this dust falleth
to the ground, when he addeth. <hi>That this last is most likely.</hi> And indeed it
were much of his concernment, to prove, if he could, that all that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of <hi>Adam,</hi> by vertue of that Covenant, was only one single act of
obedience: for then his Notions about <hi>just</hi> &amp; <hi>unjust,</hi> as to <hi>Adam,</hi> would
have some ground: but till this be done, all he hath said is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th, as well as we, that Christ hath not only
satisfied for sin, &amp; merited pardon; but also merited immutable Glory. Ans.</hi>
But we say further, that He merited pardon &amp; Immutable glory, not by
His death &amp; sufferings only, but by His whole Surety-righteousness, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in Active &amp; Passive Obedience, whereby He paid our whole debt.
But he willeth us to <hi>consider. 1. That</hi> Adam's <hi>not doing that which was to merite
glory, was sin of Omission, and to pardon that Omission is to take him as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riter
of Glory. 2. Therefore it must be somewhat more, than he forfeited by that
Omission and his Commission, which cometh in by Christ's merite above forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
3. That Christ merited all this by his active, Passive &amp; habitual Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
by which he merited pardon. 4. That it was not we, that merited in Him,
but He to give it to us only, in the termes of a Law of Grace. Ans.</hi> (I) To par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
that Omission in <hi>Adam,</hi> was not to take him, as a Meriter of Glory;
but only to take him, as one that was free of the obligation to punishment
for that Omission. It is false then, to suppose or say, that one pardoned,
as such, is taken to be one that never sinned; for the contrary is manifest;
&amp; to take <hi>Adam,</hi> as a Meriter of Glory, is to take him for one, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sinned; yea, &amp; for one, that fulfilled his course of obedience; which
can never be supposed of a pardoned man, as such. (2) That by Christ's
Merites the Elect obtaine more, than what <hi>Adam</hi> forfeited (to speak so) I
shall easily grant; but notwithstanding thereof we stood in need of more,
than of meer forgiveness, even of a Right to what <hi>Adam</hi> lost the expectation
of; and in order to this, the Law was to be fulfilled (3) I yeeld the 3d.
(4) Though we need not say, that we Merited in Him, yet we say, That
Christ merited, as a Publick Person, representing His own, &amp; as a Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
and Surety, coming in their Law-place, and taking on their whole debt,
both as to punishment deserved, and Duty required. And I see no warrand
to say, that Christ only merited to give it to us, only on the termes of a Law
of Grace: for this would make Him no Sponsor, or Surety, nor to stand
in the room of any (which yet he granteth n. 130.) but only hold Him forth,
as a third unconcerned person, no wayes related to them; &amp; like a man
buying a Bond or Obligation from a Creditor, whereby he may be in case to
distress the debtor, and call for payment in his owne way and time. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby
the whole tenor of the Covenant of Redemption, between Jehovah &amp;
the Mediator, is altered; the Mediator's Place &amp; Relation to those, for
whom he died, is changed; His Righteousness of Active and Passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is made to have no necessary respect unto the old Covenant &amp; Man's
Obligation. He is supposed to have merited &amp; bought all for Himself im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly:
He is supposed to have died for all: &amp; that the New Covenant,
or Caw of Grace is wholly of Him. To none of all which, I can assent.</p>
               <p>He saith next (n. 127.) that some come neerer &amp; say, that <hi>to punish and
not reward are all one;</hi> &amp; so the respect, that sin hath to the <hi>deserved punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
needed <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> but <hi>our deserving the Reward</hi> needed
Christ's <hi>perfect obedience to be Imputed.</hi> What saith he to this? He granteth,
that there is some what of truth here; but (saith he) there are errors also
that lye in the way; and so he willeth us to remember 1. (without a 2. or 3.)
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:104357:118"/>
                  <hi>that man can have nothing from God, but what is</hi> a meer gift, <hi>as to the</hi> matter,
<hi>though it be a</hi> Reward, <hi>as to the</hi> Order <hi>&amp;</hi> Ends of Collation. <hi>Ans.</hi> True;
what then? <hi>And in this case</hi> (saith he) <hi>punishment is</hi> damni, <hi>as well as</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus;
<hi>&amp; so the loss of the Reward is the principal part of hell, or punishment, Ans.</hi>
That there is <hi>poena damni,</hi> as well as <hi>sensus,</hi> I grant; but I am sure, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
threatned to <hi>Adam,</hi> was more than the meer want of what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised;
otherwayes we must say, that <hi>Adam</hi> was punished before he fell;
because even while he stood, he had received the Reward promised; so that
<hi>poena damni</hi> is some other thing, than the meer want of the Reward; even
the want of that, which man had already in his possession, together with
the hopes of what was promised. The faithful, yet living, are not pof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>essed
of the Reward of Glory; yet it may not be said, that they have the
principal part of hell, being delivered there from. So that all this is but
loose Sophistrie from the word loss. What more? <hi>So that</hi> (saith he) <hi>if
Christ's death hath pardoned our sins of</hi> Omission, <hi>we are reputed to have done all
our duty. Ans.</hi> Passing the Impropriety of speach here, we say, that it is
manifestly false, as appeareth from what is said. <hi>And if so</hi> (saith he again)
<hi>we are reputed to have merited the Reward. And.</hi> This is also false, as is
shown. <hi>And if he pardon our sins</hi> (saith he more-over) <hi>as to all punishment
of</hi> sense <hi>&amp;</hi> loss, <hi>he pardoneth them, as to their forfeiture of heaven, at a</hi> gift, <hi>if
not as a</hi> Reward. <hi>And.</hi> Neither can this be granted; for there is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to the taking away of the forfeiture of heaven, if by this nothing else
be meaned, than a giving of a Right to heaven, whether as a <hi>Gift,</hi> or as a
<hi>Reward,</hi> than to the taking away of all punishment, whether of Sense, or
of Loss, as such: as for example, when a King covenanteth with his own
Servant, whom he hath already advanced to great honour &amp; dignity, and
promiseth him far greater honour, if he will work one day to end, in sueh
an Imployment; &amp; if not, threatneth to deprive him of all he hath, &amp; to
cast him in prison, untill he die: This servant faileth &amp; performeth not the
condition, and therby hath both forfeited what he was in hope of, and
what he had, and is now obnoxious to perpetual Imprisonment: when the
King's own Son goeth to prison for some time, to make Satisfaction, and
thereby deliver the Servant from perpetual Imprisonment, he doth not
thereby deliver him from his loss, so as to give him a right to the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
honour promised: though he deliver him from the punishment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Imprisonment: Yea it may be a doubt, if he thereby procure his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration
to his former state: but in order to this, and to the end, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
may get the Reward promised, beside his going so long to prison in the
servants room &amp; stead, that he may be delivered from the punishment, he
must also, in his room &amp; stead, performe that daies work.</p>
               <p>We say that Remission of sin is a consequent, or at most, but a part of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification;
because a man may be for-given, &amp; yet not reputed never to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
broken the Law. To put away guilt, and to make one Righteons, are
two things. This is most clear; yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith (n. 128.) <hi>Still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusim.</hi>
Which is wonderfull; where, I pray, must the confusion lye? Is
it in this, that we say, Remission of sin; is, at most, but part of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:104357:119"/>
Doth not himself say as much hereafter (n. 208.) when he saith, <hi>that
our first constitutive justification, is in its (own Nature, a right</hi> to Impunity,
&amp; to life, or glory? Now this <hi>Right to Impunity,</hi> is the same with Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
but a <hi>Right to life,</hi> or <hi>glory</hi> is something more. Is it in this, that we
say, a man may be forgiven, and yet not reputed one, who never broke
the Law? That, I am sure, can be no confusion and contradiction: for it
is a contradiction to say, that a man is pardoned, and yet reputed one, that
never broke the Law; for pardon is of a breach of the Law. What saith
he, to make out this alleiged Confusion? <hi>Guilt</hi> (saith he) <hi>is either of the</hi> fault,
<hi>as such, or of the</hi> punishment, <hi>&amp; of the</hi> fault <hi>only as the cause of</hi> punishment:
<hi>If all guilt, both</hi> culpae &amp; poenae, <hi>were done away, that person were reputed</hi>
positively righteous, <hi>that is, never to have</hi> omitted a duty, <hi>or</hi> committed a
sin.] <hi>Ans.</hi> But do we say, That pardon taketh away the <hi>Reatus culpae,</hi> in it
self? His own following words, may partly be our answer. <hi>But indeed</hi> (saith
he) <hi>when only the</hi> Reatus poenae (&amp; culpae quoad poenam) <hi>is done away, the</hi>
Reatus culpae in se <hi>remaineth. And this Christ himself never taketh away, no, not
in heaven, where for ever we shall be judged, once to have sinned, &amp; not to be
such, as never sinned.</hi> Where is now the Confusion Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> spoke of?
But yet, I suppose, he is in a mistake, when he saith, that the <hi>Reatus cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae</hi>
cannot be taken away; for it must be taken away, legally, or there shall
be no justification, though it can never be taken away Metaphysically; &amp;
the same may be said of the <hi>Reatus culpae</hi> it self, seing it will alwayes be
true, that they did once deserve punishment, &amp; are not such, as never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
punishment.</p>
               <p>He addeth (n. 129.) that, which to him, is the Core of our errour,
[That we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hink, we must be justified in Christ, by the <hi>Law of Innocency,</hi>
which justified Christ Himself: &amp; that we are quite, or washed simply from
all <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>fault</hi> as well as Obligation to Punishment.] But neither of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
do we say, as hath been frequently shown. We are justified by the Law
of Grace, &amp; by faith; yet we say with <hi>Paul,</hi> that the Law is not made
void by faith, but established: the Law of Innocency must be fulfilled, but it
is not fulfilled by us, but by Christ; &amp; His Righteousness is Imputed to us,
and received by faith; and we thereupon are justified, &amp; receive Remission,
and Right to Glory. We do not say. That <hi>Adam's</hi> Law meant, <hi>do this by
thyself, or by Christ, &amp; thou shalt live:</hi> yet we say, that that Constitution of
God, <hi>do this and live,</hi> must as well be established, as this; <hi>Cursed is every one,
that continueth not in all things written in the Law </hi> and that, as by vertue
of <hi>this</hi> Christ our Surety was to die the cursed death; so by vertue of <hi>that,</hi>
He was to fulfill all Righteousness.</p>
               <p>He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> next (n. 130.) that the truth, which we grope after, and must
reconcile us all, is as followeth.] As if all the Reformed divines almost had
been hither to but groping after the truth, like blinde men groping for the
wall; and he and possibly two or three moe, had their eyes opened to see
the truth. His discourse here is too long to be rehearsed, that it may be
examined; a few observes upon it may suffice. (1) He saith, <hi>Christ, in His
sufferings did stand in the room of sinners, as their Sponsor. Ans.</hi> Then His Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:104357:119"/>
to justice must, in due time, be reckoned on the score of such, in
whose room He suffered. Why will he not say this also of Christ's Obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce;
seing both were performed by Him, in His estate of Humiliation, &amp;
as the Surety of the Covenant? Was He not made under the Law, as well
as under the Curse? And was He not made of a woman, given and born to
us? But neither can we say, That Christ stood in the room of all sinners, as
he supposeth. (2) We saith. <hi>That Christ acquired a Right first to Himself of
giving out the purchased benefites, to sinners, by a new Law, viz. by what He
suffered &amp; did. Ans.</hi> This is denied, as not yet being confirmed; and it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth
His being a Sponsor and Surety, and saith, He was not born to us,
nor died for us; but to and for Himself, And yet I deny not, that Christ
hath gote all power, and is the General dispensator of the blessings of the
Covenant purchased. (3) He saith, <hi>Had Christ antecedently done all, that
He did</hi> in our person, <hi>&amp; we</hi> in Him, in Law sense, <hi>the thing its self, with its
inseparable consequents &amp; effects, had been all ours,</hi> ipso facto. <hi>Ans.</hi> There is
no necessity for this; seing Christ was not thereunto appointed by us, or
conjunctly obliged with us, in the first Covenant; but after we were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
did, of His own accord, put His Name in our Obligation, and came
in our Law-place, &amp; so was made sin for us, that we might be made the
Righteousness of God in Him. (4) He speaketh of <hi>these benefites being given
us, upon termes &amp; Conditions.</hi> But we shew before, and here-after will have
occasion to do it more fully, of what Nature, these termes and Conditions
were; and that they are not such, as He meaneth. (5) He saith. <hi>What is
given by the New Covenant, we have title to upon this account, because it was
purchased by the perfect</hi> merite &amp; sacrifice <hi>of Christ; &amp; so given us by Him, and
by the Father. Ans.</hi> According to Him, the Right, that is had thus, is but
remote &amp; common to all, even to such as perish; &amp; therefore can hardly
be called a Right; but the only Right is had, is by our performance of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
and Conditions: for he saith (n. 137.) that <hi>Glory is given as a Reward
for our beleeving, and performing the Conditions of the Covenant of</hi> Grace. (6) He
saith, <hi>we deserved punishment &amp; Christ was punished in our stead, that we might
be forgiven: we had forfeited life by sin, &amp; Christ merited life for us by His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Ans.</hi> And why will he not say, that Christ did this <hi>last,</hi> as well as
the <hi>first,</hi> in our stead, seing hereby the freedom of the Gift can no more be
weakened, than pardon by the other. What followeth hath been spoken
to already.</p>
               <p>He granteth (n. 132.) That <hi>not to punish,</hi> &amp; to <hi>reward</hi> are different: yet
he saith, <hi>not to have the Gift is to be punished; &amp; so,</hi> non-donari <hi>here is</hi> puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri
materially: &amp; that <hi>it is the same Righteousness of Christ, which meriteth our
Impunity,</hi> quoad damnum &amp; sensum, <hi>&amp; which Meriteth our Right to the Gift
of life, both</hi> sub ratione doni, <hi>as a Gift,</hi> &amp; sub ratione Condonations, <hi>as
a forgiveness of the forfeiture, &amp; of the</hi> poena damni: And then addeth, <hi>That
so there is here no room for the conceite, that Christ's Death was only to purchase par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
&amp; His Righteousness: to merite life</hi>] <hi>Ans.</hi> We have said before, that we
need not be so curious here in distinguishing, if both be granted to make up
a Compleat Righteousness, to purchase both, we have all we desire: and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:104357:120"/>
from what hath been said formerly, it is manifest, that both are requisite;
&amp; Mr. <hi>Baxtor</hi> granted as much before, as we see in the foregoing paragraph
<hi>Note</hi> 6. Nor saith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> any thing here, to invalidate what we have
said. Sure, not to have this Gift was no punishment to <hi>Adam,</hi> before he
sinned, what-ever it might be said to be after his sin. Nor is forfeiture of
that properly, which a Man never had, neither in Right, nor in possession:
And therefore <hi>Adam</hi> could not be said properly (nor we in him) to have
forfeited glory; but only that blessedness and felicity, wherein he was
created, and that Righteousness, that was concreated: So that beside the
taking away of this forfeiture, there will be a Righteousness of Obedience
requisite, according to that Constitution, <hi>do this &amp; live,</hi> in order to the
obtaining of a Right for us unto the life of Glory. And to this he assenteth
in end, when he saith, <hi>That the same Merites of Christ's Active &amp; Passive &amp;
Habitual Righteousness, do causo our Glory.</hi> For we do not separat them: Nor
need we curiously enquire, whether Christ's Suffering were first Satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
&amp; then Meritorious; &amp; His Obedience first Meritorious, and then
Satisfactory, as he speaketh: it being sufficient to us, that both made up a
compleat Righteousness performed for us, by Him, as our Surety, coming
in our Law-place, whereby justice was satisfied, and life merited. Nor
need I say (as he supposeth n. 135. too many hold) That heaven is our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
for our perfection of Holiness and Obedience in and Christ; more
than that pardon is our Reward for our Satisfaction in &amp; by Christ. Yet as
Christ satisfied as a Sponsor, in the stead &amp; room of sinners, as he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
so it may be said, that Christ obeyed, as a Sponsor, in their room &amp;
stead: &amp; that as the one was requisite for purchase of pardon; so the other
was requisite for purchase of Glory: and that as we must be Interessed in
the one, imputed to us &amp; received by faith, to the end we may be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
so we must be Interessed in the other imputed to us, and received by
faith (both being Integral parts of one compleat Surety-righteousness) to
the end, we may have a Right to Glory. Nor can I say with him (<hi>Ibid.</hi>)
<hi>That eternal life is ours, by Christ's free Gift as a Reward to Christ, for His own
Merites:</hi> for then, we could not say, that Christ suffered properly in the
roome of any, as their Sponsor; and this would take away that fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
relation betwixt Christ &amp; the Chosen ones, that were given to Him of
the Father; and for whose sake He sanctified Himself &amp; was made a Curse,
&amp; made under the Law, and became the Father's Servant, and was made a

               <p>He tels us (n. 141.) <hi>That Christ's Righteousness is made ours, as our sinnes
were made his.</hi> Which is all that we desire. We grant that Christ never had
the <hi>Reatum culpae,</hi> in it self: &amp; he saith, <hi>that sin was Imputed to Him, as to
the punishment deserved, that is, He assumed the Reatum poenae.</hi> But sure, the
<hi>Reatus poenae,</hi> being a dueness of punishment, because of sin, He could not
come under this Obligation, unless the <hi>Reatus culpae</hi> had been Imputed to
Him, not in it self physically, but juridically, <hi>in ordine ad poenam.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
we must have the Righteousness of Christ, in order to its Effects;
and this is more, than to have the meer Effects themselves, as he saith: &amp;
we shall grant to him, that we have it not, <hi>in the relation of a Meritorious cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
to all uses;</hi> if he will grant to us, that we have it, in the relation of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
Cause, to those uses, which God accepted it for; &amp; hath assigned
to it in the Gospel; as he seemeth to grant <hi>ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though we do not assert such an Imputation, as he calleth the rigide sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
thereof (n. 142.) whereby God is supposed to repute us to have done that
in &amp; by Christ, which we never did by Him: yet we see no reason, why
we may not say, that God judged Christ, to be the publick legal person: yea
himself in the <hi>appendix</hi> to his <hi>Premonition,</hi> yeeldeth that Christ may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
our <hi>Vicarius poenae,</hi> or Substitute; And when we say, He is a Publick le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
person, we say not, that He is as many persons, as there be redeemed
sinners in the world, as <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> speaketh; but that He was such a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
legal person, as did represent in Law all that were given to Him, as
their publick Head &amp; Surety. And what he saith (n. 143.) of the various
sorts of Sureties (some of which are very Impertinent, as the 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

calleth an Agent a Surety; &amp; the 5. for no man calleth a pay-master, who
is the debtors Instrument, servant, or delegat, a Surety) doth not much
help him, seing there are no such Sureties among Men, nor no manner of
Suretyship, that can quadrat with Christ's Suretiship, in all things: and
therefore it is to no purpose to say, Christ is not such a Surety, as is among
men, in this, or that, or in the other respect, therefore He is no Surety
at all. He is such a Surety, as is not in all things like Sureties among men;
&amp; yet in some things, every sort of Surety among men, may carry some
resemblance to Him. See for this Mr. <hi>Gillespie's</hi> late piece on the <hi>Covenant
of Redemption;</hi> where the Reader will finde much Satisfaction in this
matter.</p>
               <p>I finde no more spoken to the Doctrine of Imputation, in this place, by
M. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that calleth for any particular Notice: for we say not, as He
hinteth <hi>ibid.</hi> that Christ was our Instrument, or Delegate: yet we may
say, He was our Surety, that did all in our legal person: for He did substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

that those of his minde do use <hi>viz. If we had fulfilled all the Law repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively
by Christ, as our legal person, we could not be bound to further Obedience
to it.</hi> This is founded (if it be directed against the Orthodox, &amp; not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against the <hi>Antinomians</hi>) upon the mistake of the true meaning of these
words, <hi>as our legal person</hi> &amp; <hi>Reputatively.</hi> When we speak of Christ's being
our legal person, we mean His becoming our Surety, and putting His name
in our Bond, and satisfying the Law, as our Surety, in our room &amp; stead:
and that therefore, all His own, being now united to Him by faith, are
dealt with, as if they had fulfilled the Law themselves; Christ's fulfilling of
it, being now imputed to them, and received by faith, unto the ends, for
which it was ordained; that is, to be accounted theirs, and reckoned on

the Reward: but, among other ends, to declare our Thankfulness unto
God, &amp; to set forth His Glory. What saith he to this answere?</p>
               <p>He judgeth it to be a yeelding of the Cause, &amp; ignorantly to destroy our
own, for 7 or 8 reasons. 1. <hi>This is to say, that when a Man is reputed to have
fulfilled all the Law; yet it is to be reputed unfulfilled, as to certain ends; as if he
fulfilled all the Law, that fulfilled it not to all due ends. Ans.</hi> This is, as if
one should reason from our saying, that Christ bore the whole Curse, and
yet beleevers are not freed from Fatherly chastisements; that this is to say,
That he bore all the Curse, that did not bear it under all Considerations, &amp;
as to all effects, that might passe under other Considerations, &amp; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
be endured for other ends &amp; Advantages. (2) Beleevers are reputed in
Christ to have fulfilled the Law, in order to the obtaining of the Crown;
and in reference to that, to have fulfilled the Law to all due ends, but not
to have done it in themselves, or in their own Natural persons. Nor is the
fulfilling of it by their Surety imputed to them, to exeem them from under
the Authority of God &amp; of His Law; far less particularly to exeem them,
from testifying their Love &amp; Gratitude, by endeavouring after Obedience
to the Law, upon Gospel-Principles, &amp; Grounds, &amp; upon Gospel-motives,
&amp; for Gospel-ends.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Or</hi> (saith he) <hi>as if the Law obliged one man to fulfill it twice over, for the
same lefes time; once simply, &amp; in all its obligations, &amp; another time for other
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:104357:121"/>
ends. Ans.</hi> This is denied; neither followeth it from what we say. Becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
we cannot fulfill the Law once, to which we were obliged; there-for
must Christ fulfill it for us, to the end we may enjoy the promised Reward:
And His fulfilling of it for this end, doth not make us Law-less, far less
exeem us from Obedience for other Gospel ends, to which <hi>Adam</hi> in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
was not obliged. <hi>Or</hi> 3 (saith he) <hi>as if the Law required any more than
absolute perfection, Ans.</hi> We do not say, that it doth: But all our Obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
with all the superaddition of new ends, is most Imperfect. 4. <hi>Or</hi>
(saith he) <hi>that absolute perfection had not been in Christ's holy Obedience. Ans.</hi>
Neither doth this follow-from what we say, more than from what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
saith; Yea not so much: for he maketh our Gospel-Obedience, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Righteousness, which we may lean to, &amp; plead for our justification &amp;
Salvation upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or</hi> 5. (saith he) <hi>as if there were any Obedience, whose end is not Righteousness
&amp; justification, against the charge of the contrary disobedience. Ans.</hi> This is but
vanity, for neither is it denied, nor is it any thing to the point; because the
Righteousness spoken of is a perfect Righteousness, answerable to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of works, as the condition of life: And who ever performe Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
with such an eye &amp; designe, &amp; for such an end, shall in end meet
with a sad disappointment, be their diligence &amp; attainments what they will.
6. (saith he) <hi>And is not gratitude an end, &amp; a thing commanded by the Law?
If we obeyed perfectly in Christ, we were perfectly thankful in Christ. Ans.</hi> It will
only follow, that we were perfectly thankful in Christ, in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of the reward; but not so, as if we in our own persons, were no more
obliged to endeavoure thankfulness.</p>
               <p>7. (saith he) <hi>But if they say, That Christ fulfilled the Law only made to
Adam for us, &amp; not his own Law of Grace, &amp; therefore, that he obeyed for us
only to the ends of that Law.</hi> Sure this is the thing that himself will say, or he
must say, that Christ fulfilled no Law for us, in our stead. But what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
he? <hi>If the ends</hi> (saith he) <hi>&amp; matter of that Law be fulfilled by us in
Him, our Obedience to any other must be needless; for he that is supposed never to
have sinned, needeth not use any meanes for pardon or remedie. Ans.</hi> We say not,
That the Law was fulfilled by us, in Him; but that He fulfilled the Law, as
a Surety, willingly putting His Name in our obligation, &amp; undertaking our
debt: And from the Imputation of this to us, it will never follow, that
we are thereby, or can be, supposed never to have sinned. What next?
<hi>By this rule</hi> (saith he) <hi>Christ only fulfilled the Law for</hi> Adam <hi>&amp;</hi> Eve; <hi>&amp; for
us only as we were in them, which is only virtually, &amp; not actually at all, but not
at all for us, according to any obligation, that ever fell upon our persons.</hi> How
proveth he this? <hi>For</hi> 1. (saith he) <hi>we were never personally bound to perfect,
personal, perpetual Obedience, as the Condition of life for that Covenant, as to
the promise &amp; condition, ceased before any man was born. Ans.</hi> That Covenant,
I grant, ceased to be the way to life, as it was to <hi>Adam</hi> at first; because it
became a thing impossible; yet, as <hi>Adam</hi> fell under the Curse of that
broken Covenant, so did all his posterity fall with him &amp; in him: hence
when his posterity come to be existent persons, they are Children of wrath,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:104357:122"/>
&amp; are under the Curse of that Covenant; and all their Actions, afterward
committed, are further sins &amp; violations of that Covenant: for we may not
think, that <hi>Adam,</hi> after his first sin, was not in case to violat that Covenant
any more: And though before any man was born, the new Covenant, or
Gospel was promulgat; yet, notwithstanding thereof, all men were born
under the Curse of the first Covenant, and were never delivered from under
that, untill they closed with the termes of the second Covenant, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace. But he saith 2. <hi>All the duty in the world, which we are bound unto,
is to be done for Euangelical ends, for recovery, grace &amp; unto gratitude. Ans.</hi> And
was not <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall also bound unto gratitude? But he possibly mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
gratitude for Redemption, yet he hath proved, that all the world,
Heathens, I meane, &amp; such as never heard of the Gospel, are obliged to
Gratitude, upon the account of Redemption: or that all, that is required
of them, is to be done for Gospel ends. But in all this, I am little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who see no necessity of restricking Christ's obedience so.</p>
               <p>8. He saith. That we see not, that our own answere implieth the truth,
of what he and others assert; and is the same which they give but our cause
is uncapable of. What then saith he &amp; his? <hi>We say</hi> (saith he) <hi>that Christ
did indeed most perfectly obey the Law</hi> of Innocency, <hi>so far for us, &amp; in our stead
(though not in our persons) as doing that, which we should have done &amp; did not;
&amp; hath merited for us a better Covenant, which obligeth us not at all to obey for the
ends of the first Covenant viz. that our perfection might be our Righteousness, or
the Condition of life; but only to obey for the ends of the New Covenant, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
&amp; improving of recovering grace</hi> &amp; <hi>Salvation by Christ freely given us,
which we ourselves must do, or perish. Ans.</hi> (1) If Christ obeyed for us, and
in our stead, I see not, why he may not be said to do it, as our Surety, and
so in our Law-person, seing, according to our Common discourse, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety
&amp; Principal debtor are one person in Law. But about ambiguous ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
we need not debate. It is of greater moment to differ, as to this,
that he thinketh the <hi>us</hi> compr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hendeth all persons, Elect &amp; Reprobat. (2)
That Christ did merite the New Covenant, is no where said in Scriptur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; &amp;
yet this is all, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here mentioneth, as merited by Him. (3)
I think, he is as much concerned, as we are, to loose his own difficulties,
formerly proposed: for. 1. How can He be said, to have fulfilled all the
Law for us, that did not fulfill it to all due ends? 2. Can the Law require
more than absolute perfection? 3. Was not absolute perfection in Christ's
holy Obedience? 4. Is not gratitude an end required in the Law of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?
5. If Christ fulfilled only the Law of Innocency, did he not fulfill the
Law for <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eve</hi> only, or for us, as in them &amp;c. Let him answere the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
himself, and he shall help us.</p>
               <p>Next (n. 190.) he bringeth some in saying. That we may as wel say, that
man must not die, because Christ died for us; as not obey because Christ ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed
for us, &amp; then tels us, that <hi>we strangely use their reason against ourselves,
&amp; know it not.</hi> But what if this be his mistake? Let us hear his reason. <hi>For
we say</hi> (saith he) <hi>that we must die, because we did not perfectly either</hi> obey <hi>the
Law, or</hi> suffer <hi>all its penalty, by Christ, as our</hi> legal person; <hi>but he suffered
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:104357:122"/>
only to satisfie justico in</hi> tantum, <hi>to this end, that man himself suffering death
&amp; temporal afflictions, &amp; obeying the Law of grace, might be saved from all the
rest of the punishment. But if we had so fulfilled the Law, as afore said, by</hi>
doing <hi>or</hi> suffering, <hi>we could not have died, or suffered the least affliction, as a</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty;
<hi>for all</hi> punishment, <hi>in the essence of the relation is</hi> for sin. <hi>Ans.</hi> Though
I had rather say, That Christ Suffered &amp; Obeyed for His own, &amp; in their
stead, as their Surety, willingly undertaking the debt, that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
than that we Suffered &amp; Obeyed in Him: yet it may be, they who
speak so, are far from that meaning, that <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> putteth on their
words: &amp; when they call Christ our <hi>legal person,</hi> they mean no more, than
that he was a Surety, or a publick Person. (2) Though he suffered not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
His own from temporal death; yeth he did bear the Curse, &amp; satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Vindictive justice, and left nothing of that for them to suffer: &amp; what
chastisements they meet with, yea &amp; death it self is made to work together
for their good.</p>
               <p>He bringeth them in againe (n. 190.) saying. It is more Inconvenient to
say, that Christ was perfect in our person, than that He satisfied in our pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
&amp; we by Him] And here possibly the same mistake is but continued.
But, as he taketh it up, he thinketh that <hi>hereby the Gospel is subverted. Ans.</hi>
The whole dependeth upon the Explication of these words, <hi>in our person. Mr.
Baxter</hi> thinketh that these words, <hi>in our person in a Law sense,</hi> import, that
we payed all in Christ, as a man payeth a Summe of Money by his servant,
whom he sendeth to carry it; or some such thing. And if this be not their
meaning, who use this expression; all this outcry is to no purpose; and is
only a fighting against his own imagination, &amp; a meer striving about words:
yet he granteth, that we may fitly say, <hi>that Christ suffered</hi> in the <hi>person of a
sinner;</hi> but he bids us mark the sense, saying 1. <hi>Suffering as</hi> penal <hi>belongeth to
a sinner as such; but</hi> Satisfaction <hi>is an effect of Christ's Suffering, which resulteth
not from the</hi> meer suffering, <hi>nor from the</hi> person of a sinner; <hi>but from the will
&amp;</hi> Covenant of God, <hi>made to that excellent person, who was God &amp; perfect man,</hi>
Well, what next? 2. <hi>Note</hi> 2. (saith he) <hi>that it is not any other mans person,
that we mean, that Christ suffered in, but His own. Ans.</hi> And no man ever
dreamed, that He either did, or could suffer, in any other man's physical
person. But seing He was made sin for us, &amp; so died in our room &amp; stead,
why may He not be said to have died in our Law-person? If a pledge, or
hostage, suffer for those he standeth for, may not he be said to suffer in their
Law-person? If a Surety be put in prison for the debtor, may he not be said
to suffer in the debtor's Law-place, &amp; in his person in Law-sense? He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.
<hi>And we mean that He took upon Him the person of a sinner; in as much as He
consented to suffer for sin. Ans.</hi> This is good, &amp; we accept of it cheerfully
<hi>in tantum,</hi> for it explaineth to us, in part, the meaning of these words,
<hi>He made Him sin for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And so</hi> (he addeth) personating <hi>here is not meant</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing
any other mans person in Law-seuse; <hi>so as that other legally suffered
what he did; but it is only</hi> his own persons becoming a sufferer, <hi>in the stead of
sinners, for their sins. As the Apostle saith.</hi> He was made sin for us; <hi>that is,
so far by Imputation, as that he undertook to suffer what sinners suffer, &amp; for their
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:104357:123"/>
sins. Ans.</hi> But when Christ came in the Law-place of sinners, &amp; did substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
Himself, in their room, &amp; suffered what they were obliged to suffer;
sure, He took on their person, in a Lawsense, &amp; they, for whom He suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
can be said, in His, &amp; in His Fathers designe, so far legally to
have suffered, what He suffered, as never to be made to suffer the same
themselves.</p>
               <p>But he seeth, that this is but a wordy Controversie; &amp; therefore to free
the matter of ambiguity of words, he (<hi>pag.</hi> 77.) addeth several things, as
1. <hi>That as we hold, that</hi> Adam <hi>was the Natural Root or parent of Mankind; so
also that Christ was the</hi> foederal <hi>root of all the saved, &amp; in several respects (though
not all) a second</hi> Adam. <hi>Ans.</hi> We hold, that <hi>Adam</hi> was not only the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Root, but he was also the federal Root of all mankinde: for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
was made with him, and with all his posterity in him: and hence it
was, that all sinned in him, &amp; fell with him, in his first transgression. <hi>Rom.</hi>
5: 12. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15: 20, 21.</p>
               <p>He addeth. 2. Adam <hi>was but one single Natural person, nor did God (by
err<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur, or arbitrary reputation) esteem or account Him to be any other, than he was.
None of our persons were distinct persons in</hi> Adam, <hi>nor those persons, that now they
are. Therefore we were not so personally in him, at his fall. But all our persons
are in time &amp; mediatly by our progenitors derived lineally from him, not as having
been persons existent in him, but being persons caused remotely by him. Ans. Adam,</hi>
it is true, was but one single Natural person, in a physical sense; yet in a
Law-sense, as he was constitute the federal Head &amp; Root, we were all that
<hi>one Adam,</hi> or he was us all, representing all; &amp; so did God esteem, or account
him, not by errour, but by a Right Reputation, founded on His own Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
(2) None of our physical persons were distinct persons in him, yet our
legal persons were in him, when he represented us all, as a federal Head.
(3) We know, that our physical persons were only seminally, or virtually in
him; &amp; we grant also, that to be only virtually in <hi>Adam</hi> is <hi>terminus dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuens,</hi> as to personal inexistence; but I know not, how we could be perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in-existent in him, even when existent in a physical sense. But all this
taketh not away that federal inexistence, whereby, in a Law-sense, we we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
in him, as our federal Head &amp; Root. But, it seemeth, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
doth not acknowledge this, because he maketh our Natural relation to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
to be the only reason of out partaking of his sin. We do not deny our
Natural Interest in <hi>Adam,</hi> but we superadde to it this federal Interest. He
saith. <hi>It is our Natural relation to</hi> Adam, <hi>supposed in God's Law, which is
the reason of our participation in his sin &amp; not any will or judgment of God, without
or beyond our Natural Interest; for else it should be God, most properly, who by His
arbitrary Imputation, should either make us sinners, or repute us such, when we
are none. Ans.</hi> I have granted, that we have a Natural relation to <hi>Adam,</hi>
but I adde, that that is not the sole ground or reason of our participation in
his sin; but the federal relation, with the Natural relation. And hence it
doth no way follow, that God doth properly make us sinners, or repute us
such, when we are not, by His arbitrary Imputation: for this Imputation,
being founded upon this double preconstituted relation, cannot be called
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:104357:123"/>
meerly arbitrary; nay, nor could it be so called, though it were said to be
solely founded upon this federal relation, more than when it is said to be
grounded upon the Natural relation. Though in another sense, it might
be so called as well, when said to be founded on the Natural, as when said
to be founded on the federal Relation, God being the free Author &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutor
of both.</p>
               <p>3. He addeth. <hi>So Christ is, though not the Natural, yet the federal Adam
&amp; Root of Beleevers: When he satisfied &amp; merited, we were not in Him, either as
in</hi> Adam <hi>seminally, as in a Natural Generator, nor as existent persons; nor did
God falsly so repute us to be. But He was then the Cause (materially) or had
that</hi> virtus effectiva, <hi>which would justifie &amp; Sanctifie &amp; Glorifie us in due time.
Ans.</hi> Christ, it is true, is no Natural; but a federal Root; &amp; so keepeth
Correspondence with the first <hi>Adam,</hi> a federal Root. (2) It is true also, we
were not in Christ, when He satisfied, as in <hi>Adam,</hi> seminally, as in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Generator: but yet the Elect were in Him, in a more noble &amp; super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
manner, as given of God to Him, &amp; as undertaken for by Him,
when He did substitute Himself in their Law-place, &amp; became their Surety.
(3) If Christ had only been the material cause, as having that <hi>virtus effectiva,</hi>
how could He be called their federal Head? or how could they be said to be
chosen in Him, before the foundation of the world? <hi>It was the nature of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
(saith he) <hi>though not a sinful Nature, which He assumed: But that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which He undertook, was existent in His Individual person, &amp; no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
person was existent in His existent personal Nature.</hi> What then? <hi>So
that</hi> (he addeth) <hi>when we say it was the common Nature of Man, we mean only</hi>
specificè<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>that Nature which is of the same</hi> species <hi>with all other mens, but not
that which existed individually, in any, but himself. Ans.</hi> Notwithstanding
of all this, Christ was a federal Head, &amp; a Publick Person, undertaking
for, and therein representing all those, that were given to Him to save;
and this his following words confirme, when he saith. <hi>But it was indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
persons, in whose stead, or place Christ suffered, &amp; whom He undertook to
justifie, sanctify &amp; save, &amp; gather into an holy Society to that end; &amp; to that end,
He undertook &amp; performed His office, &amp; merited all this by His perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
so that hereby He made Himself a federal Head &amp; Root of an holy society (His
Church) &amp; when ever any person doth beleeve, &amp; is united federally to Him, he
then receiveth the effects of that, which was before in Christ, as</hi> a virtus effectiva.
<hi>Ans.</hi> But Christ, being a federal Head to His own, whom in due time, He
was to bring in to an holy Society, beleevers receive the effects of that,
which was in Christ, as such a federal Head; which is more, than as a <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
effectiva,</hi> &amp; Importeth His Obligation, as a Surety, to work these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
&amp; speaketh out His representing of them, as a publick Person, and
paying their debt, according to His Undertaking, in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
               <p>Thereafter (<hi>pag.</hi> 78.) from this, That the Law made to <hi>Adam</hi> did not
assigne Christ to this office, nor oblige Him to suffer for sinners, according
to it, &amp; that therefore He suffered not by that obligation, which bound us
to suffer, but by the obligation of His own consent, he inferreth, <hi>that the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:104357:124"/>
Law of works took not Christ for the Civil, or legal person of Beleevers, more than
it made Him such. Ans.</hi> But this consequence is denied; for when a debtor
is lying in prison, a friend, who was not formerly obliged, undertaking to
satisfie the Creditor &amp; making satisfaction, is by Law taken for the legal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the debtor, who is accordingly dealt with, as if he himself had satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Creditor.</p>
               <p>In the 4, 5. &amp; 6. places, he tels us, <hi>That beleevers, receiving Christ Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
receive title to His Grace, Spirit &amp; Glory, &amp; are personally &amp; actually His
Subjects &amp;c, and have a right to all His conferred benefites; which right followeth
not Immediatly to them from what Christ did, or suffered, but from the Covenant of
grace; &amp; therefore they have no right before the time, nor any, but on the Conditions
specified in the Covenant. Ans.</hi> (1) Though they have no full, compleat, actual
right, untill such time, as is condescended upon; yet by vertue of the compact
betwixt Jehovah &amp; the Mediator, wherein the Mediator undertook particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
for those given unto Him, these may be said to have a real fundamental
right, though that right be not subjected in them, nor pleadable by them,
before the time appointed; yet a Right, or something equivalent (for I
will not strive about words) must necessarily flow from Christ's Satisfying
for them, and paying their debt, according to His Undertaking. As, when
it is contracted, that the Eldest daughter of the marriage shall have such a
summe of money, when she cometh to be married, or to be of such an age,
that daughter hath another right unto that summe, than any other daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath, &amp; that fundamentally from the contract &amp; Agreement, though
before the time designed, her right be not such, as she can plead it in Law,
in order to the possessing of the summe (2.) Therefore the right, that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
have, floweth from the Compact, &amp; Christ's Suffering according to
compact, though it be conveyed by the Covenant of Grace, &amp; their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the Benefites be immediatly therefrom; as that daughters right to
the summe is properly from the contract, though her actual possession ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the contract, be from her Marriage, or coming to that age.
Though beleevers right to the actual possession of the benefites be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed;
&amp; as to the conveyance, some be granted absolutly, as faith (as
himself will confess) some upon condition of faith, that is, in that order,
&amp; according to that Methode, that faith shall preceed: Yet, in respect of
God, their right to all is absolutly purchased by Christ; &amp; so in a sense
theirs, though not subjected in them, nor pleadable by them, till the time
appointed come. This whole scheme of Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> seemeth to me to be
founded upon, and to flow from his Notion of Universal Redemption, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby
he will have Christ to have died in the room &amp; stead of all; which (to
me) is in the room &amp; place of none; &amp; to have purchased the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
a Common good to all, whereby all that would performe the New
Conditions, should have right to the benefites, as having obtained the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
by their performance of these proper Conditions; anteriour to which,
there was no difference at all betwixt them &amp; others; but this Scheme and
the ground thereof I cannot owne.</p>
               <p>7. He tels us, <hi>that as none, till he was a person, could be a person guilty of</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:104357:124"/>
Adam's <hi>sin, nor when he was a person any sooner, than he was also guilty of his
own inherent pravity, &amp; none that had the use of reason was guilty of either, or
both these only, without the guilt of his own actual sin. So none till he be a beleever
is related, as a member of a</hi> perfectly Righteous Saviour; <hi>&amp; that is done no
sooner (in time) then he hath the inherent righteousness of his</hi> personal faith <hi>&amp;</hi> fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral
consent, <hi>&amp; that obligeth him to the further active Righteousness of a holy
life. Ans.</hi> The <hi>Protas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> seem not to agree, for as upon our perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
existence, we become persons guilty of <hi>Adam's</hi> sin, &amp; that before (as
to nature, though not as to time) we have inherent pravity; because this
is an Effect, Consequent &amp; Punishment of the former: so upon our faith,
which is our personal existing grace, corresponding to our personal existing
in Nature, by our Natural being, should follow, as answering to this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of <hi>Adam's</hi> guilt, the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness: but in
stead of this, he mentioneth nothing, but <hi>a Relation as a member of a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Saviour;</hi> which (according to the comparison) should correspond to
our relation to <hi>Adam,</hi> which is, in nature, before our partaking of his sin.
(2) As answering to our inherent pravity, he should have named our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
Adoption &amp;c. as the effects of the Imputation of Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ess;
in stead of this, he nameth the <hi>Inherent righteousness of our personal faith
&amp; federal consent;</hi> thereby Importing that this federal consent is posteriour
to our Relation; while as I suppose, he will say, that our Relation is upon
the condition of our federal consent: Not to mention here his errour (here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
discovered) of making faith to be considered here, as our personal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
Righteousness. Then he tels us. <hi>That all these three conjunct (though
not coordinat) make up the total Righteousness of a Saint. viz. 1. our Relation to
Christ, in Union, as to a perfectly Righteous Head, who fulfilled all Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for us, to merite our justification (which is called Christ's Righteousness im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to us, as being thus far reputed ours) 2. our penitent beleeving consent to
his Covenant, which is the condition of the foresaid relation to Christ. 3. And our
Sanctification. Ans.</hi> (1) Here we see, that Righteousness made the <hi>second</hi>
Righteousness, which yet is the condition of the <hi>first;</hi> as if our Inherent
pravity were the condition of the Imputation of <hi>Adam's</hi> sin to us (2) our
Relation to Christ is not one &amp; the same with the Imputation of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to us; no more than our relation to <hi>Adam</hi> is the same thing with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of his sin to us. (3) Thus we see, by asserting the cause, <hi>viz.</hi> our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to Christ, he taketh away the effect <hi>viz.</hi> the Imputation of His Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
as being no distinct thing: as if one should say, we are related to
<hi>Adam,</hi> a sinful Head, who broke the Law for us; &amp; this is called <hi>Adam's</hi>
sin imputed to us, as being thus far reputed ours. But yet Christ's fulfilling
all Righteousness for us (if that <hi>for us,</hi> were understood in the Scripture
sense, and not according to the <hi>Socinian,</hi> or <hi>Arminian</hi> gloss) would abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ground the Imputation, we plead for, and that as a fruit of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to Christ. Passing what he saith 8, as not worth the noticeing.</p>
               <p>We come to see, what he saith 9. &amp; lastly. Proposing this objection to
himself, if Christ's person be given us, then His personal Righteousness is
given us with it. He replieth thus. <hi>Yes, as His person is; He is not given us
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:104357:125"/>
as proprietors &amp; Lords, to become our own, at our dispose; nor is his person made one
Person with each, or any of us. His person is not turned into ours, nor ours into
his. Ans.</hi> This is all to no purpose; for no man, in his wits, either said
so, or dreamed so, at any time. <hi>As the husband</hi> (saith he) <hi>is not the person
of the wife, nor the King of each Subject: but as one, that hath a Great, wise,
learned, Bountiful, Holy King or Husband, hath also his Greatness &amp;c. as they
have him, that is, as his perfections for their good, as far as his relation bindes
him; but not as if his enduements were removed from him to them, or falsely
reputed to be in them, or his person to be their persons: so here as we have a
Christ, so we have a perfect Righteous Christ given us to be our federal head,
when we beleeve; and the Righteousness, which is not in us, but in Him, is
ours so far as to be for our good, as far as His office &amp; Covenant do oblige Him.
Ans.</hi> This savoureth of making Christ's dying for us, to be nothing else
than His dying <hi>for our good,</hi> as <hi>Socinians</hi> say: and if it import more, (as
it doth in truth) he cannot but see, that his <hi>simile</hi> here, hath nothing of
a similitude in it; for the objection speaketh of Christ's person given to us,
not as a great, wise &amp;c. King is given to his Subjects; but as the Surety
is given to the debtor, i.e. as one, whose payment of the debt, must
be reckoned on the score of the debtor, in order to his liberation out of
prison. He addeth. <hi>So that a Righteous Christ and therefore the Righteousness
of Christ, are ours, relatively themselves,</hi> quoad jus beneficii; <hi>so as that we
have right to these benefites by them, which we shall possess: and for the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of His Righteousness, we are conditionally justified and saved, before we
beleeve, and actually after. Ans.</hi> All this <hi>jus beneficii</hi> is but remote; for
in the foregoing <hi>pag.</hi> he told us, as we heard, that this right doth not
flow immediatly from what Christ did and suffered, but from his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace: and I think, he should have said rather from their <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the condition:</hi> for the Covenant conveyeth no title, but condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,
he knoweth, and therefore can give no title or Right, untill the
condition be performed; upon the performance of which, the conditional
Title becometh actual. And further, there is no more here said than
what a <hi>Socinian</hi> will say; and particularly <hi>Sclightingius pro Socino. cont. Mei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snerum

Vindicated.</head>
               <p>WE have now, at some length, as the Lord was pleased to help,
essayed to vindicat this noble &amp; fundamental Truth, of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Christ's Righteousness, in order to the obtaining of
this life of justification; and ere we proceed, I judge, it will not be amiss
to press the practice of this Truth, &amp; the hearty &amp; practical embracing the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof,
by several Arguments &amp; Considerations: for it will not be enough
for us, to know the Theory, and to be orthodox in our judgments, as to
these Necessary &amp; soul-concerning truthes; but we must also practise them,
that it may appear, we do beleev them in very deed, and that we beleeve
them with the heart; &amp; this will be the best way to be kept orthodox, and
stedfast in the truth.</p>
               <p>I shall therefore propose a few Considerations, moving to the practice of
this so necessary &amp; concerning a Truth. As</p>
               <p>1. This way of justification through the Imputed Righteousness of Christ,
the Mediator &amp; Surety, is a way, thath hath the testimony of both Law
&amp; Prophets, confirming it; &amp; is now more clearly revealed &amp; manifest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel dispensation, than it was formerly. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 21, 22. <hi>But now
the Righteousness of God without the Law is manifested, being witnessed by the Law
&amp; the Prophets, even the Righteousness of God, which is by faith of Christ, unto
all, &amp; upon all them that beleeve.</hi> And the same Apostle tels us <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: 16,
17. That he was <hi>not ashamed of the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is the Power of God unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to every one that beleeveth &amp;c.</hi> And what is the ground &amp; reason of this:
<hi>for therein</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the Righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, as
it is written, the just shall live by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith.</hi> This then must be a very sure &amp; saife
way, being thus attested &amp; witnessed by all, that are worthy of credite,
in this matter &amp; a way, that is one &amp; the same, as to its substance, both
before the Law, under the Law, &amp; now under the Gospel, though it be
now more clearly unfolded &amp; explained, since the coming &amp; exaltation of
the blessed Mediator, than it was before His coming; when it was darkly
revealed &amp; shadowed under the Mosaical Ceremonies &amp; Observances. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
need to feare a Miscarrying, or a disappointment, in following of this
way, which even the Law it self, or the Mosaical observances did point
forth, in the daily &amp; yeerly Sacrifices, pointing forth the Lamb of God,
that taketh away the sins of the world, &amp; on which the offerers were to lay
their hands, before they were to be offered up, in token of their devolving
&amp; laying their sin &amp; guilt upon the same, as the the type of that one &amp; only
acceptable Sacrifice, that was to come in the fuluess of time, &amp; was to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
justice for their sinnes; &amp; to shew forth, &amp; declare their faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:104357:126"/>
thereon, &amp; expecting acceptance there through, as we see <hi>Levit.</hi> 1:
4 &amp; 3: 2. &amp; 16: 21. And a way, which also the Prophets, or the Spirit
of Christ, which was in them, did testifie, and bear witness to, when it
testified before hand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 10. &amp;c. So <hi>Peter,</hi> in his Sermon to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> told him <hi>Act.</hi>
10: 43. that <hi>to Him,</hi> (i.e. to Christ) <hi>gave all Prophets witness, that through
His Name, whoso ever beleeveth in Him, shall receive Remission of sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is the way, which all the Ancients took, &amp; found to be a saife &amp;
sure way; &amp; therefore it should be to us a way, worthy of all acceptation.
<hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved God, preaching to him the Gospel; &amp; the object of his
faith, or the summe &amp; substance of the Gospel, that is, the Righteousness
of Christ, was imputed to him; &amp; thereby he was justified: so doth <hi>Paul</hi>
clear the matter to us <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 1, 2, 3. <hi>What shall we say then, that Abraham
our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found &amp;c. for if Abraham were justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by works, he hath to glory, but not before God: for what saith the Scripture?
Abraham beleeved God, &amp; it was counted to him for righteousness.</hi> And if we
enquire, what this was, which Abraham did beleeve? or where in was it,
that he beleeved God? <hi>Paul</hi> tels us <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 8. That it was the Gospel. <hi>And
the Scripture fore-seeing, that God would justifie the heathen through faith, preached
before the Gospel unto Abraham, saying, in thee shall all Nations be blessed.</hi> Now,
though these words, <hi>in thee shall all Nations be blessed,</hi> be not expressly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
<hi>Gen.</hi> 15. where it is said, that <hi>Abraham beleeved God, &amp; it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him for righteousness:</hi> Yet this was the chiefe &amp; principal part of that
promise of multiplying of his seed; &amp; was therefore both before this time
mentioned together with that promise <hi>Gen.</hi> 12: 2, 3. &amp; twice there-after to
wit. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18: 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22; 17, 18. And further, this is called the <hi>Covenant,
which God made with the fathers Act.</hi> 3: 25. and therefore it must have been the
chiefe thing, which <hi>Abraham's</hi> faith did fix upon, who is therefore called <hi>the
Father of the faithful,</hi> as being the Father of many nations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 16, 17.
And this is the sure promise, that is made sure to all the seed, &amp; must be
laid hold on by faith. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 16. And upon this account, <hi>Abraham</hi> is said
to have seen the day of Christ, &amp; to have been glad <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8: 56. And as
<hi>Abraham</hi> took this way; so did others take it, before him: such as <hi>Abel,</hi> who
by faith offered unto God a more excellent Sacrifice, than <hi>Cain;</hi> by which he
obtained witness, that he was righteous. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11: 4. And <hi>Enoch,</hi> who
pleased God by Faith: and <hi>Noah,</hi> who became heir of the Righteousness
which is by faith. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11: 5, 6, 7. So <hi>David</hi> under the Law, describeth
the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth Righteousness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
works &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7, 8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 32: 1, 2. This then being such a paved
way, we must close with it, and seek after no other.</p>
               <p>3. This way is by getting or putting on a Righteousness, with which God
will be well pleased, and with which alone, he is &amp; will be satisfied; for it
is called the <hi>Righteousness of God Rom.</hi> 3: 21, 22. And <hi>the Righteousness, which
is of God by faith Phil.</hi> 3: 9. as being not only a Righteousness, which God
hath found out, who knew best, how to bring about the Salvation of his
chosen ones, to his own glory, &amp; which alone will be acceptable to Him;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:104357:126"/>
but, as being also the Righteousness of one, who is God, even of Jesus
Christ, God-man, the Saviour &amp; Cautioner, and this is made over to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
&amp; imputed to them, and they receive it by faith, that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
theirs, and they may stand before justice clothed with it, &amp; thereby
answere all that Law, &amp; justice can say against them, or lay to their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge.
Can sinners finde out &amp; fall upon a Righteousness, more excellent in it
self, or more pleasing or satisfying unto God, &amp; whereupon a distressed
soul pursued by justice and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>errours of the Lord can with more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
rest and relye, then this is, which is the Righteousness of God;
the Righteouness wrought by him, who was and is the Fathers equal,
God over all, blessed for ever, and is <hi>Lord, our Righteousness Ier.</hi> 23: 5. &amp;
<hi>is made of God to us Righteousness 1 Cor.</hi> 1: 30? What can sinners invent, that
can once be compared here-with? Can any thing; which they themselves
can do, yeeld more ground of Peace &amp; Confidence? No certainely.</p>
               <p>4. This way demonstrateth both the Justice &amp; Mercy of God, &amp; so a way
wherein the Lord hath given a great demonstration of his wonderful Grace
&amp; Mercy: and a way also, wherewith justice is fully satisfied. This the
Apostle doth fully declare <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 24, 25, 26. <hi>being justified freely by his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
through she redemption, that is in Iesus Christ. Whom God hath set forth to
be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his Righteousness to declare
I say, at this time his Righteousness, that he might be just, &amp;c.</hi> And this should
commend it higly unto us, that when neither Angel's, nor men, could
have found out a way, how Mercy &amp; Grace might have shined forth, in the
Salvation of poor sinners; &amp; with all how Justice should have had satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the Infinite Wisdom of God, hath found out this way, whereby
Justice and Mercy are no more, as it were, at odds, but concurring to the
justification of a poor sinner. Whatever way else we take, should we with
these <hi>Micah.</hi> 6: 7. <hi>come before the Lord, &amp; bow ourselves before the high God,</hi>
should we come <hi>before him with brunt Offerings, with calves of a yeer old.</hi> It we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
all in vaine: He would not be pleased with <hi>thousands of rams</hi> nor with <hi>ten
thousands of rivers of oil.</hi> Should we give <hi>our first born for our transgression &amp; the
fruit of our body, for the sin of our Soul:</hi> What would that avail? It could be
no Satisfaction to Justice: the Lord would not be just, in justifying such
sinners.</p>
               <p>5. The sad disappointment, that such, as took another course to the end
they might be justified &amp; Accepted, have met with, should be as an hand
upon the margine to us, to beware of tradeing in the footsteps of their folly,
lest we fall into the same pit of ruine. We read <hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 31, 32. that <hi>Israel,
which followed after the Law of righteousness, did not attaine to the Law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sness;
Wherefore? because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works
of the Law; for they stumbled at that stumbling stone.</hi> They were at much paines
to follow after the Law of Righteousness, thinking thereby to attaine unto
Righteousness, &amp; so to be justified; but after all their paines &amp; travail, they
did misse their mark, &amp; came short of what they projected: They would
not take the way of Faith, they would not by faith lay hold on Christ, and
put on His Righteousness, but they stumbled at that stumbling stone; they
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:104357:127"/>
sought after a Righteousness, by their own works, which they supposed we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the works of the Law, but were not so indeed; for they sought after the
Law of Righteousness, but as it were by the works of the Law: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could not reach their intended end, how confident so ever they
were in their way. So againe <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 3, 4. it is said of them <hi>for they being
ignorant of God's Righteousness, &amp; going about to establish their own Righteousness,
have not submitted themselves unto the Righteousness of God; for Christ is the end
of the Law for Righteousness, to every one that beleeveth.</hi> They would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
God's way, nor submit to that Righteousness, which is twice here
called <hi>the Righteousness of God;</hi> but in the pride of their heart, would set up
&amp; establish their own Righteousness, and make it stand on its feet, and
therefore would not be beholden to Christ, &amp; to his Righteousness, nor
look to him by faith, who was the end of the Law for righteousness, to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that beleeveth: and so they lost all. This sad example should cause
all look about them, &amp; beware of intertaining a prejudice at the Gospel-way
of Justification.</p>
               <p>6. From this Instance, we may also take notice of another Consideration,
<hi>to wit,</hi> That to refuse this Gospel-way of Justification argueth intolerable
pride of heart, &amp; haughtiness of minde: It is observed of the Jewes here,
that they <hi>would not submit themselves unto the Righteousness of God;</hi> they would
not bow so low, nor humble themselves so far, as to deny their own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
&amp; condescend to take on Christ; but in their pride &amp; stoutness
of heart, they thought, though the bricks were fallen, they should build
all up againe with their own hewn stones, &amp; so they went about to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop
&amp; set up their own Righteousness, that it might stand. And what an
intolerable thing is this, for beggers &amp; dyvours to be so proud of nothing,
&amp; to refuse to accept of &amp; be satisfied with the payment of a Cautioner? As
then we would not have this guilt of contemning in the pride of our hearts,
the way that the Wisdom of God hath found out, &amp; the Righteousness of
God, let us not refuise our own Salvation, &amp; stand out against this esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
sure &amp; approven way of taking on Christ's Righteousness.</p>
               <p>7. We may take notice of another Consideration here, to move us to
close with this only way, <hi>to wit,</hi> That the refuising of this way, as it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
ignorance both of the worth, &amp; of the excellency &amp; of the necessity
of this way of Justification, through the Imputed Righteousness of Christ;
so it argueth a rooted prejudice against Christ, and the way of justification
through him, &amp; a judicial stroke of wrath from the Lord upon such, as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
&amp; pertinaciously refuise this Gospel way: for it is said of the jewes he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 3. that <hi>they were ignorant of God's Righteousness:</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 9:
32. that <hi>they stumbled at that stumbled stone,</hi> they brake their necks on that,
which was the only meane of saving them, &amp; that in the righteous judgment
of God, according to what was foretold <hi>Esai.</hi> 8: 14, 15. where it is said, that
the Lord of hosts, who would be <hi>for a Sanctuary</hi> to his own, should be <hi>for a
stone of stumbling, &amp; for a rock of offence; for a gin &amp; for a snare &amp; many among
them shall stumble &amp; fall, &amp; be broken, &amp; be snared &amp; be taken.</hi> And this is
further confirmed by that which <hi>Peter</hi> saith 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 7, 8. <hi>but unto them, which
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:104357:127"/>
be disobedient, the stone, which the builders disallowed, the same is made the
head of the corner. And a stone of stumbling &amp; a rock of offence, to them which stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the word, being disobedient, whereunto also they were appointed.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of this should cause all look about them.</p>
               <p>8. It is also considerable, that such as will not submit themselves unto
this Righteousness of God, have no way to betake themselves unto; no
course that they can follow, in order to their Justification, but that, which
is peremtorily rejected of the Lord, &amp; condemned in his word; that is, the
way of their Owne Works. These Jewes, who would not submit themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
unto the Righteousness of God, could fall upon no other course, but the
establishing of their own Righteousness: And there is no other way men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in Scripture but these two, either by Works, or by Faith; that is,
either by the Righteousness of Christ, or by our own Righteousness; hence
the Apostle doth alwayes oppose these two to other, &amp; by disputing against
the Law, our Works, or our Righteousness according to the Law, he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth
and confirmeth the true &amp; only way, through the Righteousness of
Christ; &amp; by pleading for this, he destroyeth the other, and as there are
no third way distinct from both, so there is no commixture of both, to make
up a third, in apart agreeing with both: for grace &amp; works cannot agree to
gether to make one composition. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 6. So that what ever different
Wayes, and Modes or Methodes, men excogitate in this matter, if they
step aside from the pure way of grace, the way of Justification through the
Imputed Righteousness of Christ, they must of necessity close with that way,
which is through Works, &amp; against which <hi>Paul</hi> hath disputed so much, in
his Epistles. Now what madness is it, to embrace such a way, in whole,
or in part (&amp; if in part, it must also be in whole, for as is said, grace and
works will not mixe) against which the Apostle hath argued so much, both
in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> &amp; to the <hi>Galatians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. This way of Justification through the Imputed Righteousness of Christ
is the only way to Peace &amp; Reconciliation with God; as the Apostle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 1. <hi>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God,
through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Peace with God standeth only upon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
to wit, Justification by Faith; that is, Justification through the
Righteousness of Christ imputed to us by God, &amp; received by faith. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may dream of obtaining Peace &amp; Reconciliation another way; but they
will be miserably disappointed, for, as we said above, justice can be no
other way satisfied &amp; till iustice be satisfied, there is no Reconciliation, no
Peace. What a miserable case then are persons in, who will not submit
unto this way? They may frame a way to themselves, and be very Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in it, as the Jewes had a Zeal of God <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 2. &amp; be at much expense
of duties &amp; toile therein, as the Pharisee, who fasted twice a week, and
yet attaine to no Peace or Reconciliation with God. All then, who are
desireous of this blessed Peace, must choose this way, and close with it hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
and this should be a strong enducement unto them thereunto. We
should remember what <hi>Paul</hi> said 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 18, 19, 21. God hath <hi>reconciled us
to himself by Iesus Christ</hi> &amp; that <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:104357:128"/>
but how was this: See <hi>vers. 21. for he hath made him to be sin for us, who
knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</hi> This,
even this only, is the way to Peace &amp; Reconciliation with God, and who
ever take a way, different from this, or will not cordially close herewith,
must resolve to abide in that estate of enmity, whereinto they are by
Nature.</p>
               <p>10. This way of Justification, as it is the only way of Peace &amp; Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
with God, so it layeth the ground of solide Joy &amp; Rejoyceing in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
of the glory of God &amp; of Glorying in tribulation also, as <hi>Paul</hi> informeth
us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Being justified by faith, through Jesus Christ, <hi>we
have through him, accesse by faith, in to this grace wherein we stand, &amp; rejoyce
in hope of the glory of God; &amp; not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that tribulation worketh patience, &amp; patience experience, &amp; experience hope,
&amp; hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
&amp;c.</hi> Men may, I know, promise to themselves much Peace, Joy and
Consolation, in their own false way, &amp; may also deceive themselves, as
the Pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>isee did, when he thanked God, he was not like the publican: but
how had will the discovery of the deceite and cheatry prove in end? God's
way is the only way, that will yeeld all these desirable things, in truth &amp;
reality: and therefore we would do well, to follow this way alone.</p>
               <p>11. Moreover this way of Justification will only lay the sure &amp; unfailing
foundation of true Holiness and Sanctification, and hence are the most spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
convincing &amp; moving Arguments unto the study of holiness, only to
be taken; as we see the Apostle clearing it in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans Chap</hi>
6. &amp; 7. &amp; 8. having laid down, in the preceeding Chapters, as a sure <hi>ba.
sis</hi> thereunto, the only Gospel-way of Iustification. Men may think, that
the pressing of Justification by our own works should prove the most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Meane &amp; Perswasive unto the real study of holiness, &amp; a most infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Argument to set people awork to follow holiness with all their might:
But experience sufficiently proveth that all such, who by their doctrine lay
more or less of their weight upon their owne works, in their Justification,
are so far from outstriping others in the spiritual exercise of true holiness, that
for the most part the very contrary is too too manifest: and howbeit Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
to Gospel-Justification, through the Imputed Righteousness of Christ,
object to the Asserters thereof, that thereby they are Enemies to the study
of holiness, &amp; give way to laziness &amp; negligence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that exercise; yet, not
only is their alleigance groundless, seing we press holiness upon the same
grounds, that the Apostle doth, who oft times meeteth with this objection,
in his way of declaring &amp; pressing the Gospel-way of justification: but also
experience showeth, that such as have fled to Christ, for Righteousness,
have another way of Communion with God, in all holy conversation; &amp;
their walkeing in all the wayes of God; hath a spiritual lustre &amp; heavenly
beauty, being compared with the walk of others, strangers in practice,
and in opinion, to the Gospel-way of being Justified through Faith in
Christ.</p>
               <p>12. Whoso ever reject this truth, and do not accepte of this way of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:104357:128"/>
through the Imputed Righteousness of Christ, received &amp; lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to by faith, do interpretativly say as much, as that Christ is dead in vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne:
for the Apostle tels us <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 21. that <hi>he did not frustrat the grace of God;
for if righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vaine.</hi> thereby teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us, that the crying up of the Law, &amp; the Righteousness thereof, and
urging people to seek after a Righteousness, by which they may be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
in their Obedience to the Law, is a real frustrating of the grace of
God, &amp; a declaring that Christ is dead in vaine: and consequently, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
seek after a Righteousness, consisting in their personal obedience to the
Law, &amp; will not accepte of, nor heartily &amp; practically close with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-way
of justification, through faith in Christ, do really frustrate, so
far as in them lyeth, all the grace of God, manifested in, &amp; brought to
light by the Gospel, where this noble way of recovering sinners is revealed,
&amp; more clearly &amp; fully explained, than it was formerly. And it is a saying
upon the matter, that Christ hath died in vaine: for if he died not to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
for sinners, after he had finished his course of Obedience, &amp; so to make
up a compleat Righteousness, which might answere all the necessities of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
lying under the sentence of a broken Law; and having no way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Christ, to obtaine the Crown of life, but by perfect &amp; personal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the whole Law, which was &amp; is to them utterly impossible: If,
I say, Christ died not for this end, he died in vaine; &amp; all such, as will not
heartily imbrace this way, do on the matter say, he died not for this end;
&amp; so, as far as they can, they make him to have died in vaine.</p>
               <p>13. This Consideration might also have force with us, that what <hi>Paul</hi>
taught, as to this matter, he did also practise, &amp; sweetly complye with;
thereby casting us a copie, in his own practice: for thus he speaketh <hi>Phil.</hi> 3:
8, 9. <hi>Yea doubtless &amp; I count all things but loss, for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of Christ Iesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, &amp; do
count them but dung, that I may win Christ, &amp; be found in him, not having mine
own Righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of
Christ, the righteousness, which is of God by faith.</hi> So <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 16. <hi>knowing that
a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Iesus Christ;
even we have beleeved in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of
Christ</hi> &amp;c. If therefore, we would be sure in this matter, we must take
this course, which is so corresponding in all points, with the Gospel-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
in this matter. Therefore who ever would expect to have it going
well with them for evermore, must resolve upon this course, to be clothed
with the Righteousness of Christ, and get on that rob of Righteousness,
which is had through the faith of Christ, the Righteousness, which is of
God by faith.</p>

               <head type="sub">Some of the duties of such, as live the life of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
proposed.</head>
               <p>IN the last place, we shall mentione this Use of the Truth, formerly
cleared &amp; confirmed, in reference to such as have attained unto this life
of justification, through faith, which every one may readily see,
That it is the duty of such, as are made partakers of this life, to beware of
such things, as may &amp; will provoke the Lord to anger; &amp; will be unsuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for them, who are thus graciously advanced to such an high State &amp; Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
of grace; &amp; to minde such duties, as do most suite such, as are so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advanced, and so greatly obliged to him, that hath thus called them ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually,
by his grace, and hath wrought up their hearts unto a full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with the Gospel-contrivance of free grace. Many such particular
duties might here be mentioned: but I shall only pointe at a few, to which
others may be reduced.</p>
               <p>1. Such, as live this life of Gospel Justification, should beware of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
thoughts of pride, or of boasting of any thing, they have freely and
graciously received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and particularly, they should guard against boasting in
this matter, that they are preferred to others, and brought out of a state of
death, when others are left yet to lye thereinto. This whole matter is so
contrived, and so wisely framed, that no ground of boasting, either befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
God, or man, may be left unto Man; but that every one may celebrate
the praise of Free Grace. Therefore Justification is not by works, or by our
obedience to the Law; for then the justified man, being justified upon the
account of his own works, or of the works of righteousness, which he hath
done, should have ground of glorying, though not before God, yet before
Men; as having by his own sweating, working &amp; doing, obtained that,
which others by their laziness, negligence &amp; not doing, have come short
of. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us this expresly. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 2. <hi>If Abraham were justified by works,
he hath to glory, but not before God:</hi> and this is further confirmed <hi>vers. 4. Now
to him, that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</hi> So that if
Justification were by works, Justification it self, &amp; all the Consequences
thereof should be due debt unto the worker, and his reward: and so, as the
hireling may boast of his labour, when he gets his hire &amp; reward; so the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
man, if justification were by the works of the Law, might boast of
his own paines &amp; diligence, as having received but his reward, and that
which was due to him of debt, and not of grace. But now, that all mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes
may be stopped, &amp; no flesh might glory, or have ground of boasting,
in themselves, and before others, the Lord hath contrived a far other way
of justification, <hi>to wit,</hi> by Faith alone, whereby the Man goeth out of
himself, renunceth all his own Righteousness, prosesseth himself poor,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:104357:129"/>
naked &amp; miserable, &amp; a plaine dyvour, and utterly <hi>non-solvendo,</hi> &amp; layeth
hold on a compleet &amp; alsufficient Righteousness, in Jesus Christ; and so
hath no ground of boasting or glorying even before men: for it is nothing
that is in him; or that he doth, that is that Righteousness, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of which he is Justified; but only the Righteousness of Christ without
him. It is not his faith, not his works, nor his Righteousness; but Christ's
Righteousness is equally imputed to all beleevers, to the weakest beleever,
as well as to the strongest; and so the strongest beleever hath no ground
of boasting before the weakest. <hi>Where is boasting-then?</hi> (saith the Apostle
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 27.) <hi>It is excluded by what Law? Of works? nay; but by the Law
of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Upon the other hand, let all such glory in the Lord, and in his free
grace &amp; gracious workings; Let them say, when they reflect on this matter,
<hi>not unto us Lord, not unto us, but unto thee be glory,</hi> seing the matter is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
as that all the justified may see, that God may only have the glory
of all, &amp; that none ought to share with him; that he alone should weare the
crown; &amp; all his glorified ones should most cheerfully cast their crownes
down at his feet. <hi>But of him</hi> (saith the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 30, 31.) <hi>are ye in
Christ Iesus, who of God is made unto us Wisdom, Righteousness, &amp; Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
&amp; Redemption: that, according as it is written, he that glorieth, Let him
glory in the Lord.</hi> Christ is made all things unto &amp; for his people, &amp; they
have all of God through him, that no flesh should glory in his presence, as
it is said <hi>vers.</hi> 29. Let all such therefore, as are made partaker of this rich
&amp; honourable Privilege, comply sweetly &amp; cheerfully with this designe of
God, to have God alone exalted, and the mouth of all flesh stopped, that he
who glorieth, may alone glory in the Lord.</p>
               <p>3. Let such as are thus advanced, minde the great duty of holiness, and of
growing in grace, and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ; The way of faith
is not to make void the Law, but it doth establish it <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 31. as Christ is
made of God unto is Righteousness, so is he made Sanctification. As he is
Priest to reconcile us to God, and become Righteousness to us, so is he a
King to cause us walk in the Lord, &amp; to subdue our spiritual enemies, and so
become Sanctification to us. It is the language of the flesh &amp; of corruption,
to argue from this Change &amp; advancement unto a liberty to sinne. <hi>Shall we
continue in sin, that grace may abound?</hi> will the flesh object. But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
answereth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6: 2. &amp;c. <hi>God forbid, how shall we, that are dead to sin,
live any longer therein?</hi> It is repugnant to the nature of that state, whereinto
now they are bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ght, to give way to sin: Therefore the justified should
minde what they are called to, &amp; what new grounds, new advantages,
new helps, new encouragements they have unto holiness, that they had
not before, all plainly &amp; fully set down by <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 6. &amp; eise where.</p>
               <p>4. How should they commend &amp; cry up the free grace of God, and that
love that visited them, when they were lying in their blood, and no eye pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed
them. They were ungodly &amp; without strength, yet Christ died for
them <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 6. and the Lord did justifie the ungodly, even them, who had
no righteousness of their owne, nor nothing to commend them unto him,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:104357:130"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 5. Yea where sin abounded, grace did much more abound <hi>Rom.</hi> 5:
20. Not only had they nothing more then others to commend them unto
God, but even they had less, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>et God through free grace set his Love
upon the less worthy; <hi>for,</hi> saith <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 26, 27, 28.) <hi>ye see your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
Brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty,
not many noble: but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to confound the
wise; &amp; God hath chosen the weak things of the world, and things which are despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
hath God chosen, and things which are not, to bring to naught things which are.
That no flesh should glory in his presence.</hi> Should not the thoughts of this raise
their wondering, &amp; cause them speak to the commendation of the rich and
free grace of God?</p>
               <p>5. Let such as are brought into this state of life, wherein they have peace
with God, and are reconciled to Him, through Jesus Christ, carry as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones
no more strangers unto him, &amp; as forraigners, but as now madenigh
by the blood of Jesus; &amp; therefore let such remember, that through him,
they have an access by one Spirit unto the Farher, being now fellow-citisens
with the Saints, and of the houshold of God <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 13, 14, 18, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi>
5: 2. Therefore should improve this advantage, both for their own good and
for the good of others; &amp; should exercise communion &amp; fellowshipe with
the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ &amp; so walk with him. as agreed with
Him, &amp; have their conversation in heaven. Hath the Lord brought them
into his houshold, yea &amp; admitted them to his presence, that they may
kisse his hand, &amp; stand before his face continually, in the lower cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of presence; and should they carry as yet estranged from him? Is He
at peace with them, and should they have jealous thoughts of him? Is He
reconciled unto them, and should they carry, as keeping up some grudge
against Him?</p>
               <p>6. Such should account this state, whereinto now they are brought, their
only blessedness here below. <hi>Even as David</hi> (saith <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7, 8.)
<hi>also describeth the blessedness of the Man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness
without works; saying, blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose
sinnes are covered: blessed is the man unto whom the Lord will not impute sin.</hi> Here
is the poor self-condemned sinners blessedness, that he hath a righteousness
imputed to him, who had none of his owne, and who thereupon hath his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
forgiven, covered, &amp; not imputed. And such as are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of this blessedness, should account it their happiness, that how ever it
be with them, as to outward things in the world, yet they are now brought
within the Covenant, and are covered with the mantle of Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and have all their iniquities covered, cast into the midst of the sea,
so that they shall never be reckoned upon their score.</p>
               <p>7. This should be aground for them of glorying in the Lord, in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
condition, they can be into in the world; being thus justified, they should
glory in tribulations knowing that they can suffer no loss o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> disadvantage the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby,
but on the contrary reap much good and advantage; for <hi>tribulation
worketh</hi> in such as are thus justified, and at peace with God, <hi>patience, and
patience experience, &amp; experience hope, &amp; hope maketh not ashamed, because
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:104357:130"/>
the love of God is shed abroad in</hi> their <hi>hearts by the Holy Ghost.</hi> Ought they not
then to carry under all oppressions, persecutions, hard usages of men, upon
the account of owning Christ &amp; his Interest, as persons that are upon the
gaining hand, and reaping much spiritual advantage, being now brought
through grace into such a state of life? And how would they hereby glorify
God in the world?</p>
               <p>8. The consideration of their present state of life, should cause them tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
in the midst of all difficulties &amp; temptations, that they shall meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
in their way, as knowing, that the life of justification, whereof now
they are made partakers, shall continue: and that it shall end in the life of
glory; for whom the Lord justifieth, them he also glorifieth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 30.
Who shall then lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? It is God that
justifieth: who is he that condemneth? Who shall then separat such from
the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or persecution, or distress, or fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
or nakedness, or perill, or sword? Nay in all these things they are
more then conquerours, through him that loved them: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 33, 34, 35, 37.
Hear how <hi>Paul</hi> concludeth that matter for himself &amp; others <hi>vers. 38, 32. for
I am perswaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
Powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any
other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God: which is in Christ
Iesus, our Lord.</hi> Should not therefore such carry, as persons that cannot
be made miserable? How much doth the Apostle insist on this, and cleare
it from this ground <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 9, 10. saying, <hi>much more then being now justified by
his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him, for if when we were enemies,
we were reconciled unto God, by the death of his Son; much more being reconciled,
we shall be saved by his life.</hi> And againe <hi>vers. 21. That as sin hath reigned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
death, even so might grace reigne through righteousness unto eternal life, by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, our Lord.</hi> There being then a sure ground of confidence &amp; assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of life &amp; of compleet salvation, laid in justification, all such are called to
rejoice in hope of the glory of God <hi>Rom,</hi> 5: 2. And to have confidence in the
Lord, that he will perfect what he hath begun &amp; to rest assured, that all they,
which receive abundance of grace, &amp; of the gift of righteousness, shall
reigne in life by one Jesus Christ. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 17.</p>
               <p>9. Yea particularly, the consideration of their many sinnes should not
discourage them, or cause them despond: for being now justified, all their
bygone sins are pardoned, &amp; shall not be by the Lord laid to their charge
againe, however the memory of them may humble them, &amp; cause them run
to the fountaine of the blood of Jesus; &amp; all their future sins shall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
according the Gospel grounds, &amp; after the Gospel-methode, so
that they shall not prejudge them of their promised possession of glory and
life everlasting. Now the free gift is of many offences, unto justification
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 16. There is a sure way laid down, in the Gospel, whereby all
their sins shall be taken away, and the very body of death shall be killed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
&amp; more dayly, so that they shall not finally perish, what ever Satan, &amp;
body of death within shall do, to prejudge them of the promised inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
Hence the Apostle inferreth from his foregoing discourse <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 1.
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:104357:131"/>
                  <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation to then, which are in Christ Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. Such as are thus justified, should follow the example of <hi>Paul Phil.</hi> 3: 7,
8, 9. and so account such things less for Christ, which formerly were gaine
yea &amp; count all things but loss, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ,
Jesus, their Lord, yea &amp; account them but dung, that they may win Christ,
and be found in him; Here should their heart &amp; delight be: about this should
their whole occupation be, to win and gaine Christ more, to know him &amp;
the power of his Resurrection and the followshipe of his sufferings, &amp; to be
made conformable unto his death <hi>vers.</hi> 10. that hereby Christ may be their
gaine, their glory, &amp; their all. How jealous should they be of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
hearts, that nothing be admitted, to share of the glory due to Christ,
or to possesse any of that room in the heart, that is due to him? He should
have the throne, for He is well worthie of it: And whatever cometh in
competition with him, be it within us, or without us, should be rejected
that He alone may be exalted in our souls.</p>
               <p>11. Such as have been made partaker of this royal life of justification,
through a Crucified Christ, laid hold on by faith, should labour to keep
this doctrine pure both by word &amp; deed, so far as they can, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>tit, &amp; to presse for a mixture of works upon one consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
or other, in this matter, which it will not admit: and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
it is so crosse &amp; contrary to the corrupt inclinations of Man, who is
so proud of nothing, that he will not be beholden to Christ for less and for
more, and for all. We see <hi>Paul</hi> was most jealous in this matter, and most
zealous for the truth, &amp; therefore on all occasions did assert &amp; vindicate it,
as we may see especially in his Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> where he did so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
withstand <hi>Peter Chap.</hi> 2: 14. and immediatly did state the question,
<hi>vers.</hi> 16. saying, <hi>knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but
by the faith of Iesus Christ, even we have beleeved in Iesus Christ, that we might
be justified by the faith of Christ &amp; not by the works of the Law &amp;c.</hi> adding <hi>vers.</hi>
18. that he for his part, would not build againe the things, which he had
destroyed, &amp; so make himself a transgressour. Nor would he <hi>vers.</hi> 21. fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>12. Finally all such, as have by faith laid hold on Christ, &amp; his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and are by faith justified, and so made partaker of this life through
faith in Christ, must resolve to abide in Christ by faith, that life may be
preserved, and by new acts of faith dayly on Christ, get as it were new
breath, that their life may be continued, and thus live continually the life
of justification by faith, &amp; by faith take their new sinnes to Christ, that
they may be done away in his blood; for the Righteousness of God is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from faith to faith; as it is written, the just shall live by Faith; But
of this we are to speak more hereafter.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Life of Justification, as to its continuance.</head>
               <p>WHen it is said, that <hi>the just shall live by faith,</hi> there is a State
pointed forth, &amp; a Condition intimated, that is not momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
&amp; of short continuance, but such a condition, or change
of state is hold forth, as is of a lasting Nature; not only because <hi>Life</hi> doth
connote some permanency, for a longer, or for a shorter time; but chiefly
because this Scriptural axiome saith, especially as else where applied by the
Spirit of the Lord, that the just<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or justified man, hath through faith a life,
in the worst of times, &amp; that he is made partaker of that privilege of life,
which shall prove lasting &amp; continueing, to the end, a life, that is keept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
fed &amp; nourished by Faith. Having spoken therefore of this life of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifi
on, as begun; that we may more fully explaine the nature of it, we
must speak a litle of it also, as continued.</p>
               <p>But <hi>first,</hi> we must premit some things to shew, what that Justification
is, of the continuance of which we here speak; and what we do not hereby
understand, when we speak of the continuance of the Life of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>1. We do not speak here of Justification, which <hi>Antinomians</hi> tell us, is
from Eternity; for that can be nothing, but God's eternal Purpose to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie;
and which cannot more be called Justification, than his eternal purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
to Condemne the Reprobate, &amp; to save the Elect, can be called condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
&amp; Salvation: and we can no more say, That there was a Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any man from Eternity, than that there was a Condemnation, or
Salvation of men from eternity; we must distinguish betwixt God's Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
&amp; the Effects, which he hath purposed: His purposes are indeed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:
but the Effects or Events purposed, have their being in time, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Season, meane and Methode, when &amp; whereby God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to effectuate them. And sure we are, that Justification, whereof the
Scripture speaketh, is a relative change wrought in Man, in time, when
and not before, he laith hold on Christ by Faith, according to the tenor of
the Gospel.</p>
               <p>2. Nor do we meane here, that Justification, which the same <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,</hi>
call only <hi>declarative</hi> in this life: for the true Gospel Justification is a
real Relative Change, whereby the beleever is brought out of a State of
Wrath and Judgment: where they were lying under the Curse of the Law,
and the sentence thereof, unreconciled to God, and enemies to him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their sinnes lying upon then, according to the sentence of the Law, &amp;
therefore strangers to God's favoure &amp; countenance, and so without God
&amp; without Christ; &amp; brought into a new State of Peace, Pardon, Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation &amp; Friendshipe with God, of which we spoke above <hi>Chap.</hi>
V. We
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:104357:132"/>
cannot then look upon the <hi>Iustification,</hi> mentioned &amp; explained in the
Scriptures, and of which we have hitherto spoken, as a meer Declaration to
the beleevers Conscience of what God did from Eternity; as if the admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
into favoure, and Pardoning of sinnes, were nothing but his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to their consciences, that they were accepted from eternity, &amp; had
pardon from eternity: a notion, sure, that hath no feeting or foundation
in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>3. We do not here speak of that, which some call <hi>Baptismal Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
&amp; whereby they say, all Infants baptized are justified; &amp; which they
must yeeld to be such as can &amp; doth meeth with a final &amp; total intercision,
yea &amp; amission, as to many; &amp; so be quite of another nature, from that which
adult beleevers partake of, from which there is no final or total Apostasie to
be granted, according to the Scriptures. But we owne no such Justification
of all baptized Infants.</p>
               <p>4. Nor yet do we here speak of that, which others, being more wary,
must owne, as consequentially following upon their opinion of <hi>Baptismal
Regeneration of all baptized elect infants, to wit, a Baptismal Iustification of all
baptized elect infants,</hi> it being certain, that there can be no Regeneration,
without a corresponding Justification: for as such a Regeneration is not
clearly revealed in the Scriptures, so, were it granted, no Actual Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
but only a Seminal &amp; Potential Justification could be hence inferred;
because such as the Regeneration is said to be, by such as maintaine this
opinion, such must the Justification be; but this Regeneration, which is
thus owned, is only said to be <hi>Initial, Seminal,</hi> or <hi>Potential,</hi> &amp; is distinguis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed
from <hi>Actual Regeneration</hi> (See D. <hi>Burges</hi> of <hi>Baptismal Regeneration. pag.</hi>
14, 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) As concerning the justification of Infants, though we cannot say,
that there is no such thing, yet, as the knowledge of the way of the Lords
effectuating it, doth not much concerne us; so the Scriptures are spareing in
speaking of that Subject; Sure, the Lord hath a way of uniteing their hearts
to Christ, and of justifying Regenerating &amp; Saving such of them, as die in
their Infancy, &amp; belong to the Election of Grace; though we cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
understand, &amp; determinatly explaine the manner how. It is more of
our concernment to enquire after &amp; know the way, how adult persones co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
to partake of these Privileges.</p>
               <p>5. We do not here speak of that Justification, which some call <hi>a Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the cause,</hi> and distinguish from that, which they call, <hi>a justification
of the person:</hi> for that is but the justification of a person falsly accused, as to
some particular, as <hi>David</hi> was frequently accused of many things, by his
Adversaries, of which he was Innocent, laying to his charge crimes, he
knew not, about which he was in case (as we finde he did several times in
his <hi>Psalmes</hi>) to appeal unto God, the righteous Iudge, being conscious to
himself of no guilt in the particulars alledged, &amp; knowing his own innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
in the sight of God, who knew all things: Such was the matter of that
question, concerning <hi>Job's</hi> sinceritie so much agitated betwixt him, &amp; his
friends, in the book of <hi>Iob,</hi> and at length decided in <hi>Iob's</hi> favours, by God
himself; for though this was not, concerning one or a few particular acts,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:104357:132"/>
but concerning his whole deportment, and concerning his State before God,
upon the account of his deportment, and the Lord's dispensations with him;
yet it was a justification of his Cause, rather than of his Person; for in the
justification of our Persons, we have to do immediatly with God, and not
with man; and the question was properly about a matter of fact, <hi>to wit,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had been a real beleever, or an hypocrite, though such a matter of
fact, as meerly concerned his whole State.</p>
               <p>6. Nor do we here speak of that justification, even as to our state, which
is <hi>before men,</hi> or in the judgment of men, which oft proceedeth upon mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
and unsure grounds; as the now-mentioned instance of <hi>Iob's</hi> friends evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth:
and so varieth, according to the various judgments &amp; apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of men, yea and of the same Man, at several times, according as the
grounds, whereupon he judgeth, are to him clear, or dark: Neither is
this sentence or judgment of men, who are but fallible, and judge by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance, not being able to see into the heart, and judge how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are there, alwayes according to truth; even though according to that
judgment of Charity, which the Law of God requireth: Nor is it Constant
and equable.</p>
               <p>7. Nor do we speak of that <hi>Iustification,</hi> whereof the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi>
speaketh <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. which is not the justification before God, whereof the
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, in his Epistles; but the evidencing, proving and
demonstrating thereof, by effects and works obvious to the eyes of others
and demonstrative of the cause; Those I grant will oft admit of an interci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
through Temptation, and the prevalency of Corruption, and so the
cause or true justification may, as to this manifestation, he eclipsed, though
not in it self.</p>
               <p>8. Far less do we here speak, of a groundless, fancied &amp; supposed justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
whether in the apprehension of deluded persons themselves, or of
others: for this is no true Iustification, but a meer delusion, as to themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
and a conjecture, as to others: and the sooner this be quite cast away
and renunced, the better.</p>
               <p>9. Nor do we here speak of that <hi>Iustification,</hi> which is in the <hi>court of mans
own conscience,</hi>
or as it is there, and opposed to that <hi>Iustification,</hi> which
is in God's court; for it is certaing, this Iustification, which is said to be
in the court of conscience, is but a manifestation of the other unto the mans
conscience, and is some times had, &amp; sometimes missed; sometimes it is
more clear, some times more dark, and therefore can be oft repeated and
reiterated, and intended and remitted; yea and some may for a long time
if not their whole life time be wholly without it, Walking in darkness with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all light, as to this; some may once get a cleare sight thereof, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
see more of it, till nigh the landing in eternity, &amp; yet all this while, the
Iustification, which is in the court of God, remaine fixed, invariable, and
without any interuption.</p>
               <p>10. By Justification here, we meane not that, which some call a <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
justification,</hi> and do distinguish it from an <hi>Universal Iustification:</hi> by
this understanding an universal pardon of all sins past and committed, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:104357:133"/>
by the other understanding a particular pardon of this or that sin, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
after the man hath been universally pardoned and accepted of God;
and now pardoned after a new act of faith in Christ: Though it be needless
to debate, whether this Particular Pardon can be called a Iustification, or
not; yet it is certaine, it is not that Iustification, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh
so much, and explaineth, in all its causes, in his Epistles; nor that Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
which connoteth a change of State before God, and the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of a person out of an estate of Enmity into an estate of Favour and
Friedshipe, in reference to which there must be a juridical sentence, passed
in the favours of the man, through the impured Righteousness of Christ,
received by Faith: while as this posterior act of pardon of a particular
transgression, is rather a Fatherly act pardoning the failing of his Son &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
him againe into his Fatherly embracements.</p>
               <p>11. Nor finally, do we here speak of that sentence of Absolution, that
shall be pronunced, at the last day; for, howbeit that may be called a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification;
yet it is not that <hi>Iustification,</hi> whereof we are now speaking, &amp;
it doth not make such a change in the state of such, as are thereby absolved,
as this doth; and therefore, in respect of this, it is rather a publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
and Manifestation, before Angels and Men, of their Iustification,
or being in a Iustified state, who shall be adjudged unto eternal life; than
any Iustification connoteing a change of state, seing none in that day will
be justified but such as have been here partakers of this Iustification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we speak, they who have been in heaven will need none, &amp; such as have
been in hell will expect none; &amp; none of the living, who have not by faith
laid hold on Christ, will hear any other sentence, <hi>then, depart from me, ye
cursed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>12. The justification then, whereof we here speak, is That change of
state before God, which such are made partakers of, as lay hold on Christ
by faith, through the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ, whereby
they are brought into an estate of Favour &amp; Reconciliation with God, who
were before under his Wrath &amp; Curse; and upon which they have all their
iniquities, whereof they are guilty, actually pardoned; are accepted of, as
Righteous, and pronunced such through the Surety-Righteousness of
Christ imputed to them; and freed from the sentence &amp; Curse of the Law,
under which they were lying.</p>
               <p>That we may cleare the nature of this life of Justification, as to its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
we shall lay down these few Propositions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propos.</hi> 1. Justification denoteth a <hi>State,</hi> wherein the beleever is brought,
a real change, as to state: as a man accused of some crime, &amp; keeped in
prison till he be tryed, &amp; examined by an assise, is really changed, as to his
Law state, when cleared by an assise, and pronunced not guilty, and so
absolved as to that, whereof he was accused, and set at liberty, he is now
a free man, in Law: much more is there a great change in a mans Law-sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
when before he was guilty of death, lying bound in fetters, keeped
unto the day of execution, and now getteth a free Remission of all, when
of a Man of death he is made a free liege, as there is a change in a mans
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:104357:133"/>
state, and Relation, when he is made an Adopted son, so is there a new sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
wherein the sinner is brought, when he is absolved from the sentence
of the Law, and declared a Righteous man. Sanctification, Regeneration
and Glorification, do all of them hold forth a new real State, whereinto he
is brought, who is made partaker thereof; so Iustification with Adoption
held forth a new relative state, which is also real as real, is opposed to what
is false, or imaginary. Hence is it, that a beleever is justified even whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
he is sleeping &amp; not acting faith; as a person remaineth in a married state,
though not actually consenting unto the match, the consent once granted en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stateth
the person in that new Relation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propos.</hi> 2. This new state of Iustification is continueing &amp; permanent; not
in this sense, that God reneweth &amp; frequently reiterateth the enstating of
them into this new relative state; but in this sense, that once justified al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
justified; they are fixed &amp; preserved in that state: as <hi>Adoption</hi> is a
permanent state, because once adopted alwayes a child of God. Hence it is
called a <hi>grace, wherein me stand Rom.</hi> 5: 2. It is a state of Reconciliation and
Peace wherein we stand. It is no fluctuating state, wherein one may be to
day &amp; be out of it to morrow, and againe brought into it. The ground of this
sentence is fixed, lasting and permanent, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Imputation of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ: once clothed therewith, never naked or spoiled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
againe; the gifts and calling of God being with out Repentance <hi>Rom.</hi> 11:
29. The foul's union with Christ through faith, is lasting and abiding: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
in Him, alwayes in Him, once a member of his mystical body, &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to him, as his spouse, and alwayes so, for he must finally present all
such holy &amp; without spot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, or wrinkle, or any such thing <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5: 27.
Faith whereby the knot is made, and the marriage consent is given, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
as to its root and habite, Christ prayeth, that it fail not. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22:
32. They are keeped by the power of God through faith unto Salvation.
1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 5. All the arguments proving Perseverance of the Saints, which
we cannot here summe-up, do confirme this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propos.</hi> 3. Hence Iustification is a State, that is not Interrupted and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off, and renewed and reiterated againe: as it cannot be quite taken away
and annulled: so neither can it be broken off for a time, so as for that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
they should be in a non-justified state: the marriage once made is not
broken; the sentence once pronunced is not recalled; sinnes once pardoned
by God, are not laid againe to his charge. The Spirit that once spoke peace &amp;
said, <hi>Son be of good cheer, thy sinnes are forgiven thee,</hi> will not be againe, a
Spirit of bondage unto fear <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 15. If Iustification could at any time be
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s interrupted, Adoption behoved to be interrupted with it, and so a
childe of God behoved to be for that time a childe of the devil. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
speaketh not of any such relapse into the state of Nature &amp; Sin. <hi>And
such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
in the name of the Lord Iesus &amp; by the Spirit of our God 1. Cor.</hi> 6: 11. on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
brought out of Nature never reduced into that state againe: No more
new Iustification, than new Adoption; once quickened, never againe brought
into a state of death in trespasses &amp; sins <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 1, 5. for such are then
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:104357:134"/>
brought into a saife state, being quickened together with Christ; as <hi>Christ
being raised from the death, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him
Rom.</hi> 6: 9. so they, who are planted with him, in the likeness of his Death
and Resurrection, may alwayes reckon themselves dead indeed unto sin, but
alive unto God, through Jesus Christ <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5, 11. Hence there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
to them that are in Christ Jesus <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 1. They are not under the
Law, but under grace <hi>Rom.</hi> 6: 14. And this holdeth true, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of after-sins; for if after-sins, &amp; remanent sinnes and corruption, could
break of this relation, and make an alteration in this state, no man should
be said to be one day in a justified state: for the best of men falleth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
times a day in sin, and no man can say, that he is free of sin: there being
no perfection here, there could be no state of Justification, &amp; consequently
no state of Adoption, and Reconciliation: if after-sins could break of this
Relation, or Relative State, a beleever could not be said to be partaker of
any of the privileges attending this state, for one day to end. New sins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
call for new Remissions, but these new Remissions are fatherly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,
and not such a sentence of absolution, as the person had at first, when
translated out of the Rate of Death into Life, for then the person was not a
reconciled Son: but now he standeth in a state of Reconciliation and Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe,
&amp; his new pardons are the pardons of a Father, granted to a Son;
as we see <hi>Psal.</hi> 89: 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>If his children forsake my Law, and
walk not in my judgments; if they break my statutes, &amp; keep not my commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements;
then will I visite their transgression with the rod, &amp; their iniquity with
stripes: never the less my loving kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
my fatihfulness to fail: my Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing, that
is gone of my lips.</hi> So 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 8, 9. <hi>If we say, that we have no sin, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful
and just to forgive us our sins, &amp;</hi> 2: 1, 2. <hi>My little children, these things write I
unto you, that ye sin not and if any man sin, we have an Advocat with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Iesus Christ the righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And he is the Propitiation for our sins. Psal.</hi> 103: 3, 8, 9, 12, 13. <hi>Who forgiveth all thine Iniquities. The Lord is merciful and
gracious, slow to anger &amp; plenteous in mercy: he will not alwayes chide, neither
will he keep his anger for ever, as far as the east is from the West, so far hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
our transgressions from us: like as a Father pitieth his children, so the Lord
pitieth them that fear him.</hi> So this state remaineth firme and unbroken, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
of the various changes, which are in their apprehensions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it; these may alter many a time in one day, But the Lords thoughts
are not as our thoughts: nor are his wayes as our wayes, <hi>Esai.</hi> 55: 8, 9. His
sentence &amp; judgment remaineth the same, how alterable so ever ours be.
He is in one minde, though we be in many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propos.</hi> 4. Hence also it is manifest, that Iustification is an Instantaneous
act; that is, it is not a work, that is carried on by degrees; but a sentence
pronunced by the Lord, the Righteous Judge, once for all: Though here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
they still need renewed pardons, &amp; so, may have moe sinnes actually
pardoned this yeer, than they had the last yeer; yet Justification, as relating
to their state, is no progressive work: We hear not of a grouth in Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:104357:134"/>
as we hear of a growth in Sanctification; for as for that word <hi>Revel.</hi> 22:

that all who are justified, are alike justified; none more than others; as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
are more Adopted than others, speaking of these, who are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of the privilege: None can be said to be more a son, than another; so
none can be said to be more justified, than another, who is also justified;
the Lord's sentence absolveth all equally from all their sins, who beleeve;
and admitteth them all equally into a State of Favoure and Reconciliation;
They equally passe from death unto life, they have equally peace with God,
they have all an equal imputation of the Righteousness of Christ, or a share
therein, none more or less then others, though the faith, which laith hold
on the Righteousness of Christ, be not a like strong, in all; for it is faith
in the same kinde in all, and the promise is to the kind, and not to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
or degree of faith. It is no where said, that we are justified by a faith
of such a measure or degree; but by faith; importing that how weak so ever
saith be, if it be faith of the right kinde, it inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>esseth a soul in Christ, &amp;
in his Righteousness, whereupon he is justified. It is true, one may have
many moe sins pardoned, than another. Yet both being Pardoned &amp; Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
they are equally absolved from all, that could be laid to their charge;
he that was the greater sinner, is not more liable to the Law, then he who
was the least offender; for the sentence of Pardon or Absolution doth equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
free both from all hazard of Condemnation; as when two persons are
pardoned, the one whereof hath committed many crimes worthie of death,
the other but one, they are both equally pardoned, freed from prison, and
from the sentence, and set at liberty: So also when two persons are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the one whereof hath a greater debt remitted, the other a lesser, they
are equally pardoned, the one is not more discharged, though discharged
of more, than the other, but both are alike discharged of all their debt, &amp;
freed from all trouble of Law upon the account of their debt. So in Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
all who are justified, how great so ever the difference be among
them, as to the sinnes, whereof they were guilty, are alike justified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
alike freed from the accusation and curse of the Law; &amp; alike made
partakers of the Privileges of Persons pardoned; have alike interest in the
Favoure of God, &amp; Right to glory. As to what difficulty may arise from the
consideration of after sinnes, we shall speak to that afterward.</p>

is perfect and compleet to all ends and uses; This is clear from what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
said: for if Iustification be not an act &amp; privilege, that admitteth of
degrees, or of increase; and doth not grow more and more dayly, it must
be perfect at first, or adequate to all ends and purposes, for which it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
or have that perfection that is competent to it. It is true, it is
not so perfect, as that it can never be out of sight; or as if the sense &amp; fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of it might not grow or become greater; nor yet is it so perfect &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleet,
as it thereby the justified person were freed from all sin, or all the
consequences of sin in this life, for it is not hereunto appointed, nor gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for these ends. But in these respects, and for these ends, it is may be
said to be perfect. (I) That all their former sins are pardoned, how many &amp;

once forgiven alwayes forgiven: It is true, Satan may renew the charge,
and use false summonds against the Beleever; &amp; it is also true, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins
may waken feares, &amp; bring old sins againe to remembrance, &amp; the
Lord may let them see their former debt, not to charge it upon them, but
to bring them on their knees, to humble them the more, &amp; to cause them
cry for, and seek out new extracts of the Pardon received: yet the sinnes that
God once pardoneth, he never writteth down againe upon the score of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,

of all guilt of eternal punishment, which formerly they deserved by
their sinnes. And all this holdeth good, notwithstanding of their after
sins; which (as we shall shew) do not annull, or make any such breach
upon their state of Justification; It is true, these sins must also be Pardoned,
&amp; will be Pardoned; but yet when they are pardoned, their Justification,
as to their state, is not hereby more perfected, as to these respects former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mentioned: It holdeth good also, notwithstanding of what shall be at the
great day; for that will put no man in a new Justified state, who was not
Reconciled to God before. It is true, there will be many additions, as to
the Solemnitie, Declaration, Consequences &amp; Effects thereof, in that
day, but not withstanding hereof the state of Justification here as to what
respecteth its grounds &amp; the essential change it maketh, together with the
Right, that beleevers have thereby unto all, that in that day they shall be
put in possession of, is perfect, &amp; may be said so to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propos.</hi> 7 By what is said, it is manifest, how &amp; in what respects this life
of <hi>Iustification</hi> differeth from the life of <hi>Sanctification.</hi> (1) <hi>Sanctification</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a real Physical change: <hi>Iustification</hi> maketh a Relative change. And
thereby they come to have a new State or Relation, unto the Law, &amp; unto
God the judge. (2) <hi>Sanctification</hi> is continueing work, wherein beleevers
are more &amp; more built up daily. <hi>Iustification</hi> is an act of God, or a juridcial
sentence, Absolving a sinner, &amp; pronunceing him free of the charge,
brought in against him, and not liable to the penalty. (3) <hi>Sanctification</hi> is a
gro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>wing and increasing work, &amp; admitteth of many degrees; &amp; is usually
weak, and small at the beginning: <hi>Iustification</hi> doth not grow, neither doth
it admit of degrees; but is full &amp; compleet &amp; adequate unto all ends here.
(4) <hi>Sanctification</hi> is ever growing here, and never cometh to full Perfection
before death: Justification is perfect &amp; adequate unto all ends; as we shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
(5) <hi>Sanctification</hi> is not alike in all; but some are more, some are less
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:104357:136"/>
sanctified: But <hi>Iustification</hi> is equal in all; none being more justified, then
others. (6) Some measures &amp; degrees of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which have been
attained, may be lost againe: But nothing of <hi>Iustification</hi> can really be lost;
for we are not here speaking of the sense and feeling of Justification, which
frequently may be lost; but of Justification it self (7) <hi>Sanctification</hi> is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressive
work; <hi>Iustification</hi> is instantaneous, as was shown. (8.) <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
respecteth the Being, Power &amp; Dominion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in, in the beleever, and
killeth, subdueth and mortifieth it: <hi>Iustification</hi> respecteth its guilt &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merite,
&amp; taketh away guilt and the obligation to punishment, or obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiousness
to the paying of the penalty. (9) In <hi>justification,</hi> a man is accepted
upon the account of the Righteousness of Christ, imputed to him; and
received by Faith: But in <hi>Sanctification,</hi> grace is infused, and the Spirit
given to perfecte holiness in the fear of God. (10) In <hi>Iustification,</hi> there is
a right had unto life, and unto the rich recompence of reward, upon the
account of the Righteousness of Christ imputed, whence they are said to
have passed from death to life: But in <hi>Sanctification</hi> they are made meet to be
partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in light. (11) Unto <hi>Iustification</hi>
nothing is required but faith in Christ, whereby the soul may become uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Him, &amp; have a right to his benefites: But unto <hi>Sanctification,</hi> all the
graces of the Spirit are requisite, and all the exercises of the same; all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
is required, and an adding of Vertue to Faith, of Knowledge to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
of Temperance to Knowledge, of Patience to Temperance, of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
to Patience, of Brotherly kindness to Godliness, &amp; of Charity to Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
kindness, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propos.</hi> 8 Hence it followeth also, thar there is no ground to assert a <hi>first</hi>
&amp; a <hi>second</hi> Justification, as <hi>Papists</hi> do, meaning by the <hi>first</hi> an Infusion of an
inward Principle or Habite of Grace, which is no Justification, nor part
thereof, but the beginning of Sanctification: and by the <hi>Second,</hi> another
Justification, which with them is an Effect or Consequent of the former,
having good work, which flow from the foresaid infused principle of grace
&amp; love, for its proper &amp; formal cause. This Justification, they say, is by
works, where as the former is by faith; and yet this second, they make to
be an <hi>Incrementum,</hi> an increase of the first; and for this they say, the church
prayeth, when she saith, <hi>Lord increase our saith, hope &amp; charity. Concil, Trid.
Sess. 6. cap.</hi> 10. whereby we see, this Justification, whereof they say <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>
speaketh, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. is manifestly nothing else, but the very grouth of
Sanctification: and so they know no Iustification at all, distinct from San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification:
wherefore we need say no more against the same, it being Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
formerly explained, which we treat of, and not of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereof they seem only to speak, when they mentione Iustification;
and indeed this their Iustification, which is true Sanctification, admitteth
of various and different degrees; &amp; of this, they may imagine not only a
<hi>first</hi> and a <hi>second,</hi> but according to the various degrees thereof a <hi>third</hi> and a
<hi>fourth</hi> yea a <hi>Tenth</hi> &amp; <hi>Twentieth,</hi> if they please. The Scripture, it is true,
maketh mention of twosold Iustification, one by the Works of the Law, &amp;
another by Faith: but it asserteth with all, that these are inconsistent, and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:104357:136"/>
that no man living can be justified the first way, by the works of the Law.
Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> beside the difference he maketh, betwixt Justification as <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,</hi>
and as <hi>Continued,</hi> in reference to the different conditions, required to
the one, and to the other, imagineth a twosold Iustifieation, or <hi>two Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifications,</hi>
or (as he saith against <hi>D. Tullie pag.</hi> 167.) rather <hi>two parts of
one,</hi>
yet in his last Reply to <hi>Mr. Cartwright pag.</hi> 46. he maketh them as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
as are the two lawes he speaketh of, &amp; the <hi>first,</hi> he saith, is by God the
Creatour, the <hi>second</hi> by Christ the Redeemer and in order to the vindication
&amp; clearing of this, he speaketh much of a <hi>twosold Righteousness</hi> In his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
against <hi>Mr. Cartwright pag.</hi> 70. giving us several (to the number of
thirteen) differences, betwixt them; making the one to consist in out Non-obligation
to punishment by the Law of works, because of its dissolution
upon Satisfaction made by Christ: to be without us, in the merite &amp; satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Christ; to be in substance the same with Pardon; to be opposite
to that guilt, which sin in general procureth; to be but the <hi>tantundem</hi> of
what the Law required, to justify us from a true Accusation, that we by
sin deserve death &amp;c. And the other to consist in our Non-obligation to the
far greater punishment; to be within us &amp; done by us, to consist in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
or notguiltiness; to be opposite to that guilt, which one particular
sin procureth; to be the <hi>idem</hi> required in the new Law; to justifie us from
a false Accusation, that we have not performed the Conditions of the new
Covenant &amp;c. all which to examine is not my present purpose: only I shall
say, as to this two sold Justification, that it is an explication of the matter,
which we have not in Scripture, which, I judge, should only regulat both
our Conceptions &amp; Expressions, in this affaire: and what ever pleasure men
may take, to give way to their Luxuriant phancies; yet it will be safest for us
to follow the threed of the Word, and to speak of this mysterie, according
to Revelation, and not according to our Apprehensions: And of all men,
I judge, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> should be most averse from creating new Termes,
Words &amp; Expressions, in these divine things, who expresseth himself so
angry-like (especially in his later writtings) in words, which to some may
seem to favour little of sob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iety or of modesty, against such as contend
about words; when it may be, they are but defending the received ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
doctrine from his new Notions and Expressions, as being <hi>Censorious, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viders,
Word-souldiers,</hi> &amp; I know not what. But, as to the matter in hand;
&amp; in particular, as to this <hi>second Iustifica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion,</hi> or rather <hi>first</hi> (for it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be first in order of nature, if not in time also) which is founded
upon our Innocency, or performance of the Conditions of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
Faith, Repentance &amp; New Obedience &amp; so is a declaring of us Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
because of our inherent Righteousness, I shall only say these few things.
1. That I finde not this new Iustification explained, expressed, nor so much
as hinted by the Apostle, in all his discourses and disputes about this subject,
though he hath spoken very much of Iustification, and on all occasions did
vindicate &amp; clear up the gospel-truth thereanent. If it be said, That all
this is sufficiently hinted, &amp; more then hinted by the Apostle, when he
tels that Faith is imputed unto Righteousness. <hi>I answere.</hi> What the proper
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:104357:137"/>
meaning of this Expression is, shall be shown hereafter, where it shall also
be manifested, that the Faith here said to be imputed, is not our act of
Faith, but Christ, &amp; his Righteousness laid hold on by faith, or the object
of Faith held forth in the Gospel, &amp; received by Faith. And for answere
to this, I judge it sufficient to say, That the Apostle is manifestly there
speaking of that other Iustification, which we owne, for the only Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hold forth in the Gospel, whereby Remission of sins is had, &amp; Peace
with God, through a Righteousness without, &amp; of that Iustification, which
taketh away all glorying, both before God &amp; man, and wherein God is
hold forth to be &amp; laid hold on by Faith as one, that justifieth the ungodly,
and of that Justification, which is from the Accusation of the Law; by all
which &amp; many other Particulars, observable in the Apostles discourse the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
it is undeniable, that he is speaking of that other Iustification, which
we asserte. If it be said, That all this is sufficiently imported, when Faith
is made the Condition of Justification, &amp; we are said to be justified by faith
<hi>I answer.</hi> What way Faith is the Condition of Justification, &amp; is so to be
called, shall be seen afterward: only I say, that what the Scripture spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of this, can give no ground for a new &amp; distinct Justification, because
this new Iustification is rather a Iustification of Faith, or of the Beleever
because of his faith, &amp; purely upon the account of his Faith; for it is a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of judgment, pronunceing the man to be a Beleever, because he is
so; &amp; his faith to be right Faith, because it is so; than any Iustification of
him by faith. Not to mentione this, that together with faith, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
Repentance &amp; New Obedience is joyned; &amp; then there must be a
Iustification of works, or of the man by, yea &amp; because of works, which
cannot be imported by being Iustified by faith, because that is alwayes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to Iustification by works. Beside, that even in mens courts there are
not two distinct sentences of the judge, required in deciding of a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
depending upon the clearing of a Condition; one anent the truth,
of the Condition, &amp; the other anent the thing depending upon that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but the Condition being instructed to be performed, the one senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
is given out; much less is this requisito here, where we have to do with
God, who knoweth whether the Condition be performed, or not; and
needeth not, that we instruct the same against the Accusations of Satan, or of
the world in order to his information. Moreover, there is but one Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here brought in against the man, from the Law, &amp; from the Righteous
Iudge, <hi>to wit.</hi> That he is a sinner, &amp; therefore a son of death: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is but one sentence requisite: for as for that Accusation, that the
person hath not performed the Condition of the new Covenant, neither
will the Law-giver, or judge, nor can the Law bring it in against a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
and what Satan, the accuser of the Brethren, or what a blinde or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
World, or what a mans own blinde &amp; deceitful heart shall or can
herein do, is of no consideration, in reference to a Iustification, which
is before God, &amp; in his sight. But 2. Against this twofold Iustification.
I would say, that all that is mentioned, concerning Gospel Iustification, in
Scripture, agreeth but to one, &amp; the very contrary thereof must be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:104357:137"/>
to the other new-coyned Iustification, according to his own explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof: the one is by faith, the other is for faith; the one is by faith
alone, withour works, the other is because of Faith &amp; Works too; the
one is an act of God's free Grace, the other is an act of pure Iustice; the
one is of a sinner, and of an ungodly person, the other is of a Righteous
man, as such, &amp; because such; the one taketh away all boasting and all
gloriation even before men; the other not; the one maketh the reward of
free grace, the other of due debt; the one is because of a Righteousness
without us, the other because of a personal inherent Righteousness; The
publicans language, <hi>God be merciful to me a sinner</hi> suiteth the one best; The
Pharisees language, or some thing like it, <hi>God, I thank thee, I am a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
&amp;c.</hi> suiteth the other best; In the one the one the man can plead no inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie,
in the other he can &amp; must plead himself not guilty, in the one, the
sinner must say with <hi>David Psal.</hi> 143: 2. <hi>enter not into judgment with thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
for in thy sight shall no man living be justified;</hi> in the other, he may and
must say, <hi>enter into judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight, I shall be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.</hi>
Other things or this Nature might be mentioned, but these are
sufficient. 3. This New Justification must of necessity be a justification of
conscience, or in it, or terminated in it; because it is not before God, or
in his sight, where the world, or the deceived heart the chiefe accusers he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
do not compear to accuse, &amp; Satans accusing them before God can cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
no trouble to them, untill he come, as an Accuser, before conscience,
&amp; give in false summonds there. And therefore it is not the Justification by
Faith, treated of in Scripture: as himself proveth in his <hi>Confession Chap.</hi> 8.
<hi>pag. 189. &amp;c.</hi> 4. This will make way for moe Iustifications, than two; for
as faith must be justified so must Repentance, so must also Works, &amp; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
in them to the end: If it be <hi>said,</hi> that all these make but
one compleet Condition, &amp; therefore give ground but to one sentence. <hi>I
answer:</hi> Then no man can have this sentence pronounced upon him, <hi>to wit,</hi>
to be one, that hath performed the Condition, until he hath persevered unto
the end, &amp; finished his course, &amp; this being the first Iustification, at least
in order of Nature before the other, a man must be dead before he be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
from the Law, yea or with this Iustification: and yet we hear of Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in this life. Further, this will make way for moe Justifications,
upon this account, that it is a declaration of the man to be what he is indeed,
&amp; to have what he hath indeed; &amp; so, as hereby tho man who hath true
saving faith, must be justified upon that account, so the man, that hath
but an historical faith, must be justified in so far, in comparison of him, that
is a meer infidel, and may plead his own cause, so far, even before God's
tribunal; so may the man, that hath but a legal Repentance, in respect of
him, that hath none at all; &amp; the man, that performeth Works material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good, though not in a right manner, in comparison of him, that doth
not so much, &amp; himself tels us <hi>pag. 8, ag. Cartwright</hi> of a, 3 sold Accusation,

5, This will lay the ground for God's multiplying, or frequently reiterating
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:104357:138"/>
of one &amp; the same Iustification; for Iustification presupposeth alwayes an
Accusation, &amp; seing neither God, nor the Law, will ever accuse a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of being no Beleever, only Satan, &amp; the world, &amp; his own Misguided
Conscience it; now, if the Accusation of these or of Satan alone (as he seemeth to insinuat p. 81. &amp; else where, against Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi>) be enough
to lay the foundation of such a Iustification, then as oft, as this Accusation
is renewed, (&amp; how oft that may be, who can tell?) must the Lord reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
his sentence of Iustification, and pronunce the man a true Beleever: and
it will not be sufficient to say, that it will suffice if the Lord manifest to the
Mansconscience, that he a beleever; for why shall that be sufficient now,
more than at the first? and if this take away the necessity of reiterating the
sentence, it will also say, that there was no necessity for pronuncing the
sentence of his being a beleever at the first. None need to say, that this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
may be alledged against our Iustification before God; for the Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we only owne, is in reference to the Accusation of the Law, &amp; of
Justice &amp; of God the Righteous Judge, under whose Curse the sinner lyeth,
until he be justified, &amp; when he is once justified through faith in Christ,
he is no more troubled with their Accusations; for neither God, nor Law,
nor Gospel accuse a Beleever of being an Unbeleever &amp; under the Curse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
whatever Satan, &amp; his own misguided conscience, or others may
do. 6. He groundeth his twosold Iustification p. 93. &amp; 94. upon a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sold
Covenant with distinct conditions &amp; a twosold Accusation for non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the one, &amp; of the other. But thus, as he shall make us to be
justified by the old Covenant of works, &amp; that by the principal justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
an absurdity, that he frequently loadeth our opinion with; so he
maketh all the justification which is according to the new-Covenant to be
upon &amp; because of our own personal Righteousness; which is also repugnant
to the whole Gospel. We do not performe the conditions of the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and all the liberation from the Curse of that Covenant, under
which we are by Nature, is through the Surety-Righteousness of Christ,
imputed to us, &amp; received by faith: and the Gospel or new-Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth
no other way of Justification to us. As for the distinct accusations,
we have said enough already. Neither the Lord, nor his Law do ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
a Beleever of not being a beleever, &amp; as for Satans or others accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this kind, a well informed conscience from the light of the word;
&amp; of the Spirit, clearing up the work of faith, in the soul, &amp; the true &amp;
real works of a lively faith, will be sufficient to quiet the beleever, &amp; stop
the mouth of all these Accusers; without the fiction of a new &amp; distinct Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
whereof the Scripture is silent.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his last reply to <hi>Mr. Cartwright</hi> explaineth, the matter
far otherwayes, telling us <hi>pag.</hi> 46. and forward. That the <hi>first justification</hi>
is by God, as <hi>Rector,</hi> only by the pure Law of works, as Creator: the other
by God in Christ, as Redeemer &amp; Rector of the Redeemed world. The
first is conditionally past upon the whole condemned world &amp; that without
any condition in man, whether faith or works: &amp; so it is both absolute &amp;
conditional. In the first the Father first condemned his Son, as it were (see
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:104357:138"/>
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 52.) &amp; after satisfaction given justified first him, as Sponsor, &amp; then
the world for his sake: thus God forgave those all the debt, who yet perish
by taking their fellow servant by the throat. Here is a justification both ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
&amp; conditional; Here is pardon &amp; no pardon: Here is a justification
of all the Reprobat: Here is a justification of persons not in being &amp; prior
to &amp; without all faith. This therefore is not the justification, whereof the
Scriptures speak, as himself proveth, in his <hi>Confession.</hi>

               <head type="sub">The state of justification remaineth, notwithstanding
of after sinnes, &amp; punishments.</head>
               <p>FOr further clearing up of this life of Justification, as to its Continuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
we shall remove two objections, that may seem to stand in the
way of the truth, hitherto cleared. For it would seem, that Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is not such a continueing uninterruptible state, as it was said to be,
upon this double account, <hi>first.</hi> That the sinnes, which Beleevers, who
are justified, do commit, especially such as are of a more hainous &amp; crying
Nature, do break off this state of favoure &amp; reconciliation, seing they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
even the least of them, God's wrath &amp; curse, &amp; so expose the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
unto the just revenges of God; which seemeth not to be consistent with
a state of Justification. And then <hi>secondly</hi> as their sinnes deserve God's cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
&amp; wrath, so the many sharp &amp; sore afflictions, which they are made to
lye under, both are effects of the wrath of God, &amp; fruites of the Curse, &amp;
also would say, that that state is such, as can be broken off, or at least, is
not perfect, as it was said to be.</p>
               <p>Now for clearing of the truth, formerly asserted, &amp; vindicating of the
same, from these two Objections, to which all others may be reduced, we
shall propose some few things to consideration.</p>
               <p>1. None will say, that every sin of infirmity &amp; weakness, which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
commit, doth or can cut them off from the state of justification; for
then they should never remaine one day to end in that state; for no man
liveth, that sinneth not, &amp; the Righteous fall seven times a day; if the
Lord should stricklymark iniquity, no man should stand; even the best of
their actions are defiled with sin, and they cannot answere for one of a
thousand. So that either it must be said, there is no state of justification, or
that it is consistent with sin in the justified: Justification, though it take
away all the guilt of by paft sins, and free the beleever from that obnoxious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the wrath &amp; curse of God which they were formerly under; yet it
preventeth not all future sinnes, not doth it put the beleever into a perfect
sinless state; nay nor doth it kill any one sin, as to its being, but only taketh
away the guilt, offensiveness &amp; the obligation to punishment, or the <hi>reatus
poenae,</hi> whereby the sinner is bound over unto the Penalty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:104357:139"/>
2. As for such sins, as we may suppose, if committed, would <hi>ipso facto,</hi>
as they say, forfeit the transgressour of the state of Justification, &amp; destroy
all interest in Christ, in the Covenant of grace, &amp; so transferre them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their former state of Nature, while they were under the Curse; as being
sins, inconsistent with a state of Grace &amp; Reconciliation with God; such as
the sin against the Holy Ghost, or of full &amp; final Apolstasie: as for such sins,
I say, the faithfulness of God, Mediation of Christ, &amp; the Operation of
the Spirit of Grace, are, as it were, engadged, to keep the Iustified from
falling into them; as all the Arguments, proving the perseverance of the
Saints, do abundantly evince.</p>
               <p>3. Though every sin, being a transgression of the Law of God, which still
remaineth in force to oblige the beleever, as all others, unto obedience in
all points, doth, in its own nature, deserve God's wrath &amp; curse, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the threatning &amp; penalty of the Law: yet these sins do not annul the
state of justification, nor interupt it (1) because notwithstanding thereof,
all their former sins, of which they were pardoned, remaine pardoned, &amp;
do not bring them againe under the curse, &amp; their Right to the Inheritance
remaineth fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me, through Jesus Christ. (2) Because all these after sins were
virtually pardoned, &amp; their obligation to the suffering of the penalty upon
the account of these, virtually removed, in their Iustification; for therein
was there a legal security laid down &amp; given, that all future sins should not
actually bring them under the curse, or into the state of condemnation: &amp;
this is much more, than what was before their actual closing with Christ,
&amp; being thereby brought into an estate of justification, for though it may
be said, there was sufficient security laid-in in the Covenant of Redemption
betwixt Iehovah &amp; the Mediator, concerning the Non-perishing of the
Elect; Yet this security was hid &amp; under ground, lying in the unchangable
purposes of God; in the Fathers Election of them, &amp; giving of them to the
Son to be redeemed; in the Son's undertaking for them, &amp; in due time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
sin &amp; a curse for them, &amp; so taking on their debt, &amp; making full &amp;
compleet satisfaction therefore; And this fundamental &amp; remote Right,
(as it may be called) could not be pleaded by themselves. But after they
have closed with Christ, and are brought into a state of justification, their
Right appeareth above ground, and the security is laid open in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, whereby they are in case to plead their virtual pardon, to be
made actual, &amp; the promises to be made good, according to the Gospel
termes, &amp; after the Gospel-method. And thus. 3. Not only doth the law's
threatnings speak to them, as shewing what <hi>de jure</hi> only they may look
upon us due unto them, &amp; not declaring what shall eventually
befall them, or that eventually they shall fall under the eternal cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se;
for in a sense, that is true even of all the elect not yet justified, as
was said; but they have a legal ground &amp; Right in the Covenant of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
securing them from Condemnation, &amp; they have accless &amp; ground
in Law to plead this Right &amp; so to plead for actual Pardon in the termes,
&amp; according to the methode of the Gospel: I do not say, that the justified
while lying in sin, without making application to Iesus Christ, &amp; acting
faith on him, in order to pardon, have ground to plead for actual pardon,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:104357:139"/>
for that is repugnant to the Methode of the Gospel, requireing new acts of
faith, in order to new acts of Pardon, I mean the implicit acts if faith (to
speak so) in reference to dayly infirmities &amp; unseen sins, &amp; the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
acts of faith, in reference to grosser sins, seen &amp; lamented: But
they have ground to plead for grace to discover their sins, to humble them
for their sins, &amp; to excite their soul to renewed acts of faith in Christ, and
thereupon to expect, according to the Gospel methode, Remission; and
to plead for it, in the merites of Christ, unto which they have a sure
Right. Therefore 4. New sins cannor annul the state of justification; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
not only are beleevers secured that <hi>de eventu,</hi> they shall not come into
Condemnation for these sins; but even as to any legal dueness of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that new sins may bring them under, there is a sure &amp; saife remedie
at hand, the blood of Christ that taketh away all sin, to which they are
called to go that they may wash their souls there by faith, and be clean,
&amp; be delivered from guilt.</p>
               <p>4. For further clearing of this, we could consider, that there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to be put betwixt Sin, in order to its direful effects, considered in it
self, and considered, as it is in the Iustified. Though sin, in it self is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
mortiferous, and exposeth to the curse and wrath of God, having a
malignant demerite constantly attending it: Yet it is not so, being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
as it is in the justified: for as poison, is alwayes deadly in it self, &amp;
working towards death; yet it is not so, as in a person, who hath received
a sufficient antidot. Though every act of felonie in it self make obnoxious
unto death, according to the Law; yet some acts, as committed by one,
who can read, will not have that effect: so the beleever is antidoted by the
Covenant of Grace, that howbeit sin remaine still deadly, in its own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re;
yet as to him, it cannot produce these effects.</p>
               <p>5. Though after sins, in a justified person, may have, before they be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
very sad effects, in reference to Comfort, or comfortable Improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Privileges &amp; Advantages: yet they cannot disinherite them,
or put them from their Right: Though leprosie did deprive the leper of the
comfortable enjoyment and use of his own house; yet it did not destroy his
right: though the miscarriages of the prodigal son did incapacitate him for
any present enjoyment of his interest in his Fathers affection; yet they did
not destroy his Sonshipe <hi>Luk.</hi> 15: 17. So though sins, not yet washed
away, in such as have been justified, may and will certainly prejudge
them of many comfortable Advantages, which they might otherwayes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve;
yet they do not take away their Sonshipe, nor their Right to the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of sones.</p>
               <p>6. Though after sins, not yet pardoned through faith, do and will stirr
up Fatherly Anger &amp; Displeasure against them, who are justified, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his Adopted children; <hi>Esai.</hi> 54: 7, 8. Yet they bring not justified man
under pure judicial wrath, and under the Curse and Law-anger, so as
God is no more their Father, but hath cast them out of his familie, &amp; father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
favour. It is one thing to be under the frowns &amp; gloomes of an angry
Father: &amp; another thing to be under the severe aspect of an angry judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:104357:140"/>
7. It is considerable also. That through grace, and the Lord's great love
and wisdom, after-sins are so far from destroying their State and Right to
the inheritance, that upon the contrare, they are ordered to the Justified
mans good, and further establishment in grace; not that sin it self hath any
such natural tendency; but it is by accident to sin, which is so ordered by
the wise disposal of a loveing Father, making all things work togerher for
good, and thus counter-working Satan without, &amp; Corruption within,
making that, which Satan had designed to their ruine and destruction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributo
to their good &amp; advantage, by giving them fresh occasion, of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
Humility &amp; Repentance, &amp; of Renewing their gripping of Christ by
Faith, &amp; of Watching more with Diligence here-after; as also hereby they
are put to search &amp; examine themselves, to try their Rights &amp; Securities, &amp;
thus to make their calling &amp; election sure, to their further establishment &amp;
comfort in the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>8. Thus we see whatever present alteration after sins, not yet taken to
Christ, to the end they may be pardoned through his blood, do, or can
make, as to the present Condition of the justified; yet their State remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
firme, &amp; unshaken; for thereby they fall not againe under the old
Covenant; nor under the sentence thereof, nor under pure Law wrath,
pure Justice &amp; the Curse of a broken Covenant; but being under Grace, &amp;
not under the Law, they are secured as to Condemnation <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 1. &amp; as to
the loss of the favour &amp; friendship of God <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 35, 39. for not only is the
guilt of Original sin, &amp; of all their preceeding Actual sins taken away,
through faith in Christ, when they were justified, but there is a sure way
condescended upon betwixt Jehovah &amp; the Mediator, how their after-sins
shall be Pardoned, &amp; taken out of the way, &amp; the same method and way
is declared in the Gospel, &amp; made sure by the Covenant of Grace: and by
their being in the Covenat, they have a right unto the promises thereof,
and ground to press for the performance; &amp; so for Remission, &amp; for all
things requisite thereunto, or following thereupon; yea they have a sure
pledge of Remission already, <hi>to wit,</hi> the actual Pardon of what is past, and
their past Justification; that is a comforting &amp; strenthening word <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 9,
10. <hi>much more then being now justified by his bloud, we shall be saved from wrath
through him; for if when we are enemies, we were reconcile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to God, by the death
of his Son; much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life</hi> &amp; so is that
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 32. <hi>He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all: how
shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. We may adde, That if sins, afterward committed, could take away
Justification, then they should also take away Adoption, &amp; Regeneration;
&amp; so the justified man, should by after sins, not only become an unjustified
man; but also the child of God should become againe the childe of the
devil, &amp; the Relation should be quite broken off, &amp; he, who was borne
againe, should return unto his former state of black Nature: &amp; thus there
should be a second, &amp; a third, yea &amp; multiplied Regeneration; whereof
the Scripture is silent, nay it clearly depones the contrary.</p>
               <p>10. And if it be enquired, how it cometh to passe, that after sins may
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:104357:140"/>
not, at least, gradually impaire the State of Justification, as sins do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
and weaken Sanctification? I <hi>answere</hi> (and this may further help to
clear the business under hand) The reason is manifest, from the difference,
that is betwixt these two blessing and benefites; <hi>Iustification</hi> is an act of God,
changing the Relative-state of a man, and so is done and perfected in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<hi>Sanctification</hi> is a progressive work of God, making a real physical
change, in the man; whence sin may tetard this or put it back, but cannot
do so, with the other, which is but one single act, once done, and never
recalled, the gifts and calling of God being without repentance <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 29.
In justification we are meerly passive, it being a sentence of God pronunced
in our Favours; in Sanctification, as we are in some respect patients, so are
we also Agents, and Actors, and thus sin may retard us in our motion, and
as it evidenceth our weakness for acting, so it produceth more weakness.
Moreover Sin and Holiness are opposite to other, as light and darkness, &amp;
therefore, as the one prevaileth, the other must go under, and as the one
increaseth, the other must decress. But there is no such Opposition betwixt
sin, &amp; pardon, which is granted in Justification. And whereas it may be
said, that sin expelleth also grace Meritoriously: yet that prejudgeth not
the truth in hand, for it can expell grace meritoriously no further, than the
free constitution of God hath limited: and so though it can and oft doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
many degrees of Sanctification; yet it cannot expell &amp; make null the
grace of Regeneration; or the Seed of God, so no more can it expell or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul
Justification; because the good pleasure of God, hath secured the one &amp;
the other &amp; made them both unalterable.</p>
               <p>By these particulars, we see how the <hi>first</hi> doubt is removed out of the
way; we shall <hi>next</hi> speak to the <hi>Second,</hi> which is concerning afflictions, &amp;
Punishments, which are the fruits and deserts of sin, and seem to be part
of the curse or penalty threatned in the first Covenant: To which we need
not say much to show, that notwithstanding hereof, the State of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
remains firme, and unaltered. These few things will suffice to cleare
the truth.</p>
               <p>1. Though all affliction, and suffering be the fruite &amp; consequent of the
breach of the Covenant by <hi>Adam,</hi> the head of mankind; for if he had stood,
and the Covenant had not been violated, there had been no Misery, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Death or Suffering: and though in all, who are afflicted in this
world, there is sin to be found; And though it cannot be instanced, that
God ever brought an afflicting or destroying stroke upon a Land or Nation,
but for the provocations of the People, yet the Lord may some rimes afflict
outwardly or inwardly, or both, a particular Person, in some particular
manner, though not as provoled thereunto by that persons sin, or without
a special reference to their sin, as the procuring Cause thereof; as we see in
<hi>Iob:</hi> and as Christ's answer, concerning the blinde man <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9: 3. <hi>Neither
hath this man sinned, nor his parents</hi> (that he was born blinde;) <hi>but
that the works of God should be made manifest in him,</hi> giveth ground to
think.</p>
               <p>2. Though it doth oftner fall out, that God doth afflict, Punish and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:104357:141"/>
Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sten his people even because of their sinnes, as well as other wicked
persons; yet the difference betwixt the two is great, though the outward Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
may be materially the same: To the godly, they flow from Love, are
designed for good, are sanctified, and made to do good, they are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
mercies; but nothing so to the wicked. They are mercies to the one,
but curses to the other; They speak out love to the one, but hatred to the
other; They are blessed to the one, but blasted &amp; cursed to the other; They
work together for good to the one, but for evil to the other: and all this
notwithstanding, that the outward affliction &amp; calamity that is on the
godly, may be double or treeble to that, which is upon the wicked: Yea
there is mercy and love in the afflictions of the Godly, when the prosperity
of the wicked is cursed. Whence we see, that all these afflictions cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
or dammage their Justified state.</p>
               <p>3. Though the Lord may be wroth &amp; smite in anger his own people, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
&amp; punish them in displeasure; yet, this wrath &amp; anger, is but the
wrath and anger of a Father, and is consistent with fatherly Affection in
God, and therefore cannot be repugnant to a state of Sonshipe in them.

               <p>4. In all these afflictions, that seem to smell most of the Curse, and of
the death threatned, and are most inevitable, such as death, &amp;c. there is
nothing of pure vin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ictive justice to be found in them, when Justified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are exercised with them: for Christ did bear all that, being made a
curse for them, and as to this, the Lord caused all their iniquities to meet
together upon him: He drunk out the cup of Vindictive anger, and left not
one drop of the liquor of the Curse of the Law, for any of his own to drink:
He alone did bear the weight of revenging justice; and there is nothing of
this, in all that doth come upon beleevers; So that the very sting of death is
taken away, &amp; the sting of all these Afflictions is sucked out, and now they
are changed into Mercies &amp; Blessings. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3: 21, 22. Therefore we must
not think that they contribute the least mite unto that Satisfaction, which
justice required for sins, &amp; Christ payed down to the full; &amp; justice was
fully satisfied with what he paid down: nor must we think, that God will
exact a new satisfaction for sins, or any part thereof, of the hands of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
after he hath received a full satisfaction from the Mediator Christ, &amp;
did rest satisfied therewith. The afflictions and Punishments then, that
the godly meet with, being no parts of the Curse, nor of that Satisfaction
that justice requireth for sin, nor flowing from vindictive justice; but being
rather fatherly chastisments, mercies &amp; meanes of God, can do no hurt
unto their state of justification; nor can any thing be hence inferred, to the
prejudice of that glorious state.</p>
               <p>5. But it is said, Pardon and Justification is one thing, and a man is no
more Justified than he is Pardoned; and Pardon is but the taking off of the
obligation to punishment, and consequently of punishment it self; and
seing punishment is not wholly taken off, but there remaineth some part of
the curse, or of the evil threatned for sin, and will remaine untill the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
it is cleare, that pardon is not fully compleet, not consequently
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:104357:141"/>
Justification so long as we live. But for <hi>answere,</hi> &amp; to clear up the matter in
hand more, we say (1) Pardon of sins is not adequatly the same with Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
nor the whole thereof, but at most a part, or rather a partial ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in justification, the person is constituted Righteous, and declared such,
and thereupon hath his sins pardoned, and a Right to the purchased reward;
and he is thus made &amp; declared Righteous, through the Mediators Surety-Righteousness,
imputed to him, and laid hold upon by faith. (2) When a
person is justified, he is at once and for ever freed from the punishment due
from the Law &amp; from vindictive justice, for the broken Covenant: &amp; the
Obligation to punishment required by vindictive justice, is taken away and
dissolved; Christ having fully born that Punishment, and satisfied that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Justice, they, in &amp; through him, are delivered from the Curse,
and the maledictory sentence. (3) Hence all their sufferings &amp; afflictions
here, being no part of the Curse, nor of Satisfaction to divine vindictive
justice, nor of the Condemnation threatned, how ever they be materially
evil, and Fatherly Chastisments or Punishments; yet are no effects of Law-vengeance,
nor parts of vindictive Punishment: and so cannot give ground
to inferre an imperfect Pardon, or an imperfect Justification. (4) Nor must
we call them any part of the Punishment, threatned by the Law, remaining
yet unremoved; for that would make them parts of the Curse; and yet Mr.
<hi>Baxter Confess. p.</hi> 125. conceiveth it <hi>fittest to say, that beleevers are freed from
the curse, &amp; are not under it,</hi> and addeth his reasons there: And the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is clear, because, what the Law threatneth, as such, belongeth
to the Curse; for the Law saith, <hi>Cursed is every one, that continueth not in all
things, which are written in the book of the Law to do then, Gal.</hi> 3: 10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27:
26. And therefore every Punishment, that is a punishment of the Law,
must be part of the Curse; So if the Punishments, or Afflictions, that the
Godly are now under, be part of the Curse, that is yet remaining unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
or of the Punishment (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> there p. 124. saith) it will
inevitablie follow, that beleevers are yet under the Curse, and not wholly
delivered there from; and as to these outward afflictions, many of the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Godly shall be more under the Curse, then several of the wicked: and
if they be under any part of the Curse, how can they be pronunced Blessed?
how can they be said to be Redeemed from the Curse of the Law? how can
Christ be said to have been made a curse for them; how shall their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
not be a part of Satisfaction to Vindictive justice? Shasl not they be in
part Satisfiers for themselves? Shall not they then be beholden to Christ,
only in part? How shall then these Afflictions flow from love, run in the
channel of love, and work-out their good, through grace &amp; love, if they
be any real &amp; formal parts of the Curse? Shall not the curse then be a part
of the blessedness of the Saints, and of their bequeathed portion, which
they may owne as theirs, as well as they may owne life! Shall not the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
or a part of the curse, separat from the Love of God, and of Christ?
What, I pray, will, if that do it not; and yet the Apostle tels us <hi>Rom.</hi> 8:
33. &amp;c. that <hi>afflictions</hi> cannot do it, <hi>nor death</hi> it self. How can any part
of the curse work for us a far more exceeding &amp; eternal weight of glory?
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:104357:142"/>
and yet Afflictions do that 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 17. The curse will not conforme us
unto Christ; yet afflictions will, and do <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 29. (5) Even as to the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of the body of death, that cause the godly to groan, and cry out.
<hi>Miserable man</hi> &amp;c. if we consider them, as an Affliction, we cannot say, that
they are a remanent part of Law-vengeance, of Law-punishment, or of
the curse, threatned in the Law; for then they should be effects of God's
hatred towards the Persons, &amp; of pure vengeance and of juridical, &amp; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
Wrath &amp; Anger, and were not capable of Sanctification to their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
advange; and Beleevers, upon this account, could not be said to be
delivered from the Law, and dead to that, wherein they were formerly
held, as they are <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: 6. for they, who are under the Curse, and under
such an especial part or Effect thereof, cannot but be under the Law, and
that, as a cursing Condemning Law. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 10. Nor could the Apostle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,
as he doth, after the mentioning of the sad wrestlings, that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have, with the body of death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: 15. &amp;c. that <hi>there is now therefore
no Condemnation to them, that are in Christ Rom.</hi> 8: 1. for this would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from their being really &amp; properly under such a great part of the Curse.
Sure, this cannot but be derogatory unto the perfect Satisfaction made by
Christ; seing hereby there is, in some measure, a Satisfaction made unto
the justice of God: and it was the end of Christ's suffering &amp; satisfaction,
to deliver his people from the curse of the Law, in whole, and in part, &amp;
from that penalty threatned in the Covenant of works. Christ was made a
curse for us, and thereby did redeem us, not in part only, but wholly,
from the curse of the Law: and this penal Law Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> must understand
<hi>pag. 127. Confess.</hi> or he speaketh not to the purpose. Nor can I say with him
<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 119. that <hi>every threatning is it in one sense, &amp; the execution in another, that
is commonly called the curse of the Law:</hi> for the execution of the Law upon any
person, is inconsistent with loving-kindness towards that person; but so is
not every threatning, nay nor the execution thereof upon beleevers, as we
see <hi>Psal.</hi> 89: 30, 31, 32, 33. Nor could these executions of threatnings be said
to flow from Love, contrare to <hi>Revel.</hi> 3: 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12: 6. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3: 12. for the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is no fatherly Love, in executing of the Curse.</p>

1. That no man is made partaker of the life of Justification, before Faith;
or that untill souls exercise faith, they are without this life of Justification.
Some talk of a Justification from Eternity; &amp; thus confound Justification
with Gods love of Election; or with Gods decree &amp; purpose to justifie. Some
speak of Justification of all, in the death of Christ; but neither is this to be
admitted, if we speak of actual Justification; It is true, Christ did, when
he laid down the full price of Redemption, conforme to the Eternal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
betwixt Jehovah &amp; Him, make an absolute &amp; actual purchase of all those,
that were given to him to be saved, &amp; did buy &amp; purchase all the Favours,
Blessings &amp; Privileges for them, which were afterward to be actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed,
in the time, &amp; after the way &amp; methode, condescended upon by
Jehovah &amp; the Mediator: (I am here speaking of such as came to have a being,
in the world, after Christ had in the fulness of time, come &amp; laid down the
price; &amp; not of those; who lived before, when Christ's death &amp; Satisfaction
had only a Moral being, &amp; yet full efficacie to produce the same saving effects
on beleevers:) and though in this respect, all the Elect may be said to have
been virtually justified, when Christ laid down the actual price, and was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
from all the charge of their debt, that was laid upon him (as in some
sense, it may be said, that all the Elect were virtually Justified in Him, when
he undertook to make satisfaction for their debt) yet there is no actual Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
before Faith; according to the Scriptures that speak of justification,
of adoption, &amp; of Sanctification by Faith, shewing that these Benefites &amp;
Privileges follow Faith, as to their actuall being, though they were from
eternitie decreed, as was also Glorification, &amp; were actually procured by
Christs death: in which respect, as also in respect of Christs undertaking or
substituting himself in the room of sinners, they may be said to have been vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
Sanctified &amp; Glorified, even then. It is true, that before Faith, the
justification actual of the Elect is every way secured, &amp; all things tending
thereunto are concluded &amp; firmly laid, &amp; all the other anteceding causes are
existent, before Faith, for Christ is appointed &amp; substitute Mediator; Christ
hath accepted &amp; undertaken the work of Mediation; He is come in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of time, &amp; hath laid down the full price; The Father is satisfied with the
price paid. The Father laid upon him the iniquity of all the Elect, &amp; He hath
born it, &amp; made full satisfaction, therefore he is accepted of the Father,
as Head of the Elect justified &amp; possessed of glory, so as they may be said to be
risen with him in heavenly places, <hi>to wit</hi> virtually, &amp; meritoriously; &amp; all
this before faith, Thus God was in Christ, reconciling the Elect world unto
himself, not imputing trespasses unto them, because he imputed them to
Christ &amp; made him sin, who know no sin &amp; this before the word of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
ministred by the Ambassadours of Christ, hath wrought them up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God by faith. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 18, 19, 20. And this I think was more, then what
<hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> saith <hi>confess.</hi> pag. 225, 226. to wit, <hi>that he was providing a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
remedie for the pardon of it, if they would accept of it freely given;</hi> for the
world here spoken of is the world of the Elect, though he think otherwayes
<hi>ibid.</hi> &amp; the Lords <hi>not imputing their sin unto them,</hi> was more then his not dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with them, according to the desert of their sin, but in mercy, for as
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:104357:143"/>
yet many of them had not a being, and so were not capable of being dealt
with, according to the desert of their sin; but it importeth, what is more
emphatically expressed thereafter <hi>vers. 11. to wit,</hi> that God was laying
their sins on Christ' and making him sin, as to its demerite, or guilt,
for them, that they might in due time be made the Righteousness of God in
him.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding of all this, actual justification &amp; Reconciliation is
not before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as is clear from many passages of Scripture, asserting our
justification, life to by faith, <hi>Rom. 1. 17. &amp; 3. 28. &amp; 9: 1. Ephes 2: 8. Gal.</hi>
2: 16, 20. Ad it cannot be said, to evite the force of these &amp; the like Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that this is to be understood only of justification, as to our feeling,
sense &amp; apprehension: for the case, which the Apostle proveth all to be into
before justification, in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans Chap. 1. &amp; 2. &amp;</hi> 3. is such as
cannot consist with a justified state, as to <hi>be under sin, Rom.</hi> 3: 9. to have their
<hi>mouth stopped</hi> &amp; be <hi>guilty before God vers.</hi> 19. But it is manifest, that many, who
are now not under the Law, nor under sin, but delivered from under both
yet may &amp; do want the sense &amp; feeling of their justification, &amp; doubt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And beside this crosseth the whole scope of the Apostle, in proving ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by faith, which is to evince, that justification is not by the works
of the law, or the works of Righteousness, which we do; so that the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
whereof the Apostle speaketh, cannot be by works, but by faith
alone; but the manifestation of justification to our sense &amp; consciences, can
well be by works, as <hi>Iames</hi> sheweth &amp; proveth <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. Works can contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
unto this, but not unto that justification, whereof the Apostle speaketh,
in his Epistles to the <hi>Romans</hi> &amp; <hi>Galattans</hi> &amp; which is justification in the sight
of God.</p>
               <p>That justification is not before faith, is manifest from the condition, which
the Scripture telleth us, such are into, who have not yet beleeved; for if that
condition be such, as is inconsistent with a state of justification &amp; Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there can be no justification before faith: now the Scripture telleth us,
that such as beleeve not, are <hi>condemned Ioh.</hi> 3: 18. <hi>dead in trepasses &amp; sins, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of wrath, Ephes.</hi> 2: 1, 2, 3. <hi>Without Christ, &amp; without God in the world,
&amp; strangers from the Covenants of promise Ephes.</hi> 2: 12. have <hi>made God a liar,
1 Ioh.</hi> 5: 10. <hi>cannot please God Heb.</hi> 11: 6. By all which, &amp; many like pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
that might be cited, it is manifest, that before faith, there is no real ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
Faith is required in order to adoption, &amp; Remission of sins, and
therefore must be before justification <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 10: 43. <hi>Gal</hi> 3: 26. <hi>Act.</hi> 13:
38, 39, of 26: 18. But enough of this, seing <hi>M. Baxter</hi> hath abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
it, in his <hi>Confess. pag. 229, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some move this Objection. <hi>If we are justified by faith, then faith is in order
before justification; &amp; consequently the act is before the object, whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the act depends upon the object, &amp; not the object upon the act,</hi> Thus <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

de justif. lib. 1. c.</hi> 10. disputeth against the assertion, that maketh the
special mercy of God to be the object of justifying faith: wherein the ground
of the whole debate, lyeth in a mistake of that special mercy of God; and
whatever mistake may be, at least as to expression, in the assertion, which
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:104357:143"/>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> opposeth; yet <hi>Bellarmius</hi> Opinion can no way be owned, who
doth so defend the object of faith, as that he maketh justifying faith to be
nothing but Historical Faith. Learned &amp; grave Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> in his <hi>Orthodox
Euangelist Ch. 14. p.</hi> 314. in answering this objection, distinguisheth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the being of justification &amp; our being Justified; or betwixt justification
<hi>in abstracto</hi> i. e. without the receiving subject thereof, &amp; <hi>in concreto</hi> i. e. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the beleever, The first, which signifieth Remission of sins and
Righteousness to Acceptation prepared, though not yet conferred upon
the Elect, he saith, hath a being before Faith and so the object is before
the act: though the ather be after faith. But I conceive there is no great
necessitie of this, for answering of the argument, if any should propose it,
to evince justification before faith; and <hi>Bellarm.</hi> adduceth it not, to this
end, as we saw; for I see no ground to assert justification to be the object of
justifying faith, as if in order to justification, we were called to beleeve, that
we are justified, and that our sins are pardoned: (as was said above) And
as for this justification, considered in the abstract, which is said to have a
being not only in the Purpose of God, but also in the Covenant, between
the Father, &amp; the Mediator, &amp; in the Purchase of Christ; not only is it
not called justification in Scripture, but also, in so far, as it is the object
of faith (as all other revealed truthes are) it is of the elect in general, and
not of this, or that particular person: so that though justifying faith may
beleeve that God Purposed &amp; Christ Purchased, &amp; the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
did expresly containe the justification of the Elect; yet it doth not
beleeve, in order to the mans justification, that he in particular so was justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
either in the Purpose of God, or in the Purchase of Christ, or in the
Covenant betwixt Iehovah &amp; the Mediator; nor is this Faith called for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this object is not a revealed truth: Yet this same justifying Faith, is
of that Nature, as to produce afterward reflecting acts, whereby the man
may see his own justification &amp; be perswaded of it, in truth, &amp; hence also
be perswaded, that the Lord Purposed to justifie him in particular; that
Christ Purchased his justification, in particular, and that it was an article
of the Covenant of Redemption, that he in particular should be justified.</p>
               <p>2. While it is said, <hi>That the just liveth by faith,</hi> we see that faith is the
way, whereby persons come actually to live the life of justification; and
hence it can not it self be the matter of their life: What interest properly
faith hath in this affaire, must be debated afterward; <hi>to wit,</hi> whether it be
properly imputed as the matter of our Righteousness; or only be to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as an Instrument: or as a Condition, &amp; how so?</p>
               <p>3. We see, That this living by Faith proveth that there is no justification
by works, in the sight of God; whence it is manifest, that faith here can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be considered as a work of the Law, or as a duty enjoined by the Law or
under any such consideration. (2) That works have no interest as a cause, or
condition, with Faith in justification. (3) That the life of justification, as
to its continnation is by faith, and by faith, as opposite to works; for the
just, (or the man already justified) liveth by faith: This being also que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned,
we will have occasion to speak more to it afterward.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:104357:144"/>
4. While it is said, <hi>the just liveth by faith,</hi> it is considerable, That this
faith in its kinde, and not in such, or such measure, is here said to be the
meane, whereby persons come to live the life of justification. So that this
true Faith, how weak so ever is the only mean of interessing a soul in this
privilege of justification. This will give occasion to speak of the object of this
justifying faith, which will help to cleare the nature of it.</p>
               <p>Our larger Catechisme qu. 72. giveth us such a definition or description
of justifying faith, that may satisfy us as to most of these difficulties; The
answere is this [justifying faith is a saving grace (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 39.) wrought
in the heart of a sinner, by the Spirit (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 13. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 17, 18, 19.)
&amp; word of God (<hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 14, 17.) whereby he being convinced of his sin
&amp; misery, &amp; of the disability in himself &amp; all other creatures to recover him
out of his lost condition (<hi>Act. 2: 37. &amp; 16: 30. Ioh.</hi> 16: 8, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 6. <hi>Eph.</hi>
2: 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 4: 12.) not only assenteth to the truth of the promise of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
(<hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 13.) but receiveth &amp; resteth upon Christ and his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
therein hold forth, for pardon of sin (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 16: 31. &amp; 10:
43.) &amp; for the accepting and accounting of his person Righteous in the
sight of God, for salvation (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9. <hi>Act.</hi> 15: 11.)] And this question
is none of these particulars, wherein Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Confess.</hi> desireth to
dissent from the said <hi>Catechisme,</hi> as the next Question is; as we shall
hear.</p>
               <p>We may hence take notice of these particulars, concerning this faith',
whereby it may be known, &amp; distinguished from what some may mistake
for it.</p>
               <p>1. As to its nature, &amp; kinde, it is <hi>saving;</hi> for all such, as have this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of justifying faith, are in the sure way of salvation; &amp; whatever faith
persons may have, if they have not this, they are not in the sure path of
life. There is a <hi>faith of miracles,</hi> both Active &amp; Passive, as we may say,
that is a faith to do miracles, and a faith to receive miracles wrought upon
them. The first was that which the Apostles had and others, who wrought
Miracles; and is to be understood <hi>Mat.</hi> 17: 20, 21. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17: 6. The other
is that, which some of those had, who received miraculous cures, as the
woman <hi>Mal.</hi> 9: 21, 21. and that Man, who cried out, <hi>I beleeve, help mine
unbeleefe Mark.</hi> 9: 24. and the man of <hi>lystra Act.</hi> 14: 9. and others This in it
self considered is not a saving grace. <hi>Iudas</hi> had this faith, whereby he cast
our devils, and had commission to work miracles with the rest <hi>Mat.</hi> 10: 8.
<hi>Luk.</hi> 9: 1, 6, 10. So also the Seventy disciples <hi>Luk.</hi> 10: 9, 17, 19. And how
great a privilege so ever this was; yet Christ told them <hi>vers.</hi> 20. that it was
a far greater matter, and much greater ground of joy, to have their names
written in heaven, whereby he giveth us also to understand, that these are
distinct &amp; different from other, and also separable. <hi>Many</hi> (saith Christ
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7: 22, 23.) <hi>will say to me, in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
in thy name? &amp; in thy name have cast out devils? &amp; in thy name have done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wonderful works? And then will I professe unto them, I never knew you, depart
from me, ye that work iniquity.</hi> And it is of this Faith, that <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13: 2. <hi>&amp; though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:104357:144"/>
have no charity, I am nothing,</hi> Importing that this Faith may be, where the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is no saving Christian Love. There is an <hi>Histori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>al faith,</hi> that is a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not only of the histories recorded in the word of God; but of the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
Revelation of God's minde there, yet only as things historically record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
working up the man, in whom it is, unto a voluntary profession of that
truth; This, though true in its kinde, yet is not saving, seing many may
have this, who are strangers to true saving Faith. <hi>Simon Magns</hi> beleeved
thus <hi>Act.</hi> 8: 13. who yet was but <hi>in the gall of bitterness &amp; in the bond of iniquity
vers.</hi> 23. Many beleeved in the name of Christ, when they saw the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which he did, to whom notwithstanding Christ did not commit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 2: 23, 24. Christ had many disciples, who professed the truth and
yet went back, &amp; walked no more with him <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6: 66. This faith, when
it cometh no further, is but such a Faith, as devils have, who beleeve, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is a God, &amp; tremble <hi>Iam.</hi> 2: 19. This is the fruitless, workless Faith,
that <hi>iames</hi> speaketh of <hi>Iam.</hi> 2: 14. that cannot save, &amp; which he calleth a
<hi>dead faith. vers.</hi> 17, 20. a faith that cannot work with works <hi>vers.</hi> 22. There
is a <hi>Temporary faith,</hi> which (whether we look upon, as distinct from the
preceeding historical faith, or as an higher measure &amp; degree thereof, the
matter is not much) is also different from &amp; far short of this saving Faith,
whereby a man cometh to live the life of Iustification, though it hath some
effect wrought upon the affections; this is the stonie-ground that receiveth
the sowen seed <hi>Mat.</hi> 13: 20, 21. These are they, who hear the word, and
anon with joy receive it, yet have no root in themselves, but endure for a
while only; for when tribulation or persecution ariseth, because of the word,
by &amp; by they are offended.</p>
               <p>2. Every act of saving Faith, is not the justifying act of faith, or that
act thereof, whereby we are Justified before God. Saving Faith hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
several acts, as we may see <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Though where ever there are any
of the real acts of saving faith, that man hath also acted justifying faith: yet
we may look on Justifying Faith, or on the act of faith whereby the soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
Justified, as some way distinct from other acts of Saving Faith. Though
by saving Faith we come to understand that the worlds were framed by the
word of God <hi>Heb.</hi> 11: 3. not in a meer historical manner, but savingly;
yet, that act of saving Faith, is not the Justifying act thereof, to speak so.
Though the same Faith by which the Ancients subdued kingdomes, stopped
the mouthes of Lions, quenched the violence of fire &amp;c. was that by which
they were justified, yet these were not justifying acts of that faith; that is,
in order to justification, faith acteth in another peculier manner: Though
it be one &amp; the same saving faith, whereby a beleever is united unto Christ,
in order to answer the Challenges &amp; Accusations of the Law, &amp; to free him
from guilt &amp; condemnation, and maketh use of Christ's Right, Strength
Support &amp;c. in times of Darkness, Temptations &amp; Difficulties: yet these
acts of the same faith are not the same, but may be looked upon as distinct:
Faith acteth one way on Christ in order to Justification, &amp; another way in
order to Sanctification: Faith acteth one way, when it receiveth in, and
another way, when it giveth out, as it were, Faith acteth one way on
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:104357:145"/>
Christ as Priest, and it acteth another way upon him, as Prophet &amp; as King:
yet we would know, that in all these actings of faith, whole Christ is laid
hold upon, though more expresly &amp; explicitly, in the uniting act, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the soul is married unto Jesus, &amp; thereby becometh one spirit with him.
There can be no use making of Christ for any end whatsomever, untill the
soul be united with himself, and in every act of faith, whereby Christ is
made use of, for what ever particular mercy the Beleever would have, be it
Pardon, Light, Strength, Comfort, or such like, Christ himself is grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to, &amp; laid hold on; for there is no separating of Him &amp; his favours:
yet the Beleever, while gripping &amp; laying hold on whole Christ, taketh him
up under that Relation, and eyeth that Office; that most neerly answereth
to and correspondeth with his present necessity, and pointeth forth that
good, which he is now desirous of, &amp; so acteth faith suitablie or putteth
forth faith in suitable acts: as for example, when the beleever is troubled
with conscience of guilt, he runneth to Christ, yet in a special manner he
goeth to him, as Priest, &amp; eyeth that Blood, that only can purge conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from dead works <hi>Heb.</hi> 9: 14. When he is troubled with Raging Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
&amp; would have them subdued, or would have his hard Rebellious
Heart made more soft &amp; pliable to God's will, he goeth to Christ; yet in
special manner, he eyeth Christ as a King &amp; acteth Faith upon him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly;
So when he is troubled with Ignorance, Doubts, and Darkness, he
goeth to Christ; yet he eyeth him th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n especially as a Prophet &amp; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acteth Faith upon him. Yet we would know, that when the Beleever
acteth thus, in this different manner, upon Christ; whether as a Prophet,
or as a Priest, or as a King, there is no exclusion, far less any denyal of the
other offices; which cannot be, because Christ himself, &amp; consequently
whole Christ, is alwayes He, to whom the beleever goeth, though with
a more express, explicite &amp; special application to &amp; usemaking of that offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
&amp; work of Christ, which most suiteth the beleevers present necessity. Now,
though all these acts of faith, be acts of saving faith; yet they are not all
that act of faith which is or may be (for distinctions sake) called, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
act of faith; for this is that act of faith only, which the soul exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
in order to Justification, and Absolution from the Curse of the
Law.</p>
               <p>3. This Faith is no product of the power of Nature, accompanied with
all its advantages, &amp; elevated to its highest pitch, &amp; to the highest mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of accomplishments: Nature, as now corrupted &amp; depraved, not
only will not willingly complye with the designe of Grace in the Gospel; but
it cannot, being nothing but pure enmity to the holy Wayes &amp; Counsels
of God; all its mindings are of the flesh, and all the minding of the flesh,
or the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the Law of
God, neither indeed can be <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 7. Persons, deluded by Satan, may
imagine, &amp; suppose with themselves, that it is so wholly in their power to
beleeve, that they can exerte that Faith, at what time so ever they will:
But, howbeit, out of their own mouths such unbeleevers stand convinced,
&amp; condemned, for their not beleeving; yet the mighty power of God's
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:104357:145"/>
Spirit must be exerted, ere they be brought unto a beleeving frame, or their
souls be made to look towards Jesus in earnest, so as to lay hold on him by
Faith. Therefore is Faith called the gift of God <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 8. There is the
working of the might of God's power requisite unto beleeving <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 19.
Such then, as have not the workings of the Spirit of God, Inclining, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing,
Perswading &amp; Causing the heart beleeve, are real strangers to this
grace, whatever great Enduements &amp; Gifts, or ordinary effects of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
they may be possessed of.</p>
               <p>The author of <hi>a Discourse of the two Covenants</hi> (a book recommended to
us by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his preface, prefixed thereunto, as a Treatise, which
will give us much light, into the Nature of the Gospel) <hi>pag.</hi> 24. tels us,
that <hi>man himself, is not wholly passive, in this change, or what goes to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of it; but is so far active in it, as to denominate what he doth by God's assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to be his own act.</hi> Whereby he sufficiently discovereth an <hi>Arminian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe;
yet so qualifieth his expressions, as may abundantly show, he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to evade. For he will not say, that man is not at all passive, in this chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
but only, that he is <hi>not wholly passive;</hi> and yet he dar not say this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
but must adde, <hi>or what goes to the making of it:</hi> and how much he
may comprehend under this, who can tell? But if man be not passive, he
must be active. How far then is he active? <hi>So far,</hi> saith he, <hi>as to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
what he doth by God's assistance, to be his own act.</hi> That the act of Faith
is mans act, is most certain, for it is he that beleeveth; but the question
is, what change is wrought in the soul, by the Spirit of God, before the
act of faith be exerted? and what hand mans labours and endeavours have
in the infusion of the new Principle, the Divine Nature? Is not the man
purely passive, in the receiving of the effect of that creating act, or in the
work of Regeneration? That the Lord prescribeth the use of ordinary means,
wherein the man is to waite for the free &amp; gracious working of the Spirit is
true; but there is no connexion made by the Lord, by any Law or Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
betwixt the use of these meanes, and the gracious work of faith,
nor betwixt ordinary Light &amp; Conviction, and the like common effects of
these meanes, and Saving Grace. Yet he tels us afterward, that if <hi>man do
but what he can do, through the assistance of God's: common providente (in whom
we live, &amp; move, &amp; have our being) God is most ready, through his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or out of the goodness of his will &amp; pleasure, to work in him, both to will
&amp; to do savingly, to carry the work quite thorow.</hi> But what Scripture doth teach
us this? Sure I am, that <hi>Phil.</hi> 2: 12, 13. with which he ushereth in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
giveth no ground for this; for that is spoken to such, in whom the
work of Salvation is already begun, and who are commanded to work it out,
&amp; to say, that the case is the same, is to overturne the whole Gospel, and
present us with pure <hi>Pelagianisme;</hi> is there as sure &amp; certane a connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
mans work of nature &amp; God's gracious works of Grace, as is betwixt
the work of grace Begun &amp; Carried on? His adducing afterward p. 25. the
commands to make ourselves a new heart, &amp; to repent &amp;c. to enforce this,
is but the old <hi>Pelagian</hi> argument brought againe upon the stage, to which I
have said what I hope will befound Consonant to the Scripture, in my book
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:104357:146"/>
against the <hi>Quakers.</hi> But this man discovereth himself more plainly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>pag.</hi> 28, where after mentioning some acts of men, which cannot be
called acts of super-natural grace, he tels us, <hi>if men will but go thus far
(as they can) out of a real-desire to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e happy, I should make no question, but that
the Spirit of God would yeeld them his assistance to carry them quite through, in the
work of conversion.</hi> Beside that connexion, whereof he maketh no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
though the orthodox have hithertill denied it, writting against <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,
Iesuites</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminians,</hi> we may observe this, here, That nature can
carry the work of conversion quite through, having only the assistance of the
Spirit of God; and what difference is there then betwixt Nature &amp; Begun
Grace: for begun Grace needeth the assistance of the Spirit of God, to
work Salvation quite thorow; and Nature needeth no more? where are
then the Infused Habites? Is Regeneration only brought about by assistance?
Need they, who are dead, no more but Assistance? If this Author help us
to clearness in the doctrine of the Gospel, it must be the Gospel, that only
<hi>Pelagians, Iesuites, Arminians</hi> &amp; <hi>Quakers</hi> owne; but not the Gospel of the
Grace of God revealed to us, in the Word; which telleth us of something
more requisite unto the Conversion of a sinner, &amp; to the bringing of him to
Beleeve &amp; Repent, than the <hi>Cooperation of God's assistance</hi> (as he speaketh <hi>pag.</hi>
25.) <hi>&amp; mans endeavours.</hi> He tels us <hi>pag.</hi> 26. that <hi>there is a promise of divine
assistance to Man, using his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndeavours in doing what he may, &amp; can do towards
the performing the condition of the Covenant:</hi> But he showeth us not, where
that promise is to be found: and <hi>pag.</hi> 17. he talks of an implicit promise; and
this he very wonderfully inferreth from the Gospel, that was preached to
<hi>Abraham:</hi> for thus he speaketh, <hi>for God in promising blessedness to the Nations
through</hi> Abrahams <hi>seed, therein promised all that was absolutly necessary for him
to vouch safe to make them blessed, &amp; without which they could not be blessed. And
if so, then he therein implicitly promised to assist the endeavours of men to perform
the condition of the promise, without the assistance of whose grace, they cannot
savingly beleeve repent &amp; obey.</hi> Whence it would seem (1) that all men, are
comprehended within this promise; and (2) That no more is promised in
reference to the Elect, than to the Reprobat. (3) That the promise of faith
&amp; Repentance, is but a promise of of Assistance. (4) And this promise of
Assistance, is not to assist Grace, but to assist Nature. (5) That the promise
of Faith &amp; Repentance was but an implicite promise, This is a sufficient ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
of this Authors <hi>Pelagian-Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. We proceed. This work of the Spirit upon the soul, whereby the man
is brought to a closing with, and to a resting upon Christ, is ordinarily
wrought by the word: for faith cometh by hearing, &amp; hearing by the word
of God <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 17. The Lord hath established that great Ordinance of
Preaching, for this end; and for this end, he blesseth it unto his chosen
ones, we meane not this exclusivly, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the word could no other way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blessed;
for he blesseth, as he seeth good, for this end, the Reading of,
&amp; Meditation on the word also; though the grand &amp; special mean be the
Preaching; as we see <hi>Act.</hi> 2: 37, 41. &amp; 8: 26-30. &amp; 26: 18. The Lord, it is
true, may send wakenings by his Judgments &amp; by other like Occasions; &amp;
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:104357:146"/>
may blesse the private Endeavours of Parents &amp; friends, by their private
Instructions &amp; Admonitions: yet all these are no way prejudicial unto, but
rather contribute to the confirming of the privilege of the word, as the
Principal Mean &amp; Ordinance, both as leading thereunto, &amp; as receiving
strength thereby: for what ever real beginnings the Lord may work so, they
have this effect to commend the word more unto these persons, &amp;, in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,
the publick Administration thereof by his Authorized Ambassadours:
so that whatever saving work be wrought, as it is not altogether without the
word, some way or other made known; so it tendeth to the further usma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the word publickly administred, where it may be had, as <hi>Saul,</hi>
when under that terrible work of God <hi>Act.</hi> 9. was directed to go to <hi>Ananias</hi>
in <hi>Damascus,</hi> to understand what he should do, &amp; <hi>Cornelius</hi> was ordered
<hi>Act.</hi> 10. to send for <hi>Peter,</hi> to get instruction in the wayes of God. And
whatever work of Light, Conviction, or Terrour, be wrought upon any
occasion, that is attended with a contrary effect, is to be suspected, as not
of God, nor saving. How dreadful then their Condition is, who have
not the word, but are without the pale of the Church, where this word
is preached; &amp; their condition also, who, though living within the Church,
have this word as a sealed book, needeth not be said.</p>
               <p>5. The condition of soul, unto which the Man is brought by the Spirit,
accompanying the Administration of the word, in order to his actual belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
is considerable here; for thereby we will be helped to understand bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Nature and Actings of Faith, whereby only, as a mean, reliefe is
brought unto the soul; and to know what that reliefe is, and wherein it
lyeth, that the distessed man is pursueing after, &amp; seeking with earnesness.
In order to which, we would know,</p>
               <p>(1) That the Spirit by the Word beareth home Convictions of Sin and
Misery, discovereth to the man, how he standeth guilty of the breach of
the Law of God, &amp; so chargeth sin home upon him, both Original and
Actual, &amp; thereby fixeth guilt upon the Conscience, shewing how he hath
forfeited all Right to blessedness &amp; life, &amp; how moreover he is under the
Curse, threatned to the breakers of the Law, and hath the wrath &amp; male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of God hanging over him: He is made to see the sins he never saw
before, both of Omission &amp; Commission, &amp; the sad Consequences thereof,
<hi>to wit,</hi> how he is obnoxious to the penalty, the insupporrable wrath of the
living God. Thus the Spirit convinceth of sin <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16: 8, 9. thus he openeth
their eyes, &amp; turneth them from darkness to light, in so far <hi>Act.</hi> 26: 18. thus
the secrets of the heart are made manifest 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14: 24, 25. and they beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
lost in themselves, like a lost sheep, the lost piece of mency; &amp; the lost
son <hi>Luk.</hi> 15: 6, 9, 24. and like one of those whom Christ came to seek &amp; to
save <hi>Mat.</hi> 18: 11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19: 10. These are the sinners mentioned <hi>Mal.</hi> 9: 13.
that is, such as are now brought by the work of the Spirit, to see &amp; feel
their sinful condition, to know that they are sinners, and that they are in a
lost condition.</p>
               <p>2) There is a discovery made of their Inability to relieve &amp; help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out of this woful condition of sin &amp; miserie. They are made to see,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:104357:147"/>
that nothing in them, or in any other creature, can make satisfaction unto
the justice of God &amp; thereby redeem them from the Curse of the Law, and
from the wrath of God, that is lying upon them, the sense &amp; apprehension
whereof doth now presse &amp; pinch them sore. Which maketh them cry out,
with these pricked in their hearts <hi>Act.</hi> 2: 37: &amp; 16: 30. <hi>What shall we do to be
saved?</hi> They see, they cannot keep the Law: &amp; though they could, it would
not availe, as a Compensation &amp; Satisfaction to the Justice of God, for the
by gone innumerable Transgressions, whereof they stand guilty.</p>
               <p>Whereby we see, that the troubled wakened soul, in this case, is brought
to a desparing in himself. He is under the sentence, and he seeth nothing
under heaven that can command Peace to his soul; nothing within him, nor
without him, beside God, that can bring him out of this Prison, &amp; relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
him from this dreadful sentence, under which he is lying, as a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Malefactor: And we see, what is properly the reliefe, that he would
be at, and that he only desireth: <hi>to wit,</hi> To be freed &amp; delivered from the
sentence of the Law, and from the curse of God; &amp; to be brought into a
state of Favour &amp; Reconciliation with God, that his sins may be pardoned, he
may be accepted of God, as Righteous, &amp; so brought into a State of Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
&amp; Salvation. This is the plaister, that his soul is longing for; this is the
only remedie that can relieve him; this is the only good that he can be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with: all the Pleasures, Honours, &amp; Rihes of the world will bring no
reliefe or ease to his distressed soul: And when he findeth tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this is not to
be found in himself, nor in any other Creature, he must look for it, else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
And thefore</p>
               <p>(3) When the Spirit of the Lord is carrying on this work, he, by the
preaching of the Gospel, convinceth the man of the reality &amp; truth thereof,
&amp; discovereth the Suitablness, Fulness, Satisfactoriness, Glory &amp; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the remedie, that is hold forth in that Gospel, that hath brought
life &amp; immortality to Light, even in the Gospel of the grace of God,
wherein is revealed, what Christ God-man hath done &amp; suffered, to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the justice of God: therein is the Righteousness of God revealed from
faith to faith: There he seeth, that the Father is well pleased with him,
&amp; with the Sacrifie, which he offered up for sins, Whence the poor wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sinner seeth, that his case is not utterly desperate, &amp; that there is
hope for him, through Jesus; or at least that it is possible, he may be saved
from the wrath to come; &amp; a <hi>may be</hi> of reliefe is a great reliefe: And he
seeth, that if that Righteousness &amp; Satisfaction of Christ were made over
to him, or he interessed therein, he were well; for that would sufficiently
guarde him from the wrath of God, and secure him, as to future blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Thus the Spirit, by the word, revealeth the Gospel of Salvation to
the end the wakened sinner may see his reliefe there, &amp; betake himself to the
only reliefe that is held forth there.</p>
               <p>6. Hence we see, that while the wakened sinner is in this condition, his
maine &amp; only work will be, how he may be interessed in that al sufficient
Redemption, &amp; Purchase of Christ, to the end he may be partaker of the
Ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fites, that flow there from, and so be freed from the state of Sin,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:104357:147"/>
Wrath &amp; Enmity, wherein he is now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> plunged: And when the Gospel cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
for Faith, in order to this, &amp; he findeth, that it is not in his power to
Beleeve, but that it is the pure gift of God, who must give the new heart, &amp;
the heart of flesh, &amp; must regenerat &amp; beget him of new, &amp; so create a
new Principle of grace in his soul, to the end he may be brought to act
Faith on the offered mediator &amp; Mediation, &amp; accept thereof, as his only
Cure &amp; Remedie.</p>
               <p>7. So that, when the Spirit worketh up the soul to beleeve, he causeth
him sweetly acquiesce, in the way of Redemption, revealed in the Gospel,
and to count it a faithful saying, and worthie of all acceptation, that Christ
Jesus came into the world to save sinners 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1: 15. and to comply sweetly
with the designe thereof, in all points: and for that end to close with Christ,
and to accept of him upon his offer, and particularly to rest upon him, and
his Righteousness, revealed in the Gospel, as the only ground of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
&amp; peace: This being the thing that their soul longeth after, <hi>to wit,</hi>
how they shall get guilt taken away &amp; they be clothed with a Righteousness,
wherein they may with confidence appeare before God, the Spirit of God,
when working the soul up to a compliance with the remedie, held forth in
the Gospel, causeth them accept of Christ, as made of God unto them,
Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification &amp; Redemption, and every such
soul to say. In the Lord our Righteousness, have I Righteousness. In him
alone will I look for Pardon, Acceptance, Reconciliation &amp; life, &amp; on him
alone will I roll my debt, &amp; there will I rest, in hope.</p>
               <p>8. Therefore, this Faith, though it bring the soul unto Christ, as the
only Redeemer, and is the mans clasping his armes about him, &amp; embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceing
him, as all his Salvation, &amp; rolling all his weight upon him, yet it
looketh to &amp; in a special manner, eyeth the Satisfaction, Merites &amp; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ; for that is it, which the man mainly now standeth in
need of Justice must be satisfied, saith he, my sins must be pardoned, I must
be accepted in favour with God, I must have a Righteousness where with my
sins may be covered, and the month of justice, of the Law, &amp; of my chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
conscience, may be stopped, &amp; whereby I may have Right to life:
and this being held forth in the Gospel, Faith bringeth the soul to a resting
on this Righteousness of Christ, that he may be found in Christ, not having
his own Righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the
faith of Christ, the Righteousness, which is of God by faith <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9.
This is to beleeve on Christ <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: 16, 36. <hi>Act.</hi> 16: 31. &amp; faith in his blood

the wings of Christ, and hideth itself, as it were, in him from the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of bloud, the wrath of an angry God, purseing for a broken Law. And
here, the Man abideth hid in Christ, and eleaveth to him, as being glued
to him, and utterly unwilling to be separat from him, or to appear without
his garment of Righteo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

man by faith trusteth to this way, and resteth upon it with full confidence,
nothing doubting of his saiftie thereby.</p>
               <p>9. By this we see, how the way of justification by Gospel-faith serveth both

Faith the condition of the promise, in <hi>that great things are promised upon
such a possible practicable easie condition, as faith is, considering the meanes and
assistance promised by God to work it:</hi> for this spoileth Grace of its Glory,
when Man is looked upon, &amp; said to be the principal author of saith, as he
is, upon the matter, said to be, when all that God doth, is but called
<hi>assistance,</hi> and at least the man may challenge, as his owne, no small share
of the Glory of acting Faith, and of going so great a length in the way to
Faith, without any more assistence, than he hath need of, to eate his meat
when hungry, and of going on his own feet to the very place, where God
stood ready to lend him a hand to help him forward. Not to mentione, how
this altereth the whole Nature of the Covenant of Grace, making it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a new edition of the old Covenant of works. (5) It is of faith to the
end the promise might be sure to all the seed <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 16. When all the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
is wrought, as it were, to our hand, and nothing more requisite to
interesse us, in the noble Effects of all, than our consent, &amp; this also is
wrought by the Spirit of God conforme to the Covenant of Redemption,
can a more ensureing way be imagined? Alas! what ground of Confidence
or of Certainty, can the <hi>Arminian &amp; Socinian</hi> way, followed by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Author, give to a poor soul? When all is made to hang upon
the tottering &amp; inconstant will of man, who hath no more from God, but

some common assistances, standing ready to attend him, if he advance so
far his alone without them; &amp; when he hath gotten them to day, may run
back, &amp; undo all againe to morrow, &amp; Apostatize for ever; for this also
is a part of that Gospel, that this man will teach us, <hi>pag.</hi> 135. if we beleeve
Mr. <hi>Baxter's Preface.</hi> Beside that hereby, no man can win to any solide
Peace, or Joy, so long as he liveth; for he is but still performing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of his Justification, and perfecting it by his works; so that till they
be at an end, the Condition of Justification is not performed, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
no Justification: and it is the maine scope of this mans discourse to
prove the interest of Gospel-obedience (as he calleth it) as a Condition,
as well as Faith, or rather as a part or best part of practical Faith, in the
matter of Justification.</p>
               <p>10. Hence we may also see, how erroneous &amp; dangerous that definition
of faith as Evangelical, Christian &amp; Justifying, is, which the mentioned
Author giveth us <hi>pag.</hi> 38. to wit, <hi>Such an hearty assent &amp; consent unto God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
in the Gospel by his Son, concerning Christ himself &amp; his Grace &amp; Favour
towards men by him, &amp; concerning their own duty, as causeth a man to expect from
God, and to act in a way of duty, according to the tenor of such a declaration, &amp;
his own concerns in it.</hi> This upon the matter is the very faith of <hi>Adam,</hi> only
<hi>Adam</hi> heard no word of Christ; &amp; so it is but a Law-faith, &amp; no Gospel-Faith.
And againe more plainly by way of explication, he saith <hi>pag.</hi> 39.
<hi>nor is it a bare beleefe, that God will for Christ's sake pardon &amp; save, as many
as truely repent &amp; amend their lives &amp; become new creatures; unless they so beleeve
all this, as seriously &amp; heartily to repent themselves of their former folly, and to
return to their duty in new Evangelical obedience.</hi> Not only doth this man take
away from Justifying &amp; saving Faith, all that peculiar closing with Christ,
&amp; accepting of him, as Redeemer, &amp; all particular &amp; special eye or respect
had to his Righteousness &amp; Mediation; but he maketh Iustification depend
on works, as well as on faith, or on works, as the integral parts of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
justifying faith: It is true, Saving faith, cannot but bow &amp; incline
the man, in whom it is, to all holy Obedience; But to make these thus to
be included in Faith, as the Condition of Justification, is to give us the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Iustification, &amp; the Socinian Faith,</hi> for the true orthodox justification
&amp; faith: and if this be the Gospel justification, &amp; Gospel faith which (as
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> thinks) this look will help us unto, the <hi>Socinians</hi> are better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Gospel, than the orthodox have been, or are. And to
evince this (which is all I need to do here) I shall propose a few of their
Assertions concerning Faith, that the Reader may judge what harmonie is
betwixt this Author &amp; them. The <hi>Racov. Catech. cap. 9. de fide</hi> tels us, that
<hi>faith is a Trust in God, whereby we not only confide in him, but also obey him.</hi> This
is short yet fully the same with our Auther's. <hi>Socinus</hi> himself <hi>dial de justif.
f. 11. what is that to beleeve in his name? It is receive him, to beleeve his words,
to confide in him, &amp; finally to obey him.</hi> And <hi>in not: in dial f.</hi> 25. he tels us, that
<hi>the faith by which we are justified, doth containe obedience to the commands, not
as an effect, but as its substance &amp; forme, yea</hi> (faith he) <hi>it is obedience it self.</hi>
And againe <hi>de fid. &amp; oper. f.</hi> 60. he faith, <hi>I will have nothing else, than to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:104357:149"/>
de in Christ; and this is done &amp; receiveth its perfection, &amp; as it were, its forme,
when obedience is yeelded unto his commands: So that betwixt justifying faith &amp;
good works there is no difference.</hi> See him further f. 123. 134. <hi>Smalcius de di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin.
Christ. cap. 14. f.</hi> 38. tels us, that <hi>faith in Iesus Christ is a firme assent
unto what he hath said &amp; a confideing truely so called, whereby not only we firmly
beleeve what he hath said concerning us, but we confide in him &amp; adhere to him,</hi>
(this is much more, than our Author saith) <hi>&amp; heartly embrace his doctrine
as celestial &amp; saving, placeing our considence &amp; hope in him, as such &amp; so great,
a King, &amp; as our Priest</hi> (fy upon our Author, that is less orthodox, than this
Socinian) <hi>hanging wholly upon him, with a firme hope to obtaine these things, which
he hath promised to such as obey him, that is, if we amend our lives, according
to his prescriptien, we are confident to receive remission of sins, deliverance from
death &amp; eternal life.</hi> But you will say, there is no mention made of good
works in this faith. See therefore what he saith <hi>disp. 6. cont. Frantz de bon.
ope. Thes. 53, 55, 63, 68. We do not</hi> (saith he) <hi>consider two parts of faith.
Trust in God, &amp; Obedience to his commands, but we distinguish them, as if they
were two: for albeit really they may be taken for encthing, &amp; are one, they can be
some way distinguished - Obedience is rather the forme of faith, or faith it self,
than any part of it.</hi> And in this, the <hi>Arminian Remonstrants</hi> in their <hi>Confess.
cap. 10. s.</hi> 1, 2, 3. do homolegate with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> telling us, that faith
comprehendeth all the commands of the Gospel, and that the command of
Faith must no other-way be considered, than as by a natural proprietie it
includeth obedience, and is a fruitful mother of good works: and that
faith thus considered comprehendeth a mans whole conversion, prescribed
in the Gospel. <hi>Socinus</hi> is plaine <hi>Synops. 1. s.</hi> 8. and tels us, <hi>that the way of
justification is the same under both Covenants, seing in both on God's part was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Remission of sins: &amp; on mans part, Repentance, &amp; Obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
which is truely that very faith, that every did, &amp; ever will make man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
unto God.</hi> And then tels us, <hi>that we must beware to make sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
an effect of justification.</hi> These things may shew, that this part, at least,
of this Authors Gospel is more learned out of the <hi>Socinian &amp; Arminian</hi> Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
than out of the Scriptures: and if we would be guided into this, we
may follow other more ancient leaders, than is this Author, whom else
where, I suppose, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calleth <hi>Mr. W. Allen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. We would also take notice of this, That when the Scripture saith,
<hi>the just liveth by faith,</hi> or <hi>we are justified by faith,</hi> the meaning must not be,
we are justified by Hope, or we are justified by Love, or we are justified
by Patience or by any other Grace: for though all these Graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
may be conceived as springing from one and the same root, &amp; seed
of God, which is planted in the soul, in the new birth; and though, we
may, by our acute wits, so explaine each, as to include the rest, more or
less: Yet as divine Revelation is the ground of all our Faith, in this matter,
so Scripture expressions, are the best guide to us, in our Expressions &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
about this matter. And as the Scripture doth speak of and name
these Graces, as formally distinct, ascribing to each their distinct, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Operation, End and Use; so we never read, that we are said to be.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:104357:149"/>
justified by Love, or by Patience, or by Hope, or any other; but alwayes
by Faith. This certanely must instruct us, that Faith here hath a peculiar
and singular interest, &amp; must be considered, as looking to Christ, in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
way, from Hop &amp; Love, which also have Christ for their object, or
Christ must be the object of Faith, in another manner &amp; under some other
consideration, than he is the object of other graces.</p>
               <p>12. It is also considerable, that it is simply said, the <hi>just man liveth by
faith, or we are justified by faith,</hi> and not the just man liveth, or we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
by a strong faith, or by a faith continueing to the end: Though it
be true, that a true &amp; lively Faith is of that Nature, that it will continue
to the end, and will grow; yet we may not say, that only a strong Faith,
or a Faith as continueing to the end, is the condition of the Covenant, or
of Justification; for hence it would follow, that as no man of a weak, yet
true and sincere Faith, could be said to be Justified, so no man could be said
to be Justified untill his Faith had endured to the end, which is contrary
to Scripture, speaking of beleevers, while in their infancy, as justified &amp;
adopted, as partakers of, or at least, as having a Right to the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Justification, such as Pardon, Peace, Glorying in Tribulation, and
Comfort &amp;c. The promise granteth Justification and Adoption to Faith,
that is of the right kinde, &amp; no mention is made of that Qualification
<hi>thereof, He that beleeveth is passed from death to life, and shall never die &amp;c.
Ioh.</hi> 3: 36. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: 16, 18. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 12. If the meaning of such, as make
Faith, as continneing to the end, the condition of the Covenant and of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
were this, That Faith as continued in to the end is the Mean
of Continuance in the Covenant, and in the state of Justification, they
should speak truth: for the just liveth by faith first &amp; last, as by Faith they
are brought into the estate, so by faith they are continued therein; Faith
maketh the first Union, Faith continueth it: But of this we shall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to speak more afterward.</p>
               <p>13. This faith is not one single act of the soul, nor seated in one faculty,
The various things, spoken of it in Scripture, and the various objects it
acteth upon, and is exercised about, and the various and different necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which beleevers stand into, with the corresponding uses, which faith
serveth for, in these necessities, cleare it to be no one single act of the Soul:
I would rather call it the act of the whole Soul, than the act of any faculty,
whatsomever.</p>

of our Justification by Faith: The first &amp; great Question
anent Faith is, whether it be imputed unto the Beleever, as his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
whereupon he is justified? Adversaries to the truth both <hi>Socinians</hi> &amp;
<hi>Arminians</hi> do plainly assert, that our faith, or that grace of faith is the very
thing, which is imputed to the Beleever for his Righteousness. They are
all convinced, that the sinner, must be clothed with a Righteousness, some
way or other, in some sense or other, ere he can be Justified, for the Lord
is Righteous, &amp; will not justifie the wicled, that is such as have no Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:
and being willing to yeeld to the imputation of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, they substitute, in place of Christ's Righteousness, Faith,
properly taken, or our act of Beleeving, as is it performed by us, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Gospel-command. <hi>Socinus de Serv. lib.</hi> 4. c. 4. <hi>Cum igitur
&amp;c.</hi> i.e. <hi>seing he teacheth, by the example of Abraham that Righteousness is
imputed, when can doubt, that nothing else can hereby be under stood, but that we
arerighteous before God, because it hath seemed good to the Lord, to account our
faith, in place of Righteousness.</hi> And thereafter. <hi>That faith is imputed unto
righteousness, is nothing else, than that faith is accounted to us in place of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
but not that the Righteousness of christ is imputed to us &amp; cap. 11. Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
say, that that saith justifieth not by its proper worth, but because it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
Christ: But that apprehension of Christ of yours, is a meer humane fiction,
&amp; a most vaine dream. And when we read, that faith was imputed to Abraham
for Righteousness, or unto Righteousness, we have no reason to think, that mention
is there made of the Righteousness of another, when it is manifest, that he is spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of his own.</hi> In his <hi>dial. de Justis. f.</hi> 14, 15. he tels us, <hi>that faith is by
God imputed to us for Righteousness, &amp; he accounteth that in place of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Confess.</hi> pag. 18, 19. Excepteth against some words in
our <hi>larger Catechisme &amp; Confession of faith,</hi> to wit, that <hi>it is denied, that the
grace of faith, or any act thereof is imputed for Justification,</hi> unless it be thus
understood, that <hi>our faith is not imputed to us, as being in stead of a perfect
Righteousness of Obedience, to the ends, as it was required by the Law of works;
nor is our faith the matter, or the meritorious cause of the remission of our sin, or of
our right to Salvation.</hi> But the meaning of the Assembly is plaine enough
against that, which is the opinion of <hi>Socinians &amp; Arminians,</hi> as the words
of the Answer to <hi>quest.</hi> 73. of the <hi>larger Catech.</hi> make manifest; where it is
said (in answere to that Question, <hi>How doth faith justifie a sinner in the sight

which do alwayes accompany it, or of good works, that are the fruit of it;
nor a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> if the grace of faith, or any act thereof were imputed to him for his justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
(&amp; this is confirmed from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 5. <hi>comp.</hi> with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 10.) <hi>but
only as it is an instrument, by which he receiveth &amp; applyeth Christ, &amp; his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi>
And in the <hi>Confess. of Faith.</hi> Ch. 11. f. 1. <hi>nor by imputing faith it
self, the act of beleeving, nor any other evangelical obedience, to them, as their
Righteousness.</hi> Nor is this a determining of a point, expresly against the
words of God, as he supposeth; for it is not the bare words, as Hereticks
interpret them, that is the minde of God, but the true sense &amp; meaning of
his words: And in <hi>Confessions &amp; Catechismes,</hi> I judge that matters should
be made plaine, and that it were not plaine &amp; ingenuous dealing to set down
the truth in these expressions, that hereticks can subscribe unto, when it is
known, they have an exposition of these words contrary to truth: It seemeth
that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not say, in the explication of the Sacrament of the Lords
supper, that the bread is not changed into the body of Christ, lest he seem
to contradict expresse Scripture, which saith, that Christ said of the bread,
<hi>this is my body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, as to the matter, I assert, with our <hi>Confess.</hi> &amp; <hi>Catechis.</hi> and
with all the orthodox against <hi>Socinians &amp; Arminians.</hi> That faith, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as our act of obedience, is not that which is accounted our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in order to Justification, nor that, which is properly imputed to us
for that end; Nor is that the meaning of the Apostle. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. And of this
I give these reasons.</p>
               <p>1. The Apostle, in his whole Disput about Justification, opposeth Faith
&amp; Works as inconsistent with, yea as repugnant to other: as is notoure;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:104357:151"/>
But this could not be, if Faith as our act of obedience were imputed to us,
as our Righteousness; for faith, as our act of obedience, is a work, and a
work commanded by the Law of God, otherwayes it should be unlawful,
or a work of supererogation. The meaning then of the Apostles Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 28. should be this, a man is justified by one dead of the Law,
without all works or deeds of the Law; which were a contradiction. And
it is certaine, that when the Apostle excludeth the works of the Law, he
excludeth their from being looked upon, as our Imputed Righteousness;
for Adversaries did plead for their interest in justification, as a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to be imputed to the doers, where upon they might be justified: if
then faith as our work, were imputed as our Righteousness, <hi>Pauls</hi> disput
should be, whether all works should be imputed for Righteousness, or one
work of faith only: Nor can it be said, that by the Law here, the Apostle
understandeth only the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as such, for he is speaking this, even of
the Gentiles, who never were under the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and instanceth
<hi>Chap.</hi> 4, in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was justified long before the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as
such, had a being. And he is speaking of the Law, <hi>by which is the knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
of sin. Rom.</hi> 3: 20. &amp; which <hi>worketh wrath Rom.</hi> 4: 15. which cannot agree
to the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> only.</p>
               <p>2. By asserting, that Faith, properly taken, is accounted our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
the whole scope &amp; all the Arguments, which the Apostle useth in
this matter, should be enervated and contradicted; as a very light
view of them might make manifest, and the following Arguments will
evince.</p>
               <p>3. Faith, considered as our act of obedience, and as a work of ours, is
not that Righteousness of God without the Law, which is witnessed by the
Law, and the Prophets: Nor is it that Righteousness of God, which is by
the Faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that beleeve <hi>Rom.</hi> 3:
21, 22. Neither Law nor Prophets did bear witness, that faith, as our act
&amp; work, was accounted all the Righteousness that was to be imputed to the
beleever: Nor said, that our act of faith was the Righteousness of God,
without the works of the Law. Nor is it imaginable, how faith can be
that Righteousness of God, which by Faith is imputed unto all, and put
upon all that beleeve. Shall we think, that the Apostles words have but
this sense, That faith is unto &amp; upon them, that have faith; or that faith is
imputed by faith? Sure the Apostles words must be so understood, as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
that the beleever hath by his faith something imputed to him, which
is distinct from faith, as is obvious.</p>
               <p>4. If faith, as our work, were imputed as Righteousness, how could
the Righteousness of God be declared in the justification of sinners, &amp; God
be just, when he was the justifier of him, which beleeveth in Jesus; as
the Apostle saith <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 26? Is our Beleeving such a perfect &amp; compleat
Righteousness, that God cannot but account us Righteous, because of it, &amp;
so justifie us, as Righteous, upon the account of it? Is it not sick of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
discemper of weakness with other graces?</p>
               <p>5. If Faith, as our act &amp; work, were imputed to us, as our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:104357:151"/>
how should boasting be excluded, &amp; all occasion of glorying, though
not before God (before whom even <hi>Adam,</hi> though he had continued in his
state of innocency unto the end, could not have gloried) yet before Men,
taken away, as it is in the matter of justification <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 27. &amp; 4: 2. The
Law of works will not exclude boa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing, &amp; faith, as our work belongeth
to the Law of works: and if we were justified by Faith, as our imputed
Righteousness, we should certainly have ground of glorying before Men,
as well as <hi>Adam</hi> should have had, if he had stood in his integrity, &amp; obtained
the crown by his doing.</p>
               <p>6. If Faith, as our work, were imputed to us for our Righteousness,
Justification &amp; the reward should not be of grace, but of debt; as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
expresly affirmeth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 4, 5. <hi>Now to him, that worketh</hi> (&amp; he who
beleeveth, in this, which he now opposeth; worketh) <hi>is the reward not
reckoned of grace, but of debt; but to him, that worketh not, but beleeveth</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
then here is opposite to working, &amp; therefore cannot be considered,
as a work of obedience in us, but as carrying us out of our selves, to seek
&amp; lay hold on the Righteousness of Christ, without us) <hi>on him, that justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
the ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteousness;</hi> that is, the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ, which Faith laith hold on, is counted for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>7. If Faith, as our act of obedience, were accounted our Righteousness,
&amp; we were justified upon the account of it, as our Righteousness, God should
not be he, who justifieth the ungodly, as he is expresly stiled <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 5. And
the reason is, because he cannot be called an ungodly person, who hath a
Righteousness inherent in him, &amp; which is his own, &amp; which the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
to him for a Righteousness: he is not unrighteous, whom God
accounteth Righteous, &amp; he whom God accounteth Righteous, cannot be
called ungodly: so that if God account Faith to us for our Righteousness,
putting it up upon our score, as our Righteousness, when God justifieth us
as Righteous, by vertue of our faith, or as clothed with faith, as a compleet
Righteousness, he cannot be said to justifie such as are ungodly. But now,
the Scripture tels us, that God is one, that justifieth the ungodly, that is,
one who hath no Righteousness inherent in him, upon the account of which
the just &amp; righteous God can justify him; but one that must have a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
from without, Imputed to him, upon the account of which he is
Justified, and accounted Righteous in Christ, though unrighteous &amp; ungodly
in himself; our Faith cannot be said to be imputed to us, as our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</p>
               <p>8. If Faith, as our act of obedience, were imputed to us, as our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
<hi>Paul</hi> could not say, as he doth <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6. <hi>Even as David also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputed righteousness without
works:</hi> for then Righteousness should not be imputed without works; but a
prime, special, principal &amp; comprehensive work (for with our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
here, faith is in a manner all works, or comprehendeth them, as we
heard, towards the end of the foregoing <hi>Chapter</hi>) should be imputed, as our
Righteousness, &amp; not a Righteousness without works.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:104357:152"/>
9. Free pardon of sins will never prove the man blessed, unto whom God
imputeth Faith, in a proper sense, for his Righteousness; as it doth prove
him blessed, unto whom God imputeth Christ's Righteousness, or a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
without works: And the reason is, because faith is no satisfaction
to the justice of God; &amp; therefore can not be our Righteousness, upon
which we are pardoned &amp; justified. Now the Apostle argueth thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 4:
6, 7, 8. <hi>Even a, David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God
imputeth righteousness without works; saying, blessed are they, whose iniquities
are forgiven, &amp; whose sins are covered, blessed is the man, to whom the Lord will
not impute sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. The Righteousness imputed is something distinct from our Faith, &amp; is
not our faith it self, for the Apostle saith <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 23, 24. <hi>Now it was not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him, but for us also, to whom it
shall be imputed, if we beleeve on him &amp;c.</hi> If Faith it self were the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
imputed, these words could make no good sense. Shall we think,
that the meaning of the Apostles words is nothing but this. Faith shall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
if we have faith, or our Beleeving shall be imputed to us, if we Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.
This looks not like one of the discourses of the Apostle.</p>
               <p>11. The imputation of our Beleeving, as our Righteousness, cannot
ground our Peace with God, not have we by it access into this grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we stand; nor can we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God; nor glory
in Tribulation: for it is obvious, how weak a ground that were for such a
great building. But the Righteousness of Christ laid hold on by Faith, can be
a sufficient <hi>basis</hi> for all this <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>12. Faith, as our work of obedience, is not the grace of God, and the
gift by grace, which must be imputed to us, as our Righteousness, upon
the account of which we are to be justified: as the offence &amp; transgression
of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed to his posterity, as the ground of death, passing upon
them, and of judgment or guilt to condemnation: But is only our receiving
of that abundance of grace, and of the gift of Righteousness <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 17. But
that which is imputed, as the ground of Justification, as <hi>Adam's</hi> disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
was imputed, as the ground of their Condemnation, is the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> of whom the <hi>first</hi> was a figure <hi>vers.</hi> 14, 15,
18, 19.</p>
               <p>13. When the Apostle saith 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 21. <hi>for he made him sin for us, who
knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God, in him;</hi> his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cannot be, that our Faith is the Righteousness of God, or that we are
made the Righteousness of God upon that account of having faith: for the
Apostle is holding forth here a comfortable commutation, which God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
betwixt Christ &amp; us, as the ground of that ministrie of Reconciliation;
<hi>to wit;</hi> that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
their trespasses unto them, mentioned <hi>vers.</hi> 18, 19. And therefore
as Christ hath some thing, that was properly ours, imputed to him by God,
that is Sin or Guilt, which he had not in himself: so we must have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
as the native fruit &amp; effect of that, that is properly Christ's, imputed
to us of God, that is, his Righteousness, which we have not in ourselves.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:104357:152"/>
And beside, this Righteousness of God is that, whereupon Reconciliation
is founded, as is manifest, comparing <hi>vers.</hi> 19. with 21. But who will say,
that our Reconciliation unto God is founded upon our Faith, as if that were
our Peacemaker, &amp; our Atonement, &amp; Satisfaction; &amp; as if that were
Christ, in whom God was reconciling the world unto himself. Was Christ
made sin, that the imperfect grace of faith might be made a compleet Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
&amp; become our compleet Righteousness?</p>
               <p>14. When the Apostle saith <hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 31, 32. <hi>That Israel hath not attained
to the Law of righteousness, because they sought it not by faith,</hi> he must meane a
Righteousness, that is distinct from Faith, and therefore he cannot meane
Faith it self: for if he meaned faith it self, as our work, the words should
have this sense, they sought not Faith by Faith, and therefore they did not
attaine to Faith. Shall we impute such jejune &amp; insipide expressions to <hi>Paul,</hi>
or rather to the Spirit of God speaking in &amp; by <hi>Paul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>15. The same Apostle tels us <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 3, 4. That the <hi>jewes being ignorant
of God's righteousness, &amp; going about to establish their own righteousness, have
not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God:</hi> And by this Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, he cannot meane, Faith: for their faith had been their own,
&amp; so their own Righteousness, if Faith had been Righteousness: but he
must meane the Righteousness of Christ, which faith laith hold on, for he
addeth, <hi>for Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness, to every one that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth:</hi>
So that it is the Righteousness of him, who is the end of the Law,
that is that Righteousness, unto which they should have submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by Faith; &amp; it is not Faith it self, but a Righteousness which is had
from Christ; who is the end of the Law, &amp; a Righteousness, which is
had by Faith, and which every one partaketh of that beleeveth, as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words show.</p>
               <p>16. When the Apostle saith <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 19. <hi>by the Obedience of one shall many
be made righteous,</hi> doth he meane by that obedience of one, our Faith; &amp;
not rather the Obedience of Christ, which is imputed, and whereby we
become Righteous? As the disobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> was not some particular
after deed of his posterity, which was imputed to them for their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
but it was the particular fact of <hi>Adam,</hi> eating the forbidden fruit,
which was imputed to all his posterity, and whereby they were constituted
sinners: so this obedience of Christ cannot be any act of obedience in us, be
it Faith, or what you will; but the acts of Christ obeying the Law, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to us, whereby we become Righteous, &amp; are constituted Righteous
in the sight of God.</p>
               <p>17. When <hi>Paul</hi> said <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9. <hi>and be found in him</hi> (i. e. Christ) <hi>not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
mine own righteousness, which it of the Law, but that which is through the
faith of Christ, the righteousness, which is of God by faith,</hi> can he meane by
this Righteousness, which he was desirous to be foundin, only Faith? If
he had meaned Faith, had not that been his own Righteousness? Is not our
Faith called our owne? If not, why saith <hi>Iames Chap. 2. shew me thy faith,</hi>
&amp; <hi>I will shew thee my faith.</hi> And should not this Righteousness, if his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
had been it, been of the Law? Or is faith according to no Law?
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:104357:153"/>
If it be according to no Law, it is no act of obedience. Moreover, how
could Faith be said to be through Faith? Is Faith a mean to it self? How can
Faith be the Righteousness of God, which is by faith? Was not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
scope &amp; desire, to win Christ? And is Faith Christ?</p>
               <p>18. If our act of beleeving be imputed to us as our Righteousness, then
we cannot say. <hi>In the Lord have we righteousness,</hi> contraire to <hi>Esai.</hi> 45: 24. in
order to a saying, in the Lord we shall be justified, as <hi>vers.</hi> 25. but rather
in ourselves have we Righteousness, in order to this end, for Faith or our
act of Beleeving is in our selves immediatly, and is said to be our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Nor can we thus call the <hi>Lord our righteousness,</hi> contrate to <hi>Ier.</hi> 43: 6.
But rather our own act of beleeving shall be our Righteousness, &amp; trusted to
as such. Nor yet could we say, <hi>that Christ is made of God to us righteousness.</hi>
As it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 30. unless that because by vertue of his mediation, our act
of beleeving is made of God to us Righteousness sure I am the emphasis of
the words pointeth out some other thing, as hath been seen.</p>
               <p>19. Is our beleeving that rob of Righteousness, wherewith the Lord co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
such, as have ground to rejoice greatly in the Lord, and to be joy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful
in their God <hi>Esai</hi> 61: 10? Such might as well rejoice greatly in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
&amp; be joyful in themselves, &amp; in their Beleeving.</p>
               <p>20. Is Faith that everlasting Righteousness, that the Messias was to bring
in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9: 24 Doth our act of beleeving last for ever? <hi>Paul</hi> hinteth some
other thing. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>21. When <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 10. <hi>that with the heart man beleeveth unto
righteousness,</hi> must not this Righteousness be something distinct from belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving?
If not, we may as well say, that Confession with the mouth is the
same with Salvation, for he addeth, <hi>&amp; with the mouth confession is made unto
Salvation,</hi> wherefore, as Confession is but a mean &amp; way unto Salvation, so
Beleeving is but a mean &amp; way unto Righteousness.</p>
               <p>22. Can we with any coloure of reason suppose, that our act of beleeving
is that Righteousness of God, which is revealed from faith to faith <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.
17. Can faith be said to be revealed from it self, &amp; to it self?</p>
               <p>23. Our act of Beleeving cannot be that Righteousness, whereof <hi>Noah</hi>
become heir <hi>Heb.</hi> 11: 7. for he became heir of this Righteousness by Faith:
&amp; he could not be said to be come heir of Faith by Faith.</p>
               <p>24. Faith is among the works of Righteousness, which we do: and al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
these works of Righteousness the Apostle excludeth from an interest in that
Righteousness, where-upon we are Justified, as opposite to mercy. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 5.
Therefore our Beleeving cannot be our Righteousness unto Justification.</p>
               <p>25. If our act of Beleeving be imputed to us for Righteousness, then it
alone must be that fine linen, wherein the lambs bride is arayed; and it
must be the fine linen, that is clean and white, for this fine linen is said
to be the Righteousness of the saints <hi>Revel.</hi> 19: 8. But that cannot be
because our Faith is not so pure, as that it may be called clean &amp; white
linen; the Saints themselves are ashamed of their faith, as being so full
of blemishes and imperfections; as also because this favour granted to
her to be arayed in this linen, cometh in after that she hath made her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:104357:153"/>
ready <hi>vers.</hi> 7. which (as Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> on the place sheweth)
is to be meaned of Faith.</p>
               <p>26. All this work about the Imputation of Faith taken properly, for our
act of Beleeving, is made of purpose, to shoot out the Imputation of the
Righteousness of Christ; as is clear by <hi>Iohn Goodwines</hi> whole disput; &amp; from
his very stateing of the question <hi>part. 1. pag.</hi> 7. saying. <hi>But the Question in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
termes is this. Whether the Faith of him, who truely beleeves in Christ, or
whether the Righteousness of Christ himself be in the letter &amp; propriety of it, that
which God imputes to a beleever for righteousness, or unto righteousness, in his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</hi>
Now let any judge which of the two hath more countenance in
Scripture, when the one, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Imputation of Faith, is but to be
drawn, with any show of probability, from one place of Scripture (and
yet how small countenance that giveth to it shall be seen hereafter) and the
other is so emphatically expressed, in so many places, both in the <hi>Old &amp;
New Testament;</hi> And which of the two deserve most the name of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
in order to our Justification: and the Imputation of which of the
two is most consonant unto the genius of the Gospel Covenant, which we must
suppose to be far different from the Nature &amp; Constitution of the Covenant
of Life, made with <hi>Adam;</hi> &amp; withall, which of the two wayes speaketh
out most distinctly the riches of the Love &amp; Grace of God, &amp; giveth most
sure ground of hope &amp; Confidence unto a poor wakened and distressed Soul;
&amp; <hi>finally,</hi> which of the two is that, which the seriously exercised Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
dar with fixedness of Resolution, Lean the weight of his soul upon, &amp;
exercised Christians finde to be that, whereupon they Loaning &amp; resting
finde Peace, &amp; Quietness of Soul?</p>

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:104357:154"/>
in a juridical sense to wit for absolution: but in a physical or moral sense, for
making of a man compleetly just &amp; righteous.</hi> Ans. What <hi>Swencfeldus</hi> said, I
finde not recorded by <hi>Zanchie</hi> in the place cited, in my edition, &amp; if his
words be rightly repeeted in the margine, he hath had the same judgment,

That the <hi>minor</hi> &amp; its Probation speak not of the act of God Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,

so. And beside, though Justification it self were here understood: yet it
might be said, without any ground of imputation either of <hi>Popery</hi> or of

of such an act, but of a Justification, as to State, and of a corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding
Righteousness, which must be universal, answerable to the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge

a Righteousness by God, who is Truth &amp; Justice it self, in order to the

who truely beleeveth, with as much grace &amp; favour, &amp; intends to do as bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
by him, as if he were a man of perfect righteousness. Ans.</hi> But this <hi>Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
should have said, that Faith in the <hi>letter &amp; formality</hi> of it, is imputed;
for thus he disputes against the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness: and
he should have said, that God looketh upon the simple act of Faith, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Obedience to all the Law: for when we plead for the Imputation of
Christ's Righteousness, he said, that thereby we make God to look upon
us, as performing that Righteousness, in our own persons. Neither will
he &amp; others understand any other Imputation: and yet we see, how they
can speak, when explaining the imputation of faith, that they may think
to evite the force of an argument. But (2) though it be true, that God
dealeth thus, as is said, with Beleevers; Yet that can give no ground to
think, that he imputeth Faith for Righteousness: because it is not upon the
account of Faith, taken as an act of their obedience, that the Lord dealeth
so with them, but upon the account of the Righteousness of Christ imputed
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:104357:154"/>
to them, and received by faith. (3) A Justified person is accounted Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
not inherently but imputativly, and is accepted as such, and pronunced
such; and therefore must be righteous indeed: for the judgment of God is
according to truth: And if nothing be imputed to the justified, but his faith,
unto Righteousness, that faith must be accounted to be a Perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
which yet it is denied to be.</p>
               <p>He <hi>Excepteth 4. Nothing is more frequent with the best writers, than that God
accounts those just, who, in strickness of speach, are not such, but only have their
sinnes forgiven them. Ans.</hi> And their ground is good; because they alwayes
suppose, that such, as have their sins pardoned, have a perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
imputed to them, and received by Faith, without which their could be
no Pardon.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. If faith should be imputed for Righteousness, then should Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification

                  </gap> or by some what in our selves. But the Scripture
every where rejecteth works, &amp; all things in our selves from having any thing
to do in Justification.</p>
               <p>He excepteth. <hi>That by works or some what in ourselves may be understood either
by way of merite, and in this sense the</hi> Consequence <hi>of the</hi> Proposition <hi>is false; or
by way of simple performance, &amp; then the</hi> Assumption <hi>is false, for the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
expresly requireth faith, or a work of us, in order to Iustification.</hi> When
Faith is required in order to Justification, in way of simple performance, it
is not required, as our Righteousness, far less as all the Righteousness, which
the Justified soul must have; but only as a mean, or Instrument, laying
hold upon, and putting on the Righteousness of Christ, which is offered and
imputed, and whereby the beleever resteth upon, and wrappeth himself in
that Righteousness, as the only Righteousness, wherein he can think to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before God's tribunal, and thus Faith is not considered as our act, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up our Righteousness, but as bringing in, with a begger's hand, a
Righteousness from without. But when faith or Beleeving is purely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
as our work, and as an act of obedience in us, and yet is called our
Righteousness, &amp; said to be all that Righteousness, which is had, &amp; is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
in order to Justification, it justifieth as a work; &amp; upon the account
of it, as something in our selves, we are said to be justified; &amp; all this in
perfect opposition to the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness (2) It is but a
Popish evasion to say, that by <hi>Iustification by works,</hi> the Scripture only mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
justification by works, that are meritorious; as if either any work of
ours what somever could be meritorious; or as if such, against whom <hi>Paul</hi>
disputed, did meane a meritoriousness in their works; or as if the Scripture
did not inferre merite from every work, that is ours, and that we do to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
up a Righteousness by, upon the account of which we might be justified.
Saith not the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 4. <hi>Now to him that worketh, is the reward not recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of grace, but of debt,</hi> inferring debt &amp; so merite from all works that we
do, whereby to patch up a Righteousness, in order to Iustification? He
doth not distinguish betwixt works, that are by way of merite, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
works, but meaneth even such works, as were performed by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi>
who was far from imagineing any merite is his works. (3.) And
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:104357:155"/>
sure, if any work be accounted meritorius, in this case, that must be so
accounted, which is made the whole of our Righteousness, upon which
we are justified; &amp; is said to be the only Righteousness, that is imputed
to us, for that end, that we may be Justified. <hi>Is</hi> not that beleeving ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
our Righteousness, &amp; thereby declared to be no less meritorious, than
<hi>Adam's</hi> perfect Obedience would have been?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. That which maketh justification not to be of grace, cannot
stand with the truth of the Gospel. But the imputation of Faith for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
maketh Justification not to be of Grace.</p>
               <p>He <hi>excepteth, The Scripture still maketh a perfect consistency of free grace with
the condition of saith Eph.</hi> 2: 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 24, 25. <hi>Nay the work of beleeving is
purposely required, that the freeness of his grace might have place Rom.</hi> 4: 16.
<hi>How can a gift be conceived to be more freely given, than when nothing more is
required, than that it be received: now beleeving is nothing else, but a receiving
of that righteousness or</hi> justification, <hi>which God giveth in &amp; with his Son Iesus
Christ Iob.</hi> 1: 12. <hi>Ans.</hi> Here are good words, but nothing to loose the
argument, for Faith, receiving a Righteousness, or the gift of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
or the Atonement, or Christ &amp; his Righteousness, is but the
instrument (as it were) of the soul, laying hold on, &amp; in law presenting
(to speak so) the fidejussorie-righteousness of the Surety, Christ, as the
Righteousness, upon the account of which, &amp; for which alone, he is to
be justified. But beleeving, considered in it self, as our work, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
to be our Righteousness, &amp; all our Righteousness, &amp; said to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
for our Righteousness, is not considered as a receiving of a gift of
Righteousness; (which is distinct from Justification, howbeit he confound
them) but really is made a price in our hand, wherewith to purchase the
gift of Justification; &amp; the reckoning of this work to us (which is our
work) as our Righteousness, in order to justification, maketh Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not of grace, but of debt, as the Apostle argueth <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 4. &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
our Justification to be of works, &amp; if it be of works, it is no more
of grace, as the Apostle asserteth <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 6. The consideration of Faith,
as the act of the soul, receiving &amp; laying hold upon a Righteousness,
or on Christ, &amp; his Righteousness, establisheth the Imputation of Christs
Righteousness; but the Imputation of Faith, properly taken doth qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
extrude it: &amp; these two are made incompatible by our adversaries;
&amp; the one is asserted, that the other may be denied; for which there we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
no necessity, if Faith were considered, in the Scripture sense, as it
ought to be, that is an Instrument laying hold on &amp; bringing in a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
from without, even the Surety-Righteousness of Christ. So
that this exception, if it be ingenuous, must overthrow the Position main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>

of Faith for Righteousness doth minister occasion to the flesh of boasting
Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He <hi>excepteth, Suppose the act of beleeving, which is so imputed for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:104357:155"/>
be a mans own work, yet it is so by the meer gift of God</hi> Ephes. 2: 8.
Phil. 1: 29. 1 Cor. 2: 12. &amp; 3: 6. <hi>and this cuttech off all groud of boasting.</hi> 1.
Cor. 4: 7. <hi>Ans.</hi> (1) Though there be no true ground of boasting of that,
which is freely given; yet the flesh can take occasion therefrom to boast, as
the <hi>Pharisee</hi> did <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. when yet he acknowledged all to be gives, for he
thanked God for what he was not, &amp; for what he did, &amp; so acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
all to be given, and all to be given freely. (2) The Apostle saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
that boasting is not excluded by the Law of works <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 27. and
yet all works are given, &amp; are not absolutely of &amp; from our selves. (3) Saith
not the Apostle expresly. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 2. <hi>If Abraham were justified by works, he
hath to glory:</hi> And yet I hope, Abraham did acknowledge, that all these
works of his were of grace, &amp; of God's free gift, and not absolutly &amp; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way his own. (4) The works, required in the old Covenant of works,
were not absolutely <hi>Adam's</hi> own, but were in some sense also given of God;
yet by that way of Justification, there had been ground of boasting. (5)
Though now there should be no ground of boasting before God; (as neither
would there have been ground of boasting before him, by the way of works;
for the Apostle addeth <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 2. <hi>but not before God</hi>) yet there is ground laid
for boasting before men, when our Beleeving is made our Righteousness,
upon the account of which we are justified &amp; pronunced righteous in order
to Absolution from what was brought in against us. (6) Therefore is the way
of Justification now so contrived, that man should have ground or coloure
of ground of boasting, even before men: for all that Righteousness, which
is required unto Justification, as that Righteousness upon the account of
which they are to be justified, and by which only they are to be declared &amp;
pronunced Righteous, is not in them; but in another and imputed unto
them; it is the Righteousness of Christ made over unto them of God's free
grace, &amp; received by Faith, which receiving hand is also given: so that
the Righteousness, upon which all are justified, is one &amp; the same, &amp; is a
Righteousness without them; &amp; therefore the flesh hath no seeming occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of boasting in this matter.</p>
               <p>He <hi>excepteth 2. Suppose the act of beleeving were from a mans self, yet there
were no cause of boasting; because that weight of glory is not given to faith for any
worth in it, but by the most free gracious &amp; good pleasure of God. If a King for
taking a Pin of a Mans sleeve should raise his house, &amp; make him honourable in the
State, were it not a ridiculous thing for such a man to brag of the Pin of his slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
&amp;c. Ans.</hi> (1) Can we think, that those, against whom the Apostle dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
in this matter, did think, that there was worth &amp; excellency in all
their works, to merite the exceeding great &amp; eternal weight of glory? did
<hi>Abraham</hi> think so. And yet though we cannot say, that he thought so, <hi>Paul</hi>
not withstanding denieth, that he was justified by his works. (2) If the act of
Beleeving were from a Mans self, &amp; made all that Righteousness, which he
is conceived to have when justified, &amp; upon the account of which he is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
he should not only have occasion, but even cause of boasting before
men, notwithstanding of the disproportion betwixt faith &amp; the weight of
glory: for it might then be said, that he had made himself to differ; &amp; that
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:104357:156"/>
he had laid down, out of his own purpose, the whole price, that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and so had, according to the termes of the Compact, made a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of glory to himself: as the man with the pin in his sleeve, if the Law
&amp; Covenant had so stood, that all that gave the Prince a Pin out of his slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,
shall receive such &amp; such great things; &amp; he only &amp; a few moe were so
good merchants, as to give the Pin, when others did not, might well have
boasted &amp; said, he had not gotten those great things for nothing, for he
laid down the full price, condescended upon by Law &amp; Covenant, and had
ground of boasting, at least, before men, though not before the Prince,
who graciously condescended to reward so richly such a mean gift. (3) This
answere will say, that there had been no ground of boasting, even by the
old Covenant of works, though man had keeped the Law perfectly: for
even then, it might have been said, that the weight of glory was not given,
for the really worth &amp; excellency of perfect Obedience; Perfect Obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
&amp; Holiness having its sufficient reward in its own besome; for it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to it self.</p>
               <p>But he saith. <hi>If men had fulfilled the Law, &amp; bin justified that way, there had
been some pretence of boasting or glorying in themselves. Ans.</hi> And why not also,
if faith be now accounted the fulfilling of the Law, and be now imputed to
us, as all our Righteousness? Let us see, if the reasons, which he bringeth
for the former, will not also evince this.</p>
               <p>His <hi>first</hi> is this; <hi>Because such a Righteonsness had held some proportion at
least that should have been given to it</hi> Rom. 4. vers 4. <hi>God had given
them no more, than what they had (at least in some sort) deserved. Ans.</hi> But
who can tell us, what that <hi>proportion,</hi> or that <hi>sort</hi> would have been? And
may not also the Righteousness of Faith (which is here supposed to be of our
selves, and not the meer gift of God) be said to hold some proportion, at
least in some fort? Yea, may it not, in this respect, be said to hold a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
proportion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the exerting of the act of Faith now would argue
more strength of free will, to that which is good, that Perfect Obedience
in <hi>Adam;</hi> for though we should suppose, that man now had as full a power
to beleeve, if he would, as <hi>Adam</hi> had to obey, yet it cannot be denied,
but there is much more opposition now even within, to that which is good,
than there was in <hi>Adam;</hi> and consequently that the vertue appearing in the
acting of Faith, must be conceived as greater, than what could have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in <hi>Adam's</hi> full obedience, who had nothing within to oppose him, or
prove a <hi>remora</hi> in his way? As it would argue more valour for a weak souldier
to go a quarter of a mile fighting with his enemies in the way, then for a
giant to go twentie miles, wherein he should meet with no opposition. But
though the proportion were granted to be greater betwixt the reward and
<hi>Adam's</hi> Obedience; than is betwixt the reward &amp; Faith; yet there must be
&amp; will be a proportion granted: for <hi>majus &amp; minus non variant speciem,</hi> degrees
make no variation in kinde. (2) Can or will it be said, that God had given
the perfect obeyer no more, than he had, in some sort at least, deserved, if
we should suppose, there had been no promise made of such a reward to
obeyers, or antecedently to a Covenant? And if this cannot be said (as it
cannot be said, by any I suppose, who seriously consider the matter) then
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:104357:156"/>
the reward was made such only by God's free Condescension; &amp; God had,
in that case, given what they had deserved according to the Covenant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
wherein such a reward was promised to obeyers; and, in justice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
it as a reward upon such, as did fulfill the condition. Now, when
Faith is said to have the same place, in the New Covenant, that Perfect
Obedience had in the old, and so the same Efficacy &amp; influence in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
&amp; withall, it is supposed, that Faith is now no more the gift of
God, than Perfect Obedience was under the old Law; is it not as true now,
that God giveth no more, than what beleevers have by Faith (at least in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
sort) deserved, by vertue of the Compact &amp; New Covenant, wherein
this reward is promised, as it would have been under the old Covenant? And
is it not hence also manifest, that the New Covenant is made to be of the
same Nature with the Old, and that the reward is as well now of debt, as is
would have been by the Old Covenant? Is it not also hence undeniable, that
hereby there is a proportion acknowledged, in some sort, betwixt Faith &amp;
the Reward? where is then the difference? Let us see, if his next reason
will helpe here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> (he saith) <hi>because if they had made out their happiness, that way
they had done it out of themselves, that is, out of the strength of those abilities,
which were essential to their Natures, &amp; in the strickest &amp; most proper sense that
can be spoken of, or applied to a creature, their owne. Ans.</hi> (1) When he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
(as we saw in the Exception) the act of Beleeving to be from a mans
self, must we not also say, that the beleever making out his happiness this
way, doth it out of himself, though not out of the strength of abilities es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
to his Nature. (2) I much doubt, if those abilities (if he speak of
moral abilities, as he must, or speak nothing to the purpose) can be said to
have been essential to mans Nature, for then it would follow, that man,
after he lost these abilities (as it must be granted he did, when he fell) was
no more a compleet man, wanting something that was essential to his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.
These abilities may be said to have been natural or con-natural to him,
considering the state, the Lord thought good to create him in, and so not
meerly supernatural; but how they can be said to have been Essential to his
Nature, I see not. (2) When God gave <hi>Adam</hi> these Abilities, and thereby
furnished him with a sufficient stock; was he not to acknowledge God for all
that he did? or was he afterward to act without dependance upon, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
from God, the first Cause? If not as it is confessed, when it is <hi>said
to be so only in a sense, that can agree to a creature;</hi> and when Faith is here sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be from mans self acting in the same dependance on God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the same influence from him, as the first Cause, may not Faith also
be said to be mans own, in as strick &amp; proper a sense as can be spoken of, or
applied to a Creature? And even though we speak of Faith, in the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
sense, as being the gift of God, yet seing it floweth nativly from the
new Nature given in Regeneration, &amp; is said to be mans faith, &amp; his act,
all this difference will not exclude all occasion of boasting &amp; glorying before
men, more then <hi>Abraham's</hi> works would have done, if he had been justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by them. And yet the Gospel-way of Justification perfectly excludeth
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:104357:157"/>
all boasting, being so contrived in all points, as that he who glorieth may
only glory in the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. If Faith be imputed unto us for Righteousness, then are we ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by that, which is Imperfect, &amp; which it self needeth a Pardon; seing
no mans Faith is perfect in this life. But there is no Justification to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for before God by that which is Imperfect, but by that, which is Perfect.
Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He <hi>excepteth. These words then, we are Iustified by that, which is imperfect,
may either have this sense, that we are justified without the concurrence of any thing,
that is simply perfect, to our justification, or that somewhat that is comparativ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imperfect, may some wayes concurre &amp; contribute towards our justification. In
the first sense the proposition is false, in the later sense the assumption goeth to wreck
Ans.</hi> This distinction is to no purpose; for it doth not loose the difficulty, in
regard that the argument speaketh of a Righteousness, as the <hi>formal cause,</hi>
or as the <hi>formal objective cause</hi> of Justification, or as that upon the account of
which the person is Pronunced &amp; Declared to be Righteous, and Justified:
and so is levelled against Faith, concluding that it cannot be our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or the formal Objective cause of our justification (as it is said and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be by such, as say, that it is imputed to us for Righteousness, for it is
made by them to be all the Righteousness that is imputed to us) &amp; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of its Weakness &amp; Imperfection.</p>
               <p>He addeth, in application of this distinction. <hi>The truth is, that the</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of faith for Righteousness <hi>presupposeth somewhat, that absolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
as absolutly necessary unto justification. Had not the Lord Christ, who is
perfect himself, made a perfect atonement for sin, there had been no place for the
Imputation of faith for righteousness, for it is through this, that either we beleeve
in him or in God through him; &amp; it is through the same atonement also, that God
justifieth us upon our beleeving, that is, imputes our faith unto us for righteousness.
Ans.</hi> This presupposal doth not helpe the matter; for notwithstanding the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof,
Faith it self is made the only Imputed Righteousness; and faith is not
considered as an Instrument, receiving Christ's Righteousness; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
there through, but as a work, making the reward of the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be of debt, <hi>ex pacto,</hi> and not of free grace, and so to have a worth
&amp; a merite in it. Our Adversaries will not grant, that this presupposed
Righteousness of Christ, whereby the perfect Atonement was made, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
unto us; for this is expresly denied: and beside, they say, that it was
equally made for all, and so is equally imputed to all; so far, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
all are put into such a state, as, notwitstanding of the former breach
made, they may now, upon the new termes of Faith, receive the promised
reward. And thus, it is manifest that with them, this imperfect thing,
saith is that, for &amp; upon the account of which, they are justified. As for
example (that we may hereby illustrate &amp; cleare the matter) if we should
suppose, that Christ had by his Atonement delivered all from wrath, due
for the former transgression of the Covenant, and had put them into the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
state, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was, before he fell, &amp; procured that God should
take a new essay of them, and make promise of life unto them, upon the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:104357:157"/>
old termes (as some, who plead for Universal Redemption, say God might
have done, had he so pleased, after the Atonement was made) in this case,
might it not be said that every person, that should now be Justified, upon
the performance of these termes, were justified by the performance of the
Condition, as by his own Righteousness; &amp; that this new Obedience were
all the Righteousness he had, &amp; declared to have, when justified? &amp; should
he not be justified upon the account thereof solely? And was he more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
unto the Atonement of Christ, than others, who did violate of new
these Conditions? And seing now Faith is put in the same place, and made
to have the same Force &amp; Efficacy; shall we not now be Justified by this one
act of Obedience, as we would have been, in the other case, by perfect
Obedience? And if it be so, is it not manifest, that we are justified by a
Righteousness, that is Imperfect, &amp; that all the presupposal of a perfect A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement,
doth not availe? (2) When it is said, that it is through the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement,
made by Christ, that we beleeve in him, or in God through
him, it must be granted, that Christ hath purchased Faith, &amp; that either
to all, or to some, and if to all, then either absolutly, or upon condition
if to all, &amp; that absolutly, then all should have faith; if upon condition,
we desire to know, what that condition is? If not to all, but to some only,
then Christ cannot be said to have died alike for all. (3) as to that he faith,
<hi>viz. That it is through the same atonement, that God imputeth our faith to us, for
righteousness, &amp; justifieth us upon our beleeving,</hi> it being the same that others
say, who tell us, that Christ hath procured faith to be the condition &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of the new Covenant, we shall say no more now, than that we see no
ground to asserte any such thing, &amp; here after we shall give our reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum. 6. If faith be imputed to us for Righteousness, then God should rather
receive a Righteousness from us, then we from him, in our Iustification. But God

               <p>He <hi>excepteth</hi> by denying the consequence upon these reasons. (1) <hi>Because
God's imputing Faith for righteousness doth no wayes implye that faith is a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
properly so called, but only that God by the meanes thereof, &amp; upon the
tender of it, looks upon us as righteous, yet not as made either meritoriously, or
formally righteous by it, but as having performed that condition or Covenant, upon
the performance whereof he hath promised to make us righteous, meritoriously by the
death &amp; sufferings of his owne son; formally with the pardon of all our sins. Ans.</hi>
All this can give no satisfaction, for. (1) If no Righteousness be imputed to
us, in order to Justification, but Faith, and if faith it self be hereby made
no Righteousness, then we are justified without any Righteousness at all;
&amp; God shall be said to pronunce them Righteous, who have no Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
at all; or Justification must be some other thing, than a pronunceing or
declaring of a man Righteous. (2) Why have we heard so much above said
for Faiths being Righteousness &amp; why have there been so many passages of
Scripture adduced to confirme this, particuiarly such as mention the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of faith, or the Righteousness of God by faith? But it may be,
this <hi>salvo</hi> is added, a <hi>Righteousness properly so called:</hi> Yet then it will follow,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:104357:158"/>
that it must be, at least, a Righteousness improperly so called, and that
must be an improper speach, faith is imputed for righteousness, and if that
be an improper speech, why is there so much noise made about the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety
of the speech, when we take Faith for the object of faith, in that
sentence, <hi>faith imputed unto righteousness?</hi> All that great clamoure must now
recurre upon the excepter, and his followers. (3) If this, which he hath
given, be the meaning of these words, <hi>faith imputed unto righteousness,</hi> let any
judge, whether our sense of them, or this be most genuine, &amp; freest of
trops &amp; figures, &amp; which of the two is apparently farthest fetched. (4) Faith
then, it seemeth, is tendered unto God, &amp; faith being but a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
improperly so called, we tender unto God, in our Justification a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
only, that is improper, &amp; thereupon are declared Righteous,
whether properly, or improperly, I know not. (5) If upon the tender of
Faith, God look upon us as Righteous, then we m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st be righteous; for we
must be what he seeth, &amp; acknowledgeth us to be: And then I ask, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth he look upon us, as properly Righteous, or as improperly Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous?
(6) If God look upon us, as having fulfilled the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
&amp; as Righteous upon that account, then he must look upon us, as
properly righteous &amp; faith must be a proper righteousness; or he must say,
that Christ hath purchased, that an improper Righteousness shall be the
Condition of the Covenant, for we heard, he said, that Christ had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased,
that Faith should be the condition. But the performance of the
Condition of God's Covenant must be hold for a proper Righteousness, as
perfect obedience was under the first Covenant. And we heard lately, that
Faith was truely &amp; properly called a Righteousness, &amp; that it might be so
called with truth, &amp; in sufficient propriety of speech, in his answere to the
first argument. (7) If we be righteous by faith, &amp; be looked upon, as such
by God, having performed the condition of the Covenant, it is not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
how we shall not be, if not <hi>meritoriously,</hi> yet at least <hi>formally</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;
seing as <hi>Adam</hi> by Perfect Obedience, would have performed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of that Covenant, under which he was, and thereby had been both
Meritoriously &amp; formally Righteous; so must it be now, in respect of faith,
which is made to have the same place, force &amp; efficacy, in the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and that through the procurment of Christ, that Perfect Obedience
had in the old Covenant. (8) He saith, <hi>we are made meritoriously righteous by
Christ's sufferings.</hi> But what is the meaning of this? Is this the meaning
thereof, that Christ's sufferings hath merited a Righteousness to us? Then
hereby nothing is spoken to the point; for we are not now speaking of Christ's
Righteousness, but of ours. And againe I would enquire, what Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
hath it merited unto us? Whether a meritorious Righseousness, or
a formal Righteousness (as he distinguishad) or both? Or is the meaning
this, That through Christ's merites &amp; sufferings, we have a Righteousness,
which is meritorious? If so, I enquire, what is that Righteousness? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it Christ's Righteousness imputed to us, &amp; made ours; or is it our
Faith that becometh meritorious? If this <hi>last</hi> be said, that is granted, which
was denied; &amp; Faith must be accounted our meritorious Righteousness. If
the <hi>former</hi> be said, imputation of Christ's Righteousness will be granted, &amp;
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:104357:158"/>
more than we dar say. (9) He saith, we are made formally righteous, with
the pardon of sins: But this is never proved, and it hath been often asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
And how will he make this a Formal Righteousness, &amp; Righteousness
properly so called? Is this any conformity to a Law, in whole, or in part?
Did not himself insinuat in his answere to the first <hi>Argum.</hi> that nothing can
with truth, and in sufficient propriety of speech, be called a Righteousness
but what is a conformity to the Law of God? And sure I am, Pardon of sins
is not any such conformitie. (10) The summe of this answere is, this Faith is
not imputed, as a Righteousness; but it is said to be imputed unto Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
because it is the fulfilling of the Condition of the new Covenant,
whereby we come to be made Righteous meritoriously by Christ's death, &amp;
Righteous formally with the pardon of sins. And what a wiredrawn, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
&amp; self-contradictory sense this is, let every one judge.</p>
               <p>He denieth the consequence. 2. Because, <hi>suppose that this inference lay in
the bowels of what we hold, that faith were</hi> a proper righteousness; <hi>yet neither
would this argue, that therefore God should receive</hi> a righteousness <hi>from us, in</hi>
our justification; <hi>for we rather receive our faith from God</hi> for our justification,
<hi>shen God from us,</hi> in our justification; <hi>though I grant that in a sense a far off,
&amp; with much adoe, it may (haply) be made a truth, that God receives our faith
from us in our justification. Ans.</hi> But, sure, though <hi>Adam's</hi> obedience was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
from God &amp; efficiently, he being the First Cause; yet had <hi>Adam</hi>
been justified, according to that Old Covenant, he had been justified by
his own works, &amp; not by the Righteousness of another, bestowed on him
by God; so he had been said to have presented his own Righteousness unto
God, in order to his justification, and God might have been said to have
received it from him, in his justification, or rather, in order thereunto.
Now, just so is it here, as to Faith: for faith is our work, &amp; we come with
it to God, &amp; he taketh it from us, &amp; thereupon justifieth us, according to
our Adversaries opinion, not in a sense a far off, or made with much ado,
as he supposeth, but in a sense most plaine &amp; obvious.</p>
               <p>He saith lastly. <hi>That that imputation of faith for righteousness, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecteth,
supposeth a righteousness given unto &amp; received by men, because it could not
be truely said, that God doth impute faith for righteousness unto any man, except
he should make him righteous upon his beleeving. Now, as it is impossible, that a
man should be made righteous without a righteousness in one kinde or other; so is it
impossible also, that that righteousness, wherewith a man is made righteous in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
should be derived upon him from any other, but from God alone, for this
righteousness can be none other, but forgiveness of sins. Ans.</hi> (1) How can the
Imputation of Faith suppose a Righteousness given, unless the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be given, before Faith be imputed, seing what is supposed is alwayes
first in order of nature, if not also in order of time? And if matters be thus,
sins are first forgiven, and then Faith is imputed. (2) If the supposing of a
righteousness will follow, <hi>to wit</hi> Remission of sins, then there is no answere
to the argument, for the argument speaketh of a Righteousness anterior to
Justification, and in order there unto. (3) It is againe said, but was never
proved, that to forgive sins is to give a Righteousness. And I would ask,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:104357:159"/>
what for a Righteousness this pardon of sins is? is it a Righteousness perper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so called? But that cannot be, for all such Righteousness consisteth in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Law: therefore it must be a Righteousness improperly so called,
&amp; if so, it cannot be called our formal righteousness, as he said it was.
(4) When he saith, <hi>we are made righteous in justification,</hi> &amp; yet will not grant
an Imputed Righteousness, and his Remission of sins is not yet found to be
a proper Righteousness, the sense must either be Popish, or none
at all.</p>
               <p>I shall not here adde other reasons against this Assertion, whereby it might
be made manifest, how dangerous this Opinion is, if it be put in practice;
&amp; how it tendeth to alter the Nature of the Covenant of Grace: It may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
at present, that we have vindicated these few reasons against it, &amp; that
we have found it, in the foregoing <hi>Chapter,</hi> inconsistent with the doctrine
of grace, in the New Testament &amp; repugnant to the Nature of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as declared &amp; explained to us by the Apostle: and that we shall finde
it, in the next Chapter, without any footing in the Apostles discourse <hi>Rom.</hi>
4. which is the only place adduced for its confirmation.</p>

               <p>THe maine, if not only ground, whereupon our Adversaries build
their Assertion of the Imputation of our act of Beleeving, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.
where they tell us, the Apostle doth frequently &amp; expresly say, that
<hi>Faith is imputed unto Righteousness.</hi> We must therefore, in order the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of truth, vindicate this place from their corrupt glosses; &amp; to this
end, we shall <hi>first</hi> show, that that can not be the meaning of the Apostle,
in this place, which our Adversaries contend for; &amp; <hi>next</hi> we shall examine
what they say to enforce their Exposition of the place.</p>
               <p>That the meaning of the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. where it is said <hi>Abraham beleeved
God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness:</hi> &amp; afterward <hi>his faith is
counted for righteousness,</hi> and <hi>faith was counted to Abraham for righteousness &amp;c.</hi>
is not that Abraham's act of beleeving was accounted the Righteousness,
whereupon he was accepted, &amp; was imputed unto him as a Righteousness
in order to his justification; and consequently, that the act of Beleeving is
now imputed to Beleevers for their Righteousness, as said <hi>Servetus, Socinus</hi>
&amp; his followers, <hi>Arminius</hi> &amp; his followers, <hi>Papists,</hi> &amp; others; that, I say,
this is not the true meaning of the place, may appear from these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>1. If the act of Beleeving be accounted a Righteousness, it must either be
accounted a Perfect Righteousness, or an Imperfect Righteousness: If it be
accounted for an Imperfect Righteousness, no man can be thereupon Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:104357:159"/>
But <hi>Paul</hi> is speaking of a righteousness that was accounted to <hi>Abraham</hi>
the father of the faithful, in order to Justification, &amp; that behoved to be a
perfect righteousness, for all his works, wherein was an Imperfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
were rejected: It cannot be accounted for a perfect righteousness,
because then it should be accounted to be,what it is not, and this accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
being an act of God's judgment, it would follow, that the judgment of
God, were not according to truth; contrare to <hi>Rom.</hi> 2: 2. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our faith is not perfect in it self, there being much drosse admixed, &amp;
many degrees wanting in it: far lesse can it be a Perfect Righteousness,
seing a Perfect Righteousness must comprehend full Obedience to the whole
Law of God.</p>
               <p>2. The Imputation, whereof the Apostle speaketh, is of some thing to
be made the Beleevers, by the Imputation of God, which the Beleever had
not before: But this cannot be Faith, or the work of Beleeving, because
Faith is ours before this Imputation; for <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved God, &amp; then
followed this Imputation; and <hi>vers.</hi> 24. it is said, that it (<hi>to wit,</hi> some
other thing, than the act of beleeving) <hi>shall be imputed to us, if we belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve:</hi>
therefore it is not the act of Beleeving, properly taken, that is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or accounted here.</p>
               <p>3. Faith being antecedent to this Imputation, if the act of Beleeving be
imputed, the word <hi>impute,</hi> or <hi>account</hi> here, must not signifie to Bestow,
Grant or Reckon upon their score; but simply to Esteem, Judge or Repute:
and thus Faith, or the act of beleeving shall be in a beleever, and yet not be
a Righteousness, till God repute it, to be so: But when God esteemeth,
judgeth, or reputeth any thing to be in us, he doth not change it, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
it something, that it was not before; but judgeth it to be, what it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
for his judgment is according to truth <hi>Rom.</hi> 2: 2.</p>
               <p>4. This sense &amp; glosse is quite opposite unto, and inconsistent with the
Apostles maine scope, in the first part of that Epistle, which is to prove,
that Righteousness is now revealed from faith to faith <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: 17. and that
we are not Justified by the works of the Law, but freely by grace, through
the Redemption that is in Jesus Christ, whom God hath set forth to be a
Propitiation through faith in his blood <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 24, 25. And therefore not
through the Imputation of Faith, the act of Beleeving, or any work of
Righteousness, which we have done: for that should not exclude boasting,
or glorying; but through the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by Faith.</p>
               <p>5. That which was accounted to <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteousness, did exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
all works, and that to the end, that all ground of boasting, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men, might be take, away <hi>vers.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. Therefore Faith as a work, or
the act of beleeving can not be it, which is here said to be reckoned or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteousness: for this is a work, and being made
the Ground &amp; Formal Objective Cause of justification, can not but give
ground of glorving before men.</p>
               <p>6. This glosse maketh the Apostles discourse wholly incoherent; for he
saith <hi>vers. 4, 5. Now to him, that worketh, is the reward not reckoned ef grace,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:104357:160"/>
but of debt: but to him, that worketh not, but beleeveth on him, that justifieth
tht ungodly, his faith is counted for Righteousnese.</hi> Now if Faith, properly
taken, be imputed, the reckoning shall be of just debt: for to reckon a
men righteous, who is righteous antecedent to that act of accounting, is
no act of grace, but of just debt: but Faiths being accounted for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is an act of grace, and therefore it must be the Object of Faith, or
the Righteousness, that Faith laith hold on, that is here said to be counted
upon the Beleevers score; and this indeed is no act of just debt, but of
grace.</p>
               <p>7. Againe, as was said above, if Faith properly taken, or the act of
Beleeving be imputed for Righteousness, God should not be the justifier of
the ungodly; nor could Faith act upon God, as such, with truth. And yet
the Apostle tels us here expresly, that Faith acteth upon God, as one that
Justifieth the ungodly. He who hath a Righteousness in himself is no ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man; and God justifying a righteous man; could not be said to justifie
the ungodly. But if we take faith here, for the object of faith, or for the
Righteousness of Christ, which faith fleeth unto, and layth hold on, all is
clear &amp; harmonious; for then that man is not a worker, but beleeveth, &amp;
he beleeveth on God, that justifieth the ungodly, that is one, that hath no
Righteousness in himself, but must have it elsewhere, even imputed to
him, and bestowed upon him, through Faith; &amp; when he thus heleeveth,
or layelh hold on Christ's Righteousness, this Righteousness, which by
faith he leaneth to, is counted on his score for Righteousness, &amp; he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
justified.</p>
               <p>8. Leaving what was formerly adduced against this glosse from <hi>vers.</hi> 6, 7.
8. of this Chapter <hi>Chap.</hi> XVIII. we shall see what other passages in this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
will say against it. The Faith that was reckoned to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
when he was in uncircumcision, <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10. is the same with the
Righteousness of faith, which he had, being uncircumcised <hi>vers.</hi> 11. But this
Righteousness of faith is not his act of Beleeving, nor Faith taken properly,
as an act of Obedience; but the Righteousness of the promised seed of the
woman, in whom all Nations of the earth should be blessed, embraced by
faith: for it is this, and not the meer act of beleeving, that was sealed by
the signe of Circumcision <hi>vers.</hi> 11. for this Sacrament was a seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
&amp; we know, Sacraments seal the whole Covenant, &amp; all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
thereof, to such as beleeve; &amp; never seal our Faith, or the like, to
be our Righteousness.</p>
               <p>9. The same, that was imputed to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteousness will be
imputed to all beleevers <hi>vers.</hi> 11. But that is not the pure act of Beleeving;
for <hi>Abrahamt</hi> act of Beleeving was a strong act, and is declared and explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be such, but every beleever, who yet must be justified, hath not such
a strong act of faith, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had: And we cannot say, that some are les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
&amp; some are more justified, because the faith of some is weak, and the
faith of others is strong: and yet this must be said, if the act of Beleeving be
imputed for a Righteousness, for the Righteousness of one shall be greater
than the Righteousness of another: &amp; their Justification must hold correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with the ground thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:104357:160"/>
10. That which was imputed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; will be imputed to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,
for a Righteousness <hi>vers.</hi> 11. must be a Righteousness, which such
have imputed unto them, who do beleeve; for it is added, <hi>that he might be
the father of all them that beleeve, though they be not circumcised, that righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
might be imputed unto them also: Abraham</hi> had Righteousness imputed to
him, or reckoned upon his score, through faith, while he was uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
that he might be the Father of Beleevers, among the Gentiles, to
whom also, when they beleeve, a Righteousness will be imputed, as it was
to Father <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. It is againe called <hi>vers.</hi> 13. the <hi>Righteousness of faith,</hi> &amp; through it, he
sais, the promise was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; to his seed: but the promise is not
through faith, as an act of virtue &amp; obedience in us; for then it should be
through the Law; but as the promise was made upon the account of the
Righteousness of the promised seed, (our faith can not be said to procure,
or purchase the promise) so its application is by Faith, laying hold on &amp;
gripping to that Righteousness.</p>
               <p>12. If faith properly taken were imputed, it should be made void, &amp; the
promise of none effect, &amp; they that are of the Law should be heires, for
faith taken properly, for the act of Beleeving, belongeth to the Law: &amp;
when it is made our Righteousness, it is opposite to the free promise; for
what is promised or given upon the account of Righteousness, or any thing
within us, is not a free &amp; gracious promise: And when a free &amp; gracious
promise is taken away, all the right use of Faith is taken away; &amp; so Faith
is made void; for the very essence of justifying faith lyeth in looking to, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hold on &amp; leaning to a free &amp; gracious promise.</p>
               <p>13. The Apostle <hi>vers.</hi> 15. proveth, that they, who are of the Law, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be heirs; &amp; consequently that Faith, or the act of Beleeving cannot be
imputed for Righteousness, as it is our act, done in obedience to the Law;
by this reason, because <hi>the Law worketh wrath &amp;c.</hi> And this also maketh
against the Imputation of faith, properly taken, because that is an act of
obedience to the Law, &amp; cannot become our Righteousness, being Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
&amp; consequently not conforme to the Law, which requireth Perfection
in all duties, or other wayes threatneth wrath. And if any shall deny this
of faith <hi>viz.</hi> that it belongeth to the Law, they must say, that there is no
Law for it, &amp; consequently that not to beleeve is no sin, for the Apostle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<hi>where no Law is, there is no transgression.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. The ground of the free promise is that which must be Imputed, and
laid hold on by Faith: But that cannot be Faith properly taken, as our act;
for then the promise should not be of grace, as it is expresly said to be <hi>vers.</hi>
16. nor should it be sure, if it depended upon our faith, &amp; not upon that,
which faith laith hold on.</p>
               <p>These things, beside what was mentioned before from this same <hi>Chapter
vers.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 23, 24. may satisfie us, in this matter, and sufficiently evince,
that it is not the Apostles meaning, that Faith, properly taken, as our
act, or our act of Beleeving, is imputed unto Righteousness; but that the
Object of Faith or the Righteousness of Christ laid hold on, and applied
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:104357:161"/>
by Faith is that Righteousness which is reckoned upon the beleevers
score.</p>
               <p>Let us now, in the <hi>next</hi> place, see what the Adversaries say, to make us
beleeve, that <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. That our very act of Beleeving is imputed
to us for Righteousness: &amp; that thus the Apostle must be understood, &amp; not
as meaning the object of faith or the righteousness of Christ. The forecited
Author <hi>Iohn Goodwin of Iustifie. Part.1. Ch.</hi> 2. adduceth some grounds for
his glosse, which must be examined.</p>
               <p>His <hi>first</hi> ground is the <hi>letter of the Scripture, that speaks it once &amp; twice yea
a third &amp; a fourth time</hi> vers. 3, 9, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Certanely,</hi> saith he, <hi>there is not
any truth in Religion, not any article of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Christian beleefe, that can boast of the
letter of the Scripture, more full, expresse, &amp; pregnant for it. Ans.</hi> We finde
it only twice said, in express termes, that <hi>faith is counted for Righteousness
vers.</hi> 5. and againe <hi>vers.</hi> 9. that <hi>faith was reckoned to Abraham for Righteousness.</hi>
It is then too widely spoken, when he saith, that there is not any truth in
Religion, nor any article of the Christian Faith, that can boast of more
full, expresse &amp; pregnant letter of Scripture; yea even, though it were as
oft &amp; as expresse as he allegeth: but we must let many such confidente ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
passe with him. (2) The question is not touching the letter, or the
words; but the true meaning: &amp; if a truth be but once delivered, in the
Scriptures, it is sufficient to command our faith; but words never so oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
when corruptly glossed, yeeld no foundation to faith. We know,
what <hi>Papists</hi> say, of these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> which with them is as
full, expresse and pregnant a proof of their dream; as this passage of <hi>Paul's</hi>
is of our Adversaries fancies. And we know what <hi>Arrians</hi> say of these words
<hi>My Father is greater than I:</hi> And yet their false glosses cannot be embraced
for truthes, let them boast of expresse Scriptures, never so much. And

us see his <hi>next</hi> ground.</p>
               <p>2. Saith he. <hi>The scope of the place rejoiceth in the Interpretation given.</hi> I grant
indeed, that this is a good rule or interpreting of Scriptures; for it is as a
sure threed to lead us through many labyrinths: But, which is the miserie,
many imagine that to be the scope of the place, which is not so indeed; &amp;
thus perv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rting or mistaking the scope, they must needs pervert all. Yet let
us see, how he would make the scope contribute to his Notions. <hi>The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
maine drift</hi> (saith he) <hi>was to hedge up with thornes that false way of Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
which lay through works &amp; legal performances; &amp; with all to open and
discover the true way of justification, that is, to make known what they must do,
&amp; what God requireth of them to their justification; &amp; that is</hi> (as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6: 28, 29.)
<hi>faith or to beleeve in the proper &amp; formal signification, &amp; not the righteousness of
Christ, this he required of Christ himself, he requireth our faith in Christ himself,
&amp; nos in his righteousness. Ans. Paul's</hi> scope is indeed to hedge up all Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the Law, or by the works thereof, in subordination to this other,
of shewing, that in the Gospel, the Righteousness of God is revealed from
faith to faith <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: 17. And therefore he cannot speak, for the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Faith, in its proper &amp; formal signification; for that is a work, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:104357:161"/>
by the Law of God; &amp; the Imputation thereof is expresly alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by our adversaries, to shoot out the Righteousness of God, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
from faith to faith. (2) To say, that the Apostle here only requireth
faith in Christ, and not faith in his Righteousness, in order to Justification;
is either to divide Christ &amp; his Righteousness, or to give us an Historical
Faith, in stead of justifying Faith; that is such a faith in Christ as is the
faith of any other truth revealed in the Scriptures, such as the creation of
the world: And this is indeed to make a fundamental Alteration, in the
Gospel Covenant &amp; to destroy the true Nature of Justifying faith. (3) It is
true, the Apostle is withall shewing what we must do, in order to our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification;
but this no way impeacheth the interest of Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as the formal ground of the Justification of the ungodly; but rather
establisheth it: for he sheweth, that we are not now Justified by our doing,
or working, but by the Righteousness of Christ imputed to us, &amp; received
by Faith. (4) Though God doth not require of us the performance of the
Righteousness of Christ; yet he requireth of is, that we lay hold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
and be covered therewith by faith, that under that rob, we may
appear before our judge; for to this end, is Christ made of <hi>God unto us Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi>
and is become the <hi>Lord our Righteousness, 1. Cor.</hi> 1: 30. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23: 6.
And he requireth of us, that we renunce all our own Righteousness, in
this affaire, &amp; acknowledge the Righteousness of Christ the only Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
upon which we are to be justified, and therefore he willeth us to
say that <hi>in the Lord have we Righteousness. Esai.</hi> 45: 24. He is pleased to add
<hi>Therefore for Paul to have said, that the righteousness of Christ should be imputed
unto them, had been quite beside his scope.</hi> Why so? His telling them what
was required of themselves, maketh nothing against this, but doth rather
confirme it; for when faith is pressed upon us, it is clearly supposed, that
the Righteousness of Christ is Imputed, this being the peculiar work of
faith, as justifying, to bring in &amp; put on Christ's Righteousness: and so,
where our Redemption or Justification by Christ is mentioned, faith (though
it be not expresly mentioned) is to be understood, as the Mean or Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby the same is applied to us; as also the Redemption &amp; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ is to be understood, where Justification by faith is only
expressed: And as sometimes we finde both expresly mentioned; so both are
most emphatically comprehended and included, in that expression, now
under consideration. Such a glorious &amp; firme connexion is betwixt all these
Causes of our Justification, &amp; such a beautiful harmonie of grace, that as
they cannot be separated, so the deforming, misplaceing or any way alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any one piece thereof, destroyeth the harmonie, &amp; darkeneth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auty
of the whole.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place he argueth against faiths being here taken Tropically or
Metonymically &amp; to this end adduceth these confiderations 1. <hi>It is not likely
that the Apostle, in this great &amp; weighty point, should time after time, in one
place after another, without ever explaining himself, through out the whole dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
use such an harsh &amp; uncouth expression, or figure of speach, as is not to be
found in all his writting beside, nor in all the Scriptures. Ans.</hi> Figurative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:104357:162"/>
are neither harsh in themselves, being rather emphatically expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative,
and more forcible upon the understanding, as to the uptaking of
these mysteries; nor are they strange &amp; uncouth to the Apostle, even in this
matter, as might be abundantly evinced, almost as to every expression,
used in this matter, or at least, as to such expressions as are about the maine
parts thereof: Let any read <hi>Paul's</hi> writtings on this subject, here, &amp; his
Epistle to the <hi>Gallatians</hi> &amp; he shall finde this true, almost in every <hi>Chapter.</hi>
But it should satisfie us, that the Holy Ghost hath thought fit, to expresse the
matter thus; &amp; that to prevent mistakes, he hath given both here &amp; else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
abundance of clear, plaine, and down right expressions, for a
supply, as hath been shown above, so as none may mistake, but such as will
wilfully step aside to follow their own wayes: And it is not faire for such, to
object this, who, of all others, make the Scriptures to speak most figurativly
&amp; trop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cally, when they have a minde to evade the dint of our arguments
from Scripture; of which very many instances might be adduced. It cannot
but seem strange to any, who hath read the Scriptures with attention, to
hear one with such confidence saying, that the naming of the act for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is such an harsh &amp; uncouth expression &amp; figure of speach, as is not to be
found in all the Scriptures againe; when the same man hereafter cannot but,
confess that <hi>Hop</hi> is oft put for the thing hoped for, and is manifest from <hi>Rom.</hi>
8: 24. <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 5, 27. &amp; else where &amp; also faith put for Christ <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 23. twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
25. once. This putting the object for the act is a known and common
<hi>Hebraisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His 2. <hi>consideration</hi> is this: <hi>It is evident</hi> (said he) <hi>that that faith, or belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
which vers. 3. is said to be imputed to Abraham for righteousness, is opposed
to works or working vers. 5. Now between faith properly taken &amp; works, and so
between beleeving &amp; working, there is a constant opposition: but between the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
obedience of Christ &amp; works, there is no opposition. Ans.</hi> It is most true, that
in the matter of justification, beleeving is opposed to working, &amp; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly;
and therefore he is concerned to look to it, who will have us consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Faith here only in such a way, as it cannot be opposed to, but every
way agree with works, as one of them. (2) The opposition betwixt our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
consisting in works which we do, &amp; the Surety-Righteousness of
Christ, consisting, not in his Obedience Active only, (as he mistakingly
supposeth all alongs) but in both active &amp; passive Obedience, whereby he
gave full satisfaction to the Law, in all its demands, is so Palpable, that it
cannot be well dissembled, far less denied.</p>
               <p>His 3. <hi>Consideration is, that it is said vers.</hi> 5. His faith is imputed to him,
<hi>where it is evident, that that faith (whatsoever we understand by it) which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
for Righteousness is</hi> His, <hi>that is, some what that truely &amp; properly may be
called his, before such imputation be made unto him. Now it cannot be said of
the Righteousness of Christ, that that is any mans, before the imputation of it be
made unto him: But faith properly taken is the beleevers, before it be imputed, at
least in order of nature, if not of time. Ans.</hi> The words <hi>vers.</hi> 5. are, <hi>His faith
is counted for, or unto Righteousness.</hi> And so whatever be understood by faith
it may in some respect, at least, in order of nature, be his, before it be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:104357:162"/>
for or unto Righteousness, or reckoned upon his score; Yea it must so
be, that it may rightly be reckoned on his score: And this is clear of the
Righteousness of Christ, which becometh the beleevers by faith, and is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to him, &amp; bestowed upon him, &amp; so made his, by vertue of his union with
Christ through faith: His mistake lyeth here, that he taketh these words <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Righteousness,</hi> to be every way the same, with <hi>imputing to</hi> or <hi>bestowing upon
a person;</hi> while as the formal difference is manifest, though the one inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the other, &amp; Accounting unto Righteousness doth in this matter, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose
the Imputation or bestowing of that, which is counted to such an
end. Further, why may not <hi>his faith,</hi> denote the object of his faith, as <hi>our
hope,</hi> or <hi>our love</hi> may denote the object of our hope &amp; love? And whence
then shall there any necessitie arise to say, that that object shall be truely &amp;
properly called <hi>his</hi> before the Imputation of it be made unto him, taking
this Imputation for bestowing, as he seemeth here to do? but if Imputation
be taken for counting on their score it presupposeth their interest in the same,
prior in order of nature, (as is said) &amp; that most manifestly.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>fourth</hi> place he saith. <hi>Though we should grant a trope in this place, &amp;
by faith, its object should be meaned: Yet it will not follow, that the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, should be here said to be imputed, but either God himself, or the
promise of God, for it was God be beleeved vers. 3. Ans.</hi> In that promise made
to <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; which he beleeved, the summe of the Gospel was compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
as <hi>Paul</hi> himself teacheth us <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 8. And this promise was a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of promises, and therefore is called <hi>promises,</hi> in the plural number <hi>Gal.</hi>
3: 16, 21. and was the <hi>Covenant confirmed of God in Christ vers.</hi> 17. &amp; the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
vers.</hi> 18. &amp; <hi>life vers.</hi> 21. which cannot be had without a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>Ibid.</hi> even the Righteousness of Faith that was to come, <hi>to wit</hi> of Christ
<hi>vers.</hi> 22, 23, 24. who is the only mediator <hi>vers.</hi> 20. and is there expresly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Christ &amp; was to be revealed. Hence they, that have beleeved in Christ
Jesus &amp; are baptized into Christ, and have put on Christ, and are in Christ,
&amp; are Christ's, are <hi>Abraham's</hi> seed &amp; heirs according to the promise <hi>vers,</hi> 26,
27, 28, 29. And if such be <hi>Abraham's</hi> seed, <hi>Abraham</hi> must have been such
himself; that Father &amp; Children may be of one Complexion; <hi>for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham, or to his seed,
through the Law, but through the Righteousness of faith. Rom.</hi> 4: 13. that is,
through the Righteousness of Christ the object of faith, &amp; who is expresly
called Faith <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 23, 25. And it is added <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 14. <hi>for if they, which are
of the Law, be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</hi>
Faith, that may be, Christ, the object of faith, is made void, &amp; all the
actings of faith upon him are vaine &amp; of none effect, conforme to what
the same Apostle saith <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 21. <hi>If Righteousness come by the Law, then Christ
is dead in vaine.</hi> And as this Faith is made void, so the promises of this
Faith, that was to come, are of no effect. Therefore the object of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
Faith was Christ, the promised Messiah &amp; that Faith that was to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
and the Righteousness of that Faith. He reckoneth up, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words, to very little purpose, the several objects of faith from <hi>Ioh,</hi>
3: 16. &amp; 5: 46. &amp; 20: 31. &amp; 8: 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 9. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 21. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12: 44.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:104357:163"/>
1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5: 10. And supposeth, that no where Christ's Righteousness is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
as the Object. But where ever Faith, or its Object is mentioned, in
the matter of justification, Christ's Righteousness is never excluded, more
then himself, for as himself was the Cautioner, so his Righteousness was
<hi>fide-jussry;</hi> &amp; faith acting upon one must necessarily act on both, these being
inseparable; beside, that elsewhere this is expresly enough mentioned. Yet
he granteth, that it <hi>is of nearer concernment to the maine, to beleev this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ than the beleeving of many other things besides, comprehended in
the Scriptures.</hi> But why, I pray, if this belong not to the object of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
faith? He not only will have us beleeve, that Christ's Righteousness
is not reckoned amongst the objects of faith, as justifying; but he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
give a reason, why it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> so reckoned; to wit, <hi>because, though it ought
to be &amp; cannot but be beleeved by that faith, which justifieth, yet it may be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
also by such a faith, which is so far from justifying, that it denyeth this Christ
to be the Son of God. Thus some jewes gave testimony to his innocency, who yet
received him not for their Messiah, not beleeved him to be God; &amp; this is the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of the Turkish faith, for the most part, concerning him, at this day. Ans.</hi>
It is one thing to beleeve a Righteousness, but it is another thing to beleeve
in it, &amp; rest upon it. The innocency of Christ as man, before men is one
thing, but his compleet Surety Righteousness as one that was both God &amp;
man, is another thing. Now Justifying faith looketh to, &amp; resteth upon his
whole Surety-Righteousness &amp; looketh upon him, as God-Man; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it cannot be thus beleeved (which is the only right way of beleeving
it) but only by such, as leane to this Righteousness, as the Righteousness
of the promised Messiah, &amp; Mediator, God-Man, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and
as all his children do: and this is the only Faith, that is Justifying &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
It seemeth by this expression, that there is no more to be regairded in
Christ's Righteousness, but the meer innocency of a man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly</hi> he tels us. <hi>That faith, which is here said to be imputed vers. 3. is that
faith, by which be beleeved in God, that quickeneth the dead &amp;c. vers. 17. But
the Righteousness of Christ can in no tolerable construction be called that Faith. Ans.</hi>
That the <hi>Proposition</hi> is false, appeareth sufficiently from what is said: And
these words <hi>vers.</hi> 17. shew, how firmly &amp; fixedly <hi>Abraham</hi> received, and
rested on the promise, and thing promised: but it is not said, that that was
imputed to him for his Righteousness; but that which was imputed was the
Righteousness of the Faith, that was to come, whereon he beleeved and
rested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly</hi> &amp; <hi>Sevently</hi> he saith, that <hi>the faith, that was imputed unto Abraham
was that, wherein he was said not to be weak</hi> vers. 19 <hi>&amp; is opposed to doubting</hi>
vers. 20. <hi>&amp; by which he was fully assured, that he who had promised, was able to
do it</hi> vers. 21. <hi>Ans.</hi> This is like wayes denied: for the thing that was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
was not that act of Faith, but the Righteousness of the Messiah, whom
he undoubtedly expected to come out of his loines, as Man, &amp; that even
when he had no appearance of an issue: for it is this Righseousness which is
the Righteousness of Faith, and is distinct from the act of Beleeving; for it
is said, that <hi>it shall be imputed to us, if we beleeve;</hi> which expression could
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:104357:163"/>
be no way satisfying, if nothing were meaned to be imputed here, but our
Beleeving; for then the sense would be this, we shall be reputed beleevers,
if we be beleevers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly</hi> he saith. <hi>That which shall be imputed unto us for Righteousness, is said
to be our beleeving on him, that raised up the Lord Iesus</hi> vers. 24. <hi>Ans.</hi> This is
sick of the same disease with the foregoing: nothing like that is here said, but
rather we may see, that some distinct thing is promised to be imputed to us,
if we beleeve on him, that raised up Christ from the deed, which clearly
saith, that the Imputation of something to us for Righteousness is promised,
when we beleeve: &amp; shall any man then think, that Beleeving it self is the
thing, which is to be imputed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly</hi> he tels us, (which is but what we heard before, &amp; is shortly this)
<hi>That a tropical &amp; metonymical interpretation, turneth Paul's perspicuity into
greater obscurity, than any light of the Scripture knoweth well how to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>eve. Ans.</hi>
Whatever darkness he conceive herein, Yet others see in these tropical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
a greater beauty of illustration, &amp; a greater emphasis of strength &amp;
signification, than all his Rhetorick is able to darken. The Apostle, not only
here, but almost every where, while speaking of this subject, followeth this
same manner of expression, Especially <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. Nor do we say, that the
word <hi>Faith</hi> is here taken simply for Christ's Righteousness; but for Christ's
Righteousness laid hold on &amp; applied by Faith; so that what is in one place
called the Righteousness of Christ, is in another place called the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Faith, &amp; the Righteousness, which is by Faith &amp; through faith: as
Christ is called <hi>our hope,</hi> not simply, but as our hope acteth upon him, as the
real &amp; true object thereof.</p>
               <p>He cannot deny, but Faith is sometimes taken for its object, even for
Christ;
yet he saith. 1. <hi>That though the faculty be sometimes put for the object, yet
the act seldome, or never. The act or exercise of the grace of hope is never put for the
things hoped for, but hope it self is sometimes found in that signification as</hi> Col.
1: 5. Tit. 2: 13. <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w that which is here said to be imputed unto Abraham, was
not the habit or grace of Faith, but the act. Ans.</hi> Neither habit, nor grace,
nor act of Faith is here said to be imputed, but the object, which the act may
also denote, as well as the habite. And if he limite &amp; restrick this to any
particular act, he must say, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ustified before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>his time
&amp; that after this act was past, it could not be said, that his Faith was imputed
to him for Righteousness,</p>
               <p>But 2. he saith. <hi>That though it were granted, that as well the act it self, as the
faculty or habit may be sometimes put for the object, yet when the act &amp; object have
been named together, &amp; the act expressed by an object proper to it, &amp; further some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
immediatly ascribed to this act, under that consideration (all which is
plainly seen in this clause,</hi> Abraham beleeved God, &amp; it was imputed to him
for Righteousness) <hi>in this case to conceive &amp; affirme, that what is ascribed, is
neither ascribed unto the act it self, there mentioned, nor unto the object mentioned,
but unto a third thing, not once mentioned in the text, is to turn our back upon the
text. Ans.</hi> Do we not see <hi>Tit.</hi> 2: 13. where it is said, <hi>looking for that blessed
hope &amp; glorious appearing of the great God, &amp; our Saviour Iesus Christ,</hi> that Christ
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:104357:164"/>
is denominated by the act or habite of hope, and called <hi>our hope,</hi> and that
here both act &amp; object are named together, <hi>to wit,</hi> looking, looking for
our Saviour Jesus Christ? It is true, there is nothing here immediatly ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to this act; but not withstanding thereof, we see Christ the object of
hope, denominated by the act or habite of hope. And whereas it is said
that this third thing, the Righteousness of Christ, is not once mentioned, it
may suffice, that it is sufficiently included, &amp; clearly enough expressed,
when mention is made of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Righteousness of faith,</hi> &amp; of
<hi>Righteousness imputed.</hi> (2) It is also to be considered, that in that clause, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
beleeved God, &amp; it was counted to him for Righteousness,</hi> it is not said,
that Faith, or his Beleeving was counted to him for Righteousness, but that
<hi>it was counted</hi> &amp;c. and that is not his Faith, but the marrow of the Gospel,
which God at that time preached unto him, and so there is nothing in
this clause, immediatly ascribed to this act but a third thing is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> he saith, <hi>The righteousness of Christ is not the object of faith, as justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying;
only the Scriptures propose his Righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eousness, or obedience to the Law, as
that, which is to be beleeved; &amp; so it may be termed a partial object, as is the
creation of the world, &amp; that</hi> Cain <hi>was</hi> Adam's <hi>son. But the object of faith as
justifying properly is either Christ himself, or the promise of God concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of the world by him. Ans.</hi> (1) Hereby we see, that in stead of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
faith, he giveth us a meer historical faith: and indeed such as deny
the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, must of necessity substitute a new
sort of faith, in room of that, which we owne for the only Justifying faith.
But though justifying faith containe in it that historical faith, &amp; presuppose
it; yet it includeth more, &amp; hath other peculiar actings of soul upon and
towards Christ, &amp; his Righteousness (which here we cannot separate, far
less oppose to other, as our Adversary doth) in reference to the mans libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the sentence of the Law, &amp; the Curse due to him for the breach
thereof, now charged home upon him by the Lord, &amp; an awakened con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
(2) By Christ's Righteousness we do not understand his simple inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
or freedom from the transgression of the Law; but his whole Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory
work, in his state of humiliation, as satisfying the offended Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
&amp; answering all the demands of the Law, both as to doing &amp; suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
which debt we were lying under. (3) Justifying Faith eyeth him thus,
runneth to him &amp; accepteth of him, as he is thus set forth by God to be a
Propitiation, through Faith in his blood <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 25. and as making Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
for faith receiveth the atonement <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 11. and it receiveth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of grace, &amp; of the gift of Righteousness <hi>vers.</hi> 17. Justifying faith must
receive him, as the <hi>Lord our Righteousness; &amp; as made of God to us Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
Therefore is this Righteousness of God called also the <hi>Righteousness of
Faith,</hi> or the <hi>Righteousness of God, which is by faith of Iesus Christ, unto all,
and upon all them that beleeve.</hi> Rom. 3: 22. <hi>A Righteousness, which is through
the Faith of Christ, or the Righteousness, which is of God by Faith.</hi> Phil. 3: 9.</p>
               <p>Thus have we examined all, that this Man hath brought by way of Reason
(for as for Authorities on the one hand, or other, I purposely wave them in
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:104357:164"/>
this whole discourse) to prove, that Faith properly taken is imputed for
Righteousness &amp; that the tropical sense, commonly received by the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
(which we have also chosen to follow, notwithstanding that there is
another sense given of the words by some, to evite in part this tropical sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
and by which the Adversaries against whom we here deal, can receive no
advantage) is to be utterly laid aside &amp; rejected; &amp; in answering him, we
have answered others also, who do but-urge the same things.</p>
               <p>Yet if any should enquire. If the Apostle doth not meane, that faith
properly taken is our Righteonsness, &amp; is imputed to us &amp; accounted our
Righteousness, why would he say so plainly, that <hi>Faith is imputed,</hi> or <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Righteousness.</hi> I <hi>Answere.</hi> The expressions, which the Holy Ghost
hath used, should satisfie us, though we should know no reason beside his
good pleasure, why he did express the matter so: It is our part, to search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his meaning, according unto the surest rules of finding out the sense of the
Scriptures, among which this is to be reckoned as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ite one, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
<hi>viz.</hi> to attend the scope, with the connexion &amp; cohesion of the
words as they lye, &amp; contribute unto that scope, together with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
plaine &amp; frequently reiterated expressions &amp; assertions of the Spirit of
God, in other places, where the same matter is treated of: for to the end,
that we may be exercised, in the study of the Scriptures, &amp; in comparing
Scripture with Scripture for finding out the mind of the Lord, hath he
thought good to express the same matter in diverse places, &amp; in various
wayes, &amp; in some places more plainly, what in other places appeareth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
obscure. And it cannot be judged a saife way of interpreting Scripture, to
fix upon one expression &amp; give it a sense, or take it in such a sense, as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
manifestly to darken the whole doctrine of the Spirit of the Lord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that truth, and to crosse the scope, to mat the connexion, and to
contradict multitudes of other passages of Scripture. It is not unusual for
the Apostle to use several expressions, in a figurative sense. How oft is the
word <hi>Law</hi> taken for obedience to the Law? What sense could be made of
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 25. if the word <hi>Faith</hi> should be there taken properly, &amp; not for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject?
as also <hi>vers</hi> 2, &amp; 5. of that same <hi>Chapter.</hi> And what sense shall we put
upon these expressions. <hi>They which are of faith Gal.</hi> 3: 7, 9. &amp; <hi>as many as are
of the works of the Law</hi> vers. 10. &amp; upon many such like, if all these words
must be taken properly? Nay, how little of this whole matter of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is expressed to us, without Trops &amp; figures? which yet do not dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but give a more special &amp; divine lustre unto the Truthes, so expressed.
How oft is the word <hi>Hop</hi> put for its object, for the thing hoped for? And
though this might satisfie us herein; yet further, if I might adventure to
give a reason of this manner of expression here, ot rather to pointe forth
what this expression should signifie &amp; hold forth to us, I would say, That
<hi>Paul</hi> is not handling this Controversie about Justification, in a meer specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
manner; &amp; therefore doth not use such Philosophical &amp; Metaphysical
Notions &amp; expressions there about, as some now think so necessary, that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout
the same they judge themselves not in case to explaine the matter to the
capacity of the meanest, which would rather have darkened, then explained
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:104357:165"/>
the matter to the ordinary capacity of Christians, as I judge the way, that
some of latetake, in explicating this matter, contributeth much more to the
darkning of the same: at least to me: But the Apostle is handling this matter
in a practical manner; so as both such he wrote unto, &amp; the Church of Christ
to the end of the world, might so understand this necessary &amp; fundamental
truth, as to put the same in practice: And therefore doth say, that <hi>Faith
is imputed unto Righteousness,</hi> to shew, that it is not the Righteousness of
Christ, conceived in our heads, that will save &amp; justifie us; but his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
laid hold on, brought home &amp; applied by Faith: that so all might
see &amp; be convinced of the necessity of faith, whereby the soul goeth out to
Christ, layeth to his Righteousness, and might not satisfie themselves with
a Notion of Christ &amp; his Righteousness, never applied by Faith; but be
enduced to lay hold on him by Faith, to the end they might have an interest
in Christ's Righteousness, the same being, upon their faith, bestowed upon
them, and reckoned upon their score. The expression is most emphatick to
hold forth, the necessity now of faith, according to the Lord's Soveraigne
appointment, as if thereby Christ's Righteousness &amp; their faith were become
one thing, as being wholly inseparable in this affaire, so that it cometh to
one, whether by faith, we understand the Grace as acting upon &amp; conno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Object, or the Object, as acted upon by the Grace of Faith as in
that expression, <hi>the Righteousness of faith Rom.</hi> 4: 13. Faith may either be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
to be Christ, as said hold on by faith, &amp; so the meaning will be
through the Righteousness of Christ, laid hold on by Faith, &amp; faith may
be the same way explained in the following <hi>vers. 14. &amp; 16. for if they which
are of the Law, be heirs, faith is made void,</hi> i. e. if the grand heritage come by
the Law &amp; by obedience to it, the Gospel, holding forth Christ to be laid
hold on by faith, is made void, as to this end: and againe vers. 16. <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is of faith, that it might be by grace</hi> i. e. it is of &amp; by Christ, laid hold upon
by Faith, that it might be by grace. Or <hi>faith</hi> in all these may be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be faith as acting upon the object, Christ &amp; his Righteousness; &amp; the
consequence &amp; force of the words will be found to be the same, whether of
these wayes we explaine the matter. As, when speaking of the Israelits
stung in the wilderness, it were all one to say, they were healed by the
brazen serpent, <hi>to wit,</hi> looked to; or they were healed by their look, <hi>to
wit,</hi> upon the brazen serpent, for still it will be understood, that all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
came from the brazen serpent (or him rather, that was typified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by)
yet so as it was to be looked upon; &amp; that their looking was but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
mean thereunto, and when a mean thereunto must include the
object looked unto. We hear it sometimes said of persons miraculously cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that their Faith made them whole, while as the vertue came from the
object acted upon by faith, as <hi>Peter</hi> fully explaineth the matter saying <hi>Act.</hi> 3:
16. <hi>And his name, through faith in his name, hath made this man strong.</hi> Thus
we see, how this matter may be saifly &amp; must be understood, when the
vertue and efficacy of the Principal cause is attributed to the Instrumental
cause: And yet, lest any should stumble at the expression, &amp; pervert it, as
many do, to day, the Apostle abundantly Caveats against this by telling
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:104357:165"/>
us so plainely &amp; so fully &amp; so frequently, of the Righteousness of God, which
is had by faith, &amp; through faith, as we have seen; &amp; never speaketh of a
Righteousness had, because of faith, or for Faith; nor saith he, that faith
is our Righteousness, while treating of Justification.</p>

               <p>OUr Adversaries, to strengthen their Assertion of the Imputation of
Faith, in a proper sense, to the exclusion of the imputation of the
Righteousness of Christ, have other two Positions, which they own
&amp; maintaine. One is, that our Faith or our act of beleeving is the whole of
our Gospel-Righteousness: And the other is. That Christ hath procured
that it should be so, by procuring the New Covenant, whereof this faith is
made the Condition. To this last we shall speak something, in the next
<hi>Chapter;</hi> &amp; of the other here.</p>
               <p>How much Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth contend, for our Faiths being called &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
our Gospel-Righteousness, is known. The forenamed Author of
the <hi>discourse of the two Covenants</hi> is very plaine <hi>pag.</hi> 48, &amp;c. where he is explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
what <hi>God's counting Abraham's faith to him for Righteousness is.</hi> There
he tels us, that he takes it to signifie thus much, <hi>to wit. That God, in a
may of special grace, or by vertue of a new Law of grace &amp; favour, which was
established by God, in Christ</hi> (Gal. 3: 17.) <hi>that is, in reference to what Christ
was to do &amp; suffer, in time then to come, did reckon his practical faith to him for
Righteousness, that is, that which in the eye of that new Law, should passe in his
estimation for righteousness, subordinat to Christ's Righteousness, which procured
this grant or Law.</hi> And thereafter <hi>pag.</hi> 40. he tels us, <hi>That it is an act of
God's special favour, &amp; by vertue of his new Law of grace, that such a faith,
as he hath described</hi> (that is, a faith taking in all Gospel Obedience, as we
saw above) <hi>comes to be reckoned or imputed to a man for Righteousness; &amp; through
God's imputing it for righteousness, to stand a man in the same, if not in a better
stead, as to his eternal concerns, as a perfect fulfilling of the original Law from
first to last would have done. Christ's Righteousness being presupposed the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
Cause of this grant or Covenant.</hi> Thereafter <hi>pag.</hi> 50. he tels us, <hi>there
are two things, which constitute &amp; make up the Righteousness of the Law of Grace,
first, that which consisteth in the forgiveness of sins &amp; 2. the righteousness of sincere
obedience: And in inference to both,</hi> he saith, <hi>faith is imputed for righteousness
be vertue of the Law of Grace; for,</hi> saith he, <hi>faith as practical is imputed to a
man for righteousness, as it is that &amp; all that, which is required of him himself by
the Law of Grace, to entitle him to the righteousness, which consisteth in remission of
sins.</hi> And then as to the second he saith <hi>pag. 52. That faith is imputed for
righteousness, which is practical or productive of sincere obedience, without which

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:104357:166"/>
benefites, &amp; consequently cannot justifie a man, in the eye of that Law: for,</hi> as
he addeth, <hi>there must be repentance,</hi> &amp; <hi>forgiving men their injuries, &amp; faith
must be such as worketh by love,</hi> &amp; then he tels us, that <hi>Abraham was justified
by his works.</hi> Jam. 2.</p>
               <p>All which abomination of doctrine, &amp; perversion of the right wayes of

                  </gap>lmeation &amp; explication made of that Gospel, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
said, this Treatise would lead us into the knowledge of: &amp; which is the

hold forth, joyning herein with <hi>Papists,</hi> as we saw in part above <hi>Chap.</hi>
XVIII. towards the beginning, &amp; we shall at this occasion trouble the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with some more of their expressions, that we may see, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which is now so much cried up, &amp; followed after, is nothing but
old <hi>Socinianisme</hi> &amp; so, owned &amp; professed by such, as do not deserve to be
called Christians, <hi>Socin. de Servat. lib. 4. c. 4, 7, 11. God justifieth the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but now converted, penitent, &amp; after he hath left off to be ungodly: the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
are not ungodly in themselves, neither are they so called, yea they are not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
&amp; which is more, they do not now sinne. And so faith &amp; works, that is,
obedience to the commands of Christ, as the forme of faith, doth justifie us before
God, &amp; by them through them</hi> (per illa, ex illis) <hi>he justifieth us. Smalcius disp.</hi> 4.
<hi>c. Frantzium. Regeneration, all other good works, Love, Prayer, Obedience,
Faith, Charity &amp;c. are so far from being effects of justification, that without them
justification can no way really exist, for God justifieth no man, but him, who is
compleetly adorned with all these vertues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> yea the study of good works &amp; walkeing
before God were the cause (though not the chiefe) of the justification of Noah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
&amp; others, who are said to be justified by faith. Socin. ubi supra de Serv. lib.
1. c. 4. Faith doth not justifie by its proper vertue, but by the mercy &amp; go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d will
of God, who justifieth such, as do such a work, &amp; imputeth it for righteousness.
With Paul, to have righteousness imputed is nothing else, but to have faith impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
&amp; to be accounted just, faith is so imputed to us, as that because of faith, we,
howbeit guilty of many unrighteousness, are esteemed perfectly righteous, or God
so dealeth with us, as if we were perfectly righteous who can doubt, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
meaneth no other thing than that we are not righteous before God, because our
works require that, as a due reward, but because it hath so seemed good to the Lord,
to take our faith in place of righteousness; so that we receive the reward of grace,
by which we are declared righteous before him.</hi> More might be adduced for this
end, as it might be shown also, how herein the <hi>Arminians</hi> conspire with them
against the orthodox. And as for the judgment of Papists, in this point, it
is likewise known.</p>
               <p>It will not be necessary that we insist, in disproving that, which hath been
so much witnessed against by the orthodox writting against <hi>Papists, Socinians,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Arminians,</hi> upon these heads: It will suffice, I suppose, if we give a
few reasons, why we cannot acquiesce in the doctrine, proposed by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Author.</p>
               <p>1. Hereby works of obedience are exalted to the same place, &amp; are allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:104357:166"/>
the same Force, Influence &amp; Efficacy into Justification, with Faith,
whereby all the Apostles disputes for Faith &amp; against Works, &amp; for faith as
inconsistent with &amp; exclusive of works, are evacuated &amp; rendered useless;
So that the Apostle hath either not spoken to the purpose, or hath not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
truth: either of which to say is blasphemie. The Apostle argueth thus,
we are Justified by faith; therefore we are not Justified by works. This man
reasoneth on the contrary, we are justified by faith, therefore we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by works; because by a faith that includeth works; as if the Apostle had
meaned a Faith that was dead, &amp; had no affinity with works.</p>
               <p>2. Hereby he confoundeth all these duties, which are required of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
or of such, as are in Covenant with God, with that which is solely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of them in order to their first entering in Covenant, or into a state
of Justification: as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> one should say, that all the marriag-duties, required
of such as were already in that marriage state, were conditions of entering
into the marriag-state.</p>
               <p>3. Hereby he confoundeth Justification, with Glorification, making all
that Faith &amp; sincere obedience, which is required in order to actual Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; Glorification, to be necessary before Justification: And thereby
must say, that no man hath his sins pardoned, so long as he liveth; but if
he be sincerely obedient, he is in the way to a Pardon, &amp; to Justification.
He cannot say, that by a practical Faith, he only meaneth such a true and
lively Faith, as will in due time produce these effects: for, as that will not
consist with his explication of that practical Faith, so it would crosse his who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
designe. <hi>The just man in the eye of this new Law,</hi> (as he saith p. 49.) <hi>is
every one that rightly beleeves, repents &amp; sincerely obeyes, because that is all that it
requires of a man himself to his Iustification &amp; Salvation.</hi> Where we see, that
with him, Justification &amp; Salvation go together, &amp; have the same condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and he that is just must be one, that hath these Conditions; and he
who hath not these Conditions is not just in the eye of that new Law; and if
he be not just in the eye of that new Law, his faith cannot be accounted to
him for Righteousness, nor he Justified.</p>
               <p>4. The man hereby confoundeth the two Covenants, or giveth us a new
Covenant of Works, in stead of the Covenant of Grace; for this practical
Faith, which includeth all obedience, hath the same place, force &amp; effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
in the new Covenant, that compleet Obedience had in the old. And
this Gospel is but the old Law of works, only with this change, that where
as the old Law required Perfect Obedience to the end, in order to Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; Salvation; this new Covenant of works requireth Sincere Obedience
to the end, in order to Justification &amp; Salvation: And so thus we are Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
&amp; saved as really by &amp; upon the account of our works, as <hi>Adam</hi> would
have been, if he had continued in obedience to the end; &amp; this Faith and
sincere Obedience is as really, &amp;, to all ends &amp; purposes, as effectually and
formally our Righteousness, as Perfect Obedience would have been the
Righteousness of <hi>Adam:</hi> And thus the reward must as really be reckoned to
us of debt, &amp; not of grace, as it would have been to <hi>Adam,</hi> if he had stood:
And as faire a ground is laid for us to boast &amp; glory, though not before God,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:104357:167"/>
as had been for <hi>Adam,</hi> if he had continned to the end. The evasion he hath
to make all this of grace, saying p. 49, 50. <hi>And yet every beleevers justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will be all of grace, because the Law by which they are justified is wholly of
grace, &amp; was ena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed in meer grace &amp; favour to undone man,</hi> is not able to help
him; for it was wholly of undeserved grace &amp; love, that God did so far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
to <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; to all mankinde in him, as to strick a Covenant with
him, a promise of such an ample reward upon his performance of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Perfect Obedience to the end; &amp; yet, notwithstanding this Law
was wholly of grace &amp; was enacted in meer grace &amp; favoure: for neither
was the Lord necessitated thereunto; nor could <hi>Adam</hi> say, he had deserved
any such thing at God's hand, the reward had been reckoned to <hi>Adam,</hi> if he
had stood, of debt, not simplie and absolutly, but <hi>ex pacto;</hi> by reason of
the compact: So that we see, the cases run parallel &amp; the Covenant is of
the same nature &amp; kinde. The difference betwixt the Power granted to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
&amp; now to man, to performe the conditions required, is with him, the
same upon the matter; for if man will go the length he can &amp; may, he may
be sure of God's help to convoy him all the length he should; And what had
<hi>Adam</hi> more? And as for the diversitie of the conditions, which then were
Perfect Obedience, &amp; now only Sincere, that can make no alteration in
the Nature of the Covenant: and beside, I see not, why this Man can not
as well say that if man now will go as far, as he may &amp; can, by his own
stock of power, unto the performance of Perfect Obedience, God will
certainly give him his help to carry him forward; as he saith, that if man
will now go all the length he can unto the performance of Faith, Repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
&amp; new sincere obedience, God is ready &amp; willing to contribute his help
to carry him forward thereunto.</p>
               <p>5. He confoundeth the <hi>right</hi> to, with the <hi>possession</hi> of life eternal, as to
their Causes &amp; Antecedents; for as new &amp; holy Obedience is by us made
the way to the possession of the Kingdom: so by him it is made the way or
cause of the Right <hi>jus</hi> to the Kingdom; for he requireth it as antecedent to
a mans Justification &amp; first being brought into a Covenant state with God,
when he first receiveth the Right to the inheritance; And thus the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is made to be of the Law, &amp; not of promise, contrare to <hi>Gal.</hi> 3:
18, for the whole and sure Right thereunto is had by Obedience to the Law,
with him.</p>
               <p>I shall say no more to this here, because there is a sufficient confutation of
this to be found in Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> on the <hi>Revel. pag.</hi> 234. &amp;c. where that digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is handled, <hi>concerning the way of Covenanting with God, &amp; of a sinner ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of Iustification before him.</hi> And in all such as write against <hi>Papists</hi> and
<hi>Sociniant,</hi> on this head.</p>
               <p>But if it be asked, may not faith be called our Gospel-Righteousness, &amp;
be said to be imputed to beleevers, as such a Righteousness, without any
wrong done to the Righteousness of Christ, which keepeth still its own pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of being our legal or pro legal Righteousness? I <hi>Ans.</hi> Though it be true,
that Faith is now required of all that would be Justified; yet I no where fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
that it is called our Gospel Righteousness; and I judge it not saife to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:104357:167"/>
expressions, without warrand of the word, in this tender matter; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
such expressions, as have a manifest tendency to corrupt, rather then
explicate the truth, in this particular; as, I judge, will be found true of
this expression; for how beit it be said by the Asserters thereof, that Faith, is
but a less principal &amp; Subordinat Righteousness; Yet in effect, according to
their explication of the whole doctrine (as may be seen by this <hi>Treatise</hi> last
mentioned &amp; answered) it is made the Principal &amp; only Righteousness,
that is imputed to us: for Christ's Righteousness, say they, is only impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as to is effects, or in its causality. See <hi>Baxter</hi> against <hi>D. Tully</hi> p. 70. (just

we may buy a Righteousness, whereby we may be formally justified; as he
who giveth a price to another, whereby he may buy clothes, is said to clothe him, not
foomally, but effectivly, morally, as is manifest:</hi>) And even as to these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fets
it dependeth wholly upon Faith, and this Faith is only said to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
imputed for our Righteousness. And beside, they tell us, that the
Righteousness of Christ is alike common to all, to the Reprobat as well, as
to the Elect, and so it can be imputed properly to none: And as to its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective

                  </gap>mputation (as <hi>Suarez</hi> calleth it) or Imputation, as to its effects or
in its causality (as others speak) after that it is offered &amp; held forth to all, &amp;
hath the same common effects, unto all, untill the condition be performed,
that dependeth wholly upon mans performance of the Condition; And as
to its antecedent effects, it is equally &amp; absolutly imputed to all; that is, it
is imputed to none, but the effects thereof are equally made common to all,
in making Salvation possible, &amp; the condition to be faith, and the like:
And as to the special effects, (as they may be called) which depend on faith,
when one beleeveth, &amp; so fulfilleth the Condition, he hath thereby a Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Righteousness,
or this Faith of his is reckoned upon his score, for a
Gospel-Righteousness, &amp; thereupon he receiveth Pardon, Justification &amp;c.
Now let any Judge, whether or not these effects are not more the effects (at
least more immediatly) of their own Gospel-Righteousness, than of Christ's:
for Christ by all his Righteousness did purchase these effects to all a like, &amp; that
conditionally; and now they themselves by their own personal Gospel Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Faith, do make an actual purchase of these effects, according
to the Covenant, <hi>ex pacto.</hi> And to say, That Christ did by his merites pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
the New Covenant, doth but confirme, what I have now said, <hi>towit,</hi>
That all that, which Christ procured, was, That all such, as should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a Gospel-Righteousness of their owne, shonld be justified &amp;c. And
thus Christ died to purchase a vertue &amp; merite to our faith, &amp; that to this
end, it should become a Gospel-Righteousness, whereby they might have
whereof to boast &amp; to glory before men, at least. Hence we see that Christ's
Righteousness might rather be called the Subservient &amp; ours the Principal.
And further, (which may justly make Christians ab horre this opinion) Thus
this poor convinced sinner, pursued by justice for a broken Law, is called to
leane his whole weight of Acceptance with God, &amp; found all his hope of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:104357:168"/>
Pardon &amp; Justification, upon his own Faith, or Gospel Righteousness, as
the only Righteousness, wherewith he is to be covered, &amp; the only Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
which is imputed unto him; &amp; not upon Christ &amp; his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
for what Christ did or purchased was common to all, &amp; had only a
conditional vertue, which the personal Righteousness reduceth into act, &amp;
so must have a principal share of the glory; for as to what Christ did, <hi>Iudas</hi>
had the same ground of thankfulness &amp; praise, that <hi>Peter</hi> had, &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> no
more then <hi>Iudas;</hi> and thus <hi>Peter</hi> was to sing the song of praise for his Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
&amp; Pardon, unto his own personal Faith &amp; Gospel-Righteousness.
If this be not the Native result of this doctrine, let any put it in to practice
(which I shall be loath to advise) &amp; trye, whether thereby more of their
weight is laid on Christ, or on their own faith: And on the other hand,
let any serious &amp; exercised Christian be enquired, &amp; see if their practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with this doctrine.</p>
               <p>If it be said, That there is no such hazard, so long as Faith is not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
here as abstracted from its Object Christ, but is considered with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
thereunto. I <hi>Ans.</hi> (1) We have seen, what a poor &amp; general respect
faith by some of our Adversaries is said to have to Christ, whereby it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
nothing but a meer historical faith &amp; the Author of the <hi>Discourse of the two
Covenants, p.</hi> 31. saith, that even that faith, that had not the Messias in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is imputed for Righteousness. (2) As for such as confesse that justifying
faith hath a special respect to Christ &amp; his Righteousness, we would know,
whether it hath this respect, that it peculiarly refugeth the soul there from
the storme of wrath, and bringeth in thence Christ's Righteousness, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
the man out to it, that he may lean upon it, &amp; plead the same, as the
only ground of his Absolution from the sentence of the Law? And if this be
granted, then it is manifest, that the beleever hath no Righteousness, but
Christ's Surety-righteousness, where withall he desireth to appeare before
God, &amp; this is it alone, to which he leaneth, &amp; through which alone he
hopeth for Pardon &amp; Acceptance, without the least reflecting act of soul
upon his own Faith. (3) But againe if so, faith must stand alone, as acting
thus in a peculiar manner on Christ, which no work else is fitted to do; &amp;
therefore Faith &amp; Works must not be joyned together; nor must Faith be
considered, in this affaire, as comprehending all Obedience in it, as we
see, they say. (4) But when Faith is made our Gospel-Righteousness, in
whole, or in part, howbeit they say, they consider Faith, as acting on its
object Christ; yet it is manifest, that it is then considered with relation to
its object, in a Physical, or metaphysical manner, as all acts (specified
from their objects) may &amp; must be considered; but not in a theological sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
as required in the Gospel, to bring-in the Surety Righteousness of
Christ, &amp; to leane the soul thereupon, as its only Righteousness: for when
it is said to be our whole Gospel Righteousness, it is considered as a moral

sense, according to the new Law, which is hereby fully &amp; in all points
performed &amp; obeyed; much more, when works are joyned with it, doth
it with works put on a far other respect, than to be the hand receiving the
Atonement, &amp; the gift of Righteousness.</p>

which is from the accusation of the Law of works, I say</hi> faith is but a
condition <hi>&amp; no otherwise justifieth, but because it is</hi> made that condition by a
New-Law, per legem remediantem, <hi>&amp; we must be judged by</hi> that Law: <hi>the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore,
when the case is, whether we have performed the conditions of that new law,
or not? then faith is</hi> materially that Righteousness, <hi>by which we must be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
against all accusations of</hi> Non-performance. <hi>Ans.</hi> (1) I doubt if such as
never heard a report of Christ, shall be judged by the New-Law; far lesse
by it alone. (2) God will not call in question a Beleevers faith, nor accuse
him of Non-performance. Nor will the Gospel, or New-Law do it; so
that the Beleever needs not plead his performance; in reference to a Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
at the tribunal of God. (3) When Faith is made a Condition by a
New-Law, &amp; thereby become the beleevers Righteousness, this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is the Condition, and is therefore a Righteousness, because made a
condition, by that new Law; yea &amp; elsewhere <hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 106. this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is said to be compleet &amp; perfect, as all Righteousness must be: we
see, what weight is laid upon it. And when there is no other Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
properly imputed to us, (for as for that Imputation of Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
which he would yeeld to as the only sound sense, it is but what
<hi>Iesuites, Socinians, &amp; Arminians</hi> yeeld to, &amp; we cannot be satisfied with,)
who seeth not, how this matter is framed so, as all the weight of the soul must
be laid upon this personal Righteousness, especially when it is made another
Sort of Condition, than we can acknowledge it to be, as shall be seen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward;
and when it is the immediat ground of our Right to Pardon, Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
Adoption &amp;c. for Christ's purchase was (to him) general &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and no more for one, than for another, and to all conditionally.</p>
               <p>If it be said. What hazard is there, so long as Christ's Righteousness is
held to be that, which satisfieth for the breach of the Covenant of Works,
&amp; is full Satisfaction to justice, and which hath purchased the New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and the new easie termes; our Righteousness, in performing the new
easie termes, whereby we come to have Right to life &amp; all the benefites pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
by Christ, is no way prejudicial unto that, nor robbeth not Christ's
Satisfaction of the least of the glory due to it. I <hi>Ans.</hi> The hazard still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth,
for hereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Gospel Righteousness, be it Faith alone, or Faith &amp;
Works together, is made the immediate &amp; sole ground of our Right to the
benefites; for what Christ did, was general &amp; common, and He, by what
he did, made no particular purchase of any good unto any, but procured the
New-Covenant, and the new grant of life upon the easie termes, alike un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all: the satisfaction, which he made unto the Law giver for the breach
of the old Covenant, was not as a peculiar Cautioner, for any in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
but was equally for all, &amp; as much for the damned, as for the saved;
So that our Right to the benefites cometh purely &amp; wholly from our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the New-Termes, which Christ is said to have purchased. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though our personal Righteousness hath no interest in purchasing the
New Covenant, or in making satisfaction to Justice, unto that end; yet Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
being now satisfied equally for all, and the New Covenant being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:104357:169"/>
alike for all, our personal Righteousness is that, which must bear the
glory of our interest in the benefits: &amp; the Obligation, where in we stand
to Christ, upon that account, is the same that others are under who reap
none of the benefites, which we reape by our New Righteousness. And here
it is also manifest, that Faith (if that should be made the Gospel-Righteousness
alone, without works) in order to the justification of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
is not conceived to act upon Christ, as the Lord our Righteousness,
that the soul may put on his Surety-righteousness &amp; thereby answere all chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
of the broken Law: but is conceived as our Work, and as our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the New Conditions, and as such is rested upon, &amp; leaned to;
Whereby man, hath ground of glorying before men, in himself, and not
in the Lord alone, for all have alike ground of glorying, upon that account,
seing what the Lord did was common to all, and this new personal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
maketh the difference.</p>
               <p>But it will be said, That Christ's Righteousness, being acknowledged to
be our only legal Righteousness, whereby we answere the charge of the Law,
the asserting of a Gospel-Righteousness, whereby we come to have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in that legal Righteousness, can do no prejudice. I <hi>Ans.</hi> Beside that
this maketh two distinct Righteousness as, &amp; the one a meane to obtean an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
the one within us a price (<hi>ex pacto</hi>) for the other without us; and
all this in order to Absolution from one charge of the Law brought in against
the sinner: hereby, as to us, our personal Righteousness is really made our
legal Righteousness, because it is made that Righteousness, whereupon
this man, and not the other that wants it, is freed from the charge of the
Law: for, according to this way, Faith is not imployed to lay hold on
Christ's Righteousness, that by presenting that Surety-Righteousness unto
justice, the soul may escape the charge, but when the charge of violation
of the Law of God is brought in against the sinner, his only reliefe is his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Righteousness,
which he presenteth, whereupon he pleadeth for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
&amp; Absolution, by vertue of the new Covenant, which Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased;
for should he alledge the death &amp; satisfaction of Christ that should
give no reliefe, because that was for all alike, &amp; thereby the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was purchased where in the Gospel Righteousness (whether Faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,
or Faith &amp; New Obedience) was set down, as the Condition; and
therefore it can stand him in no avail; but he must refuge himself from wrath
under the wings of his own Gospel-Righteousness (for he hath no other)
and thereupon rest secure, &amp; be confident of his Absolution from all that
the Law could charge against him. As, for example, if the Princes son
should by a valuable price, given to the Prince, procure new Termes and
Conditions to be proposed to a company of condemned treatours lying in
prison: if any one of these were challenged for the old crime, &amp; threatned
with the execution of the sentence past upon that account, it would be of no
avail to him, to say, the Princes son hath laid down a valuable price to
buy me from death, because he knew, that he did that for all the rest, in
purchasing a New Covenant, &amp; new conditions; but the first &amp; sure course
he would take, would be to present his performance of the new conditions,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:104357:169"/>
&amp; say, the charge cannot reach me, because I have performed the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the New Covenant, procured by the Princes son. This I suppose is
plaine &amp; cleare, &amp; this in our case, would be found to be the only saife cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
that poor challenged sinners would take, if they should act according to
the doctrine of our Adversaries, to which, (as I said) I should not dar to
advise one or other. But really the Gospel-way (which is opposite to this)
is plaine &amp; saife, if we have but so much humility, as to complye therewith:
And a difference may seem small, in the debate, which yet in practice may
prove great &amp; of dangerous consequence.</p>

               <p>WE heard what the Author of the <hi>discourse of the two Covenants,</hi> &amp;
what <hi>Iohn Goodwine</hi> said of this New Covenant. As the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their assertion of the imputation of faith, properly taken,
they tell us, that the New Covenant wherein this Righteousness is required,
as the condition thereof, is founded wholly in the blood of Christ, so that
whatever is required of man by way of condition of his acceptation with
God, becomes accepted to that end, upon account of Christ's suffering, Mr.
<hi>Allen</hi> p. 16. &amp; p. 53. 54. saith. <hi>Nor doth this, that faith accompanied with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is imputed for righteousness, at all derogate from the obedience &amp; sufferings
of Christ, in reference to the ends, for which they serve. Because the whole Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
&amp; all the parts &amp; termes of it, both promises of benefites, &amp; the Condition
on which they are promised, are all founded in Christ his undertaking for us; and
all the benefites of it accrue to us upon our beleeving &amp; obeying, upon his account &amp;
for his sake.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> also telleth us, in his book against D. <hi>Tully</hi> p. 66.
That <hi>that which Christ did by his merites, was to procure the new Covenant.</hi> And
elsewhere p. 181, <hi>that they were the meritorious cause of the forgiving Covenants,</hi>
&amp; the like he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith elsewhere frequently. The <hi>Arminians</hi> ground the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

himself <hi>disp. 19. thes.</hi> 7. that <hi>justification is attribute to faith, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the very righteousness, which may be proposed to God's rigide &amp; severe
judgment, howbeit acceptable to God; but because, by the judgment of mercy
triumphing over judgment, it obtaineth pardon of sins, &amp; is graciously imputed
unto righteousness, the cause of which is both God righteous &amp; merciful, &amp; Christ
by his obedience, oblation &amp; intercession.</hi> And in his Epistle <hi>ad Hyppolet.</hi> he tels
us, that <hi>the word imputing signifieth that faith is not the righteousness it self, but
that it is graciously accounted for righteousness, whereby all worth is taken away
from faith, except, that which is by God's gracious estimation &amp; that gracious
estimation of God is not without Christ, but in respect of Christ, in Christ, &amp; for
Christ. Christ by his obedience is the impetrating cause, or meritorious, why God
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:104357:170"/>
imputeth faith to us unto righteousness.</hi> And againe in his <hi>Artic. perpend. de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stif.
What fault is it so say, that faith by free &amp; gracious acceptation is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for righteousness, because of Christ's obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But with this assertion, we are not satisfied, for these reasons</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Arminians,</hi> who maintaine this so confidently, make it the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
of what Christ merited by his death &amp; Satisfaction, saying that Christ by
his death did so satisfie the offended party, as he would be favourable to the
offender; and so say, that he acquired to the father a <hi>jus</hi> &amp; a will to enter
into a new Covenant with men. See their Confess. c. 8. §. 9. collat. cum
<hi>Apolog.</hi> c. 8. §. 9. and as the learned <hi>Voetius</hi> inferreth <hi>Select. dispp.</hi> p. 2. p.
233, 234. it followeth hence, that Christ was not in very deed our Cautioner;
that he died not in our room &amp; stead; that he did properly obtaine &amp; acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
nothing to us; &amp; that he did not sustaine the person of the elect, while
he suffered on the crosse.</p>
               <p>2. ... that Christ procured no more, but a power or liberty unto God of
prescribing new Conditions; and some go so far, as to say, that this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was such only, at the Lord might, if he had pleased, have appointed the
old way of works againe, for the condition; So said <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> ag. <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi>
But it is true, they yeeld more, who grant, that he purchased the
New Covenant: Yet by this purchase, they can not say, that Christ died
to redeem us from our sinnes from the wrath of God, from a vaine conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
&amp; to save us: And indeed the same person last named, saith expresly,
that Christ died not properly to saye any one. And what can else be said
by such, as make this the whole of what Christ did purchase? And how-ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
is that consequence, which the same person hath, when he saith it might
so have come to passe, that Christ had had the end of his death, &amp; that no
one had fulfilled the new Covenant, &amp; had been saved; for they will not
grant, that Christ did purchase faith.</p>
               <p>3. Hence we see, that such as say, that this was all which Christ procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by his Death &amp; Merites, do manifestly spoile us of all the rich Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
which Christ hath purchased, as being no immediat fruites of his death;
such as Faith, Justification, Adoption, Sanctification, Grace, &amp; Glory,
&amp; thus evacuat the whole vertue of the death of Christ: And this do Mr.
<hi>Allen's</hi> words p. 54. import while he saith, <hi>that all the benefites of the Covenant
accrue to us upon our beleeving &amp; obeying, upon his account &amp; for his sake:</hi> and
so they do not accrue to us upon his account &amp; for his sake immediately; but
immediatly upon the account &amp; for the sake of our Beleeving &amp; Obeying;
only for Christ's sake is this connexion made.</p>
               <p>4. Who ever assert, that Christ hath purchased the framing &amp; Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Covenant, in its termes &amp; conditions, ought to confirme this
their assertion out of Scripture; &amp; till this be done, we are a liberty to deny
it, how confidently so ever it be affirmed. It is certane, that such a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
point &amp; ground article of our Religion would not be darkly expressed
in the Scriptures, far less wholly passed over in silence, as, for any thing
that yet is made to appear, it is: for as for 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 30. &amp; <hi>Ier.</hi> 23: 6. which
Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> citeth, any may see how impertinent they are, that we say no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:104357:170"/>
5. If so, then we must say with <hi>Papists,</hi> that Christ hath procured a worth
to our Faith &amp; Obedience, to merite <hi>ex pacto,</hi> the good things promised
unto such, as are beleevers &amp; obedient: Yea hereby there would be more
of merite in our Faith, then in Christ's obedience.</p>
               <p>6. We mnst say, that Christ hath purchased that we might be Justified by
an Imperfect Righteousness; For sure, our faith &amp; new Obedience is not
perfect even when sincere, they laboure of many Imperfections, &amp; have
drosse &amp; faultiness admixed: As also that he hath purchased, that an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Righteousness should be accounted &amp; estemed a perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
&amp; consequently that the judgment of God shnuld not be according to
truth: which were blasphemeous &amp; iniquous to imagine.</p>
               <p>7. Thus in effect, Christ should be made the minister of sin, by changing
the conditions of the old Law, which were perfect &amp; compleet Obedience,
into an obedience far short of that, &amp; thus he must be come either to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the Obligation of the Law, that it should not exact now, what it did
exact of old; or to loose us from the Obligation thereof; that we should
be in part Law less; neither of which can be asserted; &amp; yet this Position
maketh clear way for either, or for both.</p>
               <p>8. Then we must say, that Christ hath purchased such a way of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as leaveth ground to men to glory &amp; boast though not before God, yet
before men; for hereby he is made to purchase the renewing of the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of works, with some mitigation, as to tht termes, though with
little mitigation, as to the persons; unless we say with these <hi>Arminians,</hi> that
Man is as able to beleeve &amp; obey sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erely, if he will, as <hi>Adam</hi> was to obey
perfectly: But sure Christ came for a far other end, than to leave man any
ground of boa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ting, or of glorying in himself for his Justification &amp; Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as having made himself to differ.</p>
               <p>9. Then Christ hath purchased a way, whereby man might hold his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Justification, Adoption &amp;c. more of himself, than of Christ; for
Christ by this way cannot be said to have purchased our Pardon, Justification
&amp;c. but only that we should have these favoures upon our Faith: or have
such &amp; such a reward of our Faith &amp; Obedience; As he, who procureth that
a person shall have such a benefite upon condition he performe such a piece
of service, cannot be said to have procured that reward; for notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of this procurement (if it may be so called, which is at best, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
uncertain thing) the person might never have gote the reward.</p>
               <p>10. Then the making of the New Covenant, and the making of it on
these termes, should be an act of meer Justice, in God, and not an act of
his free Grace, Love, good Pleasure, Will &amp; Kindness: for it is Justice &amp;
Righteousness in God, to do that, which Christ hath purchased &amp; procured
to be done; though, it is true, it may thus be accounted a meer favoure,
that it was of God's free will, to enter into such termes of agreement with
the Mediator, &amp; to yeeld to the making of such a condition, upon Christ's
purchase. But the Apostle tels us <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 9. <hi>that God made known unto us
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Which mysterie of his will is the New Covenant &amp; dispensation of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:104357:171"/>
grace in the Gospel; &amp; it is ascribed not to the merites of Christ; but to
God's good Pleasure, &amp; to the Purpose, which he purposed in himself. So
the saving of such as beleeve, floweth from the love of God, as well as, &amp;
no less then the sending of Christ <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: 16. <hi>God so loved the world, that he
sent his only begotten son, that every beleever in him should not perish, but have
everlasting life.</hi> So <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3: 9, 10, 11. the fellowshipe of the mysterie was
hid in God; &amp; the manifold wisdom of God (which shineth forth in the
New Covenant) was according to the eternal Purpose; which he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in Christ Jesus, our Lord. This is ascribed to God's <hi>Love Ioh.</hi> 3: 16.
&amp; <hi>will Ioh.</hi> 6: 40.</p>
               <p>11. I grant, it may be said, that as Christ hath purchased to his own
Pardon, Justification, Adoption &amp; Salvation; so, as a consequence of this,
he hath purposed the Meanes, or rather the Application of the meanes,
thereunto, that so the good things purchased may be actually conferred, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the manner &amp; methode condescended upon by Jehovah and the
Mediator in the Coveuant of Redemption; for He <hi>hath chosen us, in himself
having predestinat us unto the Adoption of children, by Iesus Christ, unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
wherein he hath made us acctpted, in the beloved, in whom we have redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
through his blood, the forgivness of sins &amp;c. Ephes.</hi> 1: 4, 5, 6, 7. the chosen

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>:
But this matter is not consistent with their Assertion, who say, that Christ
by his death hath purchased Faith &amp; New Obedience to be the Condition
of the Covenant, because by their Universal Redemption they leave all at
an uncertainty, especially when also they will not grant, that Christ hath
purchased Faith itself to any person.</p>
               <p>12. It must be said ... that Christ purchased the termes of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
... and purchased, that God should abolish the Law quite, and not
require a conformitie thereunto, as our Righteousness, by vertue of the
new Covenant, nor exact full Obedience to the Law, from any, in our
name; &amp; consequently it must be said, that Christ hath purchased, that
the Law giver should wholly passe from that established Constitution, <hi>do &amp;
live,</hi> without any real accomplishment thereof, or requiring the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
thereof from any, on their behalf, to the end, the Lord might
be just, when he is the justifier of him that beleeveth in Jesus.</p>
               <p>13. This assertion also stricketh against Christ's being the Surety of the
New Covenant: for it is not the work of a Surety, as such, to purchase the
Making &amp; Constitution of a Covenant; but to confirme &amp; ratifie the same,
&amp; to engage for the party, for whom he is a Surety, that he shall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
the conditions, accorded to in the Covenant; &amp; so to establish the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
or contract, already agreed unto &amp; constituted.</p>
               <p>14. Thus it should be said, that Christ died rather for graces, than for
persons, <hi>to wit.</hi> That Faith &amp; new obedience may be elevated beyond their
ordinare sphere, &amp; exalted to be the Condition of the New Covenant. But
the whole Scriptures speak otherwise of Christ's death.</p>
               <p>15. If this were the thing that Christ procured, he could not be said
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:104357:171"/>
to have Redeemed any, not so have died in the room &amp; stand of any, but
only for our good, as say the <hi>Sociniant,</hi> To purchase a new Covenant, is

as opposed by the Lawyers to what is <hi>Casual;</hi> &amp; as importing that the
person of whom that condition is required, hath full power to performe
it, if he will, except some inevitable, &amp; unfore-seen impediment fall out,
which is not ordinarily supposed; how can any reckon Faith amongst these,
unless they grant, that it is as much in Man's power to beleeve, as it is to
one at <hi>Rome,</hi> to ascend the Capitol, if he fall not sick, or break not his leg?
Whereby to all, who are not <hi>Pelagians, Socinians</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminians</hi> in this
matter, but acknowledge Faith to be the pure gift of God, &amp; wrought by
the Spirit, Regenerating the soul &amp; giving an heart of flesh, it may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that no kinde of Conditions, spoken of by <hi>Lawyers,</hi> who treat only
of Compacts, &amp; other Actions, betwixt man &amp; man, can comprehend
this matter; whereof we are now speaking. Where is there such an instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
in all the Law, of a person promising to give or to do such or such a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
Courtesie, upon condition that he do something, which is not in his
power, nor in his will, &amp; which he only who promiseth, can make him
able &amp; willing to do? This would either be looked on by them, as an <hi>impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
condition,</hi> which is next to none, or if the promiser should possiblie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
him to fulfil, as a <hi>casual condition,</hi> or rather, as no proper condition at
all. If a father should promise his little childe an apple, on condition he
should touch the Crown of his fathers head with his finger, which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for him to do, unless the Father should either stoop so low unto him
with his head; or take him up in his armes, that he may reach his head;
who would call this a <hi>potestative condition?</hi> But next, what meaneth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
by this <hi>jus actuale?</hi> Is this the same with <hi>jus in re,</hi> as opposed to <hi>jus ad
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:104357:173"/>
rem? this jus ad rem;</hi> which yet I suppose, he will not grant, or doth he
meane by this. ... But what is a Potential Right? Is it the same with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
right? and how very far remote must that Right be (if it be at all)
which the Reprobat have? And is there no difference as to this <hi>Remote</hi> &amp; <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential
Right,</hi> or what way it may be called, which is opposite to an <hi>Actual
Right</hi> betwixt the Reprobat &amp; the Elect, before Faith? It is like, <hi>Mr. Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
will say, there is none, by reason that the Redemption is Universal and
for all alike, &amp; so that Right, how ever it be called, that preceedeth the
Actual Right, is equally common to all, if we meane that Potential Right,
which followeth upon the Redemption. But to us, who affirme, that Christ
died only for the Elect, &amp; that he took on their debt; &amp; in due time made
fall satisfaction, according to his undertaking, these Elect ones for whom
Christ engadged, in the Covenant of Redemption, have another sort of
right, call it Potential, or what you will, than the Reprobat have: becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
Christ hath purchased all the blessings, promised in the Covenant, unto
them: and he hath a Right keeped, for them, and not for the rest: so that
a Right unto all these good things, being purchased by their Lord Redeemer,
&amp; Cautioner, and left unto them as his sure legacie, in his Testament, &amp;
all so ensured, that in due time, according to the methode condescended
upon, they shall be put in possession of the same, their Right is in Christ's
purchase, and they are put in actual Possession of Justification, when they
beleeve; which Faith is also purchased for them: all the benefites they shall
enjoy concerning grace &amp; glory are equally by him purchased, &amp; are equally
neer related unto his merites &amp; death, as to the right, though as to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
collation, Soveraigne wisdom hath appointed an Order, &amp; determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of one, before another, &amp; so hath resolved to give faith, and than
Justification &amp;c. And though it be true, that in this case, what is <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditione,
non est in obligatione,</hi> as to the actual possession; yet we cannot think,
but the holy &amp; Just God, having received satisfaction from the Mediator, in
behalfe of such, for whom it was laid down, is under an obligation (as we
may conceive, and speake) unto the Mediator, to cause him see of the
travel of his soul, &amp; to give him his seed, and those he purchased, and in
due time to call them effectually, &amp; work Faith in them, &amp; then Justifie
&amp;c. Adopt them &amp;c. &amp; thus bestow all the benefites purchased upon then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in the time &amp; methode wisely determined. But if <hi>Mr.Baxter</hi> understand
by this <hi>jus actuale,</hi> that is constituted upon the performance of the condition,
a plaine, and simple Right unto the benefite, we can acknowledge no such
Condition, lest we render the death of Christ void: for in him alone, have
we all our Law-title &amp; Right to all the blessings of the Covenant, to Faith,
&amp; all that follow upon it.</p>
               <p>That we may put an end to this, we shall first shew, in what sense, we
cannot admit Faith to be a Condition, &amp; then shew in what sense we do
admit the denomination.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>first</hi> we say. 1. We cannot admit it to be a Condition, in their
sense who will have Justification so to depend upon it, as on a Procuring

                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:104357:173"/>
saith that benefite as a Reward: for this destroyeth the Freedome of
Grace, that: shineth forth in our Justification; &amp; overturneth the whole
nature of the Covenant of Grace, &amp; spoileth Christ of his glory; and doth
man to come in, as a sharer in the glory of that purchase.</p>
               <p>2. We cannot admit it to be a Condition, in their sense, who take a new
Obedience with it: for this taketh away the special Use of Faith and its special
End, in laying hold on &amp; refuging the soul under the wings of the Surety-Righteousness
of Jesus Christ; This changeth the nature of the Covenant of
Grace, &amp; maketh it a new Covenant of Works, &amp; giveth ground of boasting
&amp; of glorying before men; yea &amp; maketh the reward of Justification, and
what followeth thereupon, to be of debt, &amp; not of grace: And such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in the Covenant of Grace we cannot owne.</p>
               <p>3. We cannot admit it to be a Condition, in their sense, who make it
strickly <hi>a Potestative Condition;</hi> placeing it in the power &amp; free will of man,
to beleeve or not, as he will; for as this overturneth the whole Covenant
of Grace, and exalteth proud man; so it parteth, at least, the glory of
Redemption betwixt Christ &amp; Man; &amp; giveth man ground to sing to the
praise of his own Lord, free will; &amp; to say, he hath made himself to differ,
&amp; he oweth but halfe thanks, &amp; hardly so much, to Jesus Chaist, for all
that he hath done and suffered, in order to the purchasing of Salvation.</p>
               <p>4. We cannot own it for a Condition, in their sense, who make it, or

that for a Righteousness, which is no fulfilling of the Law; &amp; Christ
is made to have procured, that it should be so; &amp; that his own Surety-Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
should no otherwayes be imputed.</p>
               <p>5. We cannot account Faith a Condition, in their sense, who ascribe to
it or to it with works, the same Place, Use &amp; Efficacie in the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
that Perfect Obedience had in the old Covenant of Works: for this
maketh the New Covenant nothing but a new Edition of the old; and shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
Christ, the Lord our Righteousness, far away, who is &amp; should be
our immediat Righteousness, that in him we might be found hid, &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
from the dint of the Law-Curse; and with all giveth proud man too
palpable ground of boasting, contrare to the whole Contrivance of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Covenant.</p>
               <p>6. We cannot owne it for a Condition, in their sense, who reject it, and
disowne it for an Instrument, or an Instrumental Meane, in our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
because they deny that particular and special Use, which it hath, in
our Justification, &amp; so pervert its whole Gospel-Nature: Its special use &amp;
work in Justification being to lay hold on the Lord Jesus, &amp; his side jussorie-Righteousness,
to carry the Man out of himself, as renuncing his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
&amp; every thing that is not Christ &amp; his Righteousness, that as
poor, empty, &amp; naked he may lay hold on, &amp; rest upon the Surety-Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the publick person &amp; Cautioner, Jesus Christ: for thus Christ
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:104357:174"/>
&amp; his Righteousness are put by, and he getteth not that rent of glory that is
only due to him; &amp; the soul is made to leane upon something beside this
Rock of ages.</p>
               <p>7. We cannot admit it for a Condition, in their sense, who will have
us hereby to have gotten a legal Title or Right unto Justification &amp; other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
according. ... following the same; seing this puts the crown upon
Mans head, as having by his deed acquired a <hi>jus</hi> &amp; Law-right unto these
blessings, which become hereby a reward not of grace, but of just debt:
We acknowledge all our Right &amp; Title to all the blessings of the Covenant,
to be from Christ, the only purchaser; &amp; of him must we hold all, that
all may be of free grace, &amp; he, even he alone, may have all the Glory,
having redeemed us with his precious bloud, &amp; purchased the whole Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
of grace &amp; glory for us.</p>
               <p>8. We cannot account it a Condition, in their sense, who plead for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Redemption; because thereby Christ is only made to have purchased
something to all alike, &amp; that Conditionally, &amp; no more grace &amp; glory
for <hi>Peter</hi> than for <hi>Iudas,</hi> but <hi>Peter</hi> by his own Paines &amp; Industrie, by his
Faith &amp; New Obedience, did purchase the whole personal and immediat
Right unto the blessings, which he enjoyeth; and hath received no more
from Christ, than what <hi>Iudas</hi> had, &amp; so hath no more ground of exalting
him for Redeemer, than those have, who perish, seing what he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
was common to all, &amp; no more for one in particulur than for another:
for this setteth the crown upon mans head, who hath saved himself by his
sweating, paines &amp; labour; and spoileth our Lord Redeemer of his glory.</p>
               <p>9. Nor can we account it a condition, in their sense, who will have the
whole or principal part of what Christ purchased to be the New Covenant
&amp; the Termes &amp; Conditions thereof; as if Christ had been a Cautioner for
none in particular, but had so far redeemed all, as to have brought them
into such an estate, wherein they might now work &amp; won for themselves,
run &amp; fight for the prize, according to the new Conditions purchased; and
so, if they run well, sacrifice to their own net, and burn incense to their own
drag, because by their own industrie &amp; care in performing the Conditions,
now made easier, than they were to <hi>Adam</hi> in the first Covenant, their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is fat, &amp; their meat plenteous.</p>
               <p>10. Nor yet can we call it a Condition, in their sense, who will have us
look upon it, in the work of Justification, purely as a work of ours &amp; as an
act of Obedience to a command; &amp; as such a work, as comprehendeth in it
all the works of new Obedience: for thus its peculiar Use of applying Christ,
&amp; of apprehending his Surety-Righteousness, is taken from it; &amp; the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
nature of the new Covenant is changed into the old Covenant of works;
&amp; Christ's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idejussorie-Righteousness is not made our immediat Gospel-Righteousness;
yea when we are thus justified by Faith, we are justified by
works; whereby the whole of the Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l's disput is overturned; &amp; we are
taught to leane to, &amp; lay our weight upon a Righteousness within ourselves;
contrare to the whole scope of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Upon the other hand, we say, Faith may be looked upon, and called a
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:104357:174"/>
Condition of the Covenant, and of Justification, in this sense; That Christ
having purchased all the good things of the Covenant, all the sure Mercies
of <hi>David,</hi> all Grace, and all Glory, unto the chosen ones, and the Father
having promised the actual collation &amp; bestowing of all and every one of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
mercies &amp; blessings, so purchased and procured; and Jehovah &amp; the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
both, in the counsel of their will condescending on such a methode
&amp; way of making the ransomed ones the owners of the Blessings purchased,
that is, first to give the New Heart and the heart of fless and in effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
worke them up to Faith in and Union with Christ and so draw them to
the mediator, and cause them accept of him, &amp; wait upon him, and rest
there, for life &amp; salvation; and then to Justifie, Accepte of as Righteous,
Adopte them, and then worke the works of holiness by his Spirit &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
in their soul; and so carrie on the work unto Perfection, till grace be
crowned with glory: matters, I say, being thus wisely ordered, in the
councel of heaven, there is a Priority of order; Faith, receiving Christ, and
resting on his Surety-righteousness, going before; and Justification following,
and a firme connexion made betwixt the two, that who so ever beleeveth thus,
shall be justified, and none shall be justified who beleeveth not thus: Now,
when by vertue of this constitute order &amp; Method, explained &amp; revealed
in the Gospel, the Ambassadours of Christ, in obedience to their Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
call upon all, who heare the Gospel, to receive Christ and refuge
themselves under his wings, and receive the atonement through his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and promise them thereupon, in their Masters name, Pardon,
Peace with God, Reconciliation; and acceptance &amp;c. nothing more is here
insinuated, than that such a Methode &amp; Order is wisely determined, and
that there is a fixed connexion made betwixt Faith &amp; Justification; so that
who ever would be saved from the wrath to come; &amp; would enjoy God for
ever, must come unto God in this way, and according to this methode, and
must receive his blessings and Favoures, in this order, first beleeve, and
lay hold on Christ and his Righteousness, and then receive Justification &amp;c.
Thus we see faith is no legal, Antecedent Condition, no Proper or Potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Condition; but only a consequent, or Evangelick Condition, or a
Condition denoting a fixed and prescribed Order and Method of receiving of
the blessings purchased by Christ, with a firme and fixed connexion betwixt
the performance of the condition, and the granting of the thing promised
thereupon. Thus Christ hath the whole glory of the work; Man is abased, and
hath nothing to glory of in himself; The reward is not of debt, but purely
of grace; The wisdom and love of God is wonderful and remarkable; All
ground of carnal security and self confidence is removed; A plaine and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful
ground is laid for ministers, to press, exhort, aud obtest to Faith in
the first place, with all seriousness and zeal; Full security and ground of
confidence of being Justified and Accepted of God upon our beleeving, is
given; The difference betwixt the Covenant of works and the Covenant of
Grace, is distinctly observed; The <hi>Antinomian</hi> mistakes, saying we are Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
from Eternity, or at the death of Christ, or at any time before faith,
are manifestly obviated; And all grounds of excepting against, or dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:104357:175"/>
with this way, are removed from all such, as will willingly comply
with the designe of free grace, in the Gospel.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">How faith is and may be called an Instrument, in
Justification.</head>
               <p>COncerning the Instrumentality of faith in Justification, much needeth
not be said, howbeit too much hath been written, about it &amp; that to
very little edification; so I judge: I am sure, to little use, as to the
clearing up of that concerning pointe of Justification, &amp; the true interest of
Faith therein.</p>
               <p>We heard, in the beginning of the proceeding <hi>Chapter,</hi> how both <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
&amp; <hi>Arminians</hi> did disowne faith its being an Instrument, and <hi>Papists</hi> also
before them did plead against it: On the other hand, the orthodox, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
against <hi>Papists, Socinians,</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminians,</hi> did unanimously assert Faith to
be an Instrument, or to be considered as an Instrument, in the matter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.
And few, or none, can be instanced of those, who hold with
the orthodox, in all chiefe Controversies, about Justification, that did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne,
or so much as deny Faith to be an Instrument, in justification; Yea
<hi>Iohn Goodwine,</hi> in his <hi>book of justification,</hi> doth expresly call it an Instrument
in justification.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Scripture no where calleth faith an instrument; &amp; the same
being no Scripture expression, there needeth not be much strife about it, nor
will there be, among such, as are unanimous, in the maine &amp; principal
Questions about Justification; or to that, which is only designed &amp; intended
by that expression. And though the Scripture doth not use that expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>interminis,</hi> yet no man can hence inferre, that all use of it, and of
the like should be laid aside, nor can such be supposed to adde to the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
(as <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> hinteth. <hi>Apol.</hi> against <hi>Mr. Blake</hi> p. 40.) who call Faith
an Instrument; more then he can suppose that himself addeth to the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
when he calleth faith a Condition, or <hi>a causa sine qua non,</hi> for these are
as little to be found expresly, in the Scriptures, as the other. Nor do they,
who say Faith is an Instrument, so much plead for the name, as for the
thing intended thereby: All expressions, that are not in Scripture, must
not be laid aside, in our speaking of divine things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for then we must lay asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
the word <hi>Trinity, Sacrament, Satisfaction</hi> &amp; several others: far less must
the truth, which we conceive can be intelligibly &amp; usefully expressed by
those borrowed words and termes, be laid aside, because the terme itself, by
which we express our Conceptions of the truth, is not in so many letters
&amp; syllabs to be found in Scripture, if so indeed, we had <hi>quickly</hi> lost a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
point of our Religion, and yeelded the cause unto the <hi>Socinians.</hi>
If the Scripture may be explained, we may make use of such expressions,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:104357:175"/>
termes &amp; sentences, as will, according to their usual acceptation, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to make the truthes revealed in Scripture intelligible to such, as heare
us. And when some termes have been innocently used in Theologie, for
explication of truthes, whether to the more learned, or to the more unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
&amp; have p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ssed among the orthodox without controll, or contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
beyond the ordinary time of prescriptions; it cannot but give
ground of suspicion for any, now to remove these old Land-marks, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when it is attempted to be done, by such meanes &amp; arguments, as will
equally enforce a rejection of many Scriptural expressions: for should all the
Metaphorical expressions &amp; sentences, which are in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ature, be so canvassed,
&amp; rejected, because every thing agreeing properly to them when used, in
their own native soile, doth not quadrate with them, as used in the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
in things divine, where should we Land? If these divine mysteries had
been expressed to us only in termes, adequatly corresponding with &amp; suiting
the matter; how should we have understood the same? Therefore we finde
the Lord condescending in the Scriptures, to our low Capacities, and
expressing sublime &amp; high mysteries, by low &amp; borrowed expressions, to
the end, we might be in case to understand so much thereof, as may prove,
through the Lord's blessing, saving unto us: And thereby hath allowed such,
as would explaine these matters unto the capacity of others, to use such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
expressions, as may contribute some light &amp; understanding to them,
in the truthes themselves.</p>
               <p>Now when the orthodox have, according to their allowed liberty, made
use of the word <hi>Instrument,</hi> in this matter, and maintained that Faith was,
&amp; was nothing more then an Instrument, in Justification; it is not faire to
reject it altogether, because improper, though fit enough to signifie what
they did intend thereby; &amp; because all the properties, that agree to proper
Physical, or artificial Instruments, do not agree to it; and because if the
same be strickly examined, according to the rules of Philosophie, concerning
Instrumental Causes, it will be found to differ from them. <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
writting against D. <hi>Kendal.</hi> §. 47. tels us, that <hi>the thing; which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth,
is, that Faith is an Instrument, in the strick logical sense, that is, an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
efficient cause of our Iustification; &amp; that he expresly discla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>meth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
de nomine, or contradicting any, that only use the word instrument, in an
improper large sense, as Mechanicks &amp; Rhetoricians do: So that the question</hi> (saith
he), <hi>is</hi> de re, <hi>Whether it efficiently cause our Iustification, as an Instrument?</hi>
But it may be conceived to have some efficient Influence, in our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not as that is taken simply &amp; strickly for God's act justifying, but as
taken largely, comprehending the whole benefite: as activly coming from
God, &amp; as Passively received by or terminated on us, &amp; that as an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though not in that proper sense, that <hi>Logicians,</hi> or <hi>Metaphysicians</hi>
take Instrumental causes, and explaine them, in order to physical &amp; natural
Effects. We know, that Justification is a supernatural work &amp; effect; and
therefore, though in explaining of it in its Causes, we may make use of
such termes, as are used about the expressing of the Causes of Natural, or
Artificial Works &amp; Effects; yet no Law can force us, to understand by these
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:104357:176"/>
borrowed expressions, the same proper, &amp; Formal Efficacy, Efficiency and
influence, which is imported by these Expressions, when used about Natural
Causes &amp; Effects.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> against <hi>Mr. Blake</hi> §. 5. tels us, what great reasons he had
to move him to quarrel with this calling of faith an Instrument <hi>viz.</hi> he found
that <hi>many learned divines did not only assert this Instrumentality, but they laid so
great a stress upon it, as if the maine difference betwixt us &amp; the Papists lay here,</hi>
And yet any might think, that they had reason so to do, when <hi>Papist's</hi> on the
other hand, laid as great stresse upon the denying of Faiths Instrumentality.
He tels us moreover, that our divines judged Papists to erre in Justification
fundamentally, in these points 1. about the formal Cause, which is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Righteousness of Christ, as suffering &amp; perfectly obeying for us. 2. About
the way of our participation herein, which as to God's act is Imputation,
&amp; that in this sense, that legaliter we are esteemed to have fulfilled the Law
in Christ. 3. About the nature of that faith, which justifieth. 4. About the
formal reason of faiths interest in justification, which is as the Instrument
thereof. I <hi>doubt not</hi> (saith <hi>Mr. Baxter) but all these four are great errors.</hi>
But we neither may, nor can call all errors, which <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> calleth errors.
We have seen above how necessary truthes the <hi>two first</hi> are, and have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
in part, the <hi>third,</hi> wherein I confesse, too many (yet not all)
of the forraigne divines have, as to expression, missed the explication of
true Justifying faith &amp; it may be, it was not their designe to describe it so, as
it might agree to the faith of every sincere, though weak beleever: but
rather to shew its true nature, grounds &amp; tendency, when at its best; &amp;
yet what <hi>Papists</hi> hold, on the contrare, is more false &amp; absurd. But as to
this <hi>fourth,</hi> it seemes, that it hath a necessary dependance upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going;
and this to me seemes to be the maine reason, why our Divines did
owne &amp; plead for Faiths Instrumentality, in the matter of Justification, <hi>viz.</hi>
because the Righteousness, which they called the Formal, or others the
Material Cause thereof, was not any Righteousness inherent in us, as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
said; but the Surety-Righteousness of the Cautioner Christ, without
us: And therefore they behoved to look on Faith, in this matter, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
then <hi>Papists</hi> did, and not account it a part of our Formal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but only look upon it, as an hand to lay hold on &amp; bring-in the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Righteousness
of Jesus Christ; and therefore judged it most fit to call it
only an Instrumental Cause. And how ever <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> exaggerat this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as complying with <hi>Papist's</hi> in condemning us, as to all these contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
and think it no wonder, they judge the whole Protestant cause
naught, because we erre in these, and yet make this the maine pairt of the
Protestant cause; yet we must not be scarred from these truthes; Yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this point hath such a connexion with the other, concerning that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
upon the account of which we are to be Justified in the sight of
God, we are called to contend also for this, &amp; that so much the rather, that,
though <hi>Papist's</hi> do utterly mistake the Nature of Justification, and confound
it with Sanctification; yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath more rational apprehensions
there about, and yet will not have Christ's Righteousness to be that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:104357:176"/>
Righteousness, upon the account of which we are Justified.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding, we need not owne it for such an Instrument, or
such an Instrumental cause, as <hi>Philosophers</hi> largely treate of, in the <hi>Logicks</hi>
&amp; <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> knowing that the Effect here wrought is no Natural Effect,
brought about by Natural Efficient &amp; Instrumental Causes; Only we say,
the Scripture affirming, that we are justified <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
giveth us ground to call Faith (if we will use such termes, to expresse our
mind) an Instrument, seing these expressions pointe forth, some special in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
&amp; influence, that Faith hath in Justification, &amp; no other Influence or
Causation can be allowed to it, conforme to the Scriptures; but that, which,
we express in our ordinary discourse, not in a strick Philosophical sense, by
an Instrument. And that so much the rather, that hereby is pointed forth
that, which is the maine ground &amp; designe of using this terme, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Application of the Righteousness of Christ, which is made by Faith, as a
meane or mid's laying hold upon without which we cannot be Justified, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Gospel; And though in these borrowed expressions from Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
metaphysical accuracy be not intended, yet the true meaning &amp; intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the users of these termes being obvious, it is but vanity, to raise too
much dust thereabout; unless difference about other more Principal Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
in the matter of Justification, enforce it, as indeed all such as place
the Formal Cause or reason of our justification before God in our own Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Righteousness, and not in the Righteousness of Christ imputed to us
&amp; received by faith, must of necessity deny all interest of faith here, as an
Instrument, or as any thing like it; because, having all their Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
within them, they have no use for Faith to lay hold-on &amp; bring-in one
from without.</p>
               <p>There things may satisfie us, as grounds of this Denomination.</p>
               <p>1. That in justification, we are said to be receivers, &amp; do receive some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from the Lord; not only the Passive justification itself expressed by our
being justified, but of some thing in order thereunto, as of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the Abundance of Grace &amp; of the Gift of Righteousness, the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the word of promise, yea every thing that concurreth unto justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or accompanieth it, we are said to receive, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 12. <hi>Col.</hi> 2: 6. <hi>Rem.</hi> 5:

               <p>2. That the only Grace, whereby we are said to receive these things, is
Faith: receiving is explained to be beleeving <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 2: 41. comp.
with <hi>vers.</hi> 44. we receive forgiveness of sins by faith <hi>Act.</hi> 26: 18.</p>
               <p>3. That the Surety-Righteousness of Christ, is that only Righteousness,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pon the account of which we are justified before God, &amp; not any Inherent
Righteousness within ourselves, hath been evinced above.</p>
               <p>4. That this Righteousness of the Surety must be imputed unto such, as
are to be Justified, or reckoned upon their score; hath also been evinced.</p>
               <p>5. That this Surety-Righteousness of Christ must be laid hold on by us,
in order to our justification, hath been showne; &amp; must be granted by all,
that acknowledge it to be the Righteousness, upon the account of which we
are Justified.</p>

that Faith must have a far other interest in; &amp; must otherwise concurre unto
our Justification, than any other Works, or Graces; and therefore must
be looked upon, as having some peculiarity of interest and influence here,
and this peculiarity of interest, can not be otherwayes better expressed, so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as the matter shall be cleared, then by calling it an Instrument. Not as if
it did concurre to the produceing of the effect of justification by any Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
operation, as Physical Instruments do; but as a medium &amp; mean requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of us, in order to Justification, according to the free pleasure of God,
who disposeth the order &amp; methode of his bestowing of his Favours upon us,
aud the Relation &amp; Respect; that one hath unto another, as he seeth most
for his own glory, and for our good; and that such a mean, as concurreth
therein, and thereunto, according to what is said, in such a way, as we
be can best understand by calling it an Instrument; for we can not allow it to
be called any way meritorious, or any formal disposition of the soul or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
unto the Introduction of an Inherent Formal Cause of Justification,
as <hi>Papists</hi> say; nor can we allow it to be called such a proper &amp; Potestative
Condition, as some would have it to be, as we saw in the forgoing <hi>Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. That no real inconvenience can follow upon the owning of Faith for
an Instrument, in justification; for Justification is not here taken simply &amp;
strickly for that, which is properly God's act, but more largely &amp; complexly,
including other things requisite unto Justification, such as the Imputation of
the Righteousness of Christ, which Faith, as the Instrument or hand of the
soul, layeth hold on, &amp; bringeth-in, for this end, that the man being
clothed therewith, may be acquitted before the Tribunal of God, Pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
&amp; accepted of as Righteous. And howbeit it be God, that justifieth,
&amp; as to this act of God justifying, Faith hath no real interest or influence;
yet the Scripture saying, that God justifieth by Faith, and through faith, we
must acknowledge some interest, that Faith hath, in the work &amp; Effect; as
when the Scripture saith, that He <hi>purifieth the heart by faith Act.</hi> 15: 9. the
purifying of the heart is God's work, and yet it is said to be done by Faith,
which is our work. It is said <hi>Heh.</hi> 11: 11, that <hi>through faith Sara herself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
strength to conceive seed</hi> &amp; vers. 33, 34. that some <hi>through faith subdued
Kingdomes, stopped the mouthes of Lions, quenched the violence of fire</hi> &amp;c. all
which were the works of God, &amp; yet while they are said to be done by faith,
faith must have had some interest &amp; influence in these effects. So in working
faith in the soul, which is God's work alone, the Lord useth the preaching
of the Gospel, and ministers, &amp; the peoples hearkning &amp; listning to what is
preached, as meanes &amp; midses thereunto; though preaching &amp; hearing be
mens work, yet God useth them for his ends; and as he sendeth Preachers to
preach, &amp; moveth persons to hear, that thereby he may, according to his
own will &amp; pleasure, work Faith in then; so he worketh Faith in souls,
that he may, thereby Justify them. Nor is it of any weight to say, that if
Faith be an Instrument, it must work as an efficient cause, because the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:104357:177"/>
Cause belongeth to the Efficient; for neither do all Philosophers
agree to this, some holding Instruments to be a fift kinde of Cause; nor are
we obliged to stand to their prescriptions &amp; rules, especially in these things,
that are no natural causes or effects; no man saith, that faith hath the same
kind &amp; measure of Efficiency in &amp; towards the effect, justification, that all
Instrumental causes, or Instrumental causes so called, have in the Effects,
which they concurre to the producing of; what efficiency hath an <hi>examplary
cause,</hi> which some <hi>Philosophers</hi> reduce to the efficient <hi>viz. Keckerman:</hi> But
that Faith hath some Influence, is manifest from the Scripture, not of it
self, it is true, but by the gracious appointment of God; and that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
cannot be better &amp; more saifly expressed, than by the name of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
appeareth to us clear; hereby nothing of the glory due to God,
or unto Jesus Christ, and to his Righteousness, is ascribed unto man, nor
is any more hereby granted unto Man, than to a beggar, as to the enriching
of himself, when it is said, his hand made him rich, by receiving the Purse
of gold, that was given unto him: yea hereby is Christ &amp; his Righteousness
more fixedly established, in their due place, because faith is considered not
as a Righteousness of it self, nor as a part of Righteousness; but purely and
simply as an Instrument of the soul laying hold on the Righteousness of
Christ, and pleading the same, as the only Formal ground of his justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before God. If it be said, that it were saifer to call it a <hi>causa sine qua
non.</hi> We must first know, what is properly signified thereby, &amp; whether
it will help us more, to understand the just &amp; true import of the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
about Faith in Justification; for no termes ought to be used, that
attaine not this end, or have not a direct tendency thereunto; such ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
however we may please our selves in the invention of their application
unto the business in hand, and think we are in case to defend the same against
opponents; yet if they do not contribute manifestly to the clearing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of the matter, according to the Scriptures, can only darken the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
And no reason can enforce us to embrace them, with the arbitrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
&amp; limitations of the Authors, and to reject or lay aside such, as
do more obviously explaine the matter, unto all such, as have orthodox ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of the matter; and have given offence to none, nor have been
excepted against by any, but such as were not orthodox in the point of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
&amp; whose erroneous Principles led them to deny, or except against
the same. And what for a cause shall we take that, <hi>causa sine qua non</hi> to be?
(which cannot be so explained in our language, as that every one that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, shall be in case to understand, what it meaneth) Such as speak of it,
call it <hi>causa fatua,</hi> and referre to it external occasions, time &amp; place, and
such like things, without which the action cannot proceed, as the place
wherein we stand, &amp; the time, wherein we do any thing, which have no
more interest in, or relation to one action, than another, for all must be done
by us, in some time, and in some place: And shall we say, that faith hath
no other interest or influence in justification, than the hour of the day, when
or the place wherein a minister preacheth, hath into his preaching? Shall
we have so meane &amp; low an account of the ordinances &amp; appointments of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:104357:178"/>
God, in reference to spiritual ends? Seing the Lord hath appointed Faith,
in order to Justification, we must not look upon it as a <hi>causa fatua,</hi> or as a
meer circumstance, but as having some kindly influence in the effect, by
vertue of the appointment of God, &amp; such a connexion therewith, that it no
sooner existeth, but as soon justification followeth. Faith then can not be
called a meer <hi>causa sine qua non.</hi> Historical faith &amp; several other antecedents,
may be a <hi>conditio</hi> or <hi>causa sine qua non;</hi> for no man of age can be justified
without it; yet we may not say, that we justified by it, as by saving faith;
the same may be said of Conviction &amp; Sense of sin, of some measure at
least, of legal Repentance, and of desire of Pardon &amp; of Peace, which yet
may be, and oft are without justification. And it may also seem strange, how
this <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> can be called a <hi>potestative condition;</hi> or how that,
which is said to be a proper Potestative Condition, <hi>ex cujus praestatione con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituitur
jus actuale ad beneficium,</hi> can be called a meer <hi>conditio</hi> or <hi>causa sine
qua non,</hi> seing it hath such a considerable moral influence in the effect?</p>
               <p>But saith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> against Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> §. 27, <hi>faith cannot justifie both as a
Condition, &amp; as an Instrument of Iustification; for either of them importeth the</hi>
proximam &amp; causalem rationem <hi>of faith, as to the effect; &amp; it is utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with its nature, to have two such different neerest causal interests. Ans.</hi>
When we speak of Faiths justifying, as an Instrument, we consider the
physical, or <hi>quasi</hi> physical way of its operation, and denote only its kindly
acting on Jesus Christ, and on his Righteousness which it layeth hold on, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth,
apprehendeth, &amp; putteth on. And when we say it justifieth as a
condition, we consider it as appointed of God unto that end, &amp; as placed
by Him, in that state &amp; relation unto justification, which now it hath:
And either of these can be called the <hi>proxima ratio causalis</hi> of Faith, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to its different consideration: if justification, (meaning not God's act
only, but the complex relative change) be considered in <hi>genere Physico,</hi> or
<hi>quasi physico,</hi> then the neerest causal interest of faith, is its instrumentality:
but if it be considered <hi>in genere morali,</hi> or <hi>legali,</hi> then its neerest causal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
is, that it is a condition. As when a rich man bestoweth a purse of
gold on a beggar, &amp; requireth that he, in order to the possessing of it,
streatch forth his hand, &amp; take it, considering this act of enriching him <hi>in
genere physico,</hi> his hand acteth herein, as an Instrument, apprehending the
purse, &amp; taking it to himself: considering this, <hi>in genere legali</hi> or <hi>morali,</hi>
the streatching forth of his hand, and apprehending the purse is a condition;
for so the donor hath determined to give the riches, after such a manner &amp;
methode, for his own ends, according to his good pleasure. Thus we see,
how faith can, in its way, produce one &amp; the same effect of justification,
both as an Instrument, and as a Condition, taking these termes, in a large
sense, according to the matter in hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith <hi>Confess.</hi> p. 89. he <hi>denieth that Faith is an Instrument of Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
because he dar not give so much of Christ's honour to man, or any act of
mans, as to be an efficient cause of pardoning himself. Ans.</hi> And he knoweth,
that the orthodox do of purpose, call faith an Instrument in justification, in
opposition to the <hi>Papists,</hi> that Christ may weare the honour alone, and
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:104357:178"/>
man may be abased: &amp; if they have been unhappy, in falling upon the <hi>medium</hi>
to that end; Yet their Intention was honest. But when Faith is called an
Instrument in justification, justification is not taken for an act of accepting
&amp; pardoning alone; for they knew, that it was God only that accepteth &amp;
pardoneth, &amp; that it is he only, who Justifieth; but they took justification
in a more comprehensive sense, as including Christ's Righteousness, the
only formal ground of justification, in reference to which, Faith is said to
act as an Instrument receiving. And this may satisfie such, as will not have
the mysteries of God cast in a pure Philosophical mould, because some such
termes are used for explications sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Baxter Confess.</hi> p. 95. saith. <hi>Such as say, faith justifieth</hi> qua instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
<hi>de most certainly make it to justifie, as an action.</hi> And in his <hi>postscript,</hi>
to <hi>Mr. Cartwright. Those that make faith to justifie, as an Instrument, or as</hi>
apprehensio Christi, <hi>do set up the</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> credere, <hi>which they cry down; for that,
which they call</hi> instrumentality, <hi>is the apprehensive act,</hi> &amp; apprehendere &amp;
credere <hi>are here all one. They contradict themselves in saying, that</hi> Paul <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
all works, because faith (say they) justifieth not as</hi> a work: <hi>for to justifie</hi>
qua instrumentum, <hi>or</hi> qua apprehensio Christi, <hi>is to justifie as</hi> a work, <hi>or as</hi>
this work. <hi>And so this doctrine sets up justification by works &amp; that in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
sense; for it maketh the formal reason of Faiths justifying to be its</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
<hi>that is, that it is</hi> such an action; <hi>or its</hi> instrumentality, <hi>which is</hi> an
operation.] <hi>Ans.</hi> This is no new <hi>Objection;</hi> for <hi>Schlichtingius</hi> the <hi>Socinian
Cont. Meisnerum</hi> p. 130. did object the same upon the matter. It is true, when
we say faith Justifieth as an Instrument, we make it to Justifie as an action,
taking <hi>qua specificativè</hi> as he himself also must do, when he faith it justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
as a Condition Potestative, for a potestative condition is some action
performed, &amp; himself, as we heard, called it <hi>actio voluntaria de futuro.</hi>
But he knoweth, that when it is said, that Faith justifieth, as an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the meaning is but more emphatically to shew, that it is the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ, which faith apprehendeth, by which we are justified,
&amp; that they, who cry up the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>credere,</hi> make that the Righteousness, by
which we are justified; so that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>credere</hi> in their sense, who will have
it imputed to us for Righteousness, respecteth immediatly the benefite, <hi>to
wit,</hi> Pardon, Acceptation &amp;c. Faith as an Instrument, or apprehension,
in our sense, respecteth Christ &amp; his Righteousness immediatly, which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
as an Instrument, in order to the benefite, which is had upon the
account of Christ &amp; his Righteousness, made ours; In our sense, faith is
no more, but as the hand receiving bread, and as the mouth eating it, in
order to food &amp; nourishment thereby; in their sense, faith is made the very
food &amp; nourishment, or meat it self that nourisheth: When we say, that
Faith Justifieth as an Instrument, it is but, as if we said, man liveth by his
hands taking meat, and by his mouth eating it; when they say, that faith
justifieth as a work, &amp; that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>credere</hi> is imputed for Righteousness, it
is, as if they said, the hand &amp; the mouth are the very food, or the meat
it self, by which we live and are nourished: we, looking upon Faith as an
Instrument, as upon the hand and mouth, as instruments of nourishment,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:104357:179"/>
ascribe all the vertue of nourishment unto the meat. They, denying the
hand and the mouth to be considered here as instruments, and saying that we
live and are nourished by the hand and the mouth, (just as they do, when
they make the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>credere</hi> our Righteousness, in reference to justification)
ascribe all the vertue of nourishment unto the hand &amp; the mouth, and so
set up the hand &amp; the mouth, in the place, that is due unto the meat, and
rob the meat, of that power &amp; vertue, that is only proper to it. Yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
when we say, that hands and mouth nourish us as Instruments, we do
not deny, but in a general sense, our receiving of meat with our hands, &amp;
eating of it with our mouth, are conditions of nourishment, importing he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby,
that the wise God hath appointed this order and methode, giving us
hands to receive meat, &amp; mouths to eat it, &amp; a stomach to digest it, in
order to the living, and receiving thereby nourishment; only we do not
say, they are such conditions, as have all the vertue of nourishment in them.
This is but a similitude, and so must halt in some things, as all similitudes
do; yet it serveth to illustrate the matter, and to shew the difference betwixt
our expressions, and the expressions of our Adversaries, in this matter; &amp;
how little ground there is so this objection, and particularly how, when
we say faith justifieth as an Instrument, we do not withall say, it justifieth,
as a work, in our Adversaries sense; And how, when we say, Faith is a
condition, we do not withall say, that it justifieth as a potestative proper
condition, in our Adversaries sense; as also, how we cannot admit, that
faith shall be called no more, than a <hi>causa sine qua non;</hi> seing it is so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that eating &amp; digesting of meat hath another influence into nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by food, than a meer <hi>causa sine qua non</hi> hath into any effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Baxter Confess.</hi> p. 95. 96. <hi>I must therefore professe, that after long conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
I know no one terme, that properly expresseth this neerest &amp; formal interest
of faith in justification, but only the terme</hi> condition, <hi>as that is usually taken
for the condition of a free gift, &amp; when the Scripture telleth us, how faith justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
it is in such termes, as these,</hi> if thou confess with thy mouth &amp;c. he
that beleeveth shall be saved &amp;c. <hi>In all which, if the conditional if, &amp; the
conditional forme of the promise, express not a condition, I despaire of ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it in this life. Ans.</hi> As for the neerest &amp; formal interest of Faith, in
Justification, if all other questions touching that fundamental truth of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
were satisfyingly determined, &amp; put to an end, there needed not
be much controversie; but when as we have seen, the decision of this hath
such an interest in the decision of more substantial points, or necessarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
the same, enquirie with sobriety after the truth, even in these les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
things, cannot be condemned; And, on the contrare, receding from,
&amp; condemning received termes &amp; expressions, which have an obvious, plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
&amp; sound meaning, being taken, according as they have been constantly
used, because not quadrating every way with mens new Philosophical and
too metaphysical apprehensions &amp; notions, in this matter, cannot but be
displeasing. And too much Philophical accuracy in the clearing up of these
mysteries, is not the most edifying &amp; saife way of explication. 2. We are
not against the use of the terme <hi>Condition</hi> in this matter, knowing that faith
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:104357:179"/>
may well be called a condition, but the question is in what sense we must
take the word, <hi>condition:</hi> And to say, that <hi>it is taken, as commonly used for
the condition of a free gift,</hi> will not satisfie in our case; because though the
gift which we expect by faith, is to us indeed free; yet it is a purchased free
gift; &amp; such a free gift, as these who get it, have all the legal title &amp; Right
thereunto, through the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tioners purchase &amp; payment, &amp; only come to
the possession of it through Faith, according to the wise methode &amp; Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion,
made by the Soveraigne Lord. <hi>Adam's</hi> perfect obedience might ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
been called the condition of a free gift: and we cannot give the same
place &amp; power to Faith in the New Covenant, that perfect obedience had
in the old; for <hi>Adam</hi> if he had perfectly obeyed, had gote his reward with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any intervention of a Price by a Mediator, purchasing it, but we must
hold all our reward solely of Christ, that he may have the glory of all (3) as
(<hi>if</hi>) can denote a Condition, so (by, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) can denote an instrumental cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.
Himself tels us som-where in his <hi>Confut,</hi> of <hi>Ludom, Colvinus, aliàs Ludov,
Molinaeus,</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> denoteth an efficient cause &amp; we read, that we <hi>are Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And further, though these passages, which he
citeth, and the conditional if, and the conditional forme of the promise,
do indeed express a Condition; yet they do not say, or prove that the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<hi>Condition</hi> is the only one terme, that properly expresseth the nearest &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
interest of faith in Justification; or that the terme of an <hi>Instrument</hi> is no
way fit to express this neer &amp; formal interest of faith in justification, seing
to be justified by faith, or through faith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (all
which the Scripture useth) is as expressive of an Instrumental interest, as <hi>if
thou beleeve</hi> &amp;c. is expressive of a condition.</p>
               <p>He saith <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 89. <hi>Conclus. 10. That the difference betwixt him &amp; others,
is not that he giveth any more to works, than they; but that they give more to faith,
than he, &amp; consequently to man: &amp; if he be guilty of equalling faith &amp; obedience
too much, it is not by bringing up works too high (to be Instruments of Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as they make Faith) but in taking down Faith too much, &amp; consequently, in
too much abaseing all acts of man. Ans.</hi> If he bring up works to Faith, in our
Justification, &amp; give a like interest to both, he giveth more to works, than
the orthodox will do: And when we call faith an Instrument in justification,
we give not so much to it, as they do, who call it <hi>conditio potestativa,</hi> and
give it the same place in the New Covenant, that perfect obedience had in
the old, as was seen above: And who ever say this, are so far from deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
man &amp; his actions, that they give him, as much ground of glorying &amp;
boasting, as ever <hi>Adam</hi> would have had, if he had fulfilled the condition,
&amp; given full &amp; perfect Obedience: And he cannot but know, that that terme,
<hi>Instrument,</hi> was of purpose applied to Faith, in this matter, to depresse man,
&amp; to keep the crown upon the head of Christ, as it is apt enough to do, if
it be but candidely understood, &amp; taken as it is applied, and no further, nor
vexed with metaphysical niceties, a way, that might render every borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
terme, whether from arts or sciences, how expressive so ever of our
meaning, &amp; explicative of the matter intended, utterly useless. It is true,
when he calleth faith only a <hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> he seemeth to giveless to
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:104357:180"/>
Faith, than we do, if that terme be taken, in its strick sense, as it is by
Philosophers taken, who will not have it called a Cause at all, but rather
<hi>conditio sine qua non:</hi> But thus he depresseth it below that place &amp; interest,
which is due to all the institutions &amp; appointments of God, as such; for
none of them can rightly be called <hi>conditio sine qua non,</hi> and no more, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to that effect &amp; end, for which they are appointed of him; and far
less can Faith be said to be only <hi>conditio sine qua non,</hi> in reference to justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
seing by the unalterable appointment of the Soveraigne Lord, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
so dependeth upon &amp; is connected with Faith, that who ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth
(to wit, savingly, or with that Faith, which here we only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand)
whensoever he beleeveth, doth immediatly passe from death unte life,
and is justified. But no man will say, that the effect doth so much depend
upon, or is connected with that, which is but a <hi>conditio sine qua non,</hi> as was
before shewn, in several Instances: And where is then his <hi>Conditio Potestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va?</hi>
is that but a <hi>causa fatua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>ibid. Conclus.</hi> 9. he tels us, <hi>that one maine reason, which constrained him
to deny that Faith is an Instrument in justification, is because he dar not give so
much of Christ's honour to man, or any act of mans, as to be an efficiont cause of
pardoning himself. Ans.</hi> When we make Faith an Instrument in justification,
we make it not an Instrument of the act of pardoning, which is solely the
Lords act; but taking justification largly as including the Righteousness of
Christ the only ground thereof, we say, that in reference to Christ, &amp; this
Surety-Righteousness of his which is imputed, in order to the Lord's justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
&amp; Pardoning of us, faith acteth as an Instrument, apprehending Christ
&amp; his Righteousness, &amp; upon that account is to be considered as an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the matter of justification: And himself <hi>Concl. 11. ibid.</hi> saith that
<hi>he ever held, that it is only faith, that is the receiving of Christ, &amp; that faith
being the only receiving grace (wherein no meer moral duty or grace doth participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
of its honour or nature) it was therefore by God peculiarly destinated or appointed
to the office of justifying, as fittest to the glorying of free grace, &amp; of God Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
therein.</hi> And if this be the all. (as to the substance) of what we say,
or the most of that which we meane, when we call faith an Instrument, what
ground was there of differing from his brethren? or what ground was there
to feare, that Christ's honour should have been wronged thereby? Sure,
while Faith is called an Instrument, as receiving Christ &amp; his Righteousness,
in order to justification, Christ is more honoured in that affaire, than when
our Faith is made our Gospel-Righteousness, &amp; called a perfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
&amp; so our whole Righteousness (as some) a chiefe part of it (as others)
upon the account of which we are justified.</p>

               <head type="sub">What Interest Repentance hath in our Justification.</head>
               <p>IN reference to the clearing of this Question, about the Interest of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
in Justification, it will not be necessary to speak much of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
it self, the premitting of a few things will be sufficient unto our
purpose.</p>
               <p>The Hebrew word, which is rendered <hi>repent,</hi> is of a general signification
for it signifieth <hi>to return,</hi> whether from a place, or from the distemper of
our minds, or from our former courses; &amp; so denoteth a motion or change
of the body from one place to another; or of the mind from any purpose, or
of the whole way &amp; walk, and in special, it sometime signifieth a change of
the whole man to the better, both as to his Mind, Resolution, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
&amp; thus denoteth a mans turning unto God: And accordingly
we read in the <hi>New Testam.</hi> of the Prodigals coming or returning to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or to his right mind &amp; wits; and we heare of Repentance towards
God. In the <hi>N. Testam.</hi> there are two greek words, the one <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
such a change, as it attended with after care; the other <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
signifying such a change, as denoteth after-wit or after thought. Some do
so difference these two, as that they say, the <hi>last</hi> signifieth so to sorrow for
what is done, as to amend it, called by the latines <hi>Resipiscere</hi> &amp; therefore
properly is meaned of a good &amp; saving Repentance, wherein the penitent
returneth to his right wits, so as to reforme &amp; amend what hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse;
and the <hi>other</hi> denoteth properly care, anxiety &amp; solicitude after some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
done, called by the Latines <hi>poenitere,</hi> and this may be used in an evil
sense, as denoting properly no change of minde or carriage to the better,
but simply such a trouble &amp; anxiety for what is done, as maketh them wish,
it were not done, whether the thing done was good or evil. But in the
<hi>New Test.</hi> we finde not this difference constantly obsérved; for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
is taken both in a good sense, for a good Repentance, &amp; saving <hi>Mat.</hi> 21:
32, 29. and for a common Repentance, that is not saving. <hi>Mal:</hi> 27: 3.
where mention is made of <hi>Iudas</hi> repenting <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> indeed &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that
cometh therefrom, import a good &amp; saving Repentance, except, <hi>Heb.</hi>
12: 17.</p>
               <p>What this word denoteth, when used of God, either affirmativly, or
negativly, we need not here enquire. It is more for our purpose to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that Repentance may be taken in a threefold sense, 1. for a common
work of legal sorrow through conviction of hazard, because of sin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the man may rew, be grieved, &amp; be sorrowful for what he hath done,
and wish he had not done it, as <hi>Iudas</hi> repented of his wickedness. This may
be; and yet not be attended with Pardon of sins: And, as to such, in whom
the Lord purposeth to carry on the work of Condition, &amp; Humiliation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:104357:181"/>
it come to real Conversion, and an Union with Christ, though it may
be called a <hi>conditio sine qua non</hi> of Justification &amp; Pardon, in such, in regaird
that usually, if not alwayes, the Lord premitteth some thing of this, as to
some sensible measure, or other, unto his more gracious workings; yet
this Common Repentance hath no proper interest in justification, &amp; cannot
be called a Condition thereof, far less a Cause, seing in it self it hath no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
connexion with justification, &amp; though it be an antecedent in the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
yet it may be, and often is, where no justification followeth, being
in many nothing but the sorrow of the world, that worketh death 2. <hi>Cor.</hi>
7: 10.</p>
               <p>But 2. There is a Repentance, that is only peculiar unto such, as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Justified &amp; Pardoned, following upon &amp; flowing from the sense and
intimation of Pardon expressed by Self-abhoring, Self-lothing, Melting
of heart, and Tenderness &amp; the like. so <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16: 63. <hi>That thou mayest
remember &amp; be confounded, &amp; never open thy mouth any more, because of thy sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
when I am pacified toward thee &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36-25, 26, 27, 28. comp.
with <hi>vers.</hi> 31: See also <hi>Ier.</hi> 31: 19, 20. Neither can this be called, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a Condition of Justification, &amp; Remission, because it manifestly
followeth not only Justification, &amp; Remission, itself, but also the sense and
intimation thereof; &amp; therefore cannot go before it.</p>
               <p>But. 3. The greatest difficulty is anent that work of Repentance, which is
a saving work of the Spirit going a longs with Faith, ariseing from the sense
of sin committed, and the apprehension of the mercy of God in Christ,
causing spiritual &amp; kindly griefe, sorrow and indignation at themselves and
their sinful wayes; with an hatred of sin &amp; a fixed purpose to forsake it, and
to turn to the Lord &amp; this is frequently mentioned in the Scriptures. Now
this Repentance may be considered two wayes, <hi>first</hi> as it is in these, in whom
the Lord is working a work of Conversion, &amp; whom He is translating out
of dearkness in to the Kingdom of his dear Son, and <hi>Secondly</hi> as it is in such,
as are already brought in to a justified state, after new sins committed. As
to this <hi>last,</hi> we will have a fit occasion to enquire afterward, how or what
way it is required in reference to Remission &amp; Pardon of after-sins. The <hi>first</hi>
falleth now under consideration, because we are speaking of Justification,
which holdeth forth a change of state, as was formerly explained.</p>
               <p>That we may therefore proceed the more distinctly in this Inquisition, we
must fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by. And</p>
               <p>1. Sometime it denoteth most griefe, sorrow, or that which is called
contrition, or that part of Repentance, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 10: 33. where it is explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <hi>sitting in sackcloth &amp; ashes. Ier.</hi> 8: 6. - <hi>No man repented him of his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,
saying what have I done.</hi> Thus it may also be taken 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11: 21.-<hi>&amp;



that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, &amp; have not Repented of the
uncleaness &amp; fornication &amp; lasciviousness, which they have committed.</hi> Here, I
say, it may be looked upon as mostly denoting this part of Repentance;
though not as excluding the other parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:104357:181"/>
2. Some time it denoteth mostly a change of former courses &amp; wayes;
whether of errour, as 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2: 25. <hi>If God per adventure will give them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
to the acknowledging of the truth;</hi> or of Conversation, called <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from dead works Heb.</hi> 6: 1. So 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 7: 14. it is called a <hi>turning from
their evil wayes &amp; from sins Ezek.</hi> 18: 21. It was said to <hi>Simon Magus Act. 8:
22. repent of this thy wickedness. See Rev.</hi> 2: 21, 22.</p>
               <p>3. Sometime it denoteth the whole work of Conversion &amp; turning unto
God, <hi>Act.</hi> 26: 20 - <hi>that they should Repent &amp; turn to God,</hi> where the latter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
is but exegetick of the former. So also <hi>Act.</hi> 3: 19. <hi>Repent ye therefore
&amp; be converted:</hi> where both expressions denote one &amp; the same thing, the
last being explicative of the former <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18: 30. <hi>Repent &amp; turn yourselves.</hi>
And this is imported by many Synonimous expressions, in the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as Seeking the Lord Deut.</hi> 4: 29. <hi>Turning to the Lord vers. 30. Returning to
the Lord. Hos</hi> 5: 4. <hi>Seeking the face of God 2. Chron.</hi> 7: 14. &amp; the like. See
also <hi>Revel.</hi> 3: 19.</p>
               <p>4. It is sometimes expresly distinguished from Godly sorrow, &amp; mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as a Consequent, or fruite &amp; effect of it 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7: 9 - <hi>yee sorrowed to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. 10. for Godly sorrow worketh Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. Sometime it is expresse distinguished from Faith, as <hi>Act.</hi> 20; 21 - <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
toward God, &amp; faith toward our Lord Iesus Christ. Heb.</hi> 6: 1. <hi>not laying
againe the foundation of repentance from dead works, &amp; of faith towards God.</hi> So
<hi>Ier.</hi> 31: 19. <hi>after I was turned</hi> (that is wrought up to faith) <hi>I repented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Sometime it signifieth nothing else, upon the matter but a receiving
of the Gospel &amp; a beleeving in Christ, not only <hi>Mark.</hi> 1: 15. <hi>repens ye &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the Gospel;</hi> where the later is explicative of the former, but also in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other places, where <hi>Iohn Bapist</hi>'s ministrie is spoken of, the summe
whereof is said to have been <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand Mat.</hi>
3: 2. and his baptisme was called the <hi>Baptisme of Repentance Mark.</hi> 1: 4 or
<hi>unto Repentance Mat.</hi> 3: 11. See also <hi>Luk.</hi> 3: 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 13: 24. Now, that this
preaching of Repentance, &amp; Baptisme of or unto Repentance, which is
said to have been <hi>Iohn's</hi> ministrie, &amp; work, was the preaching of Faith in
the Messiah, <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us expreslie <hi>Act. 19 4. Then said Paul, Iohn verily
baptized with the baptisme of Repentance, saying unto the people, that they should
beleeve on him, which should come after him, that is, on Christ Iesus.</hi> So that,
by this Commentary of <hi>Paul's,</hi> we understand both what was the scope of
his Baptisme of Repentance, &amp; also what was the meaning of his calling on
his hearers to Repent, <hi>to wit,</hi> to embrace Christ, who came after him, &amp;
to beleeve in him. And by this Commentary, we may understand the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
of Christ's preaching <hi>Mat.</hi> 4: 17. <hi>from that time Iesus began to preach, &amp;
to say, Repent; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi> And this is called <hi>Mark.</hi> 1:
14. <hi>the Gospel of the Kingdom of God.</hi> As also of the preaching of the Apostles
&amp; Seventy disciples, when they were sent to say, <hi>the Kingdom of God was
come, or is nigh unto you Luk.</hi> 10: 9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10: 7. which is called the Gospel
<hi>Luk.</hi> 9: 6. and Repentance <hi>Mark.</hi> 6: 12. they went <hi>out &amp; preached that men
should Repent.</hi> By this also we may understand the meaning of these &amp; the
like passages <hi>Mat.</hi> 9: 13 - <hi>I am not come to call the Righteous, but sinners to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:104357:182"/>
So <hi>Mark.</hi> 2: 17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5: 32. as likewise of that passage <hi>Luk.</hi> 15: 7,
10 - <hi>joy in heaven, over one person, that repenteth:</hi> for this is Christ's saving of
the man, that was lost <hi>Mat.</hi> 18: 11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15: 4. &amp; 19. 10. See also <hi>Mat.</hi> 11:
20. <hi>Act.</hi> 2: 38. &amp; 11: 18. &amp; 26: 18. &amp; 20. compared together.</p>
               <p>7. Sometime it denoteth a recovery from some measure of defection, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which persons are backsliden, as <hi>Revel.</hi> 2: 5. <hi>Remember therefore, from when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
thou art fallen, &amp; Repent, &amp; do shy first works. So</hi> Ch. 3: 3. <hi>Remember there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
how thou hast received, &amp; heard, &amp; hold fast, &amp; Repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Sometime it is distinguished from works of Obedience, that follow
upon it &amp; flow from it; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 3: 8. <hi>bring forth fruits meet for Repentance,</hi>
that is fruits suiting or answerable unto a Christian state, or a state of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in Christ, which before we saw was denoted by <hi>Iohn's</hi> Baptisme. So
<hi>Luk.</hi> 3: 8. &amp; <hi>Act.</hi> 26: 10.</p>
               <p>9. Sometime it includeth all, that is required, in order to Salvation,
upon mans part, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3: 9 - <hi>not willing that any should pert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h, but that all
should come to Repentance.</hi> So that Repentance includeth all, that is requisite
to escape perishing. So <hi>Luk.</hi> 13: 3, 5 - <hi>except ye Repent ye shall all likewise
perish.</hi> So also <hi>Act.</hi> 5: 31. <hi>to give Repentance to Israel, &amp; Remission of sins;</hi>
where, as Remission of sins may comprehend all the spiritual favours and
privileges, which Christ bestoweth, so Repentance may include all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es
&amp; blessings, which he bestoweth, in order to the actual participating
of these privileges. Thus we may understand it <hi>Act.</hi> 17: 30. <hi>but now comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all men every where to Repent,</hi> that is, by the preached Gospel, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it cometh, commandeth all men to relinquish their courses of vanity
&amp; to embrace the Gospel of Salvation, &amp; to walk accordingly. So <hi>Luk.</hi> 24:
47. <hi>And that Repentance &amp; Remission of sins should be preached in his name among
all nations:</hi> which is the short summe of the Apostles Commission, <hi>to wit,</hi>
to exhort to all Christian duties, imported by Repentance; &amp; hold forth
all Gospel privileges, as an encouragment thereunto, included in Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sins.</p>
               <p>Having premitted these things; in order to the clearing of the question,
we would know further.</p>
               <p>1. That the Question is not, whether the doctrine of <hi>Papists</hi> about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
in order to Justification, be to be owned, in whole, or in part?
for none now appeareth in the direct owning of their Assertions, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
are utterly ignorant of true Justification, as different from Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as may sufficiently appeare by the very naming of their positions for
(1) They look upon Repentance as having force &amp; efficacy to expell sin, as
light hath to expell darkness, taking Remission to be a destroying of the very
being of sin, &amp; expelling of Corruption by contrary gracious Qualities, &amp;
inherent Holiness, of which they make Repentance a part. (2) They make
Repentance concurre, as a material cause dssposing the soul for receiving a
gracious Quality, for the expelling of sin. (3) They make Repentance to
obtain pardon by way of merite, and (4) by way of Satisfaction. Not to
mention (5) their Sacrament of Pennance. All which the Reader will finde
not only rejected; but also shortly &amp; solidly confused by worthy &amp; judicious

                  <hi>Mr. Durham</hi> in his <hi>Comment,</hi> on the <hi>Revel.</hi> in that <hi>digression</hi> on <hi>Repentance.
pag.</hi> 251.</p>
               <p>2. Nor is the Question, whether the Lord call for Repentance as a duty,
at the hands of such as either are to be Justified, or are already Justified? for
both these we willingly grant, as being divine truthes, richly confirmed in
the Scriptures, what ever <hi>Antinomians</hi> say to the contrary.</p>
               <p>3. Nor is the Question, whether Repentance be a Condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
or not? For if by a <hi>Condition of the Covenant,</hi> we understand every
thing, that is a duty, required of the Covenanters, it is readily granted,
as was said, that Repentance is a duty required of such as are really in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God; but if by a <hi>Condition of the Covenant</hi> be meaned a duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in order to the closing of the Covenant, or entering into Covenant,
upon the performing of which the Covenant is immediatly closed &amp; entered
into, this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s denied; and abundantly confuted by <hi>Mr. Durham,</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
Digression.</p>
               <p>4. But the Question is, if Repentance hath the same Place, Office, Use
&amp; Consideration in Justification, that Faith hath; so that it may be every
way as well, &amp; as fully called the Coudition of Justification, as Faith is; &amp;
so that it is called for in order to Justification, upon the same account, and
under the same formality, that Faith is called for. <hi>Socinians</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminians</hi>
(as we heard above) joine Repentance &amp; Faith, in the same Order &amp; Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
&amp; ascribe the same Office Use &amp; Power unto both, in order to Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tels us <hi>Confess. pag.</hi> 37. n. 19. That <hi>Repentance is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
by God, in the Gospel, a proper Condition of our first general pardon of sin, as
well as Faith is.</hi> And he laith down a ground for this interest of <hi>Repentance</hi>
(which, I suppose, will reach to the including of other works also) in the
foregoing n. 18. saying, a quatenus ad omne vale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> consequentia. <hi>If faiths for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
interest in pardon be, as it is the Condition of the act of pardon, then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is such a Condition, must have the same Kind of formal interest, as faith.</hi>
By the <hi>first general purdon of sin</hi> here, he meaneth Justification; for with
him Remission of sins &amp; Justification is all one thing. And yet afterward <hi>pag.
96. Concl.</hi> 29. he hath words, which would seem to give some peculiar inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
unto Faith; &amp; so contradict what is here said, for he saith, <hi>If any say, that
seing faith hath a peculiar aptitude to this office, therefore it must have a peculiar
Interest. I answere, so it hath. For I, it doth alone, without (merites, or) any
positive Gospel works of obedience (as such at least) procure (as far as belongs to
its office) our first full Justification. 2. The love of Christ received, Gratitude
&amp;c. are but as modification of Faith, which is called the receiving itself. Though
some of them be distinct physical acts, yet all the rest, morally considered, are but
as it were, the modification of faith: I mean of that act, which is the acceptance of
Christ, &amp; life freely given &amp;c.</hi> Now, I suppose, he will grant (as he doth
above, as we may see) that Repentance hath not that peculiar aptitude,
to this office, that Faith hath; &amp; consequently cannot have that peculiar
Interest, as he confesseth: I suppose also, that he will put Repentance, in
the same rank with Gospel-Works of Obedience; &amp; consequently it must
no more share of that special Interest, that belongeth to Faith, in this offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:104357:183"/>
than they: I suppose likewise, that he will grant Repentance to be but,
a Modification of Faith, as well, as Love &amp; Gratitude: and then I would
know, how Repentance can be said to be as proper a Condition of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as Faith is? Sure, if it be as proper, it must have as peculiar an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
for this peculiarity of Interest cannot respect its aptitude meerly, but
its de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>gned &amp; appointed state, in that office; otherwayes the objection,
which he moved, and answered, should have this sense, seing Faith hath
a peculiar aptitude to this office; therefore it must have a peculiar aptitude
to this office, which were non sense.</p>
               <p>Now that Repentance hath not the same Interest in Justification, that
Faith hath, we judge evident from these grounds.</p>
               <p>1. The Scripture tels us, that we are justified by Faith, and that several
times, &amp; not only saith it, but proveth it, as we saw above: But it no whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
saith, that we are justified by Repentance. And reason would require,
that such as say, that Repentance hath the same Interest in Justification, that
faith hath, should tell us, where it is said, we are justified by Repentance:
for when it is thus said of Faith, &amp; no where thus said of Repentance: the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
must be a vast difference, as to their interest in Justification; unless they
can give us some Scripture expressions concerning the Interest of Repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
aequivalent to this, we are justified by Repentance. If it be said. That
this is equipollent when it is said, <hi>Repent that your sins may be blotted out: &amp;
Repentance &amp; Remission of sins</hi> are joyned together &amp; the like. I <hi>answer,</hi> Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the particular examination of these &amp; the like passages alledged, untill
afterward, I shall only say this at present. (1) That justification &amp; Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sins are not every way the same. Though <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> hath several ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
said it; yet in his <hi>Catholick. Theolog.</hi> of <hi>God's Covenant</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Sect.</hi> XIII. n.
203. he saith <hi>our first constitutive justification is in its own Nature a Right to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity</hi>
(&amp; this, as he oft elsewhere tels us, is Remission) <hi>&amp; to life or glory.</hi>
Now what is beside a Right to Impunity, also a Right to life &amp; glory, is
more than Remission of sins: And therefore the consequence from Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to Justification cannot stand. (2) In like manner, because it is said <hi>Luk.</hi>
6: 37 - <hi>forgive &amp; it shall be forgiven you,</hi> it may be inferred, that for-giving
of our Neighbour some fault, that he hath done us, is the Condition of our
Constitutive Justification, &amp; hath as great an interest in our Justification, as
Faith it se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f, and by it we have as really Right to impunity, and Right to
life &amp; glory, as by Faith. It is true, <hi>Mr. Allen</hi> will not think this very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
who reasometh from this same passage, not far otherwise. In his <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the two Covenants.</hi> pag. 52. Yet I suppose, others will: &amp; I doubt,
if <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> shall make this one &amp; the same thing with Faith, as he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in his <hi>Catholick Theol.</hi> to make Faith &amp; Repentance one.</p>
               <p>It will be said, when we are said to be Justified by Faith, it is all one, as
if we were said to be Justified by Repentance: for <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> cleareth, <hi>Of
God's Govern. Sect.</hi> XII. how Faith &amp; Repentance is all one thing. I <hi>Ans.</hi> (1)
if the Spirit of the Lord had but once said, in his word, that we were justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Repentance, we might then be allowed, to think of such explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as might make either both one thing, or shew, how both hath the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:104357:183"/>
same interest in Justification: but when the Scripture never once saith, that
we are justified by Repentance, for us to devise such explications, as to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
the Scripture speak what it never speaketh, is not faire, nor is it to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
because it hath no tendency to explaine the matter, as expressed in
the Scriptures; and is so far from clearing up the truth, that it darkeneth
all; for hereby we are taught to understand faith, wherever we hear of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
&amp; Repentance, where mention is made of Faith; so that we
may ascribe all to Repentance, that is spoken of Faith <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. &amp; say, that
Repentance is the substance of things hoped for, &amp; the evidence of things
not seen &amp;c. (2) Though it is true, the word <hi>Repentance</hi> (as we have seen)
is sometime taken so largely, as to include faith; yet that will not allow us,
to say, we are Justified by Repentance, as we are justified by Faith: It is
best for us to follow Scripture language: The Scripture expresly denieth,
that we are justified by works; &amp; yet Repentance is sometimes, taken in
such a large sense, as to include all acts of Obedience; This way then would
allow us to sav, we are justified by all works of obedience, (even as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive
Justification) as we are by Faith: Yet <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Confess.</hi> p.
89, 90. putteth a difference betwixt Faith &amp; Evangelick Obedience as to
this Constitutive Justification, making the one, like consent to marriage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
or taking one to be my Captaine; &amp; the other like conjugal fidelity
&amp; obedience, or obeying the captain, &amp; sighting under him, &amp; tels us,
that he no more comprizeth all Obedience in Faith, than conjugal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in the marriage consent. (3) That Repentance is not the same with
Faith in the matter of justification; (in reference to which, we now speak
of both) will appear from our following reasons: So that whatever paines
be taken to make them one, on other accounts, will be to no purpose, as
to our present business.</p>
               <p>2. If Repentance have the same interest in Justification, that Faith hath,
then works shall have the same interest with Faith; but this is diametically
opposite to all the Apostles disput <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. &amp; 4. &amp; <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. The reason of
the Consequence is, because Repentance includeth works, &amp; is a special
work &amp; act of obedience itself <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> tels <hi>Confess.</hi> p. 94. That <hi>Paul's
scope is both to take down Moses's Law (especially its necessity &amp; conceited suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency)
&amp; the Dignity of legal works (&amp; consequently of any works) &amp; that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
by works</hi> Paul <hi>meaneth to exclude only merites, or works, which are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Meritorious, or which for the worth of the dead done, should procure Pardon &amp;
acceptance with God, without a Mediators blood; &amp; so</hi> Paul <hi>himself described the
works, that he speaketh against.</hi> Rom. 4: 4. <hi>That they are such as make the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to be not of Grace, but of debt. Ans.</hi> This is but the same we heard befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
from <hi>Iohn Godwine,</hi> and the same answer may suffice. (1) If the scope of
<hi>Paul</hi> had been only to take down <hi>Moses's</hi> Law; why did he speak so much of
the Gentiles, &amp; shew how they were all under sin, &amp; therefore must be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by Faith, &amp; not by the Law, or by works? This had no manifest
tendency to that scope. (2) Why brought he in the Instance of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
who was before the Law of <hi>Moses? Abraham's</hi> not being justified by works,
could not prove the insufficiency of <hi>Moses's</hi> Law thereunto: (3) To think,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:104357:184"/>
that the Jewes did conceite, that they would obtaine Pardon &amp; Acceptance
with God, only by their laborious performance of Ceremonies &amp; costly
Sacrifices, excluding all Moral acts of obedience, is apparently groundless;
contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 30, 31, 32. &amp; 10: 3, 4, 5. &amp; would say, that <hi>Paul</hi> took
not a right <hi>medium</hi> to destroy that conceite, for his neerest &amp; surest course
had been to have shown the nullity of that Law, now under the Gospel;
hereby all occasion of further debate being perfectly removed. (4) <hi>Paul</hi> is so
far <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 4. from describing the works, that he speaketh of, to be such only
as make the reward of debt, that he proveth that Justification cannot be by
works, by this <hi>medium,</hi> because then the reward should be reckoned, not
of grace, but of debt, and so telleth us, that all work make the reward
of debt: This is a manifest perversion of the Apostles argument: for he saith
not, <hi>now to him, that so worketh, as to conceite his works meritorious, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is not reckoned of grace, but of debt; but now to him that worketh:</hi> far less
can this be the meaning or construction of the words, <hi>now to him, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the reward to be not of grace, but of debt:</hi> for what sense is here? And
further the meaning of the following words must accordingly be this; <hi>but to
him that so worketh, as not to make the reward of debt but of grace, his working
is counted for Righteousness.</hi> While as the Apostle saith a plaine other thing.
<hi>But to him, that worketh not, but beleeveth on him, that justifieth the ungodly,
his faith is counted for righteousness.</hi> Sure, working without this conceite of
merite, is not beleeving on him, that justifieth the ungodly, neither are
these works counted for Righteousness; for holy <hi>Abraham</hi> wrought without
that conceite &amp; yet he was not justified by works, <hi>vers.</hi> 2, 3. Nor did <hi>David</hi>
meane, that mans blessedness did consist in the imputation of such works; nor
did he describe that blessedness, when he said, <hi>blessed are they, whose iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are forgiven &amp;c.</hi> Consider 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 4, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 5.</p>
               <p>3. Repentance hath no instrumentall acting on Christ &amp; his Righteons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in order to our being justified. But Faith hath this, as was shown in
the foregoing <hi>Chapter.</hi> Therefore Repentance hath not the same Interest in
Justification, that Faith hath. It is requisite &amp; necessary, in order to our
Justification, that we be clothed with a Righteousness, even the Surety-Righteousness
of Christ: and Faith only can lay hold on this &amp; put it on, &amp;
not Repentance. Repentance doth not act so upon any thing without a man,
to bring it home that it may become the mans Righteousness, it hath other
work, &amp; acteth upon another object, upon sin within the man. It is true
<hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Catholick Theol. of God's Government</hi> Sect. XI. will have faith
rather to be called a <hi>receiving cause</hi> than an Instrumental, <hi>&amp; a medium or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positive
cause of the effect, justification as as received, but not as given.</hi> And then
<hi>Sect.</hi> XII. he calleth <hi>Repentance</hi> a disposit to materiae recipientis <hi>too, &amp; a part of
the condition of the Covonant.</hi> But we think it needless here to distinguish,
with him, betwixt, <hi>receiving Iustification,</hi> &amp; <hi>being Justified,</hi> we do not
call Faith an Instrument of God's act Justifying, as was said above. If Faith
&amp; Repentance be dispositive causes of the effect &amp; <hi>causa dispositiva</hi> be part of
the <hi>causa materialis,</hi> as he also saith, I suppose, they are not meer <hi>causae
sine quibus non;</hi> as he said elsewhere. But to our business, we have cleared
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:104357:184"/>
before, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith acteth in the matter of Justification, how it receiveth
an imputed Righteousness &amp; laith hold on this Surety-Righteousness of Christ
&amp; applieth it, to the end, the accused impeached man may have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
he may stand before the Tribunal of God, &amp; be accepted of as
Righteous, in his Cautioner, &amp; through his Cautioners Righteousness im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him, &amp; now received by Faith: &amp; though <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> do account
Faith's <hi>accepting of Christ, &amp; life offered on that condition,</hi> only its <hi>aptitude</hi> to
the office, &amp; that the <hi>formal reason</hi> of its office as to our Justification, is its
<hi>being</hi> the <hi>performed condition of the Covenant,</hi> as he there speaketh; yet that
will not invalidat our argument: for (1) Faiths aptitude (as he calleth it) or
rather its work &amp; acting in Justification, is not meerly an accepting of
Christ, &amp; life offered on that condition; but it is the accepting, laying
hold on, leaning to, &amp; applying the Surety-Righteousness of Christ, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposing
the accepting of Christ himself. (2) Though it may be said, that the
neerest formal Reason of Faiths office, is the Lord's appointment; yet this
being too too Philosophical here contributeth nothing to the clearing up
of the matter, in order to practice, so neither was Philosophical accuracy
the ground whereupon they went, who said, that Faiths interest in Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
was as an Instrument, but rather their end was to cleare the matter
in order to Practice; so as poor souls might not fall into mistakes; &amp; this
I judge to be the best Theological acuracie, howbeit he should account ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such speaches nothing but unintelligible phrases, and such doctrine to
containe such senselesness &amp; consequents, as the opening up of would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
as he there speaketh. (3) It is certaine, that Repentance doth not so
act on Christ, and his Surety-Righteounsness, in order to Justification, as
Faith doth, Repentance, as such is no acceptance of a free gift, far less of
a gift of Righteousness, &amp; of an Atonement there-through; Repentance
acteth not thus on Christ: Yea the reason he giveth <hi>Confess.</hi> p. 39. why Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
was made a condition of pardon, doth sufficiently shew, that it
cannot have that interest, that Faith hath. His reason is this. <hi>Because with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it</hi> (Repentance) <hi>God &amp; the Redeemer cannot have their end in pardoning us;
Nor can the Redeemer do all his work, for which we do accept him: for his work is,
upon the pardoning of us, to bring us back in heart &amp; life to God; from whom we
were fallen &amp; strayed. This was Christ's work. Therefore the condition, which
Christ maketh, are, as if he should say,</hi> If you will be saved by me, &amp; are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that I shall bring you back to God, I will both bring you into his favour
by Pardon, and into a capacity of personal pleasing &amp; enjoying of him.
<hi>Now, our Repentance is our consent to return to God, &amp; the change of our mindes,
by turning from former sin, that was our idol, &amp; being willing by Christ to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to obedience.</hi> By this, I say, it is clear, that Repentance hath a more
direct aspect upon, &amp; reference to the consequences of Pardon &amp; Justific<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
itself; we grant its necessity unto all the ends mentioned, and its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
presence in such as are Justified; &amp; that its contrare, or positive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency,
cannot consist with Faith, in such as are to be Justified: Yet that
will not give ground to inferre, that it hath the same Interest, Influence &amp;
Consideration, in Justification, that Faith hath.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:104357:185"/>
                  <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> In his <hi>Confess.</hi> p. 39, 40. seemeth to grant this whole Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when he expresseth himself thus. <hi>This I say, that man may see, I do not
level Faith with Repentance, much less (as they charge me) with actual external
works of obedience, which in this first remission &amp; justification, I take not to be so
much, as existent.</hi> What he addeth concerning the <hi>Ratio forma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts,</hi> why faith
or Repentance have such an interest in our Pardon, <hi>to wit,</hi> because <hi>God hath
made them the Conditions of the promise,</hi> cannot hinder our conclusion, untill
first it be proved, that God hath made Repentance such a Condition, we
are speaking here of the difference, that is betwixt the two, as to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; Aptitude, which he confesseth to be very great, &amp; also as to their
place &amp; use because of the great difference, that is betwixt them, as to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
&amp; Aptitude.</p>
               <p>4. If the Interest of Faith be not, as it is a work, or inward grace. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in the soul, but as such a going out of the soul from it self, &amp; all its
own inherent good, and from all external privileges, or what may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
adherent personal good, unto an offered Mediator, that it may embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
him, &amp; lay hold on, and lean to his <hi>fide jussorie</hi>-Righteousness; then
Repentance cannot share in this Interest with it. But the former is true. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore &amp;c. The Conncection may be cleared from what is already said: we
are not speaking of that here which <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> will have to be the neerest
<hi>formal reason,</hi> nor of that only, which he will have to be its <hi>nature &amp; aptitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de:</hi>
but of its Use &amp; proper Actings in this office, in reference to the end,
Justification; which are such, as cannot agree to Repentance, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.
Himself tels us in his <hi>Confess.</hi> p. 89, 90. That he takes <hi>Repentance to be
to our faith in Christ, as the breaking off from other Suitors &amp; Lovers, &amp; turning
the mind to this one, is to Marriage.</hi> Whereby we see, that though Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
be necessarily required, in one that is a beleever, and that faith can
not be without Repentance; Yet Repentance hath no place in the office of
Justification, it hath no plaine formal &amp; immediat interest in the receiving
of Justification; as that turning to the minde from other Suitors to that one
hath no formal interest or place, in closeing the Marriage Covenant, though
it be a very necessary prerequisite unto right closing &amp; consenting the marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
Covenant. This giveth ground for another Argument.</p>
               <p>5. As upon the account that a woman hath changed her minde from other
Suitors, to one, it cannot be said or inferred, that therefore the Marriage
Relation is made up with that one Suitor; which is done only by a formal
full &amp; explicite Consent: so upon the account that one is a penitent, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be formally inferred, that that persons is in Covenant with Christ, and
is Justified. Because as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath told us, Repentance is unto Faith,
but as the womans changing her mind from other Suitors to one, is to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
unto the Marriage proposal. And if upon a Persons being a Penitent
it cannot be formally inferred, that he is in Covenant with God &amp; a Justified
person, then Repentance hath not that interest in Justification, that Faith
hath, for upon a mans beleeving, it can formally &amp; immediatly be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that he is in Covenant, and is Justified. I say <hi>formally;</hi> because con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentially
it will also follow, that a Penitent man (meaning one that is
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:104357:185"/>
truely penitent) is justified, upon this account, that where ever there is
true Repentance, there is also true Faith: But as the change of the womans
mind is not formally the making up of a marriage Covenant; So neither is
Repentance that, which formally constitutes a man a Covenanter with Christ,
and a Justified person, only Faith doth this; as the womans consent maketh
up the marriage-Relation.</p>
               <p>6. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Repentance hath the same interest in Justification with Faith; then
as our Adversaries say, that Faith is imputed to us, as our Gospel Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;
so must they say, that our Repentance is imputed to us for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
But, beside the reasons, whereby we proved above, that Faith
was not imputed to us, as our Gospel Righteousness, which will also serve
here, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> we may adde this, that there is nothing in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
giving the least countenance hereunto, even as to words or expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>7. If Repentance have such an interest in Justification, as Faith hath,
then this must either be true of Repentance as begun, or as perfected (I
meane as to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rts) But of neither it can be true; not of begun Repentance,
for questionless there are some beginnings of Repentance before Faith; (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Repentance largly, as it is here taken,) as the womans change of her
minde from other Suitors, is before her closeing a Marriage Covenant with
this man &amp; then it would follow, that a man were Justified before Faith;
which I suppose will not be said. Not of compleeted Repentance, for that
followeth faith; for thus it followeth godly sorrow, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7: 10. and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by that Carefulness, Clearing of ourselves, Indignation, Fear, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
desire, Zeal, &amp; Revenge, mentioned 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7: 11. all which must
follow Faith; And repenting <hi>Ephraim Ier.</hi> 31: 19. said, <hi>after I was turned,</hi> I
<hi>repented; &amp; after I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea,
even confounded &amp;c.</hi> This <hi>being instructed,</hi> &amp; <hi>being turned</hi> includeth Faith; &amp;
the rest, that followed upon it, are expressions of Repentance: and hence
it would follow, if only compleeted Repentance be that Repentance, that
hath the Interest in justification that Faith hath, a man cannot be said to be
justified upon his beleeving, no not untill Repentance be brought to this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
And then Faith cannot be the consenting act, whereupon the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane
is closed.</p>
               <p>8. Repentance can bring nothing in, that can stay, or prove a support
unto an awakened soul, pursued with the sense of wrath for the breach
of the Law; nor can it present any thing unto God, as a ground, whereupon
to be delivered from guilt &amp; wrath, as Faith can do &amp; doth, by laying hold
on Christ &amp; his Righteousness, an only sufficient ground, whereupon the
poor soul can have hope, and with confidence can expect Absolution: The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
it cannot have the same interest, in justification. The antecedent is
clear, &amp; undeniable, &amp; the Consequence is also manifest; because this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in the matter of justification must be estimate according to the ground
of Hope, that is yeelded thereby unto the poor vexed &amp; tossed soul, &amp; the
ground of Confidence that is had thereby of Acceptance of God.</p>
               <p>9. To say, that Repentance hath the same interest in justification, that
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:104357:186"/>
Faith hath, will prove, I judge, dangerous doctrine to many poor wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sinners; &amp; prove a meane to keep them off the Rock of ages, and at
least, a meane to hinder or retard their motion Christ-ward, in order to
Peace &amp; Reconciliation with God: for experience teacheth such, as deale
with wakened Consciences, that the most of their work oft times is to keep
them from resting on someting within themselves, in order to Peace, and
particularly from relying &amp; resting upon some sort of Griefe, Sorrow, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
which they conceive to be in themselves &amp; to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing them unto a
cleanly resting upon Christ &amp; his Righteousness, forsaking all other things:
And when now they hear, that Repentance hath the same interest in justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
that Faith hath, how will they be fortified in their Resolutions, so
that all the labour &amp; paines of Ministers, or other Christians may prove
much fruitless, unless the Lord come in a wonderful manner, &amp; many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may perish in their presumptuous thoughts, founded on their inward
Sorrow &amp; Repentance, as they supposed, because they would never go
out of themselves to leane to Christ &amp; his Righteousness. It is true, These
of the contrary minde, presse not Repentance alone, but Faith &amp; Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
together. Yet by their way, I finde not the right Gospel-exercise of
Faith-pressed, that is, faith bringing in an imputed Righteousness, or laying
hold on Christ for Righteousness, &amp; refuging the Soul in Him, &amp; resting
upon that, as the only &amp; absolutly surest ground of Confident appearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and of expecting Pardon &amp; Peace; but only such or such an act
of faith pressed, as being now under the <hi>New</hi> Covenant in the same place,
that Perfect Obedience had in the <hi>Old,</hi> whereby, as the Old Covenant is but
renewed, so the wakened or alarmed sinner is but taught to look after &amp; lean
to something within himself, as his immediat Righteousness, upon which
he must be justified.</p>
               <p>10. If the Surety-Righteousness of Christ imputed by God, &amp; received by
Faith, be only that Righteousness, upon the account of which, the poor
sinner is to be accepted of God as Righteous, &amp; to be absolved from the
Curse of the Law; As we have above proved it to be; then Repentance
cannot have the same interest in justification, that Faith hath; because it
neither doth, nor can so lay hold upon this Cautionary-Righteousness, as
Faith doth. Or we might frame the argument thus. If Repentance have the
same interest in justification, that Faith hath, Christ's Cautionary-Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
shall not be the only Righteousness, with which, the soul that is
to be justified, must be clothed; because Repentance cannot put on Christ &amp;
his Righteousness, as faith doth. But this last cannot be said, for reasons gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
already.</p>
               <p>11. If Repentance hath the same interest in justification, that faith hath,
then even by Gospel justification, there should be ground left to man, to
boast, &amp; to glory before men; &amp; the reward should not be of grace, but
of debt; contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. &amp;. 4. The Consequence is clear, because Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
acteth not on a Righteousness without us; and can be considered
no other way, then as an act of Obedience in man, and so as a work: and
Faith by this way goeth under the same Consideration; &amp; is not considered,
as bringing-in the Surety-Righteousness of Christ, and laying hold on it
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:104357:186"/>
alone; (as it is by our way) for both are looked upon as <hi>dispositive causes,</hi>
and as parts therefore of the <hi>material cause,</hi> and as proper <hi>potestative condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
just as perfect obedience was under the Old Covenant. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
difference be acknowledged to be betwixt them, as to their Essence &amp;
Aptitude, whereby Faith is said to be <hi>an acceptance of the gift</hi> formally, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
not so, in its averting act (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is speaking <hi>Cath. Theol. ubi
supra</hi> Sect. XII. n. 201.) whatever it may be as to other acts: yet they are
both made formal Potestative conditions, as is said, &amp; so solely considered,
as works done by us: and all such, as was evidenced above, make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of debt, &amp; give ground of boasting; because, being our formal works,
they are made the immediat &amp; formal, legal ground of our Justification,
being made our immediat, formal &amp; perfect Gospel-Righteousness; as was
seen above.</p>
               <p>12. Adde to these. That if Repentance have the same Interest in Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that Faith hath, God cannot be beleeved on, as the justifier of the
ungodly, contrare to <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 5. for Faith &amp; Repentance are hereby made
the mans personal Righteousness, and <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> tels us <hi>Confess.</hi> p. 46. n. 38.
that <hi>there is no such thing</hi> in rerum natura, <hi>as a true Righteousness, which doth
not</hi> formaliter <hi>make the person so far Righteous.</hi> Now a Righteous man can not
be an ungodly man; that were a contradiction. It is not here enough to say,
that the man is ungodly before he be Justified; for in the act of justifying, or
while he is a justifying, he is considered, not as ungodly, but as Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
yea <hi>antecedenter</hi> to his being Justified, he is considered as a Righteous
man, &amp; is therefore justified because Righteous in himself, having perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the conditions, whereby he becometh personally Righteous. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
while he is justified, God doth not justifie an ungodly man. But it will
<hi>be said,</hi> that this will as well follow upon our way. I <hi>Ans.</hi> Not at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
though we place Faith in priority of Nature, before Justification, yet
we make not faith a personal Righteousness; so that while the beleever is
justified, a man guilty in himself &amp; void of all Righteousness in himself,
is justified; so that God justifieth an ungodly man. But it will <hi>be said.</hi> By
our way, the beleever is considered as clothed with Christ's Righteousness;
&amp; upon that account, cannot be called nor accounted an ungodly man. I
<hi>Ans.</hi> He is still, notwitstanding an ungodly man in himself, having nothing,
wherewith to satisfie justice, or to procure Peace to himself; but what he
hath imputed to him, from a Cautioner: And thus God is justifier of the
ungodly, in himself; that by his faith proclaimeth himself such &amp; one that
is not in case to pay one farthing of his own debt.</p>
               <p>Other Arguments may be brought from our foregoing debate against the
Imputation of Faith, in a proper sense, and Faiths justifying as a work,
I shall now proceed to examine what is alledged for the Interest of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 1. Mr. Baxter.</hi> In his <hi>Confession</hi> pag. 37. n. 19. citeth some passages
of Scripture, whereby he thinks to prove, that Repentance is made by God,
in the Gospel, a proper Condition of our first general Pardon of sin, as well
as Faith is. The first whereof is <hi>Luk</hi> 13: 35. But this I judge is miscited,
there being nothing there, that looketh here away possibly it should be
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:104357:187"/>
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. v. 3, 5. &amp; of this place, we will have occasion to speak afterward.
The next he citeth is <hi>Act.</hi> 3: 19. <hi>Repent ye therefore, &amp; be converted, that your
sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of
the Lord. Ans.</hi> But (1) <hi>Repent</hi> here can not be meaned of the acting of that
Repentance, whereof we are here speaking, <hi>to wit,</hi> of that particular &amp;
special grace, which is distinct from Faith, &amp; that because of the exegetical
terme added, &amp; be <hi>converted.</hi> So that Repent here can denote nothing else,
but a turning from all their sinful opinions &amp; wayes, and an embraceing the
Gospel way of Salvation, that thereby they may be saved for ever. And (2)
Neither is the Apostle speaking here of constitutive justification, or of our
first general Pardon; but of a blotting out of sins a long time hereafter, <hi>to
wit,</hi> when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord,
at his second coming, as the following verses shew. So that (3) As by this
<hi>blotting out of sins,</hi> all the favours &amp; great rewards of free grace, which the
Righteous judge will give in that day, are signified, or comprehended
under it, which he mentioned especially, that it might suite the charge of
the grievous guilt of killing the Prince of life, which he was laying home
upon them; so under the other two termes, of <hi>Repenting</hi> &amp; <hi>being Converted</hi>
the whole of the duties, required in the Gospel, are to be understood. If it
<hi>be said.</hi> That <hi>Repent &amp; be Converted</hi> is as much as Repent &amp; beleeve, &amp; so
the Particular grace of Repentance is here understood. I <hi>Ans.</hi> (1) Then it
will follow, that neither are conditions of Pardon here: but both are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e;
for the blotting out of sins, here mentioned, is said to be at that time, as
the following words clear. (2) This will say only (though it were the true
meaning thereof, as it is not) that Repentance is required of those, that
would expect of Christ Pardon at his second coming, as well as faith; which
we deny not. (3) This Repentance should not be compleet Gospel Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
because it is anteriour to Conversion, or to Faith, while as the best
part of true Repentance followeth, as we cleared above.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. He citeth next <hi>Act.</hi> 2: 38- <hi>Repent &amp; be baptized every one of you, for
the remission of sins. Ans.</hi> (1) This would plead for Repentance alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Faith. (2) It would plead for as great an interest for Baptisme, as for
Repentance: Neither of which can be owned, as true. Therefore the true
meaning of the place is, Turn from your former way of seeking slavation,
by your own corrupt Imaginations &amp; Superstitions, which led you, out of
blinde zeal, to crucifie the Lord Christ; &amp; embrace the Gospel of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
now preached to you through that Lord, whom ye crucified, that
ye may receive Remission of sins, through Faith in him; &amp; be baptized,
that you may have the outward signe of your professing of having Remission
of sins through him, &amp; a seal of Remission, granted to you, through him.
And this may be cleared from the promise subjoined, <hi>&amp; ye shall receive the
gift of the holy Ghost,</hi> which is no where promised unto Repentance; but unto
the faith of the Gospel, and the receiving of Christ therein, &amp; was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or of Remission of sins; And who denieth, but people are to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,

are sanctified by Faith, that is in me.</hi> I <hi>Ans.</hi> There is no word of Repentance
here, but express mention made of Faith. It is true, <hi>turning from darkness to
light &amp;e.</hi> will include Repentance: Yet it is by Faith, that both Forgivness
of sins, &amp; the Inheritance, &amp; Sanctification is had; for <hi>by Faith that is in
me,</hi> may referre to all these three: And though this should be denied; Yet
all that could be hence inferred, would amount but to this, That Repentance
is necessarily called for in these, who receive forgivness, and the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
or would receive them. But all this is nothing to our present que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. He citeth in the Margine <hi>Luk.</hi> 24: 47. <hi>And that Repentance &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins should be preached in his name.</hi> And <hi>Luk.</hi> 15: 7. <hi>I say unto you,
that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner, that repenteth. Ans.</hi> This last
place maketh no mention of Pardon, or of Justification, &amp; only saith, that
Repentance will Include Faith, &amp; doth import the whole Conversion of a
sinner unto God, whereof Faith in Christ is the first &amp; chiefe step. As to
the other place, we told before, that by Repentance here is understood all
that duty, which is called for in the Gospel, this being a short summe of
the whole preaching of the Gospel, &amp; that therefore by Remission of sins
all the blessings &amp; favours, that sinners need &amp; are promised in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
must be understood. So that this maketh nothing against us: Yea if the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
two expressions were strickly to be taken, it would give ground to inferre,
that Repentance alone were the Condition of Remission. But what saith
all this to the purpose now in hand? do any of these expressions give the least
coloure to inferre, that Repentance strickly taken hath the same use &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in Justification, that Faith hath?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. Others possibly may urge <hi>Act.</hi> 8: 22. <hi>Repent therefore of this thy wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,
&amp; pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.
Ans.</hi> (1) If this place prove any thing that way, it will say as much for the
Interest of Prayer in Justification, equal to the Interest of Faith; as for the
Interest of Repentance. (2) Yea &amp; plead for these only with exclusion of
Faith, or at least for the Sufficiency of Repentance &amp; prayer without Faith,
which is not here expresly mentioned. (3) But <hi>Repent</hi> here is taken in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
sense, as including Faith, its ground &amp; Cause, &amp; whereof it
is the expressive evidence, &amp; sensible effect; So that the presence of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in such, as would be Pardoned, may hence be well inferred: which
is granted necessary, upon several accounts, but the present question is,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:104357:188"/>
whether it hath the same Place, Office &amp; Influence in Justification &amp; Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
that Faith hath?</p>

                  </gap>rther <hi>object Luk.</hi> 13: 3, 5- <hi>except ye repent, ye
shall all likewise perish:</hi> And this likely was the passage, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> cited
in the first place, the printer putting <hi>vers.</hi> 35. for 3. 5. through a mistake.
But I <hi>Ans.</hi> This place only proveth, what is not denied, <hi>to wit.</hi> That Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is necessarily required of such, as would be saved: And if hence it be
inferred, that therefore not only its presence, but its interest is the same
with Faiths, in Justification; the Interest of good works &amp; of all comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
duties, may be hence inferred to be the same with Faiths, in justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
because these are as necessary, in order to Salvation, as is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 7. Prov.</hi> 28: 13. <hi>He that covereth his sin, shall not prosper; but who so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
&amp; forsaketh them, shall finde mercy. Ans.</hi> (1) If forsaking of sin be here
taken strickly for Repentance, &amp; if this place be urged pertinently to the
point now in hand, Confession of sin will be made to have the same influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
&amp; will be made more necessary, than Faith it self, which is not here
expresly named. (2) <hi>Finding mercy</hi> is not strickly to be understood of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or of meer Pardon, but is to be taken more largly for Felicity here
&amp; hereafter, as being opposed to <hi>a not prospering:</hi> And so hence can only be
inferred the necessity of the presence of confessing &amp; forsaking of sin, in
such as would finde grace &amp; mercy in the eyes of the Lord, &amp; would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper

hearted, the mourners, &amp; to such as are under the Spirit of heaviness <hi>Esai.</hi>
61: 1, 2, 3. <hi>Ans.</hi> This place indeed proveth, that Christ was annointed to
preach good tidings unto the meek, to binde up the broken hearted, to
comfort all that mourne, to appoint &amp; give unto them beauty for ashes, the
oile of joy for mourning &amp; the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness;
but here, as the Repentance imported is something more than ordinary, as
the expressions intimate, so the good, that Christ is here said to be sent to
do unto them, is something more than ordinary, <hi>to wit,</hi> Comfort &amp; Joy
in an high measure, which is more than meer Pardon, or Justification; so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
pardoned &amp; justified may stand in need hereof, being indeed mourners
in ashes, &amp; under a spirit of heaviness, notwithstanding of their being in
a justified state. So that this place cometh not home to the point now in
question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 9. Is not this to favoure the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who say, that Repentance
is needless, and is a meer legal duty, neither to be urged, nor practised un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel. <hi>Ans.</hi> Though we say, that Repentance hath not the same
Place, Office &amp; Interest in &amp; about Justification &amp; Remission of sins, that
Faith hath; Yet we give no countenance unto the <hi>Antinomian</hi> errour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we affirme Repentance to be necessary, in all such as are Justified, and
the real beginnings of Gospel Repentance to be also necessary, unto such as
are to be justified, I say the <hi>beginnings,</hi> because I conceive, the principal
parts or workings of saving &amp; Gospel-Repentance follow faith, and upon
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:104357:188"/>
Faith in Christ is the union betwixt Christ &amp; the Beleever made, and the
man brought into a justified state. Seing then we presse &amp; urge the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of Repentance as a constant duty, &amp; require it in all such, as would enjoy
Peace &amp; Comfort here, &amp; be saved here after, we yeeld nothing unto
the <hi>Antinomians.</hi> And against them we urge the same Scriptures, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
now been alledged, &amp; others also, as irrefragable proofs of the necessity
of this grace, though to other ends, than to be justified thereby, in such
manner, as we are said to be Justified by Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 10. Do not our Divines ordinarily say &amp; prove, that Faith &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
are Conditions of the Covenant of Grace. I <hi>Ans.</hi> True, but their
meaning is not, that Repentance is the same way a Condition of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that faith is; but that terme, <hi>Conditions of the Covenant</hi> they take lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely,
<hi>to wit,</hi> to signifie &amp; import the duties required of such, as are within
the Covenant of Grace; &amp; not strickly, for Conditions of entering into
Covenant; These two are carefully to be distinguished: many things may
be called the Conditions of marriage, that is, duties of married persons
to other, that can not be called Conditions of making up the marriage Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
as is manifest; &amp; so is it here. Many duties are required of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
that neither are, nor can be called Conditions of Justification, or
of entering into Covenant with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 11. But do not many both in sermons &amp; in writtings, even when
speaking of Pardon &amp; of justification, joyn Repentance with faith? <hi>Ans.</hi>
It may be so; but their meaning is not, I conceive, to give an equal share
of Interest, Power &amp; Office in &amp; about justification, unto Repentance,
with that, which they acknowledge Faith to have, but either their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
is, hereby to show the inseperable connexion, that is betwixt faith &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
or to show, that they speak of that faith, which is attended
with this necessary Grace of Repentance, &amp; doth effectually work the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me;
or both rather: So that their true meaning is, to give the due privilege
&amp; interest unto that saith, which can prove it self to be real &amp; true justifying
faith, by effectuating Repentance, never to be repented of; and thus they
withall satisfie an Objection, or question, that might be made, if they
had mentioned faith alone; for it might be enquired, How shall we know,
whether our faith be of the right kind, or not? Now their joining of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
with faith, doth shortly answere this question; Repentance being
a concomitant, and a fruit of true faith, &amp; more sensiblie felt, &amp; obvious
to their perception, might be to them a vive &amp; perceptible expression of true
&amp; justifying faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 12. But seing faith by some is called, <hi>that which doth morally qualifie
the subject to be a fit patient so be justified:</hi> why may not Repentance have an
equal share in this moral Qualification, with Faith? I <hi>Ans.</hi> If we should
make faith to have no other Interest in justification, than Repentance hath,
or may be yeelded to have, we may easily grant, that Repentance hath the
same &amp; equall Interest with faith: but it is denied, that faith hath no other
Interest, but as that, which doth morally qualifie &amp;c. drieness in wood may
qualifie it for the fire, &amp; yet the wood may be long so, before it become
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:104357:189"/>
the subject of fire; &amp; so may it be with moral qualifications: many a man
may be morally qualified to be a fit match for such a woman; or a woman
for such a man; &amp; yet the marriage Relation never be made up betwixt
them: But this cannot be said of faith, whereby the marriage is made, &amp;
the person is actually justified, &amp; not a bare fit patient to be justified.</p>

&amp; may be called, the Condition of Justification; thus confounding
the whole order of the Gospel, &amp; making all duties, required of such, as
are in Covenant, &amp; ordained of God for other ends &amp; uses, to be required
as Conditions of entering in Covenant, and to have the same use and end
in &amp; unto justification, which faith hath; contrary to express Scripture,
saying, that we are justified by faith, &amp; not by works of Righteousness,
which we do, and contrary to the whole methode of the Gospel, &amp; grounds
laid down therein, for an acceptable performance of obedience.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Love, Papisit's</hi> make it the forme (as they speak) of faith, not in
it self simply considered, but in order to Justification &amp; Salvation thereby,
saying that faith without Love is dead: And it is true, that true &amp; saving
faith worketh by Love: and that faith cannot be called Saving or Justifying,
which doth not excite unto acts of Love, and many may deceive themselves
with a faith, that will not be found, when tried, to be of the right stamp:
as the Apostles <hi>Iames</hi> teacheth. But yet they put no specifick difference,
commonly, betwixt this dead faith &amp; faith informed; for both (as to what
is essential &amp; intrinsik to faith, which they hold to be an assent unto all things,
revealed by the Lord unto men, upon the account of the Veracity and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Revealer) are one &amp; the same; so as one and the same faith
may be sometime dead, when <hi>to wit,</hi> not working by Love, &amp; sometime
lively, when formed with Love. But of these things we need not here
speak: only we see, that with them, Love is in a manner more necessary
unto Justification, than faith; &amp; must be looked on, as a necessary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereunto, even as that, without which faith can do nothing. And
to confute this here is but vaine. seing it shall serve nothing to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
because with them justification is the very same, we call Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>But others, who have more sound and distinct apprehensions of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
tell us, That love is the condition of justification, because a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:104357:189"/>
of the Covenant of Grace; as if all the duties of such, as are in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
Relations, were conditions of making up the marriage Relation, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who distinguish betwixt Faith &amp; Evangelick Obedience, as betwixt
consent to a mans Soveraignity, &amp; obeying him, as Soveraigne, as doth
<hi>Mr. Baxter Confess.</hi> p. 89, 90. Yet say, that Love is comprized in Faith, and
is some degree of Justifying Faith &amp; not properly a fruite of it; because the
wills apprehension of a thing good, or earnest willing &amp; accepting it, is the
fame with Love; so is the wills Consenting, Electing &amp; accepting; &amp; all
this being in Faith, Love must be comprehended in it; Yea they say, that as Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
&amp; Faith are propounded in the Gospel, as of the same necessity, so they are
necessary in Justification, &amp; concurrent in apprehending Christ. So spoke <hi>Mr.
Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Aphorismes.</hi> And in his <hi>Confess.</hi> p. 34, 35. he saith. <hi>Though Charitie,
as it respecteth other objects, is no part of faith, yet as it respecteth an offered Saviour,
it is as much essential to faith, to receive Christ with Love, as it is essential to a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
(the object of faith) to be good for us; for good as good is received by love.
Nor was it ever the Intent of the Holy Ghost, to take faith in Christ, in so
narrow a sense, as includeth not Love to him, when it is saving Faith, that is
spoken of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In reference to all which, we need say but those few following things.</p>
               <p>1. The Scriptures do plainly enough distinguish betwixt Faith &amp; Love,
They are reckoned as distinct fruits of the Spirit <hi>Gal.</hi> 5: 22. <hi>Love, joy-faith</hi>
yea Faith is said to <hi>worke by love Gal.</hi> 5: 6. we heare of <hi>the work of faith, and
labour of love 1. Thes.</hi> 1: 3. we heare of <hi>Charitie out of a pure heart,</hi> &amp; <hi>of faith
unfaigned. 1. Tim.</hi> 1: 5. <hi>And the grace of our Lord</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Tim. 1: 14)
<hi>was exceeding abundant, with Faith &amp; Love, which is in Christ</hi> Iesus. We hear
of the brestplate of Faith &amp; Love. 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5: 8.</p>
               <p>2. The Scriptures do plainly tell us, that we are Justified by Faith, as
we heard, but never saith, that we are justified by love: And sure, as it
is best for us, to regulate our expressions, according to the Lord's Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this mysterie; so it cannot but be offensive to use such expressions, as
not only are not scriptural, but also seem inconsistent with Scriptural ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions:
when the Scripture saith expresly &amp; frequently, that we are Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by faith, and that in opposition to works, and not only saith it, but
proveth it, it cannot be justifiable in us to say, that we are Justified by Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve;
seing that would at least seem to crosse the Apostle's assertion, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
whereof is (as ours abundantly evince against the <hi>Papists</hi>) that we are
Justified only by Faith, &amp; consequently by no other grace: neither by Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,
nor by Hope, nor by Patience, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. By the Scriptures telling us, that we are Justified by Faith, &amp; never
saying, that we are Justified by any other grace, as by Love &amp;c. we are
given to understand, that Faith hath other Operations, Uses &amp; Ends, in
the office of justification, than Love, or any other grace hath: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to insinuate, that love hath the same Interest &amp; Office in &amp; about justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that Faith hath, is to deny, or overturn the proper &amp; specifick actings
of Faith, in order to justification: And, how small a matter soever this
may appear to be at first; yet, when it is further prosecuted, or the ground
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:104357:190"/>
of this searched into, or its designe &amp; tendency considered impartially, it
will befound of a deeper consequence, &amp; to tend to the alteration of the
whole specifick nature of the Covenant of Grace, as it is distinct from the
Covenant of Works: for though both Faith &amp; Love may &amp; must be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
upon, as acting upon the same object Christ; yet when Faith is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as acting no other way, than Love, and both, as potestative Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or as parts of one Potestative Condition, and no other way; it is
plaine enough, how the special actings of faith, in compliance with the
designe of God's Wisdom, Grace, and Love in the Gospel contrivance,
and thereupon in receiving &amp; resting upon Christ, as the alone propitiating
Sacrifice, and on his Surety-Righteousness, as that alone, by vertue of
which they are to expect Justification &amp; Acceptance with God, &amp; to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
the Atonement, are laid aside: And the beleeving soul is supposed not
to act on Christ, nor apply Him &amp; his Righteousness in order to the being
Acquit from the sentence of the Law, &amp; from the Curse, due for the breach
of the same, in that particular manner, that both its case &amp; condition
requireth, and the Gospel pointeth forth, and the experience of soul, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
hereby to Peace, doth confirme.</p>
               <p>4. It is true, there is Love to Christ, in the soul, that beleeveth, and it
must be so; and it is true also, that this Love is called for in the Gospel;
but hence it will not follow, that Love is the Condition of Justification, or
that every thing, that is present with, or accompanieth faith in justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hath the same Life, Ends, and Interest in Justification, or the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
thereupon, that faith hath; far less will it follow, that that which
followeth faith, and whereby faith worketh through all the after-carriage
of a Beleever, hath the same Place, Power and Interest in &amp; about justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that faith hath, as we shewed above of Repentance.</p>
               <p>5. If by this Love nothing else were meaned, but that Love of desire,
that necessarily accompanieth the souls accepting, and closeing with what
is good, or offered as good; sure, it would have given no ground of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to have called it so, &amp; would have been more acceptable, than to have
called it otherwayes, even though speaking strickly, the Love of desire
may be called Love, and is a Love, in its own kinde: and therefore, I
judge, that denomination might have been rather chosen, which would
have given no offence, than the other, which to avoide suspicion and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
calleth for so much waste of words, to render the expression less, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious,
especially, seing for all that is said, in clearing of the same, all ground
of suspicion is not removed, but that some other thing was intended, than
that meer Love of desire, that is inseparable from the will's earnest pursui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
after, or embraceing any good thing offered; especiasly when it is
said, That <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16: 27. &amp; 14: 21. make <hi>Love</hi> the <hi>antecedent Condition</hi> of <hi>God's
Love</hi> &amp; <hi>Christ's Love</hi> to the person. And that that goeth with <hi>Remission</hi> and
is a Love of Reconciliation; and Reconciliation comprehendeth Remission:
At least you will never shew out of Scripture, that the <hi>procureing God's
Love,</hi> and the <hi>Procuring Remission</hi> &amp; <hi>Reconciliation</hi> have not the same <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
for hereby it is manifest, that Love, even as distinct from faith (as
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:104357:190"/>
it is <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16: 26 <hi>-because ye have loved me &amp; have beleeved that I am come out
from God</hi>) is made as formal &amp; full a Condition of Reconciliation &amp; Pardon,
&amp; consequently of justification, as faith his; Yea &amp; that both faith &amp; Love
are made <hi>Conditions procuring</hi> God's Pardon &amp; Reconciliation. Thus spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> against <hi>Mr. Cartwright pag.</hi> 202. But lest any should think,
that either of these places cited should prove, what <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> alledgeth them
for, it would be considered. (1) That <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14: 21. He is speaking of such, as
are already beleevers &amp; justified, when he is speaking of such as have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Christ's commandemants, &amp; keep them. (2) He speaketh of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
&amp; of his own Love of such, in the future time, which cannot be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in reference to his Disciples, unless we think, they were not yet justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
contrary to the very forgoeing <hi>verse,</hi> &amp; many other passages in that
discourse, particularly <hi>Chap.</hi> 14: 1, &amp; 15: 3, 4, 5, 9. (3) This is meaned of a
Love of Manifestation; as Christ's own words added exegetically declare.
<hi>And I will Love him &amp; will manifest my self to him.</hi> (4) This same sort of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Love is also to be understood <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. as the whole scope cleareth,
this being spoken to perswade them, that they should receive the returne of
their prayers &amp; should not ask the Father in vaine; for such a Love carrieth
he towards you (as if he had said) that, in a manner, I need not intercede
for you. (5) And so the Love of the disciples here mentioned, is that Love
of complacencie, which they had in Christ, in abiding still in his Company,
and delighting in him, whom they had followed as their Master, all alongs;
and the cause from whence this flowed, is added, <hi>and have beleeved, that I
came out from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>second</hi> particular, to wit. <hi>Purpose of obedience. M. Baxter</hi> in his
<hi>Aphorismes</hi> told us, that <hi>as the accepting of Christ for Lord (which is the hearts</hi>
(Subjection) <hi>is as essential a part of justifying faith, as the accepting him for
Saviour: So consequently, sincere obedience (which is the effect of the former) hath
as much to do in justifying us before God, as (some) Affiance, which is the fruit
of the latter.</hi> Hereby he would seem to give the same Interest unto actual
Obedience, in Justification, that he giveth unto Affiance, which cannot
be wanting unto Justifying Faith, yea himself confesseth to be an essential act
of Faith, in the margine of these words, Printed with <hi>Mr. Cartwrights ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations</hi>
and his Reply <hi>pag.</hi> 204. But in his <hi>Confess.</hi> (as we heard above)
p. 89, 90. he putteth as great a difference betwixt faith, &amp; Evangelick Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
as betwixt the Consent to Marriage Relation, and the conjugal Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
&amp; Obedience of a wife to her husband: So that hereby it is manifest,
that with him, all Obedience cannot comprized in faith, &amp; so cannot be a
Condition with Faith of Justification: and this he saith <hi>pag.</hi> 90. expresly.
<hi>So that I do no more (as I am accused) comprize all Obedience in Faith, because I
comprize a Love to the Redeemer, &amp; a Consent to be governed by him, then I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
all Coujugal Obedience &amp; Fidelity of a woman to her husband, in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>venant or Consent, because I comprize in it Love to the Man &amp; a Covenant
of fidelity &amp; obedience to the future.</hi> His meaning is not then, that actual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is either a part of faith, or hath the same interest of a Condition in
Justification, that faith hath. Therefore he tels us more plainly &amp; positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:104357:191"/>
his meaning, as to this, <hi>Confess. pag.</hi> 38: 39. n. 22. <hi>This Covenant</hi> (saith
he, meaning the Covenant, that a Beleever entereth with Christ, as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and in him, with the offended majestie (<hi>containeth an engagement to
future obedience: So that though our first faith be not the same thing with Obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to Christ - yet in taking Christ for King, it essentially containeth a Resolution &amp;
Covenant to obey him.</hi> Hereby we see, that a Resolution, Promise, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to obey Christ, for the future, is essentially included in faith, as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying,
&amp; consequently that this must be as kindly a part of the Condition
of Justification, as any thing in Faith. And <hi>next,</hi> that the ground of this
is, because justifying faith, as justifying, doth as kindly &amp; really take
Christ for a King, as for a Priest. This is further explained by what he saith
immediatly before n. 21. <hi>The very nature of this saving Faith, is to be a Heart-Covenanting
of a Sinner with Christ, as a Saviour - Even as is a Covenant of a
woman to her husband, a Souldier to his Commander; a Subject to his Prince, a
Scholler to his Master; it is our becoming his Disciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which we see these things laid down, as truthes to be received.</p>
               <p>1. That the souls Covenanting with Christ, or accepting of him, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in the Gospel, is like the Covenanting of a woman with her Husband,
of a Souldier with his Commander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Subject to his Prince &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. That as the Woman, Souldier or Subject, Resolve, Covenant &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to performe obedience unto the Husband, Commander, or King, so
the Sinner, in Covenanting with Christ, doth Resolve, Covenant and
Promise to performe Obedience unto Him.</p>
               <p>3. That therefore, this Resolution, Covenanting &amp; Promising to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
obedience, being essential to Justifying Faith, is a formal Condition of
Justification, &amp; the meaning of faiths being the Condition of Iustification
must be this, the Man's Resolution, Covenanting &amp; Promising to performe
Obedience, is the Condition of Iustification; or at least this part of faith,
as well as others, is the Condition.</p>
               <p>4. And the ground of this is, because Justifying faith, even as Iustifying,
or in order to Iustification, acteth as directly &amp; expresly on Christ as a King,
as on Christ, as a Priest.</p>
               <p>In Answere to which, I shall but briefly say these things.</p>
               <p>1. The similitudes adduced halt in one thing, &amp; that one thing, is all,
as to our present business. A woman Covenanting with her husband, and
thereby promising obedience, or a Souldier with his Commander, or a
Subject with his Prince, presuppose &amp; acknowledge, Power &amp; Strength in
themselves to performe the obedience promised, &amp; upon the Supposition &amp;
Conviction of this power &amp; ability in themselves to performe what shall be
commanded, they willingly &amp; of their own accord, promise to put forth
that Power, Strength &amp; Ability of theirs, unto the performance of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
that shall be required. But it is not so, in our case, The Sinner,
who is now supposed to be about Covenanting with Christ, through the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Conviction, &amp; Humiliation, is put far from all his natural Pelagian
conceits &amp; apprehensions of himself, &amp; of his own abilities; He is now
made to see, that as he hath nothing at present, wherewith to Satisfie God,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:104357:191"/>
for the sins that are charged upon him; nor to allure Christ, to do for him;
unless it be wretchedness &amp; miserie, that may move Christ to compassionate
his case; so he can do nothing for the future, that can be accepted of God, till
he be renewed; He is made to see, that there is a Natural Impotency (I
mean not a physical impotency, as if he wanted a soul, or Faculties) in
him to any thing that is good, &amp; a pravitie of Will, whereby it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that he can do any thing, conforme to the will of God, untill he be
Regenerated, made willing by an omnipotent Power, &amp; have a new acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
Principle of life and grace, given unto him, or infused in him, by the
Spirit of Jesus.</p>
               <p>2. Whereupon, it is manifest, That a sinner in that plight (&amp; in that
Condition we must consider him to be, who is now seeking to be Justified,
and to be delivered from the wrath of God for sin) in fleeing to Christ for
refnge, cannot be thought to be making any such Promises, or having any
such Resolutions, in order to his Justification, and &amp; Freedom from the Curse
of the Law; He, that is throughly convinced of his total Impotencie, will not
think (while he is under the power of these Convictions) of making any
Engagements for obedience in time to come: Yea, where any such things
really were, it might be feared, that the work of Conviction was not keep
enough; and that such, so acting, would not receive Christ freely, as he
is offered in the Gospel; but rather came with a price in their hand, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of faire promises for the future, of doing that, which was not in their
power. But it will possibly be said. That though there be no express and
explicite Engaging &amp; Promiseing here; yet there cannot but be a virtual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageing;
as in the making of Marriage, though the woman do not explicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
promise obedience, yet her engagement is included in her acceptance of
the person. I <hi>Answere.</hi> Let us suppose, that the woman is every way as una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to obey her husband, as the sinner, not yet converted, is to obey the
commands of God; &amp; that from her husband alone she must receive that,
whereby she shall become able: &amp; then see, if her consenting to the match
do formally include, even virtually, her engagement to future obedience.
I do not suppose, by all this, that the Beleever is under no Obligation, or
Engagment to Obedience; for as he hath received a principle of obedience,
even the new heart, the willing minde, and the renewed faculties; so he
is under many Obligations, Promises, Vowes &amp; Engagements explicite
&amp; virtually, to carry as devouted unto God, in all obedience: but we are
speaking here of a person, not yet out of the state of nature, but being
under the terrours of the Lord, and Convictions of guilt &amp; misery, is
seeking after a Reliete, unto his present case, <hi>to wit,</hi> how he may be
freed from the Curse of the Law, and put in a Justified state, &amp; in Favoure
with God.</p>
               <p>3. Hence, it is much to be doubted (however it be put beyond all doubt,
or disput, with <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>) whether Faith, Saving &amp; Justifying, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
essentially any such formal Engagement &amp; Resolution unto Obedience;
seing the person, of whom we are speaking, fleeth to Christ, for reliefe, as
one, that is throughly convinced of his own Impotency, Inability to do
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:104357:192"/>
any thing less or more for his own help, or for pleasing of God. This Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
unto new obedience is rather included in Repentance (which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from Faith, as we saw above) &amp; so it is mentioned, in the descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of Repentance, given in our shorter <hi>Catechisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. But it will be said, How then is Christ received by faith, as a King?
I <hi>Ans.</hi> Not to debate that here, which is to be spoke to afterward, (<hi>to wit,</hi>
whether justifying faith, while it is acting, in order to Justification, doth
receive Christ, as a King? or rather, (for this is more properly the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion)
whether a person, under the Conviction of sin &amp; wrath, &amp; seeking
for Pardon &amp; Acceptance in &amp; through Christ, doth six the eye of his
soul upon Christ as King, or as Priest? Or whether there is that in Christ,
considered as a King, or considered as a Priest, that is more sutable unto the
present case of the convinced sinner? Or whether, or not, the Person, in the
Condition mentioned, seeketh reliefe rather from Christ, as a Priest, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up himself, as a Sacrifice giving his bloud for a Ransome, to Satisfie
the justice of God for sins; or as a King, endued with Authority to subdue
sin? And if the question thus were proposed unto the experienced Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
or unto the persons, in such a Condition, it would, I suppose, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a very quick answere.) Unto the question now proposed I say, That,
though it were granted, that Faith, in order to the mans Justification, did
act as well on Christ as a King, as on Christ, as a Priest (which yet cannot
be granted; as is already hinted, and shall be cleared afterward) yet it
would not follow, that this Faith did essentially include a Resolution and
Engagment to future obedience: for it is not here, as in Subjects receiving
a person for their King, as was said already, whose Persons or Subjects,
have power &amp; ability, &amp; their will (as to these things) in their own hand,
&amp; may therefore promise obedience, according as the Relation made up,
formally engageth unto; &amp; yet <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> ag. <hi>Ludiomaeus Colvin.</hi> §. 15. saith
<hi>That this is but to consent to the Relation, or to his Soveraignity, that they may
obey him, and Love, honour &amp; obedience come after.</hi> But if we should suppose
a company of men, lying bound in chaines, in dunge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns, under the feet of
cruel Tyrants &amp; Enemies. &amp; in that case receiving one for their King; would
their receiving of him for their King firstly &amp; primarily import a formal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
on their part, to obey him? I suppose, it would import some
other thing, anteriour to that, <hi>to wit,</hi> their ready consent, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t he, by
all the power &amp; might he can make, shall loose their bands, and set them
at liberty, &amp; put them in the case &amp; condition of free Subjects. Now the
case is so here with us, with advantage; for not only, are we in
bands, and lying in prison, and so unable to performe any Obedience; but
naturally, till a change be made, we are utterly unwilling &amp; averse from
performing any acts of Obedience, though it were in our power, so that
before we be in case to yeeld obedience, the whole man must be renewed,
Judgment, Will &amp; Affections; when therefore, we, in such a case, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Christ, as our King, it is firstly &amp; chiefly, that he may make us wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the day of his power; that he may make us his Subjects, willing &amp;
obedient, &amp; ready to do his will; that he may loose our bands, deliver us
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:104357:192"/>
from the bondage &amp; slavery of sin, bring us out of captivity, &amp; from under
the power of Satan, &amp; worke in us both to will &amp; to do, according to his
good pleasure. These are Acts of Christ's kingly power, these are Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
that answere the present necessity of wakened souls: these therefore
must be the good things, their souls must seek after, &amp; for these things must
they goe to him, as King, &amp; in reference to these must they lay hold on
Him: So that this is mainly implyed in their receiving of Christ, as King.
In like manner, when they receive him, as a Prophet they do not come
unto him, as other Scholers do to their Masters, bringing a Capacitie, a
Faculty &amp; an Ingine with them for learning, without which all the Masters
paines in giving Instructions, &amp; theirs in studying hard, will be in vaine: but
they come unto him, in the through conviction of their Blindness, Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
to learne, want of Understanding to perceive the things of God, and
to take up the mysteries of the Kingdom: that he may teach them, as never
man taught; by giving them an hearing eare, and an understanding Heart,
by opening their eyes, to see the mysteries of God &amp; of Christ; that he
may so teach, as to write his lawes in their heart; cause their hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
to wisdome, &amp; cause them, to know the way, wherein they should walk.
It is true, the receiving of Christ as King includeth also their obligation to
owne him, as such, by receiving his Lawes, subjecting unto his Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
&amp;c. And the receiving of him as Prophet, includeth their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to acknowledge him for their only Teacher, and to depend on him for
their Instruction: But yet I say, as this speaketh out no formal promise or
engagment to actual Obedience &amp; actual learning, but rather an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp; Resolution to be willing that he may act the part of a Prophet &amp; of a
King towards them, and so cause them carry &amp; look like Scholers &amp; Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
so the thing that is firstly &amp; mainely in their eye, in their coming to
Christ, is that which suiteth their present case, and answereth their present
felt necessity, &amp; is an help to their present pinch. What Engagements may
be laid upon them by these Relations; or what Resolutions they may have,
after they are renewed in the Spirit of their mindes, and united unto Christ,
unto actual obedience, in the power and strength of the Lord, is not to the
present purpose, while we are speaking of what the Soul doth, in order to
Justification.</p>
               <p>5. Hence we see, how groundless it is, to say, that a Resolution to actual
obedience is a Condition of justification: This we finde no where required
in order to Justification: This is no where called a Condition of Justification.
We are no where said to be Justified by this Resolution. This is inconsistent
with the frame of a poor wakened soul, seeking Justification. This would in
part make the gift of Justification not free &amp; of free grace, but to be of works
or of a Resolution for works; and so would give ground (in part at least)
of boasting &amp; of glorying, contrare to the whole frame of the Gospel. And
so this would lessen the difference betwixt the Old Covenant of works, and
the New Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>Having thus dispatched the <hi>second</hi> particular, we come unto the <hi>Third;</hi> to
wit, to enquire, whether perseverance be a Condition of Justification?
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:104357:193"/>
And of this we need not speak much, seing by what is already said, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
how false this is. Every thing, that is required of such, as are Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
cannot be called a Condition of Justification. It is said, that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
suspendeth the obligation, to bestow the benefite promised upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
untill it be performed: And so it will hence follow, that, if Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
to the end be the Condition of Justification, no man can be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
untill he have persevered to the end; &amp; so no man shall be justified in
this life; whereby an end is put to all our present debate, the subject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
being taken out of the way.</p>
               <p>If it <hi>be said.</hi> That faith is the Condition of Justification, as it endureth
to the end. I <hi>Ans.</hi> That that faith, which will endure to the end, is the
Condition, I grant. But I deny, That Faith is the Condition of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as it endureth to the end, we no where read of Faiths being the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
under this reduplication, as enduring to the end; for then it would
follow, that no lively faith, how strong so ever, could unite a soul to
Christ, untill it had endured to the end, and so man upon his first Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

have passed from death to life; contrare to all the Scriptures. And this
would too much assimilate the New Covenant unto the Old, wherein <hi>Adam</hi>
was to work out his dayes work to the end, ere he had Right to his wages.
Yea &amp; hence it would follow, that in this life, there were none of the fruites
of justification to be had, such as Peace with God, Accesse to God, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
in tribulations, Joy &amp; Comfort, contrare to experience, &amp; the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.

               <p>So that in a word, from what hath bein said, it is evident, how little ground
M. Br. hath to glory in this way of his, and though to an inadvertent person it
may appeare Plausible, what is adduced for a reason, yet when considered, it will
be found fioath and a florish of words: for be it so, that justifieing faith recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
whole Christ (which we doe not deny: for Christ is not divided: for as the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is but one faith, so but one Christ. And I will have occasion to speake mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
fully to this matter afterward.) Yet what doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> gain? hath he
gained his Pepper-corne of Faith or Gospel-obedience to be imputed unto
us for Righteousness according to the new law (he should say, the new edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Old Covenant, or rather the Old Covenant newly established?)
no, by no means: for be it grainted, That Iustifieing Faith as such respected
Christ equally as King and Prophet, as it doth him as Priest (which yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and shall, without divideing Christ, make it appeare) I aske him, how
doth it receive Christ Jesus the Lord? Surely he cannot but say, as he is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Gospel; well then, the Lord, who knoweth what we are, offereth
him to us, and makes him to us wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and
redemption, so that God in the offer of his Christ as a King, lookes upon the
sinner in the same capacitie to obey him, as in the offer of him as a Priest
he is to pay his debt, and that is not onely in no capacitie but as opposit
to such a thing of himself. Hence it as evident that Faith receives Christ
as a King not by promiseing or purposeing to obey him, but from a Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:104357:193"/>
of its own aversion to purpose to please God, that he by his Kingly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
shall kill the enmity, Conquer the soul, bring it to purpose, as well as
practise, work in it to will as well as to doe, cast down imaginations, that exalt
themselves against the knowledge of God, and bring every thought in captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to his obedience, so when Faith acts on him as a Prophet, there is in this
act neither purpose nor promise, to obey him as a teacher &amp;c. But from a
Conviction that the mind is not onely void of light, but it is prepossessed with
corrupt principles, so that the man that hath nothing but the soul of a man,
takes up the whole Gospel Mysterie as foolishness. And it is impossible for
him, to know these things, since they must be spiritually discerned. I say from
this Conviction he receives Christ as his wisdom, as he that shall give him an
understanding, to know him that is true; and to make him who is not onely
as a beast, but so much worse, that his light is darkenesse, of a quick understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the feare of the Lord, and wise to salvation. Now this exactly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the sinners need, and hath all his wants made up by Jesus Christ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his riches in glory, and God's end in makeing his Christ to poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
wisdom, Righteousness &amp;c. That so he, who glorieth may glory in the
Lord. Now if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will Consider this, he will even lay aside his Pepper-Corne
as of no Price; for here all is without money and without Price to the
poor soul &amp;c. and he is considered as a receiver of all from Christ.</p>

               <p>THough, as we heard, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself will not say, that Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-obedience
is the Condition of Justification; yet he recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a book to us to peruse, to the end we may receive much light in
the knowledge of the Gospel, I meane the <hi>discourse of the two Covenants</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
mentioned, wherein this is asserted with great confidence: And
though this be sufficiently confuted by what is said; yet we shall in short take
some notice of the grounds of this Mans Confidence, &amp; give some remarks
upon what he saith.</p>
               <p>He tels us <hi>pag. 132. That the sense, in which the Apostles did assert it,</hi> (i.e.
Justification by Faith without the works of the Law) <hi>was, that faith Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
without works, antecedent to beleeving</hi> (This is what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> &amp; other
Papist's say) <hi>&amp; without works, as the works of a literal observation of Moses law,
which was opposed by the jewes to faith.</hi> This is but his fiction, and its grounds
may come to be considered afterward. But what is this Faith? It is a <hi>Faith</hi>
(saith he) <hi>that hath Repentance, Regeneration &amp; sincere Obedience in a holy life
for its inseparable effects.</hi> Then (1) this Faith is not fruite of Regeneration,
because Regeneration is an effect of it. (2) Then upon a mans sincere Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
he cannot be said to have passed from death to life, &amp; be freed from
Condemnation, nay not untill all the effects of faith be produced. And this
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:104357:194"/>
he expresseth more clearly within a line or two, calling <hi>Regeneration &amp; new
obedience parts of the Condition;</hi> thus making men able to Regenerat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
with some help of the Spirit, according to his former doctrine.</p>
               <p>Passing his inveighing <hi>pag.</hi> 134. &amp; forward, against the orthodox do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
concerning Justification by faith alone; and loading it with Socinian
reproaches, wherein he bewrayeth more acquaintance with <hi>Popish, Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
&amp; <hi>Arminian</hi> Principles &amp; Consequences, than with the Gosp. I doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
either in Theorie or pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce, I proceed to examine his grounds, which
he laieth down <hi>Chap. 7. pag.</hi> 140, 141. and prosecuteth to the end of that
<hi>Chapter.</hi> His grounds are Ten in number.</p>
               <p>The first is. <hi>That works of Evangelical obedience are never in Scripture opposed
to God's grace in reference to Iustification &amp; Salvation. Ans.</hi> (1) Here we have
the fundamental errour of his whole discourse hinted to us; when he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
Justification &amp; Salvation together, making all that is antecedently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
unto Salvation, to be also antecedently required unto Justification;
or he must acknowledge no justification, untill Salvation come; (2) A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
contradiction to this ground of his we have <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 8, 9, 10. <hi>for by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
are ye saved, through faith, not of works, lest any man should boast: for we
are his workmanshipe, created in Christ Iesus unto good works, which God hath
before ordained, that we should walk in them.</hi> Here grace is opposed to works,
to good works, unto which we are created in Christ Jesus, &amp; in which we
are to walk, and that in reference to the Salvation, that is in justification.
The man was so wise for his own unhallowed ends, as never once to take
notice of this place. He cannot but grant, that Works &amp; Grace are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to other: but he giveth us a very sceptick evasion, telling us, that then
<hi>by works we are to understand either works antecedent to conversion, or as they are
denyed</hi> (I think he would have said <hi>deemed,</hi> or some such thing) <hi>to merite, at
the hands of God; or the works of the Law of Moses, as erroneously contended for
by the jewes; or the works of the Law as Typical &amp; as opposed to things typified; or
the works of the Law, as the Law is in its rigour opposed to the milder oeconomie of
the Gospel.</hi> And yet all this will not helpe the matter, for <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, that
even <hi>Abraham</hi> was not justified by his works, but by faith, in opposition to
works <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 1, 2, 3. And <hi>Abraham's</hi> works here excluded from Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
can be reduced to none of these heads of works here mentioned; They
were not works antecedent to Conversion; for in opposition to these it is said,
his Faith was reckoned unto him for Righteousness, long after his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Nor did the holy father dreame of any merite in his works, nor we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
these the works of the Law in any of the senses mentioned; for Faith was
reckoned to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteousness, even when he was in uncircumcision.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 9, 10, 11. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He taketh notice of <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 5. <hi>not by works of Righteousness, which we have
done, but according to his mercy, he s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ved us:</hi> but giveth us p. 143. this glosse.
<hi>This change of their condition was not effected, or so much as begun among them
by any reformation of their own, till the Gospel came to work it (which is meant by
the appearing of the kindness &amp; Love of God vers. 4. &amp; is of like import with.</hi> Ch.
2: 11, 12. <hi>Ans.</hi> By what either Law or Reason he restraineth that <hi>appearing
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:104357:194"/>
of the kindness, &amp; Love of God,</hi> mentioned <hi>vers.</hi> 4. to the Gospel, I know
not. (2) And though the Gospel were here understood, that would not help
the matter; for the Text saith, that after this did appear, he saved them
(that is Justified in the first place, as we see <hi>vers.</hi> 7.) according to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp; not by work of Righteousness. (3) These works are called works of
Righteousness; But no works of their own, before Conversion, can be so
called: can the works of such as are foolish, disobedient, deceived, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
diverse lasts &amp; pleasures, living in malice &amp; envie, hateful &amp; hating
one another, be called works of Righteousness? and yet such were these,
before the kindness &amp; Love of God reached them, as <hi>vers.</hi> 3. showeth. He
thinks the same answere may be given to 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1: 9. And so we think, the
same reply may suffice.</p>
               <p>His 2. ground is p. 114. <hi>That Paul, in speaking agaist Iustification by
works, giveth sufficient caution not to be understood thereby to speak against Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick
obedience in the case.</hi> That is, not to speak against justification by Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick
works; which were to say, he took much paines for nothing; for if
he had but said, that the Ceremonial Law was abrogate, he had sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confuted justification by the Ceremonies, if that had been all the Law he
meaned. But how proveth this man, what he here alledgeth? He addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 31. But I wonder how did the Apostle by his doctrine establish
the Ceremonial Law? <hi>In the Spirit of it</hi> (saith he) <hi>in as much as in preaching
Iustification in the Gospel way, he preached in plaine precepts, the necessity of
that spiritual purity unto Salvation, which was but darkly taught by the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Law. Ans.</hi> (1) Then this man supposeth, that he is establishing the
Ceremonial Law, by his doctrine in this book; for he thinks, that therein
he is preaching up Justification in the Gospel way. (2) Neither did the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law more darkly, nor doth the Gospel in more plaine termes preach
the necessity of spiritual purity, as the Condition of Justification: So that
this Author beggeth what he cannot prove. (3) But that this is the Moral
Law, hath been frequently shown above; as also it hath been shown, how
&amp; what way it was established, by the doctrine of just<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fication without
works; so that we need not regaird his saying; <hi>that by the doctrine of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by faith, they established the moral Law, both in the letter &amp; Spirit of it, in
teaching the necessity of Evangelical obedience to it, after a more spiritual &amp; forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manner, than had been taught before.</hi> For this saith nothing for their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for obedience to this Law, as a Condition of Justification; which is
the thing, he should have said: And if he know not, how Justification
without the works of the moral Law, can consist with necessity of Obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to the Moral Law, upon Gospel grounds, he is ignorant of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and hath been more educate in <hi>Socinus</hi> his School, than in the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Church.</p>
               <p>He citeth to the same purpose <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 4. &amp; tels us, that <hi>Christ was the
end of the Law in his doctrine, having taught that Righteousness of living, which
the Law itself taught, but in a more excellent spiritual &amp; effectual manner.</hi>
Which is a very <hi>Socinian</hi> like gloss, but no way suiting the words, nor the
scope of the Apostle, as the very reading of them may evince, &amp; the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:104357:195"/>
words vers. 7, 8, 9, 10. may put beyond all question, His citeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<hi>pag. 146. Rom.</hi> 7: 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 19, 20. is to no purpose; for in neither of
these, nor any where else, doth he cry up holiness, performed in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
whatsomever, as a Condition of Justification; and this our Author
should show, or he doth nothing: for we are not against the necessity of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
but see more Sure, more Comfortable, more Heart quieting, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
Divine, and more Gospel-like grounds, whereupon to presse holiness,
than any he discovereth in all his book, or can, according to his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>His 3. ground is p. 147. <hi>That Regeneration or the new creature, as including
Evangelical Obedience, is opposed to works of the Law, in the business of mans
Iustification, as well as Faith is, &amp; as well as the grace of God it self is.</hi> And
this he thinketh to prove from <hi>Gal.</hi> 6: 15. as <hi>Schlightingius the Socinian</hi> did
before him <hi>cont. Meysner</hi> p. 148. But one thing is to be proved, <hi>to wit,</hi> that
the Apostle is speaking this, in order to justification, and so contradicting
all the former disput he had; which neither Reason, nor Religion will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
us to think, nor do the words, nor any Circumstance of the words, nor
any thing of the scope, or of the threed of the Apostles discourse give the
least countenance hereunto.</p>
               <p>His 4. ground p. 148. is also from <hi>Schlichtingius ubi supra. That Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
obedience as well as faith, &amp; together with faith, is opposed to the works of the
Law, in reference to Iustification &amp; Salvation. Gal.</hi> 5: 6. <hi>Ans.</hi> He supposeth
here, that Circumcision is the same with the works of the Law, while as
these that were crying it up at that time, took it only for a privilege, which
might be keeped together with Christianity; and therefore the Apostle told
them <hi>vers.</hi> 3. which they did not take notice of, that by their taking on that
badge of circumcision, they made themselves debtors to do the whole Law
(2) All that is required in reference to Salvation, is not required in referen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to Justification. (3) Faith working by Love denoteth the right &amp; the livly
Faith, which only is Justifying &amp; Saving, but bringeth not in all Evangelick
Obedience under Love, as sharing with faith, in the same prerogative of
justification, as was shewed above.</p>
               <p>His 5. ground p. 149. is. <hi>That Evangelical Obedience alone is opposed to the
works of the Law, in reference to Iustification.</hi> And this he confirmeth by 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
7: 19. borrowing it from <hi>Schlightingius,</hi> the <hi>Socinian,</hi> where only two things
are wanting, to make this passage a confirmation of his Assertion, one is,
that by Circumsion here is meaned the keeping of the Law: and what shall
then be understood by Uncircumcision? The other is, that the Apostle is
speaking this in reference to Justification, contrary to the whole context.</p>
               <p>His 6. ground <hi>ibid.</hi> is. <hi>That faith itself is an act of Evangelical obedience.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which we need say nothing here, having said so much above, to shew, that
Faith in the matter of justification is not considered as an act of Gospel-obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
but as an Instrument, laying hold on the Righteousness of Christ,
the Cautioner.</p>
               <p>His 7. ground is p. 152. <hi>That by Gospel-obedience Christians come to have a
Right to Salvation</hi> Revel 22: 14. This <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>liberty</hi> (as it is translated 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:104357:195"/>
8: 9.) Power or privilege, as it would seem to import 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9: 18. &amp; else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
is no proper Right; for all that can be called proper Right, the
Saints have it through the purchase of Jesus Christ; his blood &amp; his blood
alone, hath bought the inheritance to us: And hereby we see the true ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of this Man's doctrine, even to give us heaven as that, which we have
bought with our labour &amp; obedience; that is, to give us heaven by a new
Covenant of Works, which Christ hath procured to be made with us. But
this Right, is but a liberty to take possession of the crown of life purchased
by Christ, &amp; promised, at the end of the journay, in the way, wherein
the Lord hath appointed us to walk towards the possession thereof: And can
only prove, what we deny not, <hi>to wit,</hi> the necessity of Holiness, in order
to the actual injoyment of life: But what saith this unto justification? He
will not have us put any difference betwixt them, alledging that, such as do,
are more curious &amp; nice in distinguishing, than <hi>Paul</hi> was. And why so?
<hi>Paul cals Iustification,</hi> the justification of life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 18. Therefore Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
&amp; Glorification is one &amp; the same, &amp; have every way the same
conditions: <hi>Ans.</hi> It followeth not. He citeth next <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 30. which clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maketh them distinct. What more? <hi>He</hi> (i.e. <hi>Paul) proves that men shall
be justified by faith, because it is written, the</hi> just shall live by faith <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 11.
<hi>&amp; with him to be justified &amp; blessed are all one</hi> Gal. 3: 8, 9. Rom. 4: 7, 8, 9.
<hi>Ans.</hi> What that from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 11. can be made to prove by him, I know not.
And as for the next, it will prove as much, that is, just nothing. He might

&amp; Suffering of persecution, were all the same with glory, because of
what is said. Mat. 5: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Yet he proceedeth at this
rate, &amp; tels us p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as Synonimous termes Gal.</hi> 3: 21. <hi>Ans.</hi> As if Justification were not a state of

them both one thing: But though there be a life begun in Justification, that
shall at length end in Glory, we see no ground to say, for all that he hath
brought forth, that they are so the same, as to require the same previous
Conditions: How profitable so ever <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> account this Treatise to be,
yet I cannot think, that he shall approve of this, which yet is the maine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
of the book.</p>
               <p>His 8. ground p. 156. <hi>That the promise of forgiveness of sins is sometimes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
unto Evangelical obedience.</hi> This he goeth about to prove from 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 7.
Where the Apostle is shewing the Advantages that such have, as have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship

with God through faith in Jesus Christ, evidenced by their walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the light (as is clear from <hi>vers.</hi> 6. and this in particular, that as they
will be dayly failing, so they will have ready accesse to the blood of Christ;
to get all their sins cleansed away. Neither is the Apostle here speaking of the
first Pardon granted, when persons are translated into a state of justification,
but he is speaking of such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as are already in that State. He cite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the blood of Christ, without obedience.</hi> Making that a condition of
being sprinkled with the blood of Christ, which the Apostle mentioneth,
as a distinct <hi>medium,</hi> to which they were elected, in reference to eternal life,

                  </gap>e of obedience without being sprinkled with the blood
of Christ: and that too agreeth more with truth.</p>
               <p>His 9. ground p. 157. is. <hi>That to forgive injuries is an act of Evangelical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to that precept</hi> Mat. 11: 25. <hi>And yet without this, men cannot be pardoned
&amp; so not justified</hi> Mark, 11: 25. Mat. 6: 15. &amp; 18: 35. <hi>Ans.</hi> Though men
cannot be pardoned without this, it will not follow, that therefore it is a
part of the condition of Justification: but only proveth, that this must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
as an evidence of their acting Faith on Jesus Christ, in truth &amp; reality,
in order to pardon: And these passages are explications of the fift petition of
the Lord's prayer, the sense whereof is well given in our larger Catechisme
§. 194. in these words, <hi>which we are the rather emboldened to ask. &amp; encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to expect, when we have this testimony in ourselves, that we from the heart
forgive others their offences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His 10. &amp; last ground is. <hi>That Repentance is an act of Evangelical Obedience</hi>
Act. 17: 30. <hi>&amp; yet pardon of sin, which is essential to justification, is not to be
obtained without it.</hi> Luk 13: 3, 5. <hi>Ans.</hi> Of Repentance we have said enough
above <hi>Chap.</hi> XXV. I wonder how he can to this end cite <hi>Luk</hi> 13: 3, 5. where
no mention is made of Remission of sins; but perishing threatned to all, that
will not repent.</p>
               <p>I shall not here meddle with his mis representation of our doctrine, in
the following <hi>pages,</hi> nor with the grounds &amp; reasons of the preference he
giveth, unto his way, seing, by all that he speaks, he bewrayeth utter
ignorance of the Gospel truth, which we owne, &amp; of its true Tendency to
promove Gospel holiness, beyond any other way, what somever, hatched
by <hi>Papist's</hi> &amp; <hi>Socinians,</hi> that may be little or nothing beholden to Iesus
Christ, for Grace here, or for Glory hereafter. And his Insinuations, as
if we did not presse Repentance &amp; Holiness, is little to his credite, or to
the credite of the cause he maintaineth, seing the contrarie is so well known,
to say no more.</p>
               <p>Nor shall insist on the grounds he layeth down, to overturne the whole
argueings of the Apostle in this matter, seing they are, upon the matter,
the same, that others have laid down, and have been before spoken to: for
from a tedious discourse concerning the mistaking apprehensions of the je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
about the Law &amp; the works thereof, in order to justification, to very
little purpose, he inferreth p. 117. that <hi>doubtless Paul's denial of Iustification
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:104357:196"/>
&amp; Salvation to be by the Law, is to be understood in the very same sense, in which
the incredulous jewes, against whom he disputed, did hold these so be attainable
thereby:</hi> Forgetting with all, that what <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, was dictated by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
&amp; so that for the use of the Church unto the end of the world. But su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
if no other works were here understood, than this Author will have he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
understood, it could be of little use to the Gospel churches, after the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the question, the Ceremonial Law, it self is taken away: And had
it not been a shorter &amp; most effectual way to have confuted the jewes errour
here, simply to have proven (as he doth elsewhere) the abolishing of that
Law? Beside, we finde many things spoken of this Law, against Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by obedience to which the Apostle disputeth, that cannot agree to the
Ceremonial Law, as hath been several times touched. But let us hear what
the true question was. <hi>We must understand him</hi> (saith he) <hi>to deny a freedom
from the eternal punishment to be attainable by legal Sacrifices: &amp; also to deny that
the promise of eternal life was made upon Condition of literal Circumcision, &amp; a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
observation of the Mosaical Law. Ans.</hi> If this had been all to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
I pray, did the Apostle laboure so much to prove, that not only the
jewes, but that the Gentiles also were under sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. The Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
were not, nor yet were to be under the Law of Ceremonies. (2) How
could the Apostle inferre, that by the deeds of the Law, there should no
flesh be justified, from his proving, that both jewes &amp; Gentiles were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the breach of the Moral Law, whereby every mouth was stopped, &amp;
all the world become guilty before God <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 10-20? (3) did only the
Law of Ceremonies give the knowledge of sin? Himself proveth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<hi>pag.</hi> 57. (4) did the curse only belong unto the Ceremonial Law?
or did Christ only become a Curse, in reference to the breaches of that?
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 10.</p>
               <p>He will not so much as yeeld p. 119. that <hi>Paul</hi> doth, on the bye, deny Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by other works: And that meerly because it would destroy his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of a <hi>Iudaical Socinian</hi> justification: though he pretend, that thereby
the Apostles doctrine would be made inconsistent, not only with the Faith of
the holy men of old, but also with his own doctrine: But neither did the
holy men of old express the Condition of Justification (which he confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
with the Condition of the Covenant of mercy) by loving God &amp; kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
his commandements; nor doth <hi>Paul</hi> speak any such thing, as we have
seen, what ever he with <hi>Socinians &amp; Arminians</hi> say.</p>
               <p>He giveth us another character (which also we heard from others before)
of the works, by which <hi>Paul</hi> denied men were justified, calling them such <hi>works,
which were apt to occasion boasting Ephes.</hi> 2: 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 2. But thus he quite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verreth
both the sense of the words, scope &amp; argueing of the Apostle; for the
Apostle cleareth that it is by grace we are saved: &amp; not by works, upon this
very account, that if we were saved or justified upon the account of any of our
works, man should boast <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 9. <hi>Not of works;</hi> why? <hi>lest any man should
boast,</hi> manifestly declaring that all works were laid aside, in this matter,
&amp; that for this end, that no man should have any occasion of boasting: &amp;
this is not spoken, as every one may see, to qualifie, or specifie the works
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:104357:197"/>
that are excluded; these words carry nothing of a restriction in them: The
same is cleare also <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 2. <hi>If Abraham were justified by works, he hath whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof
to glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> shalll the meaning be, <hi>Abraham was not justified by such works,
as give ground of gloriation?</hi> then the meaning lyeth not in the words, but
the words do expresly crosse &amp; contradict that sense, unless we shall suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
them to have no sense: to speak nothing of the following <hi>vers.</hi> 3. where
<hi>beleeving</hi> is mentioned, &amp; not another sort of works, <hi>to wit,</hi> such as give no
ground or occasion of boasting, which, in this case of justification, no man
can describe unto us, or tell us what they are.</p>
               <p>He tels us p. 122. that the meaning of these words <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 28. <hi>Therefore we
conclude</hi> &amp;c. is no more but this, <hi>viz. That a man is justified in the Gospel way</hi>
But not only is that in the general included; but that Gospel-way is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
expressed, to be <hi>by faith without the deeds of the Law:</hi> And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his <hi>Popish,</hi> &amp; <hi>Socinian</hi> way is diametrically opposite to the Gospel-way.</p>
               <p>He goeth about to explaine to us p. 124. &amp;c. what is meaned by <hi>their own
Righteousness,</hi> that is so frequently set in opposition to <hi>the Righteousness of God,</hi>
&amp; tels us, that it was so called upon a threefold account. 1. <hi>Because they sought
the pardon of their sins by their own Sacrifices. Ans.</hi> And why not also by their
works of Obedience? Sure. neither <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor <hi>David</hi> sought for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
upon any such accout, &amp; they renunced other works, than these. Is
that all the Righteousness that <hi>Paul</hi> renunceth <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9? Was he then oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
about Sacrifices? Some thing else sure is understood. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 4.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>they did not think Regeneration, or Supernatural grace
necessary to the obtaining of it. Ans.</hi> And truely, all the Regeneration &amp; Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
grace, which he thinks necessary, is but that a <hi>Pelagian, Iesuite
&amp; Arminian</hi> will think necessary, &amp; no more, as we saw above. But doth
he think, that <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>David</hi> had any such apprehensions? &amp; yet even
their works are excluded from justification. Was that the Righteousness
that <hi>Paul</hi> called his owne <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9? I think for shame he will not say it.
And what meaneth <hi>Paul</hi> to say 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 4. <hi>I know nothing by my self, yet am
I not hereby justified.</hi> This sure, must include works done by supernatural
Grace; &amp; after Regeneration.</p>
               <p>3. Saith he. <hi>Because it was a way of seeking to be justified of their own devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
&amp; not of God's appointing. Ans.</hi> This is very true, but it is not the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
truth in this matter: And his way is of the same Nature, no more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with the Gospel methode of justification, through the Righteousness
of God by faith, than theirs is; for the Imputed Righteousness of Christ
he rejecteth with contempt: True justification he is ignorant of; He kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
no Faith, but what is <hi>Popish</hi> &amp; <hi>Socinian.</hi> His New Covenant is but a
new edition of the old. His Regeneration is Pelagian. His Good Works
are but works flowing from a Principle of Nature, aided with a common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
assistance.</p>
               <p>Let us now in end hear, what is the result of all his discourse. It is to shew;
<hi>That they were the works ef the Law, as exclusive of Faith in Christ, &amp; his death:
&amp; Not those, which are the immediat effects of Faith in Christ, in his death &amp; in
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:104357:197"/>
his doctrine.</hi> But the Gospel tels us, that in the matter of Justification, all
the works, of the Law, are exclusive of faith in Christ, even <hi>Abraham's</hi>
works <hi>David's</hi> works: &amp; <hi>Paul's</hi> works; &amp; therefore they were all laid asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
&amp; justification was only looked for through Faith.</p>
               <p>Thus we have seen, what a Gospel this is, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to us, the consideration whereof may move some to say.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the object of justifying Faith.</head>
               <p>THough something of the Object of Faith was hinted before <hi>Chap.</hi>
XX. when we were speaking of the Nature of Faith: yet it will not
be amisse, to speak a little more of it here, both in reference to what
followeth; and also, &amp; more particularly in order to the better understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of, what it is to Live by Faith.</p>
               <p>In order therefore to the explaining of this Object, we would premit the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
few things.</p>
               <p>1. As was mentioned in the forecited place, there is presupposed unto the
right exercise, &amp; actual exerting of Faith, accepting the offered Saviour &amp;
Salvation through him, a Conviction of sin &amp; misery, in one measure, or
other, whereby the Sinner is brought to a desparing in himself, seing he
can finde no remedie, or reliefe for himself, within himself, and to a
concluding, that he is an undone man, if there be no other remedie, than
what he is able to do for himself: for after all meanes assayed (and a soul in
that case is ready to turn to many hands, to seek reliefe, &amp; until preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
grace come, will embrace &amp; close with any promising way, how char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
&amp; troublesome so ever it be, ere it sweetly comply with the only Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abasing
&amp; Grace-exalting way of Salvation, through Faith in Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the Gospel) he findeth himself disappointed. And further, it is
presupposed, as necessarily requisite hereunto, some knowledge of the
grounds of Religion; &amp; particularly of the Gospel, of Christ, of his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Work &amp;c. all revealed in the Gospel.</p>
               <p>2. When we speak here of the Object of Faith, we mean that Faith, by
which a Soul is united unto Christ, &amp; closeth with Him, as offered in the
Gospel, &amp; improveth Him to all ends &amp; uses, which their case &amp; neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie,
in all time coming, calleth for. So that it is one &amp; the same Faith,
whether it be called Uniting Faith, Saving Faith, Justifying Faith, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
&amp; heart-purifying Faith, or the like. It is one &amp; the same radical
grace, receiving these or the like various denominations, from the effects
brought about by it, or the several ends &amp; uses it hath, &amp; is appointed for.
And the same Faith bringeth all these effects about, in its way, according
to the Order, Methode &amp; measure, ordained of God: the same Faith,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:104357:198"/>
whereby the beleever is Married to Christ, &amp; Covenanteth with Him, as
Head, Husband, Lord &amp; Saviour, by the same is he justified, adopted
&amp; brought into a state of Peace &amp; Reconciliation with God. By the same
Faith also doth the man get his heart Purified, &amp; he liveth the life of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.
By the same also he getteth Strength, Reviving, Comfort,
&amp; Support in times of Temptation &amp; Trial. So that the Beleevers life first
&amp; last is by Faith, the beginning, progress, all the steps of it, &amp; final Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is by Faith; whence it is called Saving Faith, to distinguish it from
that Historical Faith, which, (though true in its kind yet) is not from
the saving grace of God, nor hath it effects accompanying Salvation.</p>
               <p>3. Though this Faith be one &amp; the same, by which the Beleever liveth
first &amp; last; and which proveth serviceable &amp; useful to him, on all occasions,
&amp; to all ends &amp; uses, that his several necessities call for: Yet in reference
to these various ends &amp; uses, it acteth not after one &amp; the same manner, in
all points: Faith acteth not every way, after one &amp; the same manner, in
order to get Strength for Duties, that it acteth, in order to get Sin Pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
It acteth not the same way for Subdueing the reigning power of sin,
that it acteth for Justification, nor doth it act the same way for Comfort and
upholding strength in a day of trial, that it acteth, in order to Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And yet we need not say, that it acteth distinctly &amp; differently, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to every distinct benefite, and blessing, that is had thereby: The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent
natures of the necessities we stand into, with the different wayes of
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ord's communicating what we stand in need of, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Relations he standeth in, &amp; various offices he hath taken on, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to his peoples good, may satisfie us herein, &amp; according as these
several particular necessities may come under one head, &amp; reliefe may be
conveyed to them, after one &amp; the same manner: All which will be best
discerned by the understanding Christian, in his application to Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Condition &amp; wants, which he would have helped &amp; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>4. Hence, though the Principal Object of this Faith be alwayes one and
the same; Yet there may be some peculiarities in that object, which Faith
eyeth more in one case, than in another: As we finde the Saints, in their
adresses to God, in their several straits &amp; necessities, sometimes pitching
upon one attribute of God, sometimes upon another; according as the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby
Faith presented God to the soul in a sutablness to the present case it was
in; and so when dispensations seemed to crosse the promises, Faith eyed
God as Faithful &amp; Unchangable; when enemies appeared strong, difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
invincible, and the like, Faith took hold on God, as the Almighty,
to whom nothing was impossible; &amp; when sin appeared as a discouragment
to drive them from their hopes, Faith took hold of the mercy of God &amp;c.
So when a poor sinner is under the convictions of sin &amp; threatnings of the
Law, Faith must take up Christ in a sutableness thereto, &amp; eye something
in Him, that peculiarly suiteth that case; &amp; when againe the beleever hath
need of Light, Instruction, Strength, Comfort, Throwbearing &amp; the
like, he fixeth his eye on some thing in Christ, that suiteth that particular
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:104357:198"/>
necessity: and so Faith acteth accordingly: And thus, though the object
remaine the same, and Christ be alwayes made use of; Yet Faith may and
doth act more immediatly on Christ, as Prophet, when in one case where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
this office carrieth a respect; and at another time more immediatly
&amp; directly on Christ, as a King, when the present necessity calleth for help
from Christ as King; &amp; againe faith acteth on him, as a Priest, when only
that, which Christ, as a Priest did, can answere their present necessitie.
Yet, (which is carefully to be observed, to prevent <hi>Mr. Baxter's</hi> challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge)
I do not say, nor see I any necessity to say, that these several acts of
Faith, are as so many several Conditions unto the receiving of the several
favours, taking the terme <hi>Condition</hi> in his sense; I do not say, that Faith
acting one way on Christ is a proper Condition of Justification, &amp; Faith as
acting another way on Christ is the proper Condition of Adoption, &amp; that
Faith acting a third way on Christ is the proper Condition of Sanctification
&amp;c. but that, as the effects &amp; benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, which sinners stand in need of, are
ascribed unto several effectuating acts of Christ, &amp; to the several Relations
&amp; offices he hath taken on; so Faith in order to the receiving of these bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites,
acteth suitably on Christ, &amp; the Beleever is, taught so to do by the
Spirit of the Lord, to his Comfort, Hope &amp; Encouragment.</p>
               <p>5. I presuppose here the Formal Object of all divine faith, which is the
Truth &amp; Veracity of God; for all divine faith giveth credite unto divine
Revelations upon the Credite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Truth &amp; Veracity of the Revealer. <hi>Thus
saith the Lord,</hi> who is true, &amp; who is Truth itself, is the sole Formal ground
&amp; <hi>Ratio</hi> of this Faith.</p>
               <p>6. I presuppose here also that Comprehensive Material Object of all divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
Faith, which is the whole will &amp; mind of God, concerning whatsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thing it be revealed, whether by the Scriptures, or by the Light of
Nature. If the Truth &amp; Veracity of God be the only Formal Ground of
this Faith, then all that this God revealeth must be beleeved &amp; received, as
true, when known to be revealed by Him. <hi>By faith we understand, that the
worlds were framed by the word of God. Heb.</hi> 11: 3. &amp; we beleeve <hi>all things
which are written in the Law &amp; the Prophets Act.</hi> 24: 14. Yea &amp; in the whole
word of God: I do not here determine, what particular Truthes, revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the word, are necessarily to be expresly &amp; explicitly beleeved, by
every one, that hath a true Saving Faith, &amp; what not: only this I say, that
many particular truthes, are revealed, whereof a true Beleever may be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
&amp; yet have a true Saving Faith, receiving all, which he knoweth to
be revealed by the Lord, &amp; rejecting no one Truth whatsomever, that he
knoweth to be revealed.</p>
               <p>But we are here to speak of that Object of Faith, which immediatly &amp;
directly concerneth our delivery from our natural state of sin and miserie;
and our eternal Salvation: And this, we judge, to be <hi>whole Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
as he is hold forth and revealed in the Gospel.</hi> We say Christ Jesus
(1) wholly, and (2) as he is held forth and revealed in the Gospel. And
both these, for explications sake, may be branched out, in several par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:104357:199"/>
I say then <hi>first.</hi> That whole Christ is the object of Saving or Justifying
Faith. Hence are we so often times commanded to Receive him, &amp; to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
in &amp; on Him &amp; in his name; &amp; Faith is expressed by a Coming to him,
Eating &amp; Drinking of Him, Receiving of him, &amp;c. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 12. &amp; 3: 16,
36. &amp; 6: 29, 35, 37, 40, 44, 47, 51, 54, 55, 58. &amp; 7: 38. <hi>Act.</hi> 10: 41, &amp; 13:
38, 39. &amp; 26: 18. <hi>Rom</hi> 3: 22. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 16. and many moe places. Hence
this Faith is called <hi>the Faith of Christ Gal.</hi> 2: 16. and the Faith of the Son
of God <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 20. So then Saving and Justifying Faith taketh whole Christ.</p>
               <p>1. Faith taketh him &amp; closeth with him wholly; as to his Natures: Faith
receiveth him, as Mediator, God &amp; Man in one person, though it be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
terminated on him, as God <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14: 1. &amp; as the Son of God <hi>Gal.</hi> 2:
20. Yet faith receiveth him, as <hi>God manifest in the flesh. 1. Tim.</hi> 3: 16. as
the <hi>word made flesh Ioh.</hi> 1: 14. as <hi>the Christ, the Son of the living God Matt.</hi>
16: 16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6: 63. as the <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God with us <hi>Esai.</hi> 7: 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1: 23.
<hi>Luk</hi> 1: 31.</p>
               <p>2. Faith taketh him wholly, as to his Offices; as a Prophet, as a Priest,
&amp; as a King: Faith embraceth him, as that great <hi>Prophet Act.</hi> 3: 22. as the
Word of God, that came out of the bosome of the Father, to reveal his

is the object of Saving &amp; Justifying faith: And so</p>
               <p>1. He is received, as the result (to speak so) of the wonderful Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
&amp; Designe of free Grace, Love, Goodness, Mercy, &amp; Wisdom,
concerning the glorifying of God, in the Salvation of the chosen ones, in &amp;
through Him: faith here observeth &amp; closeth chearfully with that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Covenant of Redemption, betwixt Jehovah, or God Father, Son and
Holy Ghost, and the Son in order to the Salvation of poor man, through
the Sones becoming Mediator, God-man, &amp; becoming Cautioner, for
such as were given unto Him, and coming in their Law-place, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for them, and their debt. &amp;c. Faith closeth with, and embraceth this
foundamental Ground of Salvation, in all its Parts, Ends &amp; Meanes: and
so receiveth Christ, as standing in such a place, and as engageing to through
such a designe of Love &amp; free Grace; so far as the Beleever cometh to know
&amp; understand the same to be revealed. We may consider to this end <hi>Esai.</hi>
53. through out <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 3. &amp; forward. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 21-27. and other places; &amp;
there see how Christ is held forth.</p>
               <p>2. He is received as the great Gift of God <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4: 10. as the Soveraigne
Mean, through which all the great designe of Grace is brought about, in a
glorious manner, as the authorized Ambassadour of God, and messenger
of the Covenant <hi>Mal.</hi> 3: 1. as the grand Effect of Love, Grace &amp; Goodwill
<hi>Tu.</hi> 3: 4. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: 16. as fore-ordained and set forth to be a Propitiation
through faith in his blood <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 25. and as made of God unto us wisdom,
Righteousness, Sanctification &amp; Redemption. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 30. He is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as the Power of God, and as the Wisdom of God 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 24. as He,
in whom God was reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their
trespasses unto them 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 19. and as made sin, though he knew no sin
for us, that we might be made the Righteousness of God, in him 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5:
21. that is, as the Lord our Righteousness <hi>Ier.</hi> 23: 6. Thus faith, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Christ, as thus held forth in the Gospel, eyeth God, the Giver,
the Sender, the Maker of Christ to be sin, and eyeth God, as the Justifier
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:104357:200"/>
of the ungodly in him <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 5. and as the Reconciler of us to himself by
Christ 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 18. as forgiving sins, and granting Redemption through
Christ's blood, according to the riches of his Grace, wherein He hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
toward us, in all wisdom &amp; prudence. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 7, 8. Here is the
incomprehensible riches of the Mercy &amp; Grace of God Father. Son &amp; Holy
Ghost, eyed as the Object, according to their peculiar methode &amp; order of
working, in this grand affaire.</p>
               <p>3. He is received as offered &amp; held forth in the Promises: Thus was he
embraced of old, as the promised Messiah, and as the substance of all the
Promises, which the Fathers of old saw a far off <hi>Heb.</hi> 11: 13. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8: 56.
That promise made to <hi>Abraham</hi> that in him all Nations should be blessed,
was the Gospel <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 8. and contained a bunddle of promises <hi>vers.</hi> 16. And
the faith of this, was that faith, by which <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified <hi>Rom.</hi> 4:
16-22. Hence all the promises are made good in and through him; and
they are all yea &amp; amen, in him 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 20. And he is the Substance of
them all; for they either hold forth his Person, or his Work, or some thing
of Him, or some thing from Him, according to the Various Exigencies &amp;
Necessities of his people.</p>
               <p>4. He is received as the grand meane of declaring &amp; setting forth the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Attributes of God; which the Lord will have manifested in and by
this noble designe of the Gospel: for Faith sweetly acquiesceth in this desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne
of God's, to preach forth his Excellencies &amp; Vertues, in this manner;
and therefore receiveth Christ, as offered &amp; held forth in the Gospel, for
such a glorious End; &amp; so receiveth him, as the great Gift of Love <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:
16. as the mean, whereby the Righteousness of God is declared <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 25.
and his Grace <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 5, 6. and as the Power of God. and the Wisdom of
God. 1: <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 24, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3: 10. Thus Faith seeth the glory of God shining
with a peculiar splendour, in the face of Jesus Christ 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 6.</p>
               <p>5. So is he received as the grand &amp; only Meane to bring about all the
great Ends, designed of God, and desired by them: so that in the receiving
of him, all these ends are closed with, and expected: such as Remission of
sins, Justification, Acceptation, Adoption, Sanctification, Peace of
Conscience, Joy in the Holy Ghost, yea life, and Immortality &amp; full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1; 14. <hi>Act.</hi> 26: 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 25. &amp; 4: 6, 7, 8. <hi>Ephes.</hi>
1: 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 1, 2, 3. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 3, 4. So that Faith eyeth he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
by way of end, all that Grace &amp; Glory, they would have, and can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to make them up,</p>
               <p>6. And, in a word, He is received as the grand meane to Interest them
in God, Father, Son &amp; Holy Ghost, as theirs; to bring them nigh unto
God, and in Covenant with Him, and to enjoy the several Effects &amp; Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
of their Workings. They come to God through Him, as the only way
to the Father <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14: 6. They close with the Father, as their God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through Him, and with the Holy Ghost, as their Sanctifier, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
through Him, who sendeth the Spirit from the Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15: 26.
&amp; 14: 26.</p>
               <p>All these several things belong unto the adequate &amp; full Object of that
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:104357:200"/>
faith, whereby beleevers become Justified, Adopted, Sanctified, &amp; shall
be at length finally Saved, for they shall receive the end of their faith, the
Salvation of their souls 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 9. Yet to prevent mistakes, we would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
some few considerations.</p>
               <p>1. By all this, we do not meane, that all these Objects, or Various parts
or Considerations of the one adequate &amp; compleet Object, are expresly and
distinctly conceived &amp; laid hold on by every Beleever, when they act faith
on Christ, or come unto God through him, according to the Gospel-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
But that these things belong to the full Object of Saving faith, and
are implied therein; so that whoever beleeveth savingly, beleeveth these
several truthes, according to the measure of the Revelation of God, and
of their Capacity &amp; Information. So that a more full &amp; explicite beleefe
of these particulars is now required under the Gospel, than was required un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Old Testament, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>his Revelation was not so full and plaine, as
now: and more is required of such, who have had clear information of
Gospel truthes; than of others, who have wanted that Advantage: and
more also is required of such, as have large Capacities &amp; Understandings,
than of others, who are more Rude &amp; of a narrower Reach.</p>
               <p>2. Wherever any of these truthes are rightly beleeved, and heartily clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with, all the rest are implicitly also received; for they cannot be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
the whole contrivance is such a noble piece af divine art &amp; of infinite
wisdom, that all the several pieces, are indissolubly knit together: Hence
what ever piece it be, that the beleever first doth directly &amp; explicitly close
with, or under whatsoever notion Christ at first be embraced, according us
the beleever cometh to more distinct apprehensions of other pieces or parts
of this contrivance, so his heart complyeth with, and he cordially embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the same.</p>
               <p>3. We may be hereby helped to understand, the several and various ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
used in Scripture, to pointe forth faith, acting on its object; for,
however these be not alwayes one and the same, but different; yet the same
whole object is implicitly understood; and these particulars, expresly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
must not be considered abstractly, or alone; but according to their
several place in the grand designe, and with respect thereto; as when the
object of faith is said to be <hi>He, who justifieth the ungodly Rom.</hi> 4: 5. and to be
<hi>Him, who raised up Iesus our Lord from the dead vers.</hi> 24. and in that same
<hi>Chap.</hi> the object of <hi>Abraham's</hi> faith, whereby he was justified, is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
that God would make him a Father of many Nations &amp;c. <hi>vers.</hi> 17, 18.
&amp;c. all these must be considered with respect unto Christ, the grand <hi>medium,</hi>
who was appointed to be a Saviour to all Nations, and was to die &amp; rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
after satisfaction made to Justice, and in and through whom alone
God will Justifie the poor sinner, that is ungodly in himself. With referen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
here unto must we understand the Publicans saying, <hi>God be merciful to me,
a sinner,</hi> and the saints under the <hi>Old Testam.</hi> their so frequent fleeing to the
Grace, Mercy &amp; Bounty of God; for all this was with respect to the only
Soveraigne way, that the Lord had condescended upon, whereby to shew
forth, and manifest, his Mercy &amp; Goodness &amp; Grace to sinners. In the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:104357:201"/>
                  <hi>New Test.</hi> we finde more express mention made of Christ, as the object of
faith, as <hi>Iesus of Nazareth, the true Messiah,</hi> who was promised <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20: 31.
1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5: 9, 10, 20. <hi>Ioh. 1, 45. Act.</hi> 13: 38. or as Lord &amp; God. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20: 28.
as the Son of David. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15: 21. &amp; 9: 27, &amp; 20: 30. &amp; 21: 42. As the Son
of God <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9: 35. as the <hi>Christ the Son of God Ioh.</hi> 11: 27. <hi>Act.</hi> 8: 37. as <hi>come
forth from God Ioh.</hi> 16: 30, 27. as the <hi>Lord Iesus Act.</hi> 16. 31. as <hi>raised by God
from the dead Rom.</hi> 10: 9 as one that <hi>died &amp; rose againe 1. Thes.</hi> 1: 14. as <hi>sent of
God Ioh.</hi> 17: 8. that <hi>Iesus is the Christ. 1. Ioh.</hi> 5: 1. So that under all these
and the like, one and the same thing for substance is pointed forth; though
some particular in that grand designe of grace is more expresly &amp; immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pointed at; yet that particular is to be understood with reference to the
whole; and the whole is to be included. So also when God is mentioned
as the object of faith; either absolutely 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5: 1. 1.
<hi>Thes.</hi> 1: 8. or in Reference to Christ, whom he sent <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5: 24. or through
whom he is beleeved in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 21. or the like, the matter must be thus
understood.</p>
               <p>4. Hereby also may the Various Explications of this object of faith, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by men, be some way understood &amp; reconciled, when some say, the
Mercy of God is it, others say, the Promises, some Remission of sins,
and the like? some God the Father, Son &amp; Holy Ghost: for such as seem
to restrict it most, may be understood as not speaking exclusively of what
else the Scripture mentioneth as belonging thereunto.</p>
               <p>5. All this notwithstanding, faith may have &amp; hath a special respect to
Christ as Priest, and making Satisfaction to justice, and laying down the
Ransome-money, and paying the debt, according to his undertaking as
Surety, in order to the particular benefite of Justification, and of Pardon
of sins; as was in part cleared above, and may be more spoken to after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
in the following <hi>Chapters.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="33" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XXXIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Righteousness of Christ is the special Object of
Faith in Justification.</head>
               <p>COnsidering what hath been said at some length above, concerning the
imputation of the Surety-Righteousness of Christ, in order to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
we needed not insist on this here; Seing if what is said
touching that fundamental point hold, this will not endure much debate:
Yet because Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Apologie</hi> against Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> §. 11. is pleased to
tell us, that <hi>Faith, which is the Iustifying condition, is not terminated on the
Righteousness of Christ:</hi> And that <hi>it is a meer fancy &amp; delusion to speak of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
a Righteousness, that we may be justified</hi> constitutive <hi>thereby, in such a
sense, as if the Righteousness were first to be made ours, in order of nature before,
our Iustification, &amp; then justification follow, because we are Righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:104357:201"/>
But, sure, this eyeing of, laying hold on, and leaning to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ, holdeth clear correspondence with the experience of the
Children of God, not only at their first Conversion, when delivered from
under the Convictions of sin, and the terrours of the Law; but even after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
when exercised with new assaults of Satan, objecting unto them their
Unworthiness, &amp; Filthiness, and hence inferring their exclusion from the
face of God: for then their maine quieting refuge is the Righteousness of
Christ; wherein they seek only to be found, acknowledging that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they are but sinners, and so rejecting their own worth &amp; holiness,
as too ragged to cover the shame of their nakedness, wherein they have the
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> going before them <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 8, 9. (which may also serve, for a
scriptural proof and ground of the truth in hand) He rejected all these things,
wherein sometime he gloried, and he did now (even long after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
while a prisoner at <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; after all his great Labour &amp; Paines in
spreading the Gospel) <hi>count all things</hi> (nothing is here excepted) <hi>but loss</hi>
(saith he) <hi>for the excestency of the knowledge of Christ Iesus, my Lord, for whom
I have suffered the loss of all things, &amp; do count them but dung. that I may win
Christ, &amp; be found in him, not having mine own Righteousness</hi> (it is nor good
that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> should carp at Writters &amp; Preachers, for speaking &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
after this manner, as he doth <hi>Cath. Theol. Mor. Works</hi> §. 176.) <hi>which
is of the Law; but that, which is through the faith of Christ, the Righteousness
which is of God by faith.</hi> This saith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>early, that in order to Justification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, faith laith hold on a Righteousness, which is of God, and which
is had by the Faith of Christ.</p>
               <p>And this Surety-Righteousness of Christ, is that which can only prove
sutable unto the case of a wakened sinner, pressed with the guilt of sin, and
seeing justice armed against him, stopping his way to life, because of his
Un-righteousness. What can be more welcome unto such a sinner, than
the newes of a Righteousness, and of having Christ to become the Lord his
Righteousness, as made of God Righteousness? And what can his faith
grippe to more earnestly, than to this Righteousness, that he may be covered
therewith, and think with joy of appearing before God? How else shall
he think to be justified by God, who is just, even when the justifier of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
sinner. He knoweth, that God is Righteous, and will not acquit
the guilty; and therefore he must have a Righteousness, that he may be in
case to stand before the Righteous God: So that he can have no peace, till
by faith he have interest in the Surety-Righteousness of Jesus Christ; for he
knoweth, that he hath none of his owne, and that there is none any where
else to be had.</p>
               <p>And further, this way doth exceedingly serve to demonstrate, upon the
one hand, the Righteousness of God, who will not Justifie without a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
or one that hath no Righteousness; and upon the other hand, it
commendeth the riches of the free Grace &amp; Mercy of God, when the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
seeth, how free Love hath provided such an alsufficient Remedie, a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
against which, no exception can be made, and a Righteousness,
under the wings of which, he may saifly hide &amp; shelter himself &amp; being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:104357:202"/>
with which, he may rest confidente of acceptance, and so may with
full peace of mind rest here, and relye upon it. As also it serveth exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to abase man in his own eyes, and to make him for ever keep a low saile,
and walk humblie before this God, and give Him the Glory of all.</p>
               <p>Hence this Righteousness is called the <hi>Righteousness of Faith,</hi> or of Christ
beleeved in, and laid hold on <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 13. <hi>&amp; the Righteousness of God, which
is by faith of Iesus Christ Rom.</hi> 3: 22. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9. <hi>&amp; a Righteousness through the
faith of Christ, ibid.</hi> All which &amp; the like expressions do manifestly say, that
faith laith hold on a Righteousness, even on the Righteousness of God. And
this Righteousness is said to <hi>be unto all, &amp; upon all them that beleeve Rom.</hi> 3.

<hi>Rom</hi> 4: 24. <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> in the forecited book <hi>Cath. Theol.</hi> §. 131. saith that
the meaning of this <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 24. <hi>is no more, but that God reputeth, or judgeth
us Righteous.</hi> But how can he repute us Righteous, unless we have a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
either of our own, or from some other: of ourselves we have
not a Righteousness, unless he account beleeving all our Righteousness, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which we have said enough above; and the very words of the text will
not admit of this glosse, as was also shown above. If it be the Righteousness
of Christ, who was delivered for our Offences, and was raised againe for
our Justification <hi>vers.</hi> 25. then it is fit object for faith to lay hold on, it
being Christ's Surety-Righteousness, or the Righteousness, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
&amp; wrought out, when he was delivered for our offences; and which
was publickly declared to be accepted, when he was raised againe for our
Justification. And whatever <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> think, this is, and must be so far
made our owne, through the gracious Imputation of God, that the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
God, whose judgment is to according to truth, may pronunce us Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and accept of us, as such. But saith he, <hi>Imputing Righteousness to us,
is a consequent act (after faith) of God as judge, and not an antecedent dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>]
Yet it is such a consequent act of God, as necessarily presupposeth
God's free antecedent Donation: for it is God's reckoning that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
upon the beleevers score, in order to the Justifying of him thereupon;
and because this Righteousness must be given, we not having it of oursel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
there must a free donation antecede, and this groundeth Faiths ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
thereof, and receiving of it. And himself immediatly before this,
saith, <hi>that God, giving us all the effects, or Salvation merited, in it self proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is said also not unfitly to give us the merit or Righteousness, which procured
them, that is, as it was paid to God for us, to procure them.</hi> And if so, why
doth he inveigh so much, in the foregoing pages, against the orthodox
doctrine of Imputation; seing he cannot but know, that they do not say,
that God doth give us the very <hi>habits of holiness</hi> (as he speaketh there) which
were in Christ, nor the <hi>transient acts</hi> which he performed, nor the very <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi>
which he under-went, nor the Relation of <hi>Righteous Satisfactory &amp;
Meritorious,</hi> as it was that <hi>numerical relation,</hi> which immediatly resulted
from Christ's own habits, acts and sufferings: They dreame of no such
Translation of accidents. But only say, that seing (as <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> here &amp;
elsewhere saith) this satisfactory Righteousness was paid to God for them,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:104357:202"/>
and accepted of God, as a compleat &amp; Satisfactory Righteousness, they
by faith coming to be united unto Christ (according to the way &amp; metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
which the Lord hath wisely condescended upon) have an interest in
that Satisfactory Righteousness, as legally made over unto them, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
have the benefites purchased thereby; as when a stranger, who was
not under the Obligation, cometh to pay the debt of a debtor lying in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the payment must in Law sense be made, and accounted the debtors, or
put upon his score, and received upon his account, ere he can therefore be
relieved out of Prison.</p>
               <p>But in the fore-cited place against <hi>Mr. Blake</hi> he maketh this Righteousness
&amp; Remission all one thing: And indeed if it were so, it could not belong to
the Object of Faith, other wayes, than as an end, intended to be obtained
thereby. But to us Remission is a benefite purchased by this Righteousness,
and followeth upon our having interest therein through Faith, according to
the appointment of God: a Pardoned man, as such, is not a Righteous man.
But he tels us there, that <hi>our divines of the Assembly do perfectly define justifying
Faith to be,</hi> a receiving &amp; resting on Christ alone for Salvation, as he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferest
in the Gospel. <hi>It is of dangerous consequence to define justifying faith to
be the receiving of justification, or Righteousness. Ans.</hi> Here we have Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
&amp; Righteousness made one and the same, which with me, differ as
Cause &amp; Effect; our divines of the Assembly give a more full definition or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of Justifying Faith, in the Larger Catechisme, and there tell us,
that thereby the convinced sinner <hi>receiveth &amp; resteth upon Christ, &amp;</hi> (N.B.)
<hi>his Righteousness therein</hi> (i.e. in the Gospel) <hi>held forth, for pardon of sin, &amp;
for the accepting &amp; accounting of his person Righteous in the sight of God for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
And if <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> would say so much, as is here, this debate would
be at an end, and yet I finde not this among his exceptions, against that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme,
in his <hi>Confession.</hi> And when our devines mentione this Receiving
&amp; Resting upon Christ's Righteousness, they make not Justifying Faith to be
a receiving of Justification; but the one a cause of the other: And he addeth
a little thereafter, (which is considerable to our present purpose) <hi>That</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio
Ethica activa <hi>of justification, or of Righteousness</hi> (for they are both
one thing with him) <hi>goeth before Iustification, as a small &amp; secondary part of
condition, it being the accepting of Christ himself, that is the maine condition:</hi>
And we never spoke of the receiving by Faith of Christ's Righteousness, as
exclusive of the receiving of himself. He tels us next. <hi>That Christ's Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
or Redemption</hi> (solvendo pretium) <hi>&amp; merit, cannot properly be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by us; for they are not in themselves given to us.</hi> We grant the price was
payed to God, but it being payed to God for us, it may be imputed to us,
and reckoned upon our score; and we may that way receive it by faith, and
Lean our soul upon it, to the end, that the fruit of it may be given to us.
And likewise he granteth <hi>ibid. that justifying faith doth as necessarily respect
Christ's satisfaction &amp; merit, as it doth our Iustification thereby procurea.</hi> If
he will grant, that Justifying Faith respecteth Christ's Satisfaction &amp; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
as the Cause, in which we are to have an interest, and under which
we must refuge our selves, and upon the account of which we are to be
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:104357:203"/>
accepted of God, and accounted Righteous in his sight, all is granted that
I desire.</p>
               <p>But his following exceptions are founded upon a manifest mistake of his
own, taking this Righteousness, whereof we speak, and Justification, for
one and the same thing: for he saith. <hi>To say therefore, that the justifying act of
faith, is only the receiving of Christ's Righteousness, or of Iustification, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the receiving of Christ himself, any way, even to exclude him as Satisfier
from the justifying act: &amp; to exclude from that act his Redemption by Bloudshed,
Satisfaction &amp; Merite.</hi> The mistake here is palpable: for we look on Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
which faith receiveth, as the Cause, and on Justification as the
Effect: when this Righteousness of Christ, the <hi>causa proca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arctica</hi> of our
Justification, is received by faith, it is impossible, but Christ himself must be
received as a Satisfier: his Redemption, Bloudshed, Satisfaction &amp; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
cannot be excluded; for therein was the Righteousness, which faith
laith hold upon, in order to Justification. He addeth for confirmation, <hi>for
if it be only the receiving of Righteousness, that is the justifying act; than it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the receiving of Christ himself, nor yet the acknowledgment of his Satisfaction &amp;
Redemption by his blood.</hi> But this is nothing but what was said, repeated agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
Neither do we say, that the Justifying act of Faith, as it is called, is a
receiving of Christ's Righteousness, as distinct from himself: nor is it ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
how Christ's Righteousness can be received, without the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of his Satisfaction, and of the Redemption by his blood.</p>
               <p>How he can say, that Christ's Righteousness &amp; our Justification, are but
one and the same thing, I do not understand, when as he saith himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Cath. Theol. of moral works</hi> Sect. 13. n. 208. that <hi>our first constitutive justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
(which is it whereof we are here speaking, to wit, that by which
a soul is brought from an Unrighteous to a Righteous State, as he speaketh,
n. 207.) <hi>is in its nature a right to impunity &amp; to life, or glory.</hi> Now sure, this
Relation, or Relative state is one thing, and the Righteousness of Christ,
the ground &amp; meritorious cause thereof is a far other thing. And when he
saith <hi>Apologie</hi> ag. <hi>Mr. Eyre.</hi> §. 4. that <hi>he is well content to call Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Satisfaction the matter of ours,</hi> and that <hi>the imputation of Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
taken for Donation, is the forme of Constitutive Iustification,</hi> &amp; that
<hi>sentential adjudication of Christ's Righteousness to us, is the forme of our senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Iustification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Faith in order to Justification doth in a special manner, eye the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness

                     </gap> the seed of
Israel be justified.</hi> This truth is also clearly held forth, when faith in the
matter of Justification, is called <hi>faith in Christ's blood Rom.</hi> 3: 25. for when
faith laith hold on the bloud of Christ, it cannot but lay hold on his Surety-Righteousness,
whom God set forth to be a Propitiation; and in &amp; through
whom there was a Redemption wrought <hi>vers.</hi> 24. for this hlood was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption-money,
the price payed, in order to Redemption. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 18,
19. And the blessedness of Justification is through the Imputation of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
without our works <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6. and therefore faith, in order to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:104357:203"/>
the obtaining of this blessedness, must eye and relye upon this Righteousness
which is the Righteousness of him, who was delivered for our offences and
was raised againe for our Justification <hi>vers.</hi> 25. where we may also observe a
manifest difference betwixt this Righteousness, (which consisteth in his
being delivered for our offences) and our Justification; the one being the
Cause (as was said) &amp; the other the Effect.</p>
               <p>Moreover, this same truth is clear from <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m.</hi> 5: 17. where we read of the
<hi>receiving of the gift of righteousness,</hi> which is by faith, and that in order to a
reigning in life by one Jesus Christ: where also we see a difference put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
this gift of Righteousness &amp; Reigning in life; which is also more clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
in the following <hi>vers. 18. Even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift
came upon all men unto Iustification of life:</hi> this <hi>righteousness of one,</hi> to wit, one
Jesus Christ, is the Cause, and the <hi>Iustification of life,</hi> is the Effect: And
further this difference is againe held forth. <hi>vers.</hi> 19, 20, 21. Our being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
Righteous is different from the obedience of one Christ Jesus; and by the
Imputation of this Obedience to us, do we become Righteous, as our being
made sinners is different from <hi>Adam's</hi> act of Disobedience; and we are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
sinners by the Imputation of it to us. And as sin &amp; death are different,
when it is said, <hi>that sin hath reigned unto death;</hi> so Eternal life is different
from Righteousness, when it is said, <hi>so might grace reigne through righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
unto eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We need say no more of this, seing it clearly followeth, from what was
formerly at length confirmed; <hi>to wit,</hi> That justification is by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ imputed.</p>

               <head type="sub">Faith in Justification respecteth not in a special manner
Christ, as a King; but as a Priest.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Baxter</hi> did long ago in his <hi>Aphorismes</hi> tell us; That the Accpting
of Christ for Lord, is as essential a part of Iustifying Faith, as the
accepting of him for our Saviour; that is, as he explained himself,
That faith, as it accepteth Christ, for Lord &amp; King, doth justifie. And
this was asserted by him, to the end, he might cleare &amp; confirme how Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Obedience cometh in with Affiance to make up the Condition of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
for his <hi>Thesis</hi> LXXII. did run thus. <hi>As the accepting of Christ for
Lord (which is the hearts Subjection) is as essential a part of Justifying Faith, as
the accepting of him for our Saviour; So consequently, sincere obedience (which
is the effect of the former) hath at much to do in justifying us before God, as Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance</hi>
(<hi>which is the fruit of the later.</hi> Hence the question arose, and was by
some proposed thus; Whether faith in Christ <hi>qua</hi> Lord, be the justifying
act: or, whether the Acceptation of Christ, as a Lord, and not only, as
a Priest, doth justifie. And <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Confess.</hi> p. 35. §. 13. saith, that
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:104357:204"/>
                  <hi>it is not only without any ground in God's word, but fully against it, to say, that
faith justifieth only, as it apprehendeth Christ, as a Ransome, or Satisfier of
justice, or Meriter of our Iustification; or his Righteousness as ours; &amp; not as it
receiveth him, as King, or as a Saviour from the staine &amp; tyranny of sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have shewed before, that the moving of this question, is of little use,
in reference to that end, for which, it seemeth, it was first intended, <hi>to
wit,</hi> to prove, that Sincere Obedience hath as much to do in Justification,
as faith, or Affiance hath; where I did shew the inconsequence of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.
That because Justifying Faith receiveth Christ, as King; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Obedience is a part of the Condition of Justification, yea, or therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
a Purpose, or a promise of Obedience is a part of the Condition of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.
So that, in order to the disproving of that Assertion, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
obedience, or a Purpose, or a promise of obedience, an essential part
of the Condition of Justification we need not trouble ourselves with this
question: Yet, in regaird that the speaking to this may contribute to the
clearing of the way of Justification by faith, (which is our great designe)
we shall speak our judgment there anent. And in order thereunto, several
things must be premitted.</p>
               <p>As 1. The question is not, whether Christ, as a King, belongeth to the
compleet &amp; adequate object of that faith, which is the true &amp; justifying
faith: for this is granted, as was shown above, this faith, being the same
faith, whether it be called True Faith, or Saving Faith, or Uniting &amp;
Covenanting faith, or Justifying faith, it must have one &amp; the same ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
Object.</p>
               <p>2. Nor is the Question, whether Faith in order to Justification, doth so
act on Christ, as a Priest, as to exclude either virtually, or expresly, the
consideration of any other of his offices, or of Christ under any other of his
offices: for under whatever office Christ be considered; when faith acteth
upon him, whole Christ is received, and nothing in Christ is or can be
excludeth; So that there is no virtual exclusion; nor can there be any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
exclusion of any of his offices, when he, under any other of his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
is looked to a right &amp; received; for such an exclusion would be an open
rejection of Christ, and no receiving of him.</p>
               <p>3. When we speak here of receiving of Christ, as a Priest, or in respect
of his Sacerdotal Office, it is all one, as if we named his Sacerdotal work,
or what he did in the discharge of that office, offering up himself a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
Sacrifice, and giving his blood, and life for that end, and suffering
inwardly &amp; outwardly, what was laid upon him by the Father, in order to
the making of full Satisfaction to justice, and paying our debt, by his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
Active &amp; Passive.</p>
               <p>4. Nor do we, when we speak of Faiths acting on Christ, as a Priest, so
limite &amp; restrick the same unto his Sacerdotal work, as to exclude any thing,
that is presupposed thereunto, concomitant thereof, consequential there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
&amp; depending thereupon, or is necessarily requisite unto the effectual
application of the same unto our Justification &amp; Advantage. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is said, that in Justification, faith eyeth in a special manner the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotal
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:104357:204"/>
office &amp; work of Christ, there is no exclusion of the Consideration
of that <hi>fountaine Love, Grace, &amp; favoure</hi> of God, whereby Christ was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto the chosen, and appointed to be their Priest, and to make Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for them: Nor of his foregoing <hi>Incarnation, Obedience, Resurrection,
Asctnsion</hi> &amp;c. nor of other thlngs that are necessarily requisite hereunto, for
all these are necessarily herein included.</p>
               <p>5. When we speak of the Souls acting faith, in order to Justification, we
do not suppose, that at that time, the troubled soul can have no other end
or designe before his eyes; nor be troubled with no other evil, or with the
thoughts thereof, that he would be delivered from; and so in order to get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
help therein, and a remedie thereof, cannot eye some-thing else in
Christ, answering &amp; suiting the same: for a Sinner in that case, may be
troubled with the sense of the great Unbeleef &amp; Hardness &amp; Impenitency of
his heart, the Unholiness of all his wayes, his Blindness &amp; Ignorance; as
well as with the sense of his Guilt, and of his being under the Curse; and
so may &amp; must be supposed, in coming to Christ for reliefe, to eye in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
manner, that in Christ, which is answerable to these his Necessities:
And in this respect, a Sinner may be said to go to Christ, as a Prophet, and
as a King, as well as to him, as a Priest; But in reference to these evils,
they are not said or supposed to go to Christ, for Justification; for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth
merely their state of Sin &amp; Guilt.</p>
               <p>6. But the real question should be, what is the special &amp; practical mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of these words, <hi>we are justified,</hi> or <hi>live by faith:</hi> and to this end, the
true Question is, what special way doth faith act on Christ (for it is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed,
that Christ must be the Object of Justifying Faith) in order to
the sinners Justification? or what is that in Christ, that faith specially eyeth,
and carrieth the soul out unto, when Justification before God is only desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
Or when the wakened sinner is earnestly desireous of delivery from the
Guilt of sin &amp; from the Curse of God, and of enjoying the Favour &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
Face of God, whether he is to apply himself by faith unto Christ,
as King, or unto Christ, as a Priest &amp; to what he did as a Priest, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of sinners?</p>
               <p>In answere to the Question thus proposed, I say, That the wakened sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
in that case, while seeking reliefe from sin &amp; guilt, and from the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
by Absolution &amp; Justification, in the sight of God, in compliance
with the Gospel methode &amp; designe, making Justification to be by faith, &amp;
in obedience to the Gospel command, saying, Beleeve &amp; be justified, is
to act faith in a special manner on Christ's Mediation &amp; Satisfaction; &amp; to
betake himself to Christ as a Priest, and rest on him &amp; on what he di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as a
Priest, that is, on his death, Bloud, and Satisfaction. This is it, which
others call the justifyinh Act of Faith: or that special act of faith, required
in order to Justification.</p>
               <p>Though what was said in the foregoing <hi>Chapter</hi> to prove, that Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
is the Object of Justifying faith, may serve for confirmation of
this; Yet we shall, in short, lay down these grounds of proof, and</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi> Several Scriptnre-expressions, where Justification is spoken of and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:104357:205"/>
cleared in its causes, shew and pointe forth what is, which faith should
specially eye, and be employed about, in order to the interesting of the soul
in this benefite: such as</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Rom. 3. 24, 25. Being justified freely by his grace, through the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is in Iesus Christ; whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation, through
faith in his blood.</hi> Here, as justification is said to be brought about &amp; effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at
through the Redemption of Christ, who was a Propitiation, &amp; this
respecteth only his Priesthood; so the special object of faith, in this affair',
is expresly said to be his Bloud, <hi>through faith in his blood,</hi> to tell us, that all
such, as would have interest in this Privilege of justification, must by faith
eye the Propitiation, the Bloody Sacrifice of Christ; And by blood we fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
it oft said, that Remission of sins is had <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 14. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26:
28. and not without it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9: 22.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 24, 25.- <hi>to whom it shall be imputed, if we beleeve on him, that
raised up Iesus, our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for our offences, &amp;
was raised againe for our Iustification.</hi> As justification, here is held as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
&amp; brought about by Christ, as a Priest, for as such, was he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for our offences, and as such was he raised, or brought out of prison,
so faith here, even when acting upon God, yet it is with a special relation
to Christ's Priesthood, or to his Satisfaction; for it is a Beleeving on him,
that raised up Christ Jesus, our Lord, from the dead, that is, in God as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
he hath now received full Satisfaction from the Cautioner Christ by
bringing him out of prison; &amp; consequently in that Satisfaction given by
Christ, wherewith the Father is now well pleased. See also <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 9.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 9, 10. <hi>Much more then being now justified by his blood: for if when
we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son</hi> &amp;c. As the way
is here pointed out, how justification &amp; Reconciliation was effectual by
Christ, <hi>to wit,</hi> by his Bloud &amp; Death, or by what he did &amp; suffered as
Priest &amp; Cautioner; so accordingly is our faith directed to look, in order to
a partaking of this Justification &amp; Reconciliation, especially when this is so
clearly &amp; expresly explained to us.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 33, 34. - <hi>It is God that justifieth - It is Christ that died, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that is risen againe, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
for us.</hi> All which grounds of justification belong to his Priestly
Office. And, if these be here laid down for grounds of Comfort &amp; Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
unto Beleevers, to fottifie them against all Assaults of the Accuser of
the brethren, and against all Accusations, or Condemnations of men or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils;
sure, the way is also pointed out, how faith should act, in order to
their being brought into a state of justification.</p>
               <p>5. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 19, 21. <hi>To wit God was in Christ reconciling the world unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
not imputing their trespasses unto them for he hath made him to be sin for us,
who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</hi> The way
how Reconciliation was brought about, is here set down, to the end the

wit close with him, and be in him, and be united to him, who was made
sin, for sinners, that they might be clothed with a sufficient Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

               <p>6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 16, 20. - <hi>We have beleeved in Christ, that we might be justified by

                  </gap>stified, he plainly tels us <hi>vers.</hi> 20. saying <hi>I am crucified with
Christ:</hi> thus he wan to the life of justification; by eyeing Christ on the cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
making satisfaction unto justice, and assenting unto that way, &amp; acquies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eing
in it, &amp; resting &amp; relying upon it. And in the same <hi>vers.</hi> he tels us, that
his faith by which he lived, was on the Son of God, who have himself for
him, that is, unto death.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 11, 13. <hi>The just shall live by faith.</hi> This is the Text we are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and we have cleared how this life here mentioned is the life of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
But what is the speciall object of this faith, in order to justification?
That is clearly enough pointed to <hi>vers. 13. Christ hath redeemed us from the
curse of the Law, being made a curse for us.</hi> It is Christ, &amp; Christ as Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from the Curse of the Law, &amp; that by being made a curse for us; which
only looks to his Priestly office.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Phel.</hi> 3: 9, 10, 11. <hi>Paul</hi> was desireous to be found in Christ, &amp; to be
partaker of his Righteousness alone, which was by faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what was it
in Christ, that the eye of his Faith was mainly fixed upon? He sheweth
that <hi>vers.</hi> 10: 11. <hi>That I may know him, &amp; the power of his resurrection, &amp; the
fellowship of his Sufferings, being made conformable to his death</hi> &amp;c. Christ's
Sufferings, Death &amp; Resurrection were most in his eye.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: 14, 15. <hi>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even
so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever beleeveth in him should not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
but have eternal life.</hi> The special object of faith here is Christ, as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fted
up, that is, as Crucified. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12: 32, 33.</p>
               <p>It will not be sufficient for weakening of these reasons, to say. That none
of these conclude, that faith in order to Justification, eyeth Christ as a
Priest only: for (1) They sufficiently prove, that faith in this matter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
goeth to Christ, as a Priest, and eyeth his Sacrifice, Bloud &amp;
Redemption through his death; and we are called to prove no more, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
it lyeth upon those, who are of another judgment, to shew us from
Scripture, that Faith, in order to the obtaining of justification, acteth on
Christ's Kingly office, &amp; receiveth him, as Lord. (2) We know what out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes
Papists make against the like Arguments of Protestants for justification
by faith, because it is not said, we are justified <hi>by faith alone.</hi> (3) Though
the Scriptures do not as plainly say, that faith in justification doth not in an
especiall manner eye Christ, as King &amp; Prophet; as it saith, we are not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by works; Yet we are bound to follow the light of the word, and to
regulate our conceptions, by what we finde there expressed, &amp; if we finde
not any mention made of faith in Christ's command or Government, or the
like relating to his Kingly office, as we heare of Faith in his Blood &amp; the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:104357:206"/>
like relating to his Priestly office, we may saifly judge, that the one, being
so clearly mentioned &amp; so frequently, is a denying of the other, that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> The very case &amp; condition, wherein such are, who are desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
justification, may cleare this: for they are now awakened, &amp; made
to see their natural state of death, wherein they are under the sentence of
the Law, under the Curse &amp; Malediction of God: And therefore the thing,
which their soul now seeketh after, is a sutable Reliefe, something that
may answere this case and may prove a fit Reliefe to them thus imprisoned,
&amp; in chaines, because of their Debt &amp; Transgressions: And therefore, as
all Reason requireth; so experience proveth, that these wakened sinners seek
after the Satisfaction through the Death &amp; Merites of Christ, that they
may have an Interest therein, and the benefite thereof, to the quieting of
their souls; They lay hold on the Sufferings of Christ, that they may be hid
in his wounds (as it were) that so they may be healed by his stripes; and
have a Righteousness, under which they may with confidence stand, and
appear before God; They become crucified with Christ, sweetly acquies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceing
in, resting satisfied with, contentedly accepting of, and confidently
resting &amp; relying upon, his Merites, his Death, his Payment &amp; Sntisfaction
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> justice. Seing then, that this (as experience proveth) is the way, that
pursued souls take, to refuge themselves under a Crucified Christ, to flee to
his Death &amp; Merites, this, or Christ as a Priest dying &amp; paying the debt,
must be the special Object of the Faith of an hunted soul, panting after justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
or freedom from Condemnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Christ's other Offices, as his Kingly, or Prophetical office, do
not hold him forth, as immediatly sutable unto souls under this pressure;
nor is there any thing properly belonging to these offices, that promiseth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat
Reliefe unto a Soul, in this case, seeking after Reconciliation with
God, &amp; Pardon of sinners, which is only had by Christ's Death &amp; Bloud
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 9, 10. &amp; 3: 25. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 14. Christ by his Kingly or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
office, doth not act towards God, in the behalfe of sinners, but by
his Priestsly office he doth <hi>Heb.</hi> 5: 1, 5, 6, 7. And it is after this, that poor
sinners, pursued with the sense of wrath, do seek, &amp; this can only give pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
&amp; futable Reliefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> The Faith of Beleevers under the sense of sin &amp; guilt, under the
Law, was thus led to act on the promised Messiah, when he was typified
unto them by their Sacrifices, &amp; they were to put their hands on the head
of the Sacrifice, thereby, rolling their sin &amp; guilt upon the Sacrifice, or on
Him rather, who was the true Sacrifice, represented by these outward Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
&amp; thereby professing their Faith in Him, as the only Satisfying
Sacrifice, that could make Atonement, &amp; Pacifie an angrie God, &amp; deliver
them from wrath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> Christ is held forth, as having taken an these different offices, and
as to shew his being a full &amp; compleet mediator, able to answere all our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s authorized to give forth sutable reliefe; so to instruct us how
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp; to act faith upon him sutabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, with hope &amp; confidence,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:104357:206"/>
Therefore as he is a King to subdue Enemies, the faith of his people is to act
upon him, as such, when they would have their spiritual Enemies subdued;
&amp; as He is a Prophet to teach, the faith of his people must act upon him, as
such, when they would have Light, Counsel &amp; Direction; so, as He is a
Priest to Die, Satisfie, make Atonement, Reconciliation &amp; Peace, their
Faith is to act upon him, as such, when they would have Guilt removed,
&amp; Peace made up betwixt God, &amp; their souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly.</hi> The end &amp; designe of asserting Christ, as King to be as specially
the Object of Faith, in Justification, as is Christ, as Priest, may sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
render it suspicious; for it is, as we touched above, to bring-in <hi>our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
as distinct from Faith, or as included in it, to be the Condition of
Justification, the same manner of way, that Faith is: though, as was clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
above, the consequence will not be fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d good. The reall question
here (as is well observed by others) is not, whether any thing of Christ,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to be excluded from being the Object of Justifying Faith. But what, in
and of our selves, under the name of Receiving Christ as King, is to
be admitted to share with Faith, in its place and interest, in our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly.</hi> To say, that faith acteth, in order to justification, in as spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
a manner, on Christ as a King, as on Christ as a Priest, is to alter the
Nature, Use &amp; Ends of Faith, in this work &amp; to give it the Place &amp; Power
of a proper potestative condition, as it is a vertue &amp; work of ours; &amp; not
to look upon it as bringing all sutable supplies, in a distinct manner, from
Christ, as was shown above: and this is but sutable to that alteration of the
Nature of the New Covenant, that is made by the asserters of this, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is of the same specifick nature with the Old Covenant of Works; as if
it were no more, but a new Edition thereof, with some alterations, as to
the Conditions.</p>
               <p>Let us now see, what <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> saith to the contrary, in his <hi>Catholick
Theol.</hi> p. 2. of <hi>moral works</hi> Sect. 7. p. 55. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He tels us (n. 105.) <hi>That to be justified by faith in</hi> Paul's <hi>sence, is all one
as to be justified by</hi> becoming Christians. <hi>Ans.</hi> We grant, with him, that
to be a <hi>Believer,</hi> a <hi>Disciple,</hi> and a <hi>Christian,</hi> are all one, in the Gospel sense,
&amp; that by the same Faith, by which one is justified, he is a Christian also:
but this proveth not, that Faith, in order to justification, acteth not, in a
special manner, on Christ, as a Priest; and we have found, how <hi>Paul</hi> both
in his Doctrine, and in his own Practice, explaineth the acting of Faith in
Justification. This may serve for an answere also to what he saith (n. 106.)
to wit, <hi>that the faith, by which we are justified is essentially a beleeving fiducial
consent to our Covenant relation to God the Father, Son &amp; Holy Ghost:</hi> for we grant,
that it is but one &amp; the same Faith, which doth all this, but yet this Faith
may be conceived, as acting in a peculiar manner in order to justification.
We grant also, that it is the <hi>same faith,</hi> by which we have Right to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
of the Covenant, &amp; by which we are justified; Yet we say, that
in order to Justification, that same Faith, which receiveth whole Christ,
and thereby a Right to the benefites of the Covenant, acteth in a peculiar
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:104357:207"/>
manner on Christ, as Priest, in order to Justification.</p>
               <p>He tels us next (n. 108.) <hi>That the faith by which we are justified, hath God
the Father for its object, as essentially, as Christ the Saviour. Ans.</hi> And we do
not deny God the Father to be the Object of that Faith, by which we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.
And will he say, that Faith in God without Christ will justifie a
sinner, or that there is any beleeving in God the Father now, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
also in Christ? The places he citeth <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17: 3. &amp; 13: 1. shew the
contrary. <hi>Adam's</hi> Faith indeed was such before the fall; but our Faith now
must be of another kinde. It is to as little purpose for him to say (n. 109.)
<hi>That it is as essential to this faith to beleeve in Christ, as the Purchaser of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
&amp; heaven, as to beleeve in him, as the purchaser of pardon:</hi> For he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all as a Priest, &amp; not as a Prophet or King &amp; when faith acteth on him,
as a purchaser, it acteth on him, as a Priest. But he addeth. <hi>And to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
in him, as the Teacher &amp; Ruler of the Church, as to beleeve in him, as the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifier
of beleevers.</hi> True because beleeving in him, as a Ruler, &amp; belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in him as the justifier of beleevers, are both to beleeve in him, as a
King: And this is not the thing that is denied, Beleeving in Christ, as the
justifier of beleevers, is not the same with beleeving in him, as a Priest, in
order to justification, which is the thing, he should have said here, if he
would have spoken to the purpose.</p>
               <p>What he saith (n. 110.) concerning Faith's being the act of the whole
soul, &amp; having for its object God, the Father, Son &amp; Holy Ghost &amp; in
Christ, all that is essential to him, as a Saviour, was granted, &amp; asserted
also by us formerly: but it maketh nothing to our present question. He tels
us (n. 111.) <hi>That to say, that some one only of these parts of Christ's office, as
they are</hi> conceptus inadaequati <hi>of a Saviour, is the only object of justifying faith
or that by beleeving in Christ, as our Teacher &amp; Ruler, as well as Priest, &amp; as a
Iustifying judge, as well as a justifying Sacrifice, and as a fulfiller of the Law,
is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>xpect justification by works, as</hi> Paul <hi>denyeth it. This is a vaine distinguis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing,
a falsifying the doctrine of Faith &amp; Iustification, a departing from the
Scripture simplicity by corrupting seeming subtility, &amp; one of those humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which have wronged the Church. Ans.</hi> These, are but angry words, &amp;
carry with them no force of reason: And who is most guilty of vaine distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
&amp; of falsifying the doctrine of Faith &amp; Justification &amp;c. he, or
such as he opposeth in this matter, indifferent persons are at freedom to jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge:
And whether his new Doctrine, or the old, which he so violently, in
all his writtings, oppugneth, hath more of seeming subtility in it, to the
wronging of the Church, in its peace &amp; quiet, every one may judge by
the effects. But as to the matter in hand, he may know (1) that there is a
difference betwixt saying, that some one only part of Christ's office is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
object of justifying Faith (as he here speak) &amp; sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing; that faith (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
adaequate object is confessed to be as large, as he himself doth make it)
in order to a souls justification, acteth in special manner on Christ as a Priest,
not excluding Christ as a King, or as a Prophet, but rather including who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
Christ, according to the manner above mentioned, (which is the thing
we say.) (2) Where readeth he of Faith in Christ (in order to justification)
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:104357:207"/>
as our Teacher, or Ruler or Justifying judge, or justifying Sacrifice? He
should remember what he said (n. 107.) when speaking against the Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
<hi>justifying faith,</hi> &amp; <hi>faith justifying us,</hi> as being humane, &amp; not Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
at all. (3) Indeed beleeving in Christ as Teacher &amp; Ruler &amp;c, in our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
cannot inferre justification by works: but he knoweth, that it was for
this end, to bring Works in with Faith, as equal Conditions, or parts of
one Condition of Justification, that this new question was stated by him, in
his <hi>Aphorismes;</hi> And whether such doctrine be consonant to <hi>Paul's</hi> or not, we
have seen in part above.</p>
               <p>He addeth (n. 112.) <hi>That it is but the same deluding subtilty, &amp; vaine cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity,
playing with deceitful words, to say, that we are justified by faith,</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus
recipit Christ justitiam, <hi>as it beleeveth in Christ's Sacrifice &amp; perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
only; &amp; not as it beleeveth in him, as Teacher &amp; Ruler, Sanctifier, judge.
when the Scripture saith no such thing at all, but simply maketh</hi> faith in Christ,
(<hi>supposing faith</hi> in God the Father) <hi>to be that, by which we must be justified.
Ans.</hi> We minde not to be startled at his bold &amp; angry expressions, for we
meet with them so oft. Whether the Scripture warrandeth us to say, what
we have said, or not, the Reader is at liberty to judge, from what is said.
And we have nothing here yet said by him, to prove, that we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Faith in Christ, as Teacher, or Ruler, which is it we are looking
for here.</p>
               <p>More of this Stuffe we have (n. 113.) <hi>This distinction</hi> (saith he) <hi>is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on another falshood supposed, which is that the effects of all Christ's saving
works, are as distinctly to be ascribed to Receiving acts of faith, as they are to the
the several procuring acts of Christ, the object of Faith, which is another corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
addition to God's word. Ans.</hi> Who it is that saith so, as to all the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
effects, I know not; Nor do I see any necessity to say so; as to some, &amp;
in special, as to Justification, we but follow the Scripture, going before
us, as is shown. And we make no addition; but he is the man, that is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
guilty of adding to God's word, in this pointe; for he saith, that faith,
in order to justification, acteth not only in a special manner on Christ, as
Priest (which is the truth, we say, and owne with the Scriptures) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
on Christ, as a King, and as a Prophet, &amp; as a judge; &amp; yet giveth us
us not one passage of Scripture to confirme this, but thinks we must be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with his assertions, subtile distinctions, vaine &amp; curious expressions,
answering his own Philosophical Notions, with which he seemeth to be
much taken, and we very little. What followeth there, I have nothing to
do with.</p>
               <p>He hath a large discourse of various <hi>Receivings</hi> (n. 114. 115.) to what
purpose, as to the business, we are now upon, I do not well see; yet let us
see, how he endeth it, <hi>God's Covenant</hi> (saith he) <hi>doth give us Christ &amp; life,
that is, Iustification, Sanctification, &amp; Glorification, in title or right, in one
gift, to be accepted by one entire faith, as the Condition; not making at all, the
order of the gifts &amp; faiths respect to them in that order, to be any of the</hi> Ratio Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis.
<hi>Ans.</hi> (1) Will he not distinguish betwixt having of these benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
in <hi>Title</hi> or <hi>Right,</hi> &amp; having them in possession? He must, sure, or he
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:104357:208"/>
must say, that beleevers are already perfectly Sanctified, and Glorified.
(2) Will he say, that there is no more required to the actual Possession of
Glory &amp; full Sanctification, than here he saith is required unto the <hi>Title?</hi>
But it is like, he will comprehend under this Faith, all after Gospel-obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce;
But then, all this must preceed to justification &amp;c. as well as to actual
Glorification, &amp; so none shall be justified, till they be Glorified, or he must
admit of differences here. (3) As notwithstanding of what he saith here, he
will, I suppose, grant that Faith hath a Further &amp; special acting or manner
of acting on Christ, in order to obtaining of Light, Life, Strength, and
other things necessary in &amp; for grouth in Sanctification; so he may suffer us
to say, that notwithstanding of this, Faith in a special manner eyeth &amp;
acteth upon Christ, as a Priest, in order to justification; for there is no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
inconsistency in the one, than in the other.</p>
               <p>The humane instances, whereby he thinks to make this plainer (n. 116.)
do not help here. <hi>A wifes relation</hi> (saith he) <hi>is founded in her marriage consent.
Now if he be a noble man, a rich man, a wise man, a good man, &amp; they knew all
this, &amp; by knowing it were induced to consent, &amp; are to have their proportionable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
by his Nobility, Riches &amp;c. Yet their Title to these benefites ariseth not from
the act of their consent, as it respecteth these benefites distinctly, but meerly by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto their Relation. Ans.</hi> Notwithstanding hereof, when the woman is
charged by her Creditors to pay her debt, her running to her husbands Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Nobility, &amp; Goodness will not avail her; but she must in a special
manner run to his Riches &amp; must from thence bring a Satisfactory payment
unto her Creditors: And if he, whom she hath taken for her husband,
hath already satisfied the debt, she is to instruct that before the judges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom her alleidging, that her now-husband is a great Noble man, and
a most Wise man &amp;c. will not avail. We grant also, that by Faith the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
is united &amp; married unto Christ &amp; hath thereby a Right, unto Him,
&amp; to all his Benefites, according to their necessity: Yet will the Lord have,
that, in order to their actual justification, they shall apply his Merites, lay
hold thereon, &amp; as it were, produce the same in face of Court, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ground of their Discharge: as in order to their actual Glorification, he
will have them doing many other things.</p>
               <p>In end (n. 117.) he tels us, that <hi>to say</hi> [<hi>faith</hi> justifieth me, as it is the
receiving of Christ's Righteousness, &amp; not as it is the receiving of Christ,
as a Teacher, Ruler] &amp;c. <hi>is a confounding or seducing saying.</hi> But as yet we
have seen no strong reasons evinceing this to be such a seducing or confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
saying: but the contrary is apparent from what is said. Let us see why
he judgeth thus. For (sayeth he) <hi>if it intimate, that</hi> faith justifieth <hi>us as
an efficient cause,</hi> [<hi>principal or instrumental</hi>] <hi>it is false.</hi> But we have seen
before, that faith may be considered here as an Instrument, &amp; to say this, is
neither to confound nor seduce: otherwayes all the Reformed, yea &amp; his
friend <hi>Iohn Goodwine</hi> have been Confounders &amp; deceivers, &amp; none but <hi>Mr.

2. (saith he) <hi>If it meane, that</hi> faith <hi>is the</hi> condition of justification, <hi>as</hi>
it receiveth Christ's Righteousness only, <hi>it hath either one or two falshoods.</hi>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:104357:208"/>
We only say, that in order to the obtaining of justification, Faith acteth in
a peculiar manner on Christ's Righteousness &amp; Merites, &amp; conceive that in
this, there is neither one, nor two falshoods, 1. (saith he) <hi>if it mean that
faiths receiving act is the</hi> formalis ratio conditionis, <hi>or that it justifieth not</hi> quà
conditio donationis, <hi>but</hi> qua receptio justitiae Christ, <hi>it is false. Ans.</hi> We are
not here speaking precisely of the <hi>formalis ratio conditionis,</hi> in such a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Notion: for we say, that Faith in order to Justification, receiveth
Christ's Righteousness; &amp; that the Lord hath so appointed. Let Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
break their heads on these <hi>rationes formales,</hi> &amp; the <hi>qua's</hi> &amp; <hi>quae's;</hi> we
speak of this matter, so as every soul concerned may understand it. <hi>And
then</hi> (saith he) 2. <hi>that</hi> [only the Accepting of Righteousness justifieth us,
<hi>that is,</hi> is the condition of justification] <hi>is a falshood.</hi> This he should have
proved to have been a falshood: but in all this discourse of this, we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
had nothing like a proof, only confident Assertions, &amp; that in great
number.</p>
               <p>But in his <hi>Confession pag.</hi> 35. where he hath the same discourse for substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
he citeth several passages of Scripture, on the margine, as if they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
confirmations of what he saith: And yet not one of them cometh home
to the point in hand, as a short view may discover. For <hi>Col.</hi> 2: 6. proveth
what we deny not, to wit, that Beleevers receive Christ Jesus the Lord:
We have shown above, that whole Christ belongeth to the Object of Faith
that is Justifying: but we are here speaking of the special acting of that faith,
in order to Justification. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2: 12. only proveth, that such shall perish, as
do not kisse &amp; submit, to the Son &amp; that kissing &amp; submitting unto him, is
required in order to being saved. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11: 28, 29. saith, that such as would
have rest &amp; ease, that is freedom from sin &amp; misery here &amp; hereafter, must
come to Christ, &amp; take his yoke upon them, &amp; Learne of him: And in
order to that particular rest &amp; ease, had in Justification, we say also, that
they must come to Christ, &amp; take on his Righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>HAving spoken of <hi>Iustification,</hi> as to its beginning, or as to a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
entering into that State of Life: &amp; having spoken to some Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
for further clearing of the truth: We come to speak a word
or two of the Continuance of this Privilege &amp; State: That it is a continueing
and permanent State, we have seen above. The Question then, that we
have to discuss, is, Upon what termes &amp; Conditions is this State conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued?
or what is it, which the Lord requireth in order thereunto? or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any thing more be required of us for continueing this Relation than
was at first required to the making of it? that is, whether Faith alone, or
Faith together with Works of sincere obedience, <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Confess,</hi>
p. 47, n. 40. tels us, that <hi>there is much more goeth to the continuing &amp; consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
our Iustification, then doth at first to justifie us as to the condition on our
parts, to be performed to that end:</hi> This <hi>Continueing of our State of Iustification,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Not-losing of it,</hi> he maketh one &amp; the same, and that, which he requireth,
as necessary unto the Not-losing or Continueing of this State, he maketh to
be <hi>Sincere obedience,</hi> &amp; <hi>many particular materials of that obedience, as to be
humble, to forgive others, to confess Christ, &amp; suffer for him, if called to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That we may know both the State of the difference, &amp; the Consequence
thereof, we would premit these things.</p>
               <p>1. It is readily &amp; on all hands granted &amp; yeelded unto, that there is an
Holiness &amp; Personal Obedience &amp; Conformity to the Law, called for at the
hands of all Justified persons, that are come to age: The denial therefore of
what <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> &amp; others, that joyn with him, do here assert, cannot, with
any shew of reason, be loaded with this foule inference, that hereby we
cry down, or lay aside all necessity of Holiness, &amp; of sincere obedience: for
we still affirme that the Law is in force, &amp; obligeth unto obedience, and
that all such as are justified, have received a new frame &amp; disposition of soul,
inclineing them to obedience; Yea &amp; that they have now both peculiar
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:104357:209"/>
Obligations unto Holiness, and also Advantages &amp; Helps thereunto: They
are his wormanship created in Christ Jesus unto Good Works, which God
hath before ordained, that they should walk in them <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 10.</p>
               <p>2. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tels us <hi>Confess.</hi> p. 102. that it is <hi>his strong opinion, &amp; that he is
confident of it, that no justified person shall ever lose his justification; &amp; that God
hath promised to cause them persevere.</hi> This State then is not to be compared
with other States, which are losable &amp; changeable among men: nor can we
with such freedome speak of Conditions of not loseing that, which is fully
secured from all loseing; as we may speak of the Conditions of keeping &amp;
Not-loseing that, which may be &amp; oft is lost. We can not then speak of the
State of Justification, as we do of Marriage betwixt man &amp; woman: here
there may be &amp; are indeed Conditions required of each part, in order to
the keeping up of the Relation, &amp; they may be called Conditions of not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seing
that Relation or Privilege: But as to justification, which is not so lose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
to speak of Conditions of not loseing it, may occasion Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in the mindes of men of its being losable. It were saifer then, in my
apprehension, to enquire how or what way is this State &amp; Relation conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued?
or what is required on our part, in order thereunto? then to enquire?
what are the Conditions of Not-loseing this State?</p>
               <p>3. Seing <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> granteth <hi>Confess.</hi> p. 109. that no new sin destroyeth
their State of Justification, nor maketh them cease to be God's reconciled
Children, seing they are still united unto Christ, and have his Spirit, and
have Faith &amp; Repentance, (at least as to the habit) &amp; (<hi>pag.</hi> 129.) That
the habite of Faith &amp; Repentance, which is ever in them, qualifieth them
for present Remission of ordinary sins of infirmity, at least: And it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable,
that the Lord's Spirit preserveth them from such sins as are inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with a State of Justification, or that make an intercision in that State,
&amp; consequently in their Adoption &amp; Union with Christ: seing, I say, all
this is granted, to what purpose is such a question as this here moved and
stated, anent the Conditions of Not-loseing this state?</p>
               <p>4. The terme <hi>Condition</hi> here is taken in the same sense, that it was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in, when the question was about the Condition of our first entry into
the State of Justification: and so they must take it here for a proper legal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
Potestative condition: for if by <hi>condition</hi> here were meaned no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
than a mere Consequent Evangelick Condition: the question only would
be. What is the Lord's Way, Methode &amp; Manner, how &amp; by which he
preserveth his own, in that State of Justification? But, according to their
acceptation of the word <hi>condition,</hi> the question really cometh to this, What
that is, which beleevers betake themselves unto, &amp; which they can, may, &amp;
should plead with God upon, for the continuance of their state, that is, of
their Reconciliation unto, &amp; Acceptance with God, of the Pardon of their
sins, &amp; Right to glory?</p>
               <p>5. The question is not, what is the Condition, or what is required on
our part for keeping the sense &amp; evidence of our justification in our own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Consciences: many things may be useful herein, that yet cannot be called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Conditions of the Continuance, or Not-loseing of Iustification: But the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:104357:210"/>
Iustification here spoken of, is that which is before God, whereby the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
is indeed brought into a State of Peace &amp; Reconciliation with God,
&amp; hath obtained a Right unto the Inheritance of Life.</p>
               <p>6. When we speak here of the continuance, or Not-loseing of Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Iustification spoken of must be that State or Relation, where into
the Beleever is already brought: for that only can be said to be continued,
while we are living, and that only can be said properly to be losed, or Not-losed,
which a man hath: These seeme then to be two distinct questions,
What is the Condition of our final Absolution in Iudgment; &amp; what is the
Condition of the continuance of our justification here; which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
seemeth to confound <hi>Confess.</hi> p. 83. as the <hi>Papists</hi> do confound their second
justification with the last judgment, when they are pleading for works, being
required as the causes thereof.</p>
               <p>7. Though, as we have seen before, Iustification importeth more than
Remission of sins; Yet in this question of the Condition of the Continuance
of Justification, the matter seemeth to be brought to this issue; whether
works of Obedience be the Condition of future Remission of sins, in the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.
And though these may be conceived of, as distinct questions, yet
the clearing of the way of the Remission of future sins, may serve much to
cleare the present Question; for if it befound, that the same course is taken
for Remission of future sins, that was taken at first, it will be manifest, that
justification is continued upon the same termes, or in the same manner, that
it was at first obtained, if properly we can speak at all of the Conditions of
its Continuance.</p>
               <p>Having premitted these things, the Question is, Whether faith alone, or
works alone, or faith with works, are the condition required on our part,
for the Continuance, or not-loseing of the state of justification? And I jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
as faith alone was required at first, in order to justification, so that alone
is to be called the Condition of the continuance of justification: or that the
Condition both of our first installing in that state of justification, &amp; of the
Continuance of the Privilege, or of Beleevers continueing in that state, is
the same grace of Faith. Yet these two things would be noted. 1. That
though the first act of Faith in Christ, doth suffice to the entering of a soul
into the state of justification; Yet we do not meane, that that one first, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie,
&amp; numerical act sufficeth for all time coming, albeit it sufficeth for
making up of the Relation, according to the appointment of God; for the
same Faith is to continue in its habite; Yea &amp; in its actings. So that we sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
not the Question so strickly, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> seemeth to do, <hi>Confess.</hi> p. 47.
when from the Continuance of the habite of Faith, &amp; from the renewing
acts of that Faith, required after the first act of Faith, he inferreth, that
much more goeth to the continueing of our justification, than doth at first
justifie us. But our question is about the addition of <hi>sincere Obedience</hi> which
he there mentioneth. 2. When we suppose the Continuance of Faith, not
only as to its habite, but as to its renewed actings; we do not suppose, that
the actings &amp; Effects, or Concomitans of Faith afterward, are every way
the same, with what they were at first; so that we may also yeeld to this
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:104357:210"/>
difference, &amp; grant that some thing more may be requisite afterward, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
in order to the Remission of some hainous sin, in the acting of
Faith, or in the Effects or Concomitants thereof, at least as to measure,
or outward significations, <hi>to wit,</hi> in Godly sorrow, Humiliation, Forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of others, Restitution, or the like; &amp; yet it will still remaine true,
that justification is continued by Faith, &amp; not by Works.</p>
               <p>For the proof of what we conceive to be truth, we lay down these grounds,
both from Scripture &amp; Reason; as</p>
               <p>1. The words of the Text, whereupon we are, do evince this: for it is
said, <hi>the just liveth by Faith:</hi> And, as was cleared at the beginning of our
discourse, the words, as used by the Prophet <hi>Habbakuk,</hi> from whom they
are cited, are spoken of such, as were already Beleevers &amp; Justified; and
pointed out the way, how they were to have a life, in an evil time; and
how they were to continue, or be keeped in that State of Favoure with God,
whereinto they were brought; to wit by Faith; for <hi>the just shall live by his
Faith;</hi> and accordingly the same words are cited by the Apostle <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 38,
39. <hi>Now the just shall live by faith; but if any man draw back, my soul shall
have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them, that draw back, unto perdition,
but of them that beleeve to the saving of the soul.</hi> Where living by Faith is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to drawing back, <hi>to wit,</hi> through unbeleefe; and as drawing back is
unto perdition, so beleeving is to the saving of the soul; &amp; therefore the
Continuation of this life of justification unto the end, even unto the final
Salvation of the soul, is by Faith. This life of justification, as it is begun
by Faith (as the Apostle evinceth <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: 17. and in our present Text citing
in both places these same words, for that end) so it is continued by Faith,
as the only condition thereof. And to say, that the particle <hi>only</hi> is not here
added; &amp; therefore, other Works of Obedience must be, or may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
here, in this matter, notwithstanding it be said, <hi>the just liveth by
Faith,</hi> were in effect to destroy the Apostles Argument, in our Text, where
he useth this same expression, without the addition of <hi>only,</hi> to prove, that
we are not justified by the works of the Law. Therefore, as this assertion,
that the <hi>just liveth by faith,</hi> proveth justification by faith without the works
of the Law; so the same proveth the Continuation of Justification, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the works of the Law, as the Condition thereof.</p>
               <p>2. The Grounds &amp; Causes of Justification, mentioned by the Apostle
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 22, 24, 25, 26. hold good als well in the Continuation, as in the
first beginning of justification; for there, as well as here, the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God without the Law is manifested, even the Righteousness of God,
which is by Faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all them, that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve;
for there is no difference. Justification first &amp; lastly is free by his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
through the Redemption, that is in Iesus Christ, whom God hath set
fort to be a Propitiation, through faith in his blood. And there is not
the least hint given, that the matter is altered, in the Continuation of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</p>
               <p>3. As the beginning of justification is so contrived, as all boasting is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, so must the Continnance thereof be conceived to be? But if
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:104357:211"/>
works be admitted, as Conditions of the Continuance of Instification,
though they be denied to be the Condition of the Beginning thereof, all
boasting shall not be excluded, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 27. for if a sinner, after
that he is Iustified by the merite of Christ, at first, should have it to say,
that for the Continuance of his justification, he were beholden to his own
Works, he should surely have matter of boasting in himself, in so far at
least. <hi>Papists</hi> think to evite this Argument against their Second Iustification
by works, by saving that all these good works are not of themselves, but
of the Father of Lights. But this shift will not help, for all these works
are not the Righteousness of Christ, but are works of Righteousness, which
we do, &amp; are excluded in this matter, as occasioning boasting, or giving
ground thereunto; as the next Argument will more fully cleare.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Abraham</hi> is said to have Righteousness imputed unto him, &amp; Faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
unto Righteousness, and so to be justified by faith, not only when he
was first justified, but many yeers after, even when he offered up <hi>Isaac</hi> his
son. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. &amp; <hi>Iam.</hi> 2: 21, 23. So was he justified first &amp; last, as, to have
no ground of glorying, and therefore not by works. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 1, 3, 4. But
it will be said, that the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> saith expresly, in the place cited,
that our father <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by works, when he had offered his
Son <hi>Isaac</hi> on the Altar. I <hi>Ans.</hi> Not to engage in the whole explication &amp;
vindication of that Passage of Scripture here, which is of late to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
&amp; most satisfyingly done by the learned Doctor <hi>Owen;</hi> I only say,
that <hi>Abraham's</hi> being justified by works, was such, as thereby the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
was fulfilled; which saith, <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved God, and it was imputed
unto him for Righteousness &amp;c. <hi>vers.</hi> 23. Now if <hi>Abraham</hi> had been justified
by works, properly so taken, the Scripture had not been fulfilled, which
said, he was justified by Faith, but the contrary had been made good, <hi>to
wit,</hi> that works were imputed to him, &amp; he was justified by them, as by
his Righteousness. But the meaning is, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by faith,
a true faith, that proved itself such, in time of a trial, by works of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
&amp; particularly by obedience to that command, whereby the Lord
tried or tempted him <hi>Gen.</hi> 22: 1, 2. and by such a Faith as wrought with his
works, &amp; was perfected, or discovered &amp; manifested to be real, after the
trial of the fire. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2: 22. It is a good direction that the learned <hi>Camero</hi>
giveth here <hi>Op. fol. pag.</hi> 83. That we should hóld fast the scope of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>Iames,</hi> &amp; to this end, that we should take notice of the Apostles Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of the Conclusion thereof. The Proposition is set down <hi>vers.</hi> 14.
<hi>What doth it profite, my brethren, though a man say he, hath faith, &amp; have not
works, can faith,</hi> (or <hi>that</hi> faith) <hi>save him.</hi> Whereby we see, that the
Apostles scope is to prove, that that Faith, which the man supposeth he hath,
who hath no works, is not that Faith, by which we are Justified &amp; saved; &amp;
that because it is unprofitable to poor indigent brethren, in necessity <hi>vers.</hi> 15.
16. is dead <hi>vers.</hi> 17. 20, it can not be shown by works <hi>vers.</hi> 18. it is a Faith
that devils have <hi>vers.</hi> 19. All which &amp; what followeth is cleared from the
Conclusion <hi>vers. 26. for as the body without the Spirit is dead, so faith with works
is dead also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:104357:211"/>
5. It will alwayes hold true, that God is he who justifieth the ungodly
&amp; so justifieth him, that worketh not, but him to whom saith is counted
for Righteousness. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 5. But if the Continuance of Justification were
by works; &amp; works were counted for Righteoulness, in order to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of justification; God should not continue to be the justifier of the
ungodly: but should justifie the ungodly at first, &amp; thereafter justifie the
Godly; whereof the Text giveth not the least hint.</p>
               <p>6. The Instance of <hi>David</hi> cleareth this also <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7, 8. for <hi>David</hi> is
there <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. speaking of himself, long after he was first justified, and yet
his words saying, <hi>blessed are they, whose iniquities are forgiven &amp;c.</hi> prove Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by faith, without the works of the Law (which is the Apostles sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,
&amp; the end, for which he adduceth this prove; and we must not think,
that any of his probations are impertinent) but this they could not prove,
if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ontinuance of justification were by works, &amp; not by Faith only; as
is manifest; for who can inferre, that the beginning of Justification is by
Faith alone, from this, that the continuance of justification is by works?
but when the Continuance of Justification is by Faith alone, it followeth
manifestly, that the beginning of it must be by faith alone. Yea, it is hence
also manifest, that Pardon of sins committed after Justification, is not had
by works, but by the imputation of Righteousness, without works, for
saith <hi>Paul, David describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth
Righteousness, without works:</hi> And how did <hi>David</hi> describe this? When he
said, <hi>blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Paul tels us <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 2. that as by Christ, we have access by Faith into
grace, so in the same we stand, &amp; rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
Access into this grace must import the State of Justification, &amp; as this is by
Faith, so is the standing &amp; abiding therein; and consequently, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of Justification: and there is no word of works here at all, in this
whole affaire.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Paul</hi> likewise confirmeth this, in his own Experience <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 20. where
he tels us, how, and what way he lived unto God, being dead to the Law,
to wit <hi>by the Faith of the Son of God:</hi> and as this was true of the life of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:
so much more of the life of justification, both as begun &amp; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued;
for the whole life of a Christian, now crucified with Christ, &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
unto God, is here spoke to: And this is in opposition to the works of
the Law, as is cleare from <hi>vers,</hi> 16. &amp; from the following <hi>vers.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>8. The same is confirmed by the doctrine of the Apostle <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 8, 9, 10.
<hi>for by grace are ye saved, through faith - not of works lest any man should boast:
for we are his workmanship, created in Christ Iesus, unto good works, which
God hath before ordained, that we should walk in them.</hi> This Salvation taketh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
both the Beginning, Continuance &amp; End of our life, of Justification;
&amp; all this is by Faith alone, &amp; expresly it is said, not to be by works, and
that, lest any man should boast (which confirmeth our <hi>third</hi> argument) &amp;
these works are works of Gospel-obedience, and he tels us of another end
&amp; use of these, than to be the Condition of the Continuance of our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
even to be the way we should walk in, according to the fore-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:104357:212"/>
of God, and carry as his workmanshipe, created thereunto.</p>
               <p>9. We have the Apostles own practice againe set before us, to cleare this
matter <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9. where he tels us, what was his maine designe &amp; work,
not at first only, when he was Justified; but long thereafter, to shew what
was his constant designe, &amp; should be to the end; even labour to be found
in Christ, renuncing his own Righteousness, and to seek to be hid under &amp;
covered with that Righteousness, which is through the faith of Christ, &amp;
which is of God by Faith: So that, as he beleeved in Jesus Christ, that he
might be justified by the Faith of Christ, and not by the works of the Law.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 16. So here he sheweth, that he will continue in this exercise to
the end.</p>
               <p>10. We may adde to these, that passage of <hi>Paul. Tit.</hi> 3: 5, 6, 7. <hi>Not by
works of Righteousness, which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved
us</hi> (and this Salvation, sure, will take-in the Continuation of justification)
<hi>by the washing of regeneration, &amp; renewing of the holy Ghest; which he shed on us
abundantly, through Iesus Christ, our Lord: that being Iustified by his grace,
we should be made heirs, according to the hope of eternal life.</hi> And when he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>Titus</hi> in the following <hi>verse,</hi> to affirme, that they which have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in God, may be careful to maintaine good works, as being good &amp;
profitable unto men; he addeth nothing of their being the Condition of the
Continuance of our justification, as sure, he had a faire occasion to do, if
the matter were so: but he had fully excluded them from all interest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>vers.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>We may adde to these a few Reasons.</p>
               <p>1. Is it not considerable, in this point, that <hi>Paul</hi> speaking so frequently
&amp; disputing at such a length of justification &amp; clearing so many things about
it; Yet, in all his discourses thereupon, he never mentioneth this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(to wit works of obedience) of its continuance. And, which is also
considerable, though he oftentimes press to holiness, &amp; useth many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to that end; Yet he never maketh mention of this place &amp; office it
hath, in &amp; about the Continuance of justification; which sure, is supposed
by the Assertors, to be a mighty argument unto the constant exercise of
Holiness.</p>
               <p>2. We have proved above, that justification at first is by the Imputation
of the Righteousness of Christ, received by faith; and we have shown, that
Faith in Justification specially eyeth the Righteousness of Christ, &amp; resteth
thereupon. If then our personal Obedience be brought in to be the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Continuance of Justification, Christ's Righteousness is quite laid
aside from having any Further interest therein, and the Beleever is never,
after the first time, to act faith upon the Righteousness of Christ; and the
reason is, because works do not act so upon the Righteousness of Christ, as
Faith doth; neither have they that capacity to do so. But how absurd is it to
think or say, that the Beleever hath no more to do with Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
And how contrary is it to the fixed resolution of <hi>Paul Phil.</hi> 3: 9. And
how inconsistent with the whole scope of the Gospel, which is the power
of God unto Salvation to every one that beleeveth, and wherein is the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:104357:212"/>
Righteousness of God revealad from faith to faith, as it is written, the just
shall live by faith <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: 16, 17? If it be said, That this cannot militate
against such, as take-in Faith with works. I <hi>Ans.</hi> It will militate against
such; for works cannot act upon the Righteousness of Christ, as faith doth;
&amp; therefore if faith &amp; works concurre as conditions, in one &amp; the same
manner, Faith is not here considered, as acting on the Righteousness
of Christ, but only as a work, &amp; another moral vertue: and so the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ is quite excluded.</p>
               <p>3. Beleevers by Faith in Christ, are compleatly justified, as to their sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
&amp; have all their bygone iniquities pardoned, and they are accepted as
children in his Favour <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 12, they are made heirs of God &amp; joynt heirs
with Christ <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 17, and are discharged (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> granteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>Confess.</hi> p. 102. <hi>Concl.</hi> 9.) from all guilt of Eternal Punishment, yea &amp;
of all destructive Punishment in this life. Yea they are justified from all
things, from which they could not be justified by the Law <hi>Act.</hi> 13: 39.
They are blessed <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 5, 6. And all this is so fixed, that none can lay
any thing to their charge <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 33, 34. Yea they are said to have Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5: 24. Now, seing all this is by Faith: what necessitie is
there for another Condition, beside this same Faith, keeping fast by
Christ, unto the Continuance of this State? If it be said, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
hereof, they are liable to future sins, and these must also be
forgiven; and in reference to the Pardon of these, other Conditions may
be required, &amp; in that respect, these may be called Conditions of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of Justification.</p>
               <p>4. The answere to this will furnish us with another Argument; for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
therefore I say. That works are not the Condition of Pardon of after
sins, but faith going to Christ, and washing in his bloud 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2: 1, 2. <hi>If
any man sin, we have an advocat with the Father, Iesus Christ the Righteous, &amp;
he is the propitiation for our sins.</hi> Christ is here proposed to sinning beleevers,
in his Priestly office, as the object of their Faith, in order to Pardon: And
<hi>Mr.Baxter,</hi> in the forecited place <hi>Concl.</hi> 11 saith, that <hi>when ever the Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
do commit any sin, they have a present &amp; effectual certaine remedie at hand for
their pardon, that is, the merit of Christ's blood, &amp; his Intercession, the Love
of God, the Promise of Pardon, in which they have interest, &amp; the Spirit to excite
them to Faith &amp; Repentance.</hi> No word of works of obedience, as Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here. <hi>David</hi> in order to the obtaining of the pardon of his sin, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
himself to the free mercy of God, that he might get his sin covered,
his iniquities forgiven, and his sin not imputed unto him; <hi>Psal.</hi> 32: 1, 2.
and this was, in <hi>Paul's</hi> judgment <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7, 8. a betaking himself to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Righteousness without works. So he betook himself to mercy, and
withall he desired to be purged with hysope, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51: 1, 7. which looked to
the blood of Christ, that only sprinkleth consciences. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9: 13, 14, 22.</p>
               <p>5. If Justification be continued upon Condition of works, we enquire
what these works are? Are herein comprehended all commanded duties?
or all that is required of justified persons by way of duty? then a faloure in
any of these, whether by Omission, or Commission, should cause an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:104357:213"/>
of that State, and a breach of that Relation: But this is utterly false;
Yea, if so, the justified should become Unjustified every day, for no man
liveth &amp; sinneth not. The reason of the Consequence is, because the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance
of the Condition, upon which the State &amp; Relation of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
is continued, must make a breach in that State. If it be said, That
not every sin, but only such sins as are inconsistent with the State of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
will make an Intercision. Then it must consequently be said, that
upon these alone, or on the non-performance of these alone doth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of Justification depend, as on a Condition. And what be these?
<hi>David's sin,</hi> I <hi>hope, nor</hi> Peters <hi>sin,</hi> were none of these. And whatever
they be, I suppose it will be granted, (except by <hi>Arminians</hi>) that there
is sufficient provision against these laid-in in the New Covenant of Grace;
and that such, as are justified indeed, shal never fall into such sins. And
then, what need it be said, that the State of Justification is continued upon
such termes?</p>
               <p>6. By this way, Proud Nature should have occasion to boast, and say.
It was of God's Grace &amp; Mercy, that I was brought into a justified State,
&amp; had all my former sins pardoned; but for my abiding &amp; continueing the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein;
and for the pardon of all my sins, that I have committed, or do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
since, I am beholden to my own Gospel-obedience immediatly; for
Remission is granted, and my Justification continued, upon Condition of
my personal &amp; Gospel-obedience. But how inconsistent this is with the
whole straine of the Gospel, cannot be unknown. We no where read, that
our sinnes are pardoned, or not imputed to us, in or by our Evangelick
Obedience; but as we are justified freely by grace, through the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
that is in Christ Jesus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 24. so it is in &amp; through Him, &amp; his
bloud, that we are washen, &amp; our sinnes purged away <hi>Mat.</hi> 26: 28. <hi>Revel.</hi>
1: 5. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 14.</p>
               <p>7. The dayly experience of the people of God, may cleare to us, what
that is, upon which their State is continued; and upon which they seek &amp;
obtaine new Remission of their new Transgressions, and shew us, that it is
not their own personal Obedience; but the Grace &amp; Mercy of God, in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ: for it is to this they betake themselves daily, both in reference
to their being keeped in the favour of God, &amp; in reference to their getting
new extracts of Pardon; It is to the blood of sprinkling they goe dayly, that
there they may be washen, &amp; cleansed from all their sins &amp; sailings. It is
to this fountaine opened to the house of <hi>David</hi> &amp; to the Inhabitans of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
that they run with their sins &amp; uncleannesses. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13: 1. For it is
his bloud alone, that cleanseth from all sin. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 7. And so they
finde by experience, that they stand only by Faith, and that it is through
Faith in this bloud, that they are keept in the favoure of God, &amp; get their
sins pardoned.</p>
               <p>These proofs may serve for confirmation of what we say; Let us now see
what <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> saith for the contrary.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>Confess.</hi> p.47. he adduceth three Arguments. The first is this. The
word expresly constituteth these Conditions of our not-loseing our State of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:104357:213"/>
Justification, or of Continueing it. And this he tels us, he hath formerly
shewed in many Scriptures, meaning, I suppose, the passages he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
before cited on the margine. But to these I Answere in general.
That not one of them maketh mention of the continuance of our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or of our not loseing of it: And therefore it cannot be said from these,
that the word expresly constituteth these Conditions of our not-losing Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
But we shall consider them particularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 12: 36, 37. speaketh not of justification, whereof we are now trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
but of the last judgment, and we see no cause of confounding this
Justification, whereof we speak, or its Continuance, with the last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as <hi>Papists</hi> do confound their second justification with this judgment;
and abuse the same Scriptures here adduced by <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> &amp; the like, to
prove their second justification to be by works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 2: 24. speaketh not of the Continuance or not losing of justification;
but of the very beginning of justification, which is not by a dead faith or by
a faith, that cannot produce works of Obedience, or by such a faith, as
devils have; but by a faith that is working, &amp; making the soul prompt &amp;
ready to yeeld all Obedience unto the Lord: and this is the true meaning of
the words, as was showne above, and the whole scope of the place eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth.
Will <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> say, that by a dead Faith, and by a Faith that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
save, and by a Faith that is in devils &amp; is attended with no Christian
Love, we are brought into a justified state at first? No sure: and yet this is
the faith, that <hi>Iames</hi> opposeth unto works, or rather unto a working faith,
whereby we are justified first &amp; last, as was <hi>Abraham vers.</hi> 21. whose faith
was such, as it wrought with his works, and by the same was manifest to be
what it was, the true &amp; saving faith of God's Elect. And sure, this Faith
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the faith that wrought in <hi>Rahab,</hi> was another sort of
Faith, than is the Faith of devils, or that Faith, that is but a dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 6: 14, 15. speaketh of Remission of sins: And I suppose, it will not
be said, that every one, who forgiveth his neighbour, doth thereby and
thereupon obtaine Remission of his own sins, at the hands of God; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
Heathens, &amp; wicked persons may be said to have their sins Pardoned
before God, because they may forgive others, some wrongs done unto
themselves. If it besaid, that such cannot forgive others a right, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a principle of grace, and not being in Christ. True, but then we see,
that it is not this forgiving abstractly considered, that is spoken of here, but
a Forgiving, flowing from faith &amp; principled thereby; and so the meaning
of the place is, That without such a Faith in Christ, as principleth &amp; promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to Pardoning of others, we can expect no pardon of our own sins from
God; not have ground to suppose that we are indeed pardoned of God: our
forgiving of others then is here mentioned as the native Effect, &amp; evident
Signe of Faith; as our Commentators manifest upon the place, speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Papists. See <hi>Pareus, Gualter</hi> &amp; others. <hi>Pareus</hi> particularly dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the <hi>Papist's</hi> gloss; &amp; sayeth, that our pardoning of others must follow
upon God's pardoning of us, as he cleareth from <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and will not have
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:104357:214"/>
our forgiving of others said to be the <hi>causa sine qua non</hi> of our obtaining Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from God. This place then saith, That while we cannot finde in our
heart, a readiness cheerfully &amp; heartily to forgive others, we have no
ground to imagine, that our sinnes are pardoned; for all such as are pardoned
of God, have this Christian disposition flowing from faith in Christ: They
may have this, as to the seed &amp; root; but till it grow up to yeeld this fruite,
they want the evidence of their faith &amp; consequently of pardon.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 9. meaneth such a Confession of sins, as is accompanied with
the making use by faith of the bloud of Christ, that cleanseth from all sin
<hi>vers.</hi> 7. and with a running to the Advocat with the Father, Jesus Christ the
Righteous, who is a Propitiation for sins <hi>Chap.</hi> 2: 1, 2. Most wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as <hi>Saul</hi> may make confession of their sins; but not so as to run to the
fountaine, the blood of sprinkling: And by a Confession, that is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with this acting, they can attaine to no Remission before God:
And therefore faith only acting in humble Confession to the glory of God, &amp;
to the taking of shame to themselves, is the condition of Pardon, &amp; of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of Justification, as to this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Revel.</hi> 22: 14. is also abused by the <hi>Papists.</hi> to prove their second justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be by works. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, hereused, doth not alwayes denote
<hi>right,</hi> or <hi>jus:</hi> for it sometimes signifieth meer freedome, liberty &amp; power
to do such or such a thing, as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9: 4, 5, 6. And so here the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
that such as do his commandements, are blessed; for thereby they
have free access unto the tree of life, unto Christ, their objective blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which is the same with that, which is commonly said, <hi>viz.</hi> that Works
of Obedience are the way of the Kingdom, but not the cause of reigning.
It will not suite with the Gospel, to say, that by our works of obedience
we buy a right to the tree of life, even in part, or in subordination to Christ's
blood; for Christ hath purchased the whole Right: &amp; nothing of ours must
be joined, as a part of that price, otherwise must we have a proportionable
share of the glory to ourselves. Nor can it be said, that by our works of
Obedience we obtaine a Right to Christ &amp; to his Merites; for before we
have a Right to Christ, we can do no works of Christian Obedience, and
Christ alone hath bought to us both Grace, &amp; Glory: But our works of
Christian Obedience, though they cannot precede our Right to, yet they
may go before our Possession of the Inheritance purchased; now Right &amp;
Possession are different things. But <hi>in fine</hi> we say, that this place, speaking
of the possession of glory, is not apposite to the purpose now in hand, for
Justification is different from Glorification. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 30. And of justification,
as continued are we here speaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Verse.</hi> 3. &amp; 9. can prove nothing, in reference
to what we are upon. <hi>Vers.</hi> 4. sheweth that there is no fruitfulness in Grace,
but by a constant abiding in, &amp; sucking of sap by faith from Christ the true
Vine, which none denieth. <hi>Verse</hi> 8. sheweth that by fruitfulness in good, the
Father is Glorified, &amp; thereby a demonstration is given to the world, who
are indeed the true disciples of Christ, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. holdeth forth the dreadful
punishment that attendeth Apostates; but we hope, true beleevers are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:104357:214"/>
against full &amp; final Apostasie. <hi>Vers.</hi> 10. proveth indeed, that keeping of
Christ's commands, is a mean to keep the sense of our being beloved of
Christ fresh in our souls, &amp; to enjoy the fruites of his Love of Beneficence:
but saith nothing of good works being the Condition of our Continuance in
the state of justification: unless we will also say, that Christ's obedience was
the Condition of his Continueing in the State of Justification.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2: 24. &amp;c. proveth, that full &amp; final Apostasie from the faith &amp;
truth of the Gospel will indeed cutt off from all Interest in Christ, &amp; from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
by him; But as true beleevers are secured from this, as <hi>vers.</hi> 27. clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
So this will only prove, that continuance in Faith, is the Condition
of continuance of Justification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 18: 35. Only proveth (and so confirmeth what was said to <hi>Mat.</hi> 6:
14.) that such as do not from their hearts forgive their brethren their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes,
can have no ground of Assurance, that God hath forgiven them
theirs. ... our Cruelty &amp; Unmercifulness towards our Brethren, may give
us sufficient ground to doubt of our Pardon, whatever seeming assurance we
had formerly. So that this place speaketh nothing of the Condition of our
pardon, but of the condition rather of our Sense, Feeling &amp; grounded Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Pardon; which is a far different thing.</p>
               <p>These are the Scriptures, whereby he would prove his first argument.
His 2. <hi>Arg.</hi> is this. <hi>Our first faith having the nue nature of a Covenanting with
Christ, &amp; giving ourselves to him, &amp; taking him for our Lord &amp; Redeemer: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it followes, that as the Covenant making &amp; accepting was of necessity, as the
condition of our first right &amp; remission; so is our Covenant keeping of the same neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to our continued right. And that God is, as it were, disobliged, if we should
not keep Covenant. And the keeping hath more in it, than the bare making. No
Covenant-relations usually are entered among men, but the Covenant keeping is
more than the making; and the conditions of their continued right more then of their
first right. So it is with a Subject to his Prince, wife to a husband, Souldier to a
commander, Scholer to his Teacher. Servant to his Master &amp;c. Promising will give
them the first right, but performing (in the essentials) must continue it, it or will
cease: for the end of the promise was its performance: And in that respect faith,
which is the Covenant, is inferiour to obedience, which is promised, though in other
respect it may be superiour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> (1) Though Justifying Faith be also a Covenanting faith, and of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
he soul with Christ; Yet in order to Justification, it hath not (to
use his words) the true Nature of a Covenanting with Christ, nor a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
up ourselves to Him: but rather it is a receiving &amp; resting on Him,
and his Righteousness, and a fleeing to his Merites for refuge. (2) Nor
doth faith, in order to Justification, (as we cleared above) receive Christ,
or goe to him, as Lord &amp; King, but rather as Priest. (3) Nor doth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of Christ at first, as King, formally include Obedience, or a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of obedience; as was also manifested above. (4) Therefore, from
this first acting of faith in order to justification, it can no way follow, that
Obedience, or Covenant keeping (as he speaketh) is the condition of
our continued Right, or of our continued justification. (5) What God
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:104357:215"/>
hath promised upon Covenant-keeping, he is, it is true, disobliged from
giving to speak so, when the Covenant is not keeped: But we find not,
that he hath promised Justification, or the continuance thereof upon these
termes. (6) There is no Covenants among men, that can fully quadrate,
either with God's Covenanting with us, or with the matter of Justification,
about which we are now speaking. The sentences of judges absolving
the debitor, upon the payment of the Cautioner instructed, agreeth
more with this; and we finde not in such sentences, any such-like Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
mentioned of their Continuance in force. (7) Some of these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
or Covenants mentioned are purely aliene, being betwixt a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
&amp; his servant, and the Captain and the Souldier; these are meer
mercenary contracts, having Obedience &amp; service for their only end, &amp;
promiseing a reward upon that Condition. Our justification hath no
likeness to this. (8) Even in these Relations, every act of disobedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
or non-performance of the duties required, doth not dissolve the
Relation; and therefore it cannot be said, that upon the contrare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
as a condition, the continueing of the Relation dependeth,
<hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> seeing this, addeth a restriction, (<hi>in the essentials.</hi>) And in
our case, I would require, what he will account Essential? It must
be that, sure, the contrary whereof is inconsistent with a Justified sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te:
and what can this be, but a total Apostasie? From which there
is full securitie laid-in, in the New Covenant, (which is not in any of the
Covenants among men, which he hath mentioned.) And this total Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie
must include a full renuncing of Christ, &amp; his Righteousness, as to
Justification: And this rather would say, that the continuance of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
dependeth on the continuance of Faith, adhereing to Christ &amp; his
Righteousness: &amp; to this I shall willingly assent. And this taketh away the
force of the 3. Arg. which he adduceth, saying.</p>
               <p>3. Arg. <hi>If there were no more necessary to the continueing of our Iustification,
but only the same thing, which did constitute it, then we should be justified by no
none act of faith, to our lives end, but only the first instantaneous act; &amp; so our
faith, after that instant, should never more be justifying faith. But that's false,
&amp;c. Ans.</hi> This whole argument, I yeeld unto; for I plead not against the
interest of faith here; but against our works being the condition of continued
Justification; as was said above.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Interest of Repentance in the Pardon of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-sinnes.</head>
               <p>WE spoke before <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. of Repentance in order to the first pardon
of sinnes, or to justification; and in the foregoing <hi>Chapter</hi> we
shew that the continuance of Justification did not depend on our
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:104357:215"/>
works, as the Condition thereof: But now the question will be moved tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Repentance; Whether it may not be said to be required, as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Continuance of Justification; or at least, as a Condition of the
Pardon of sins committed after justification. Concerning which we would
premit these things.</p>
               <p>1. It is granted, that Repentance is not only necessary, at the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of a sinner, but is a Grace, that is constantly to be exercised, by a
Beleever, so long, as he liveth; both in respect of its <hi>terminus a quo,</hi> &amp; of
its <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> or both in respect of its <hi>aversive,</hi> &amp; of its <hi>conversive</hi>
part; for he is still more &amp; more to depart f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om sin, and to turne unto God,
and to all the wayes of his Commandements <hi>Psal.</hi> 119: 59. The very body
of death is constant matter of groaning and mourning unto him <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: 24. &amp;
his dayly iniquities &amp; transgressions ought to keep him low, and to put him
to this exercise. Beside what at extraordinarie times of publick wrath or
judgment against the Land, Church, or Place he liveth in, or judgments
upon his own neer Relations, Familie &amp;c. or upon occasion of his own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
hainous out breakings: as in <hi>David. Psal.</hi> 51.</p>
               <p>2. It is also granted. That where is no Repentance, or no true Repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
for sinnes committed, there is no ground for that man to suppose, that
his sin is pardoned: I do not here speak of the measure or expressions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
for there may be mistakes on both hands; some thinking their
Repentance is naught, because not in such a sensible measure, as they think
is required; may therefore inferre that their case is worse, than indeed it is,
others, upon the other hand, may suppose they have repented, when it is
not so; &amp; so inferre pardon, when they have no ground. But this is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that where true &amp; sincere Repentance is not, there is no Pardon from
God of sins, whereof such are guilty: for to such, as he mindeth to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
he giveth also a Spirit of Repentance, as both Scripture &amp; Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
proveth:</p>
               <p>3. Yet notwithstanding of this, it is true, that an outward Repentance;
where there is no inward, real &amp; sanctified change wrought, may hold off
for a time, or prorogue the inflicting of temporal strokes; as we see in <hi>Aabh,
Nineveth</hi> &amp; others.</p>
               <p>4. It will be granted also by all the orthodox, that Repentance is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
meritorious cause of pardon; not doth it make any Satisfaction to God,
or appease his wrath &amp; anger.</p>
               <p>4. I shall also grant, that where there is true &amp; unfeigned Repentance,
after some sin committed, there that person may saifly inferre that his sin
is pardoned: Repentance is a good signe of Remission; because it is a good
evidence, that the man hath run to the fountaine, to the blood of Jesus, and
there hath washen himself, &amp; made himself cleane. See <hi>Esai.</hi> 1: 16,
17, 18.</p>
               <p>5. The Exercise of Repentance is very usefull, to make sin become
bitter, mercy welcome, &amp; to make the soul more careful &amp; watchful in
time to come.</p>
               <p>But the Question is, whether Repentance be a proper Condition of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:104357:216"/>
of sins, committed after Justification: or not? And when we speak of
Repentance here, we consider it by itself, &amp; not as being the sensible signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
&amp; expression of Faith; for the Question is not, whether Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
in &amp; through Repentance, or working the soul up unto unfaigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
be the Condition of Remission; for that is not Repentance, but
Faith, accompanied with, &amp; acting the soul to Repentance; but the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is of Repentance considered in itself, &amp; as a distinct grace from Faith:
And speaking of Repentance, as such, &amp; considered in itself, I say, that
it is not the Condition of Remission of after sins; but faith only, acting in a
Gospel manner, on Jesus Christ, &amp; his Bloud &amp; Merites.</p>
               <p>And the reasons are. 1. Because it is Faith &amp; not Repentance, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
the sinner away to the Bloud of Jesus Christ, &amp; to his Merites, through
whom, &amp; by which alone Remission is had <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 14. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.
1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9: 14, 22. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1: 5. Repentance as such, layeth not hold on Christ,
grippeth not his Merites, maketh no application of these; but is wholly
exercised about another object, about sin.</p>
               <p>2. This would give man too great ground of boasting in himself: if upon
his Mourning, Sorrow &amp; Repentance, Pardon were to be had; and would
give occasion to think, that there were some merite &amp; worth, in that work,
&amp; some thing satisfying or appeasing to God: for the man hereby is keeped
within himself: &amp; upon the account of something within himself, or done
by himself, is he pardoned, as he might suppose.</p>
               <p>3. This should be derogatorie to the Bloud &amp; Merites of Christ, by which
alone we have pardon first &amp; last; and the Gospel is so contrived, as that
Christ must have all the Glory; and all the methodes, meanes &amp; order of
the Gospel, and new Covenant, are in like manner framed, so that man
may be abased, free grace exalted, Christ acknowledged the only Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
But if our Repentance were made such a Condition, there should be
no application made of Christ &amp; of his bloud by the sinner; No acting on
him, &amp; on his merites, in order to the obtaining of Pardon; and so, no
occasion of exalting free grace, and Love in Christ; no occasion of wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
at the wise contrivance of the Covenant of Grace, in all points: If it
be said, There is no derogating from Christ &amp; his Merites here; because it
is by vertue of his Merites, that Repentance is made such a Condition: I
<hi>Ans.</hi> This is not cleared from the Scripture; nor is it sutable to the frame of
the Gospel-Covenant; for the whole of it is so contrived, as that Christ is
immediatly to be made use of: But this way keepeth the soul off all imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat
going to, applying of, and resting upon Christ, in order to Remission
of new sinnes; &amp; setteth them only upon the exercise of Sorrow &amp; Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
within themselves.</p>
               <p>4. The Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> pointeth out the way to beleevers of obtaining Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission-of
sins 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2: 1, 2. - <hi>And if any man sin, we have an Advocat with
the Father, Iesus Christ the righteous. And he is the Propitiation for our sins.</hi> Now,
Repentance doth not make use of Christ, as an Advocat, &amp; as a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but Faith doth. And it is the proper work of Faith, in order to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:104357:216"/>
to make use of Christ, in his Priestly office, &amp; to carry the soul
away to his Propitiation &amp; Intercession.</p>
               <p>5. The dayly experience of the Saints evidence this, when upon convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of sin, they betake themselves to the free Mercy of God, in Christ,
to the Bloud of sprinkling, crying out for Pardon for the Lord's sake, and
seeking to be washen, in his blood. It is not their Repentance, or Sorrow,
that they flee to, as the ground of their hope of Pardon; but the merites of
Christ, held forth in the new Covenant, is that fountaine, wherein they
must wash &amp; be cleane. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 25: 11. &amp; 51: 7.</p>
               <p>6. This was sufficiently held forth under the Law, when for their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
Failings &amp; dayly Transgressions, the people were to bring their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
to the Priest, which were to be offered up, as types of Christ &amp;
they were to lay their hands upon the head of the Sacrifice, in signe of their
resting upon the Sacrifice typified, &amp; of rolling their sins upon that only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
&amp; of expecting Acceptance &amp; Pardon, through it alone. See <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi>
4: 20, 26, 31, 35. &amp; 5: 10, 13, 16, 18. &amp; 6: 7, 19, 22.</p>
               <p>7. If Repentance be the Condition, then this must either be said of that
part of Repentance, which preceedeth the acting of faith, or of that which
followeth: This <hi>last</hi> cannot be said; for then it would follow, that upon
the acting of faith, that preceedeth, there were no Remission; &amp; so faith
laying hold on Christ &amp; his Merites, should be utterly excluded from having
any Interest in the pardon of sins. Nor can the <hi>first</hi> be said, for then there
should be Remission, before &amp; without all application made of Christ by
Faith: Yea &amp; the very imperfect beginnings of Repentance should be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
sufficient for Remission: which cannot be said. If it be said, that this is
meaned of compleat Repentance. I <hi>Ans.</hi> Compleet Repentance cannot be
without Faith: &amp; it is against what is said, to make Repentance, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
alone &amp; by itself, or as abstracted from Faith, the only Condition;
seing this would be a manifest exclusion of Faith altogether. If it be said,
that Repentance &amp; Faith may be considered together, &amp; as joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
called the Condition of Pardon. I <hi>Ans.</hi> Seing it is manifest, that both
do not, neither can act one &amp; the same way on Christ; they cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as equally sharing in the place &amp; interest of a condition: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I judge it saifest to say, That faith, acting in &amp; by Repentance, or
so discovering itself to be true &amp; lively, is the sole Condition of Pardon.</p>
               <p>8. As at first, so alwayes that holdeth true, which <hi>Peter</hi> saith <hi>Act.</hi> 10:
43. <hi>To him</hi> (i. e. to Jesus) <hi>give all the Prophets witness, that through his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
whosoever beleeveth in him, shall receive Remission of sins.</hi> As the stung
Israelit was alwayes, in order to his cure, to look to the brazen serpent:
so is the Beleever, that would be cured of the guilt of new transgressions,
to have his recourse by Faith unto the Mediator, crucified &amp; lifted up
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: 14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. It is said, that Repentance is necessary both as commanded, and
as a meane appointed for attaining Remission of sins: And therefore must be
the Condition of Remission. <hi>Ans.</hi> The consequence is not good; for this
same may be said of Prayer, and other Duties; which yet cannot be called
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:104357:217"/>
proper Conditions of Pardon. That prayer is a commanded duty, none
will deny; That a praying sinner may be said to be using the meanes to attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
unto Pardon, and to be in the way of obtaining of it, will also be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and so in that respect, prayer may be accounted a meane: and yet it
cannot be called the Condition; for then every one that prayeth should ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
pardon, though he act not faith: And if it be said, that it must be prayer
in faith <hi>Iam.</hi> 5: 15. I <hi>Ans.</hi> True, but then the Condition is not Prayer,
but Faith exerting itself, and acting in &amp; through Prayer: And the same
we say of Repentance, and so keep it in its due place, and presse it in the
Gospel way &amp; methode.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. It is said. That there is a kind of congruity &amp; sutablness, in this
order, by subjoining the promise of pardon to it; for it is more sutable that
a penitent sinner should have Pardon, than an impenitent. <hi>Ans.</hi> So this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
may be said of Prayer; for it is also more sutable, that a praying sinner,
be pardoned, than a sinner that nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> once asketh pardon: And this tendeth
more also to the exalting of free grace. But the truth is, in pardon there is
not only a declaration &amp; exalting of Grace &amp; Mercy; but also of divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 25, 26. and unto this, Faith is singularly fitted, because it lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeth
hold on the Propitiation, and on bloud, for the declaration of God's
Righteousness for Remission of sins; and hereby is the Lord declared to be
just, when he is the Justifier &amp; Pardoner of the beleever. So that neither
prayer, nor Repentance, nor Self-searching &amp;c. can be properly called the
Condition, but Faith acting in &amp; by these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. It is said, that Repentance qualifieth the sinner, in reference to
the promise of pardon, or putteth him within the reach of the promise;
so that he may take hold of the promise of pardon: And it disposeth him to
accept the offered Salvation freely, and to rest upon Christ alone, for that
end. <hi>Ans.</hi> (1) What disposeth to accept of Salvation &amp;c. cannot for that
cause be called the Condition of Pardon, unless we speak improperly; as
felt poverty in a beggar, though it disposeth him to receive an offered almes
thankfully, Yet it is not the proper Condition: No more self conviction,
in our case, a Condition of Pardon. (2) If it qualifieth for the receiving of
the offered Salvation; then it qualifieth immediatly for Faith, &amp; but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
&amp; remotly for Pardon. (3) The promise of Pardon is not made to the
penitent properly, &amp; as such; but to the Penitent beleever; that is, to faith
acting &amp; exerting itself in &amp; by Repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 4. Esai.</hi> 1: 15, 16. <hi>put away the evil of your doings, cease to do evil,</hi> &amp;c.
this is Repentance: &amp; then <hi>vers.</hi> 18. full pardon is promised, <hi>though your
sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white, as snow &amp;c. Ans.</hi> Yet with all he bids
them <hi>wash &amp; make cleane;</hi> which could only be, by the blood of the Messiah,
for that only cleanseth. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 7. and this they had neglected, in going
about their Sacrifices, which therefore were abominable in the eyes of the
Lord <hi>vers.</hi> 11, 12, 13. because not accompanied with Faith, that purifieth
the heart <hi>Act.</hi> 15: 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 5. 2. Chron.</hi> 7: 14. the Lord promiseth to forgive sin, if his people
would turne from their wicked wayes. <hi>Ans.</hi> But with all it is required the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:104357:217" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they seek the face of God, &amp; that was in &amp; through the Messiah,
typified by the Temple, to which their prayers were to be directed, as we see
<hi>Chap.</hi> 6: 20, 24, 26, 29, 31, 34, 38.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 6. Prov.</hi> 28: 13. - <hi>He that confesseth his sin &amp; forsaketh it shall finde
mercy. Ans.</hi> True, because none will do that a right, but the beleever;
who laith hold on the Merites of Christ. And so this &amp; the like places, are
not exclusively to be taken, but principally to be understood of Faith so
acting, and evidencing itself to be true &amp; lively, and of the right stamp, by its
acting so.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Iohn Goodwine</hi> in his <hi>Treatise of justification part. 2. Ch.</hi> 2. laith
down several conclusions, whereby he might overturne this Truth:
&amp; what he saith must be examined.</p>
               <p>His 1. <hi>Conclusion</hi> in this. He, <hi>for whose sins a plenary satisfaction hath been
made (either by himself, or another for him) &amp; hath been accepted by him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom the transgression was committed, is as just &amp; righteous, as he that
never sinned, but had done all things, that were requisite &amp; meet for him to do.
Ans.</hi> If by <hi>just</hi> &amp; <hi>righteous</hi> be meaned one, who only hath not deserved the
punishment threatned; then his Conclusion is true: but if by <hi>just</hi> &amp; <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi>
be meaned one, who not only hath not deserved the punishment, but
hath also deserved the reward promised; then his Conclusion is false; for
the Satisfaction, if it respect only the transgression committed, can only put
the man, for whom it is given &amp; accepted, in the state of one, that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
no obligation to be punished: but it cannot put him in the state of one,
who not only is not to be punished, but is also to be rewarded. He addeth.
<hi>This is evident; because there is as much justice &amp; righteousness in repairing the
the wrongs &amp; injuries done to any, as there is in abstaining from doing wrong. Ans.</hi>
True, in reference to the wrong done; and therefore such an one is rightly
&amp; justly delivered from the obligation to punishment; but is not made so
righteous, as to challenge the reward, till a more compleet satisfaction be
made, <hi>to wit,</hi> such as may comprehend also perfect conformitie unto the
Law in all points, to the end, he, for whom this is done, may be looked
upon as a fulfiller of the Law, &amp; therefore to have right to the reward, as
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:104357:218"/>
he would have had, if he had in his own person perfectly keeped it. He that
simply repaireth the wrong done, doth not that, which deserveth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
The <hi>simile</hi> he annexeth confirmeth this, and demonstrateth how
far out he is, as to our case. <hi>He that by his cattel, or otherwise, hath made
spoil in his nieghbours Corne, &amp; hath given him full satisfaction for the spoil done,
to his contentment, is as good a Nieghbour, &amp; deals as justly &amp; honestly with him,
as he that never trespassed in that kind upon him.</hi> How impertinent this is, as
to our case, any may see; or he must say, that there was no reward promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to <hi>Adam,</hi> upon his perfect obedience; &amp; that that word, <hi>do this &amp; live,</hi>
had no place, in the Covenant made with him. The Satisfying Nieghbour
deserveth no reward, nor was there any reward promised to him, upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his being a good Nieghbour. He addeth. <hi>The essence &amp; nature of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
or righteousness is</hi> suum cuique tribuere, <hi>to give to every man his own. i. e.
that which is his own in a way of equity &amp; right, is due from us unto them. Ans.</hi>
But that which <hi>Adam</hi> was obliged to give to God, as his owne, was glory,
by faithful &amp; constant obedience, that he might receive the reward to the
glory of God's faithfulness, &amp; goodness. Now when <hi>Adam</hi> dishonoured the
Lord by disobedience. &amp; robbed him (as it were) of his Authoritie, as
just &amp; righteous Governour, a satisfaction for the wrong done, excluding po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
&amp; full obedience unto the Law, is not a giving to God all that is due
to him. <hi>Now</hi> (saith he) <hi>when we have enjured or damnified any man, in any
of his rights, or things belonging to him, there is nothing more due to him, than
that which is his own, i. e. that which is fully valuable to the injurie we have done
unto him. Therefore he that tenders a valuable consideration or satisfaction for an
injurie done to another, is just, according to the height &amp; utmost exigency of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;
&amp; consequently as just, as he that never was injurious or did wrong. Ans.</hi>
All this is to no purpose, as to our question; for it is not betwixt God &amp; us:
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was it betwixt God and <hi>Adam,</hi> as it is betwixt one man &amp; another. God is
to be considered, as a supreme Law-giver &amp; Ruler, enjoyning obedience
to his Lawes, under penalties, and promising rewards unto the obedient:
Now when his Lawes are broken, he is doubly enjured, &amp; the breaker, is
obliged unto punishment, and also forfeited of his expectation of the reward.
When satisfaction is made, and withall no compleet obedience to the Law,
the person is by the satisfaction made, only exeemed from the obligation
to punishment, but hath thereby no right to the reward promised, untill
the Law be compleetly obeyed.</p>
               <p>His 2. Conclusion is. <hi>There is no medium between a perfect absolution &amp; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from all sin; &amp; a perfect &amp; compleet righteousness: But he that is fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
&amp; freed from sin,</hi> ipso facto, <hi>is made perfectly &amp; compleetly righteous.
Ans.</hi> The same distinction, which we made use of in the other Conclusion,
will helpe us here. If by <hi>perfectly &amp; compleetly Righteous</hi> be meaned one, that
is liable to no punishment, it is true, that he, who is fully discharged &amp;
freed from sin, is made perfectly righteous, but if by <hi>perfectly</hi> &amp; <hi>compleetly
Righteous</hi> be meaned one, that moreover hath a right to the recompence of
reward, that is promised, than it is false: freedom &amp; absolution from sin
respecteth only the guilt, &amp; dissolveth the obligation to punishment, &amp; in
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:104357:218"/>
that respect, is a perfect &amp; compleet Righteousness; i. e. the person, so
absolved, is as free of punishment, or of obligation thereunto, as if he
had never sinned; but having sinned, he cannot by this dissolution of the
obligation to punishment be <hi>ipso facto</hi> made as perfectly &amp; compleetly Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
as he would have been, if he had never transgressed, but had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
keeped the Law; for if he had perfectly keeped the Law, he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
full right to the reward, which now he hath not, and which no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
or discharge, as such, can restore him unto. Let us hear his reason.
<hi>Nothing</hi> (saith he) <hi>can any way diminish, or prejudice the perfection of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
but only sin, as no thing can hinder the perfection of light, but darkness
in one degree, or other. So that as the aire, when it is free from all degrees of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
must of necessity be fully light; so he that is perfectly freed from all sin, must
of necessity be fully &amp; perfectly Righteous. Ans.</hi> This would make us beleeve,
that he is here speaking of sin itself, and not of its guilt and demerite, and
so the opposite hereunto, must be holiness; which expelleth sin (in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
as light doth darkness, or as one quality doth its contrary. But then
he is fighting, all this while, against his own shadow, for we are speaking
of the guilt of sin, which also must be properly understood, (and nothing
else can) when he spoke of <hi>absolution &amp; freedom from sin,</hi> in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on.
If he speak here of sin in respect of guilt &amp; demerite, his <hi>simile</hi> doth
not quadrate; and opposite to this guilt he should set Righteousness or obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
with its merite: and if any will do this, they shall easily see the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
for though a man hath not transgressed, yet he hath not <hi>eo ipso</hi> right
to the <hi>premium,</hi> for in order to this, moe dayes work may be required, than
one or halfe of one dayes work; far less can the Pardon of or satisfaction for
this transgression, give a man right to the reward.</p>
               <p>He addeth. <hi>It is impossible to conceive a man defective in any part of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
&amp; yet withall to conceive him free from all sin: sin &amp; Righteousness being</hi> in
subjecto capaci, contraria immediata, <hi>as</hi> Logicians <hi>speak. Ans. Defective
in Righteousness</hi> may be either understood in respect of the meer duty or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
or in respect of full right to the reward. In the <hi>first</hi> sense, such an
one cannot be free of all sin; but taking it in the <hi>second</hi> sense, he may: as for
example, when one is to work eight dayes in dressing a garden, &amp; then to
receive the reward promised, &amp; if he fail in his work any of the dayes, to
be punished; this man, so long as he worketh 2, 3, 4. 5. dayes cannot be
charged with sin, nor said to be defective, as to his duty; and yeth he hath
not full right to the reward untill he hath wrought Eight dayes, but is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
in some part of his Righteousness, as to this reward. And according
to this may we understand that logical axiome.</p>
               <p>Further he saith, <hi>The Scriptures themselves still make an immediat opposition,
between sin &amp; Righteousness. - To finde out a third estate between sin &amp; Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
we must finde out a third</hi> Adam, <hi>from whom it should be derived. Ans.</hi>
The state of sin &amp; of Righteousness, whereof the Scripture speaketh, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
indeed of no <hi>medium,</hi> or third betwixt them, and the reason is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
we are all now borne in a state of sin, &amp; are obnoxipus to wrath; &amp;
remaine so, untill we be translated into a state of Righteousness, which is not
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:104357:219"/>
by meer pardon of sins, but also by the imputation of a Righteousness; for
being in this State of Righteousness, we have not only the Obligation to
wrath &amp; eternal punishment removed, which is done by Remission upon
the account of the Satisfaction of Christ imputed; but we have also a right
to the reward, the crown of life, which is had by imputation of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or of obedience, though it were better to say, we have both by both;
or we have both by the imputation of that compleet Satisfaction &amp; merite,
which comprehendeth, or consisteth of both.</p>
               <p>His 3. Conclusion is this, Adam, <hi>whilst his innocency stood with him, and
till his fall by sin, was compleetly Righteous, &amp; in an estate of justification before
God: Yea, for the truth &amp; substance of Righteousness, as Righteous, as he could
or should have been, if he had lived to this day, in the most entire &amp; absolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Law. Ans. Adam,</hi> while he remained innocent, was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Righteous, that is, was changable with no transgression, it is true: That
he was compleatly Righteous, that is, had full right to the reward, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done all his duty, and compleated his work, it is most false. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(2) it is false to say, he was in a state of justification, unless nothing
else be hereby meaned, than that he was not in a state of condemnation.
Though there be no mids betwixt these two now, as to us, but either we
must be in a state of justification, or in a state of condemnation; Yet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
while he stood, was in neither; Not in a state of condemnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had not yet transgressed the Law; Nor yet in a state of justification,
because he had not yet done all his duty; for he was to persevere in obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to the end: And if he had been justified, he had full right to the reward,
&amp; so had been glorified, for whom the Lord justifieth, he glorifieth: But
<hi>Adam</hi> was not glorified upon his Law-obedience, and consequently was not
justified by his Law-obedience. (3) The truth &amp; substance of Righteousness
(unto which he would restrick all) is not the thing enquired after, nor is
it at all to the point; for upon <hi>Adam's</hi> having of that simply he could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the reward of life, that was promised, because, the Covenant, he
was under, required continuance &amp; perseverance in all the several duties,
called for by the Law, even to the end, ere he could challenge a right to the
reward: And further <hi>Adam</hi> had this truth &amp; substance of Righteousness at
the first, &amp; it was concreated with him; Yet he could not, upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
have challenged glory, as his due.</p>
               <p>He addeth. <hi>Even as the second</hi> Adam <hi>was as compleatly &amp; perfectly Righteous
from the womb, &amp; so from his first entrance upon his publick ministrie, as he was
at last, when he suffered death. Ans.</hi> If we speak of our Lord Jesus, as the
second <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, as standing in the room of sinners, as the Head &amp;
publick Person, engadging in their behalfe, whom he did represent, to pay
all their debt; though he knew no sin, and upon that account was perfectly
Righteous, and separat from sinners; Yet he was to finish the work
laid upon him, and to performe the whole debt, both of duty &amp; suffering,
which he had undertaken; and till the last penny of that debt was payed, his
work was not finished, and untill his work was finished, he could not chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
his reward: And so this confirmeth what we have said of the first <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:104357:219"/>
                  <hi>To say</hi> (he addeth) <hi>that</hi> Adam <hi>was not perfectly Righteous, &amp; consequently
in a justified estate or condition before God, untill his fall by sin, is to place him
into an estate of condemnation before his sin, there being no middle or third estate
betwixt these two. Ans.</hi> This was obviated before. <hi>Adam's</hi> state before his
fall, was a state of Innocencie, wherein he enjoyed the favour &amp; presence
of God, he being perfectly Righteous, in reference to that state; &amp; to what
was required of him; but justified he was not; for the reward was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
unto him. So that, as to him, there was a middle state betwixt a
State of Justification &amp; a State of Condemnation; though, as to us, there
is not, as the places, which he citeth afterward namely <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 18. &amp; 8: 1,
2, shew, &amp; the whole Scriptures evince.</p>
               <p>He closeth this matter thus. <hi>Therefore to grant, that forgiveness of sins puts
a man into the same estate &amp; condition, wherein</hi> Adam <hi>stood before his fall (which
is generally granted by men of opposite judgment in this controversie; &amp; nothing
granted neither, in this, but the unquestionable truth) is to grant the point in
question, &amp; to acknowledge the truth laboured for, throughout this whole discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.
Ans.</hi> It is not granted that remission of sins, as such, putteth a man eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way into the same Condition, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> stood before his fall; for it
putteth not a man in the same estate of inherent holiness, wherein <hi>Adam</hi>
was; but it putteth a man into the same estate of freedome from any obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to punishment, for it taketh away the <hi>reatus poenae,</hi> so that a pardoned
man, as such, is no more under the actual obligation unto the curse &amp;
wrath of God, threatned for transgression, than was <hi>Adam,</hi> before he fell:
and this is all, that is confessed. Which is far, yea very far from granting
the point, that he goeth about to establish: for he would have remission,
as such, put a man in the state of full right to the reward, to the end he
might exclude the imputation of the obedience or Righteousness of Christ,
as not being necessary unto this end, contrary to the Scriptures of truth. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
before he fell, had not right unto the promised reward, because he
was to finish his course of obedience, before he could obtaine that: And
therefore the granting, that remission putteth a man into the same Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherein <hi>Adam</hi> stood, will contribute nothing to his end.</p>
               <p>His 4. <hi>Conclusion</hi> is. <hi>That perfect remissien of sins includeth the Imputation or
acknowledgment of the observation of the whole Law; even as the imputation of the
Law fulfilled, necessarily includes the non imputation of sin, or the forgiveness of
all sin, in case any hath been committed. Ans.</hi> The conclusion is manifestly
false, if we speak of remission simply, &amp; abstractivly as such; And the
ground here alleiged for it, is ambiguous; for the imputation of the Law
fulfilled, may either be to sach, as never broke it, &amp; then it doth not inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
remission, but taketh away all necessity of it; or to transgressours, and
then indeed it may presuppose remission, but doth not include it, as such.
But to remove ambiguities, we shall distinguish, &amp; say, that perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins includeth the acknowledgment of the observation of the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
Law, in respect of Punishment; but not in respect of the Reward; that
is, perfect Remission of sins exeemeth a man from Punishment, as well as
if he had perfectly keeped the Law; but doth not give him right to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:104357:220"/>
for unto this was requisite the perfect observation of the Law: Now
perfect observation of the Law saith, there was no transgression; but remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
saith, &amp; supposeth, that the Law was not perfectly observed. So the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the Law fulfilled either saith, the Law was not broken, or that
now satisfaction is made for the breach thereof, &amp; therefore the person,
unto whom this imputation is made. hath a right unto the reward, which
this imputation doth directly &amp; immediatly respect, as such. But in our
case, both these go together, perfect remission, &amp; the imputation of the
Law fulfilled, because freedom from the obligation to punishment, &amp; right
to the reward, go also together inseparably.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For how can he be said</hi> (saith he) <hi>to have all his sins fully forgiven, who is
yet looked upon, or intended to be dealt with all, as one that hath transgressed either
by way of omission, or commission, any part of the Law? Ans.</hi> He that hath his sins
fully forgiven, may well be looked upon, as one that hath transgressed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by omission, or by commission, or by both; because he must be so loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
upon: for pardon presupposeth sin; no man can be pardoned, but a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and no man can think or dreame of a remission, but withall he must
suppose, that the person pardoned hath sinned. But it is true, he who is said
to have all his sins fully forgiven, cannot be intended to be dealt withall, as
one that hath transgressed: for pardon destroyeth that obligation to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but doth not so destroy sin, as to cause that it never was; for that is
impossible. What more? <hi>And he that is looked upon as one, that never transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
any part of the Law, must needs be conceived or looked upon as one, that hath
fulfilled or keeped the Law. Ans.</hi> This is very true: But what then? <hi>Which is
nothing else</hi> (saith he) <hi>but to have a perfect Righteousness, or (which is the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me)
a perfect fulfilling of the Law imputed to him. Ans.</hi> This is also true, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this imputation of a perfect fulfilling of the Law, to be to one, who
never broke the Law by sin; but it is not true, in our case, who are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours,
all the imputation of Righteousness in the world can not make
us to have been no sinners.</p>
               <p>Yet he inferreth. <hi>So that besides that perfect remission of sins, which hath been
purchased by the bloud of Christ, there is no need of (indeed no place for) the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of any Righteousness, performed by Christ unto the Law. Ans.</hi> The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of this is manifest from what is said: But he addeth a reason. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
(saith he) <hi>in that very act of remission of sins, there is included an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a perfect Righteousness. Ans.</hi> This is but the same thing, which was said,
&amp; is manifestly false. Remission regairdeth only the punishment, or the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
thereunto, &amp; dissolveth it, but, as such giveth no right to the reward,
which was promised only to obedience to the Law.</p>
               <p>But then he tels us more properly, &amp; with Scripture-exactness (as he
saith) that <hi>that act of God, whereby heremitteth &amp; pardoneth sin, is interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivly
nothing else, but an imputation of a perfect righteousness or of a fulfilling of
the Law: compare Rom.</hi> 4: 6 <hi>with vers.</hi> 7. &amp; 11. <hi>Ans.</hi> This is but the same
thing, &amp; needeth no new answere; for it is denied, that that act of God,
whereby he pardoneth sin, considered in itself, &amp; as such, is interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vly
an imputation of perfect Righteousness. But it is true, in our case, it
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:104357:220"/>
may be called so interpretativly, in this respect, that there is such an in disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble
connexion betwixt the two, that the one inferreth the other, <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
consequentis.</hi> And this is all that can be proved from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7, 11.</p>
               <p>He addeth, <hi>Even as the act of the Physician, by which he recovereth his patient
from his sickness, may, withfull propriety of speach, be called that act, whereby
he restoreth him to his health. Ans.</hi> The Physician purging away the humors, the
causes of the distemper, is the cause of health, by being the <hi>causa removens
prohibens;</hi> because <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> health followeth upon the removal of that,
which caused the distemper; but the connexion of pardon &amp; of imputation
of Righteousness is not <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> but <hi>ex libera Dei constitutione:</hi> conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the causes of both together. His next similitude of the sun, dispelling
darkness, &amp; filling the aire with light, is as little to the purpose; because
here is a natural necessary consequence, light necessarily expelling dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
which is denied in our case. Hence there is no ground for what he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
when he saith. <hi>In like manner, God doth not heal sin, that is forgive sin,
by one act, &amp; restore the life of righteousness, that is impute righteousness, by another
act at all differing from it, but in &amp; by one &amp; the same punctual &amp; precise act he
doth the one &amp; the other.</hi> For we are not here enquiring, after the oneness or
diversitie of God's acts in a Philosophical manner: God can do many things
by one Physical act: but we are enquireing concerning the Effects, whether
they be one precise thing, flowing from one moral cause; or so diverse, as
to require diverse moral causes, &amp; grounds, or whether the one doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
&amp; essentially include the other, as being both but one thing.</p>
               <p>His following words would seem to speak to this, when he saith, <hi>forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of sins, &amp; imputation of Righteousness are but two different names, expressions,
or considerations of one &amp; the same thing one &amp; the same act of God is sometimes
called forgivness of sins, &amp; sometimes an imputing of Righteousness; &amp; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givness
of sins is sometimes called an imputing of righteousness, to shew &amp; signifie
that a man needs nothing to a compleet Righteousness, or Iustification, but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givness
of his sins: And againe the Imputing of Righteousness is sometimes called
the forgivness of sins, to shew that God hath no other Righteousness to conferre upon
a sinner, but that which standeth in forgiveness of sins. Ans.</hi> This is but <hi>gratis
dictum;</hi> nothing at all is proved: These two, <hi>pardon of sins</hi> &amp; <hi>imputation of
Righteousness,</hi> are two distinct parts of one compleet favour, and blessing
granted of God, in order to one compleet blessedness, consisting likewise in
two parts, to wit, in freedome from punishment, which was deserved, &amp;
in right to the promised inheritance, which was lost: And because these
two, both in the cause, and in the effect, are inseparable conjoined by the
Lord; therefore, the mentioning of the one may &amp; doth import &amp; signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
both, by a <hi>Synecdoche:</hi> And hence no man, with reason, can inferre,
that they are both one &amp; the same precise thing, flowing from one &amp; the
same precise cause, and import only the different names, expressio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
of one &amp; the same thing, Christ's obedience to the Law, and
his suffering for sin, were not one &amp; the same thing under various considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or names, but distinct parts of one compleet Surety-Righteousness: no
more can the effects, that flow therefrom, be accounted one &amp; the same
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:104357:221"/>
thing, but two distinct parts of one compleet effect: And therefore the
mentioning of the one, in stead of the whole, proveth no confusion, or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meness,
but rather an inseparablness, which is yeelded.</p>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>5. thus. How can God be said
to impute a Righteousness to a man, which never was, nor ever had a being,
no Righteousness (at least of that kind, whereof we now speak) having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been, but that perfect obedience, which Christ performed to the
Law? This indeed is a very rational question; for our Author talketh much
of an imputed Righteousness, and never doth, nor yet can tell us, what
that is, that can deserve the name of a Righteousness. Let us heare, what
he answereth. 1. saith he. <hi>There is as express &amp; compleet a Righteousness in the
Law, as ever Christ himself performed. Ans.</hi> But what Righteousness is or
can be in a Law, but what is there, by way of prescription? And who doubts

                  </gap> the perfection of this, that acknowledgeth the perfection of the Law?
This is utterly impertinent to the purpose in hand, where the question is of
a Righteousness consisting in conformity to the Law, and which must be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to man, to whom the Law is given? <hi>And what if it be said</hi> (saith he)
<hi>that God, in remission of sins, through Christ, from &amp; out of the Law, imputeth
to every man, that beleeveth, such a Righteousness, as is proper to him? Ans.</hi> To
say this, is to speak plaine non-sense: for what is that to furnish a man with
a Righteousness out of the Law? Can a man be changed into a Law? or can
a man have any Righteousness, prescribed by a Law, but by thoughts, words,
&amp; deeds, bearing a conformity to the commands of the Law? And how can

any prohibited act, make that act conforme to the Law? Pardon thus should
be a self destroyer; for an act, that is no transgression of a Law, can need no

hath bin spoken to elsewhere.</p>
               <p>He giveth a 2. answere, saying. <hi>To say, God cannot impute a Righteousness,
which never had a being i.e. which never was really &amp; actually performed by any

full denied; it never hath been, nor never shall be proved, that forgivness
of sin is the imputation of a Righteousness. Though he addeth from <hi>Rom. 4:

now, that he who is no wayes obnoxious unto death, hath a right unto life;
Yet the consequence that he would draw from it, is not good: <hi>to wit,</hi> that
that only, which taketh away the obnoxiousness unto death, giveth also a
right to life: because God hath inseparably joined these effects together, as
also their distinct causes together, and giveth them inseparably; so that he
who is pardoned hath also a right to life, not meerly upon the account, that
he is pardoned, but because together with the imputation of the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Christ, whence floweth pardon, he imputeth also Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
upon which followeth the right to life. And howbeit now, as
to us, there is no middle state betwixt these two; Yet in <hi>Adam</hi> there was;
for while he stood, he was not obnoxious unto death; and yet he had not
right unto life: but was to work out &amp; perfect his rask, to that end. But he
tels us, <hi>That while</hi> Adam <hi>stood, he was already in possession &amp; fruition of life;
else he could not be threatned with death. Ans.</hi> This is not the life, whereof we
are speaking; we are speaking of the life, promised by that Covenant, unto
perfect obedience: But it seemeth, that he joyneth with the <hi>

say (and that is sufficient) that that Law, or Covenant, requiring perfect

Law, upon the same termes, that he was, at the beginning, &amp; the least inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption

his translation to glory, we know not; nor is it of use for us to enquire;
it is sufficient to know, that he was to finish his course, &amp; to persevere in
obedience to the end, if he would not both forfeit the life he had, and the
expectation of the life of glory, which was promised upon his compleeting
his work of obedience.</p>
               <p>He addeth. <hi>Notwithstanding, the Scriptures of the New. Test. seem to place
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:104357:222"/>
the immediat right, or capacity, which beleevers have to the Kingdom of heaven
&amp; eternal glory, rather in the grace of Adoption, than in any Righteousness what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
even Remission of sins itself not excepted. Ans.</hi> I have spoken to this else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and shall only say here, That hereby he hath destroyed his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion;
for hereby we see, that in order to the attaining of right to life,
more is requisite, than meer Remission, for he cannot say, that Remission
of sins &amp; Adoption, is all one, having clearly hinted the contrary here, &amp;
having also denied Righteousness to be the ground of Adoption, while as
before he made Righteousness &amp; Remission of sins all one. He shall never
prove that Adoption is without the Imputation of Righteousness. Let us
heare his reason. <hi>The reason whereof may (haply) be this, because the life &amp;
blessedness, which come by Iesus Christ, are of far higher nature, excellency and
worth, than that which was Covenanted to</hi> Adam, <hi>by way of wages for his work,
or obedience to the Law, &amp; therefore require an higher &amp; fuller &amp; richer capacity,
or title in the creature, to interesse him therein, than that did: work faithfully
performed is enough, to entitle a man to his wages, but the gift of an inheritance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirtth
a special grace or favour. Ans.</hi> As this is but dubiously asserted; so it
is to no purpose; for though some difference may be granted betwixt the glory, now had by the <hi>Gospel</hi> &amp; that promised to <hi>Adam,</hi> in several respects;
Yet it was a life of glory, that was promised to <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; our Adoption is
not without the imputation of a Righteousness. Nor was <hi>Adam's</hi> obedience
such a work, as in strick justice called for wages, without a Covenant. The
Imputation of Righteousness is indeed a special grace &amp; Favoure &amp; therefore
fit enough to found Adoption.</p>
               <p>His 6. Conclusion is this. <hi>That Satisfaction, which Christ made to the justice
of God for sin, &amp; whereby he procured Remission of sins (or perfect Righteousness)
&amp; reconciliation with God for those that beleeve, consists only in that obedience of
his, which he performed to that peculiar &amp; special Law of Mediation, which God
imposed upon him (which we commonly, though perhaps not altogether so properly,
call his passive obedience) &amp; not at all in that obedience or subjection, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to that common Law of nature, which we call moral. Ans.</hi> Though, if
we should speak strickly of satisfaction, as distinguished from obedience, &amp;
as relating to the punishment for sin, the substance of this Conclusion might
be granted; Yet taking Satisfaction more largly, as relative to our whole
debt, it must necessarily include his obedience to the Law moral. (2) Though
for explications sake, we may speak of Christ's Active, &amp; of his Passive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
distinctly; Yet there was suffering &amp; satisfaction, in all his Active
obedience (as it is commenly called) &amp; there was action &amp; meriting in all
his Passive Obedience (as it is commonly called.) His supposing Remission
of sins, &amp; Perfect Righteousness, is already discovered to be a mistake,
(4) The special Law of Mediation required of Christ both obedience &amp; suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
&amp; he speaketh without ground, when he restricteth it to his passive
obedience, (as it is commonly called) only. His reason is. <hi>Because nothing
can be satisfactory to divine justice for sin, but that which is penal.</hi> Heb. 9: 22.
<hi>for doubtless, where there is Satisfaction, there is &amp; may be remission. Ans.</hi> This
confirmeth only what we granted of satisfaction taken strickly. But cannot
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:104357:222"/>
prove, that Satisfaction largely taken, may not, or cannot, yea or must
not, include obedience, this being part of our debt to the Law, and to the
Lawgiver: nor will it prove, that there was nothing of Satisfaction in
Christ's obedience, which he performed in his state of humiliation. It is
true, where there is Satisfaction, there is &amp; may be Remission; but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
is not all, that we stand in need of. But he will have that obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
which Christ exhibited to the moral Law, no way penal: And his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, <hi>because it was required of man, in his innocency, &amp; imposed by God upon</hi>
Adam <hi>before his fall; Yea &amp; still lyeth &amp; shall lye to the dayes of eternity upon
men &amp; Angels. Ans.</hi> Yet for all this, it might be &amp; was penal unto Christ,
who was not meer man, but God &amp; man in one person: And for Him,
who was God, &amp; above all Law, that man cometh under, to subject him
self to that Law, which was imposed upon man, as a <hi>Viator,</hi> must needs be
penal, it being a part of his subjection, as made under the Law, &amp; a piece
of his humiliation, for thus, in part, <hi>he took upon him the forme of a servant,
&amp; was made in the likeness of men; &amp; being found in fashion, as a man, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himself, &amp; became obedient unto death. Phil.</hi> 2: 7, 8. Gal. 4: 4. What
they do, who are in glory, is not to the purpose; for here we are speaking
of the obedience &amp; subjection of such, as are <hi>Viators,</hi> &amp; not <hi>Comprehensors.</hi>
And <hi>Adam</hi> while innocent, was a <hi>Viator;</hi> and Christ, to pay that debt,
which was required of us all, as <hi>Viators,</hi> did humble himself to performe
the obedience of a <hi>Viator,</hi> in our place, &amp; in our stead, that so he might give
full satisfaction, &amp; pay our whole debt.</p>
               <p>From hence, there is no ground for his Inference, to wit, that. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
man was punished, &amp; that by order &amp; appointment of God, before his fall, &amp;
that now the glorified Saints &amp; Angels, yea &amp; Iesus Christ himself, are now pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
in heaven.</hi> For (1) it might be &amp; was penal to him, who was God,
which was duty unto man in innocency, as is cleared, &amp; (2) The Obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of Saints &amp; Angels, now in glory, &amp; far less that of Jesus Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
(if it can properly be called obedience) is not the duty of <hi>Viators,</hi> &amp;
therefore utterly impertinent to our purpose: We do not say, that <hi>Adam's</hi>
obedience was penal, it being his duty: but Christ's was, seing no Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
such obedience of him, who was God; nor was it necessary even to
his humane Nature, in order to life for himself: for the hypostatical union
fully removed that necessity, &amp; either made him, as to himself, in respect
of his humane nature, a <hi>comprehensor,</hi> or in the nearest capacity to it, even
when he was subjecting himself to the obedience of a <hi>Viator,</hi> for us, and as
standing in our room.</p>
               <p>But he saith, the <hi>Scriptures themselves no where ascribe this satisfaction to
Christ's Active obedience; but still to his passive.</hi> And here he citeth many
passages of Scripture, to no purpose, seing none of these give any hint of
the exclusion of his active obedience; but rather do include it; or else he
may as well say, that all Christ's active obedience was no way necessary, or
requisite, unto the work of Redemption; because these passages do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
say so; and yet this he will not say, seing he granteth, that his obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
was an essential requisite, &amp; absolutly necessary, to the constitution of
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:104357:223"/>
him our Priest, and his Sacrifice propitiatory: But we read of his being <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
under the Law, to redeem these, that were under the Law. Gal.</hi> 4: 4, 5. and of
his <hi>Righteousness &amp; obedience,</hi> as necessary to our Righteousness &amp; justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and as having a no less direct influence into the same; than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's</hi>
offence &amp; disobedience had unto our death &amp; damnation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5:

               <head type="sub">Christ underwent the Curse of the Law.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Goodwine</hi> tels us in his 14. Conclusion. <hi>That the sentence or Curse
of the Law was not properly executed upon Christ in his death: But this
death of Christ was a ground or consideration to God, where upon to dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
with his Law, &amp; to let fall or suspend the execution of the penalty, or curse
therein threatned. Ans.</hi> (1) This is directly contrary to what the Apostle saith
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 13. <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse
for us; for it is written, cursed is every one, that hangeth on a tree.</hi> It was the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of the Law, that we were under, &amp; were to be delivered from; and
this Christ hath delivered us from, by coming in our stead &amp; bearing it for
us, yea bearing it so, that he is said to have been made it, <hi>being made a
Curse for us,</hi> which is a most emphatick expression, to hold forth Christ's
bearing the very penalty, threatned in the Law, which cursed every one,
that continued not in all things, which are written in the book of the Law
to do them. <hi>vers. 10. Deut.</hi> 27: 26. If Christ underwent the Curse of the
Law, he, sure, did suffer the very sentence, or punishment threatned in the
Law; for the Curse of the Law can import no other thing. (2) If Christ did
not bear the sentence or Curse of the Law, how could he be said to have
died or suffered in our place, room or stead? No man is said to suffer in the
place &amp; stead of another, who doth not suffer that same particular kind of
punishment, that the other is obnoxious to, and is obliged to suffer. (3)
Why was Christ said to be <hi>made sin for us 2. Cor.</hi> 5: 21. &amp; to <hi>bear our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
Esai.</hi> 53: 6. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 24. If he did not undergoe the very punishment;
that was due to us, because of sin? (4) This is to give away the cause, in a
great measure, unto the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who will not yeeld, that Christ's death
was any satisfaction to the justice, or payment of our criminal debt, or a
suffering the punishment of sin, due to us; for if Christ did not suffer the
curse &amp; sentence of the Law, he did not suffer the punishment, which the
Law threatned, and justice required; he did not suffer any punishment at
all, if he suffered not our punishment, or that which was due to us; he did
not stand in our Law-place to answere all the demands of justice according to
what we were liable unto by the Law? nor did he bear our sins in his own
body on the cross. (5) If Christ's death was a ground or consideration to
God, whereupon to dispense with his Law; then it is apparent, that the
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:104357:223"/>
consideration of Christ's death was anterior to the dispensing with the Law:
whereas the contrary is rather true, to wit, that the Lord's dispensing with
the Law, was anteriour to his sending of Christ, because the Law properly
knowing no mediator, and requiring none to suffer the penalty for another,
must first, in order of nature, be considered, as dispensed with, before
Christ be substituted in the room of sinners to undergo what they deserved.
(6) If it was only a ground to God, whereupon to let fall, or suspend the
execution of the penalty, then it seemeth, Christ's death was no full
payment, or Satisfaction; for a full Satisfaction requireth more than
a suspension of the execution of the punishment, even a full delivery the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re-from.</p>
               <p>Let us heare his reason. <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>the threatning &amp; Curse of the
Law was not at all bent or intended against the innocent or Righteous, but against
transgressours only. Therefore God in inflicting death upon Christ being innocent and
Righteous, did not follow the purport or intent of the Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>but in sparing &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
the transgressours (who according to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the Law should have bin pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished)
manifestly dispenseth with the Law, and doth not execute it. Ans.</hi> All
this being granted, yet it will not follow, that the sentence &amp; Curse of the
Law was not executed upon Christ in his death: for notwithstanding of this
dispensing with the Law, as to the <hi>persons;</hi> Yet was there no Relaxation of
the Law, as to the <hi>punishment</hi> threatned? Though the Law did not require,
that the innocent should suffer; Yet the Supream Lord &amp; Ruler dispensing
with his own Law so far, as to substitute an innocent person, in the room
&amp; place of sinners, the Law required, that that innocent person, taking
on that penalty, and thereby making himself nocent, as to the penalty, should
suffer the same that was threatned, &amp; consequently bear the Curse, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Law.</p>
               <p>As (saith he further for explication) <hi>when</hi> Zaleucus (<hi>the</hi> Locrian Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver)
<hi>caused one of his own eyes to be put out, that one of his son's eyes might be
spared, who according both to the letter &amp; intent of the Law, should have lost both,
he did not precisely execute the Law, but gave a sufficient account or consideration,
why it should for that time be dispensed with. Ans.</hi> This speaks not home to our
case, wherein we pay not the half, nor no part of the penalty. But Christ
payeth the whole, as substitute in our room. If <hi>Zaleucus</hi> had substituted
himself in the room of his son, &amp; suffered both his own eyes to be put out,
though the Law had been dispensed with, as to the persons, yet the penalty
of the loss of both eyes had been payed, &amp; the same punishment, which
the Law required, had been exacted: And so it is in our case, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.</p>
               <p>Yet he granteth, that in some sense, Christ may be said to have suffered
the penalty or Curse of the Law; as 1. <hi>It was the Curse or penalty of the Law</hi>
(saith he) <hi>as now hanging over the head of the world, &amp; ready to be executed upon
all men for sin, that occasioned his sufferings. Ans.</hi> If this were all, all the beasts
&amp; senseless creatures, may be as well said to have suffered the penalty
&amp; Curse of the Law; &amp; consequently to have suffered for man &amp; to have
born mans sin, in order to his Redemption, as Christ; for the sin, &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:104357:224"/>
of sin, whereunto man was liable, did occasion their suffering, or being
subjected to vanity <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 20, 21. Thus our whole Redemption is subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
&amp; the cause yeelded unto the wicked <hi>Socinians,</hi> for if this be so, Christ
had not our sins laid upon him, he did not beare our sins in his body on the
tree, he was not wounded for our transgressions, the chastisement of our
peace was not on him; He was not made sin for us. He was not our Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
&amp; High Priest; He died not in our room &amp; stead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Againe</hi> 2. (saith he) (<hi>&amp; some what more properly) Christ may be said to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
suffered the Curse of the Law, because the things, which he suffered were of the
same nature &amp; kinde (at least in part) with these things, which God intended by
the Curse of the Law. Ans.</hi> Though this seemeth to come nigher to the truth,
than the former; Yet it cannot give full satisfaction, untill it be explained,
what that <hi>part,</hi> is in respect of which, only Christ's sufferings were of the
same Nature &amp; kinde, with what the Law threatned. Let us hear therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
what followeth; &amp; see if thence satisfaction can come. <hi>But if by the Curse</hi>
(saith he) <hi>of the Law, we understand either that entire systeme &amp; historical body
(as it were) of penalties &amp; evils, which the Law itself intends in the terme; or
else include &amp; take-in the intent of the Law, as touching the quality of the persons,
upon whom is was to be executed; in neither of these senses, did Christ suffer the
Curse of the Law. Ans.</hi> (1) This doth not explaine to us, what that part is, in
which Christ sufferings are of the same Nature &amp; kind, with what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the Curse of the Law. (2) There is need of explication here, to
make us understand, what is that <hi>entire Systeme &amp; historical body</hi> of penalties
&amp; evils, which the Law itself intends in the terme <hi>Curse,</hi> or <hi>death:</hi> for this
is but to explaine one dark thing by what is more dark; &amp; so can give no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
(3) But if the alternative added be explicative, &amp; so the two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
here mentioned be one &amp; the same; then we deny, that that doth
properly belong to the essence of the penalty, as threatned in the Law: that
is, every thing that necessarily attended the punishment, as inflicted on
man, did not directly &amp; essentially belong thereunto, as threatned by the
Law, such as the everlastingness of death, despaire, &amp; the like necessarily
accompanying this punishment inflicted on sinners; so that notwithstanding
Christ did not, neither could, endure these accidental &amp; consequential
evils; Yet he both did &amp; might be said to suffer the Curse &amp; death threatned
by the Law, which is to be abstracted from what floweth not from the Law
itself, but meerly from the Nature of the subject, or Condition of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
punished. But it may be, these words of his, <hi>the intent of the Law, as
touching the quality of the persons, upon whom it was to be executed,</hi> have some
other import, &amp; that he meaneth, hereby no more but this, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Law was, that the sinner should suffer: And indeed if so, it was
impossible, that Christ's sufferings could answere the intent of the Law: But
we have said above, that as to this, the Law was dispensed with; &amp; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
Christ the substitute Sufferer did suffer the same kinde of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
that the Law threatned under the termes of <hi>Death</hi> &amp; <hi>Curse.</hi> What
he addeth Further can give no Satisfaction. <hi>So that God</hi> (saith he) <hi>required
the death &amp; sufferings of Christ, not that the Law properly, either in the letter or
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:104357:224"/>
intention of it, might be executed; but on the contrary, that it might not be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
I meane upon those, who being otherwise ohnoxious unto it should beleeve.
Ans.</hi> Though it be true, that God required the death &amp; sufferings of Christ,
not that the Law either in the letter or intention of it might be executed, as
to that, wherein it was dispensed with: Yet God required the death &amp; suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of Christ, that the letter &amp; intent of the Law might be executed, as
to that wherein it was not dispensed with: that is, as to the punishment
therein threatned; And unless the Law, as to this, had been executed, no
man obnoxious to it, should have escaped, and that because of the Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of God, yea &amp; because of his justice, which he had determined to have
Satisfied, ere sinfull man should escape the punishment.</p>
               <p>In the next place he tels us, that <hi>God did not require the death &amp; sufferings of
Christ, as a valuable consideration, where on to dispence with his Law towards
those that beleeve, more (if so much) in a way of Satisfaction to his justice, than
to his wisdom. Ans.</hi> This savoureth rankly of <hi>Socinianisme.</hi> It is not for us to
make such comparisons, as if God's Wisdom &amp; justice were not at full agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and were not one. The Scripture tels us, that <hi>God set forth Iesus Christ
ts be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his Righteousness for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins that are past, To declare, I say, at this time his Righteousness,
that he might be just &amp; the justifier of him, which beleeveth in Iesus. Rom.</hi> 3: 25,
26. And so it is manifest, that Satisfaction to justice was hereby intended:
And this is enough to us, who know also, that in the whole contrivance of
the business, the Infinite Wisdom of God is eminently relucent; And Love
not to make any such comparisons: only we think, that a <hi>Propitiation,</hi> and
<hi>Satisfaction,</hi> &amp; the like termes, used in Scripture, in the expressing of this
matter, have a direct aspect, &amp; bear a manifest relation unto justice, and
correspond di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ectly there with, yea clearly enough inferre the same, though
there were no other mention made expresly of the justice of God, in this
matter.</p>
               <p>What saith he next to prove this. <hi>for (doubtless) God might</hi> (saith he)
<hi>with as much justice, as wisdom (if not much more) have passed by the er ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of his Law, without consideration of satisfaction. Ans.</hi> What God might
have done by his absolute Soveraignity, antecedent to his designe &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as to the punishment, or the <hi>reatus poenae</hi> (which must not be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the <hi>reatus culpae</hi>) is not to the question. But now, the Lord, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
declared his determination &amp; purpose to rule &amp; governe the world
thus, &amp; to have the glory of his relative justice manifested in the Salvation
of lost man, could not according to justice, passe by transgressions, without
a satisfaction. He adds. <hi>No man will say, that in case a man hath bin injured
&amp; wronged, that therefore he is absolutly bound in justice, to seek satisfaction,
though he be never so eminent in the grace &amp; practice of justice: but in many cases
of injuries sustained, a man may be bound, in point of wisdom, &amp; discretion, to
seek satisfaction in one kind or other. Ans.</hi> This is the <hi>Socinian</hi> way of argueing:
&amp; nothing to the pointe; for we are to look upon the Lord in this matter,
not as a private man, who may dispense with injuries done him; but as a
Righteous Governour, who is resolved to demonstrate his justice &amp; equitie,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:104357:225"/>
and who therefore cannot suffer sin to go unpunished without a due satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
had, for the violation of his Lawes.</p>
               <p>Nor is it to the point to tell us, that some hold, that God, if it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him, might have pardoned <hi>Adam's</hi> transgression, without the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made by the death of Christ: for they speak not of what God may
now do, having determined to manifest the glory of his justice; but what
he might have done <hi>in signorationis ante decretum.</hi> And as for that word <hi>Heb.</hi>
2: 11. <hi>It became him.</hi> &amp;c. it will as well respect the justice of God as his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
seing it became him upon the account of justice, which he would have
glorified.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Confess. Chap.</hi> IX. <hi>Sect. 5. pag.</hi> 289. thinketh that to say,
<hi>that Christ paid the same thing, that the Law required of us, &amp; not only satisfied
for our not payment, is to subvert the substance of Religion:</hi> But this is only in
his apprehension, &amp; as he taketh up their meaning, who say so; And others
possibly may have no lower thoughts of some, who hold, that <hi>Christ only gave
such a sacrifice to God, as might be a valuable consideration, on which he might
grant us the benefites, on such conditions as are most sutable to his ends &amp; honour;
&amp; that he did not suffer the same, which the Law threatned.</hi> The screwing up of
differences to such an hight, as to make either the one, or the other, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versive
of the substance of Religion, had need to be upon clear &amp; undeniable
grounds, and not founded on meer sandy and loose consequences, such as
those seem to me, by which <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> maketh out this Charge.</p>
               <p>For he tels us. <hi>The</hi> Idem <hi>is the perfect obedience, or the full punishment that
the Law requires. It is</hi> supplicium ipsius delinquentis. <hi>Ans.</hi> But now, seing
such as say, that Christ paid the <hi>Idem,</hi> will say as well as he, that when
Christ suffered that, which they call the <hi>Idem,</hi> the person himself that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
did not suffer: And I would enquire at <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> whether paid
Christ the <hi>Idem,</hi> as to all other respects beside; that is, whether Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
all that penalty, which the Law did threaten to transgressours only
this excepted (which must be excepted) that he did it in another person, &amp;
that he was not the person himself, that sinned, or not? If he say, <hi>Not,</hi>
then the difference goeth deeper; but why doth he not then, to make out
this heavy charge, Instance some particulars, threatned in the Law, which
Christ did not undergo? And why doth he insist only on this one, that he
was not <hi>ipse delinquens.</hi> but another person? If he grant that in all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
Christ paid the <hi>Idem;</hi> no man, sure, can see such difference here,
as shall make the one side subvert the Substance of Religion: for it is a meer
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ife about a word; &amp; it cometh all to this, whether when one man layeth
down his life, to save another condemned to death, after all satisfaction in
money, lands, rents service, or what else, hath been rejected, he can be
said to pay the <hi>Idem,</hi> which the Law required, or not? Some Lawyers
would possibly say, he did pay, or suffer the <hi>Idem;</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would say not,
because he was not <hi>ipsa persona delinquens,</hi> was not the very person, that was
condemned, but another. And yet death, unto which the other man was
condemned, was inflicted upon him, and no less would be accepted as satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
at his hands; which would make some say, that all that debate,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:104357:225"/>
whether it was the <hi>same,</hi> or the <hi>equivalent,</hi> were a meer needless contest
about a word. And if it be but just so here, in our present debate, every
one will judge it very hard, to call that a subversion of Religion, which,
after examination &amp; trial, is found to be but a strife about a word. Now,
how will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> prove that the suffering of the <hi>Idem,</hi> is only, when it is
<hi>supplicium ipsius delinquentis?</hi> And not also, when the same punishment, in
all its essential ingredients, is undergone &amp; suffered by another? When the
Law imposeth the penalty of death, or of such a great summe of money, on
a person transgressing such a Law; common discourse would say, &amp; I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Law give allowance thereto, that, when another came, &amp; payed
the same penalty for him, without the least abatement, he payed the same
penalty, which he Law impofed, and not another; and not meerly a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
consideration. It is true, the Law threatened only the transgressour,
&amp; obliged him to suffer; but notwithstanding, another might pay the very
same thing, which the Law threatned &amp; requireth.</p>
               <p>He saith next (p. 290.) <hi>the Law never threatned a Surety: nor granteth any
liberty of substitution: that was an act of God above the Law? If therefore the
thing due were payed, it was we ourselves morally or legally, that suffered. Ans.</hi>
Sure, some Lawes of men will threaten Sureties, &amp; grant liberty of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
too: But if he speak here only of the Law of God, we grant; that
it threatned only the transgressour; &amp; that it was an act of God above the
Law, &amp; dispensing therewith, that granted a substitution; Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of this it is not proved, that that Substitute did not, or could not,
suffer the same punishment, which the Law threatned. And if <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>
think, that the lawes not threatning a Surety, nor granting liberty of a
substitution, will prove it; it is denied. Next His other consequence is as
uncleare, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the thing due were payed, it was we ourselves that
suffered personally: all these consequences run upon the first false ground,
that no man can pay the <hi>Idem,</hi> but the very transgressour. What he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
by, <hi>we ourselves morally,</hi> he would do well to explicate. And as for <hi>legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
we ourselves may be said to do legally, what our Surety &amp; undertaker
doth for us. And if this be all he meaneth, <hi>viz.</hi> that if the thing due (to wit
by Law, as threatned there) be payed, either we in our own persons, or
our Surety for us, &amp; in our room &amp; Law place, payed it, it is true, but
subversive of his <hi>hypothesis:</hi> It must then be some other thing that he meaneth
by <hi>morally</hi> or <hi>legally</hi> &amp; it must be the same with, or equivalent to <hi>personally:</hi>
or the like; but his next words cleare his meaning; for he addeth; <hi>And it
would not be ourselves legally, because it was not ourselves naturally.</hi> And what
lawyer, I pray, will yeeld to this reason? I suppose, they will tell us, that
we are said to do that legally, which our Cautioner, or Surety doth for us.
But if he think otherwayes here also, that nothing can be accounted to be
done by us <hi>legally,</hi> but what is done by our selves <hi>Naturally</hi> (which is a word
of many significations, &amp; might occasion much discourse) that is, <hi>personally;</hi>
Yet it will not follow, that no other can suffer the <hi>Idem,</hi> that was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but the delinquent himself.</p>
               <p>At length he tels us, That <hi>if it had been ourselves legally, then the strickest
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:104357:226"/>
justice could not have denied us a present &amp; perfect deliverance</hi> ipso facto, <hi>seing
no justice can demand more, than the</hi> idem quod dehitur (rather <hi>debetur) the
whole debt of obedience or punishment. Ans.</hi> But what if ourselves, in our own
natural persons, had undergone the penalty, had we therefore <hi>ipso facto</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a perfect deliverance? It will be confessed, I suppose, that all that
underlye this punishment, underlye it for ever: how then doth their legall
suffering the <hi>idem</hi> helpe them? If it be said, that they must eternally suffer,
because never able to suffer so, as to make satisfaction: Yet still it is obvious,
that their undergoing the <hi>idem</hi> in their own persons naturally, doth not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
them, as to a present &amp; perfect deliverance <hi>ipso facto,</hi> or ever at all.
And where is then the truth of this axiome? Or where is its pertinency to
our purpose? When a man is punished with death, according to the Law,
is he <hi>ipso facto</hi> presently &amp; perfectly delivered? It seemeth then, that the
paying of the <hi>Idem,</hi> yea, or the <hi>tantund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m</hi> by another person, is more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
for their liberation, than their paying of the <hi>Idem</hi> in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
And againe the Law, in many cases granteth liberation, even when
the <hi>Idem</hi> in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> sense is payed, that is, when another payeth down the
same: Yea &amp; likewise if the Creditor be satisfied, when another thing
is payed: So that neither part of this assertion holdeth true, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally.</p>
               <p>But yet some may say; That if the <hi>Idem</hi> or the very same, were payed by
Christ, our liberation should immediatly follow. I <hi>Ans.</hi> It will not follow;
so if we, in our own persons, had made full payment of that debt of suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
(which is impossible to be done in time) it might be granted, that
actuall liberation would immediatly follow: but when we did not this, in
our own persons; but Christ made full payment of what the Law could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
by way of punishment, or threatned, for us, it will not follow, that
our deliverance should immediatly follow thereupon: and the reason is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was such a paying of the <hi>Idem,</hi> as was refusable, and as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
provided out of wonderful love &amp; free grace; and was accorded unto by
a mutual compact, according to the free &amp; wise Conditions of which the
benefites were to be given out.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Cath. Theol. part.</hi> 2. n. 48. saith, <hi>the Very</hi> nature <hi>&amp;</hi> Reason
<hi>of the</hi> Satisfactoriness <hi>of Christ's sufferings was not in being the very</hi> same <hi>either in</hi>
kind, <hi>or in</hi> degree, <hi>which were due to all for whom he suffered.</hi> Whence we
see, that he denieth, that Christ suffered the same, either in <hi>kind,</hi> or in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi>
that was due by the Law to those for whom he suffered. His reason, why
they could not be the same, which was due by the Law, he giveth (n. 49.)
is the same we heard before <hi>viz. The Law made it due to the sinner himself.</hi>
Which notwithstanding, it might be the same both as to kind &amp; degree,
which Christ suffered, that the Law made due; the substitution of a new
person, that the Law did not provide, altereth not the punishment either as
to kind, or as to degree. He addeth: <hi>and</hi> anothers <hi>suffering for him ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

not the Law (which never said</hi> either thou, or another for thee shall die) <hi>but
only satisfyeth the</hi> Law-giver, <hi>as he is above his own</hi> Law, <hi>&amp; could</hi> dispense
<hi>with is, his</hi> justice <hi>being satisfied &amp; saved,</hi> dum alius solvit, aliud solvitur.
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:104357:226"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Though the Law intend only the punishment of the transgressour; Yet
when the Law-giver dispenseth with the Law, &amp; accepteth of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp; suffering of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not <hi>eo spso,</hi> that it is the punishment &amp; suffering of another, become diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in kind &amp; degree from the punishment enjoyned by the Law; as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious;
when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ne man suffereth death for another, the Law being dispensed
with, that made death due to the transgressour himself: his death doth not
become <hi>eoipso,</hi> that it is the death of another, than of him that transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
another kind of death, ar distinct as to degrees; it may be the same
as to both: And yet this is all the force of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> argument, <hi>dum alius
solvit, aliud solvitur;</hi> which whether it be a certaine &amp; universal rule in the
Law, I much doubt: but though it were : Yet no man can hence inferre,
that <hi>aliud quoad genus &amp; gradus,</hi> eo <hi>ipso solvitur:</hi> for it is a rule in logick,
that <hi>a genere ad speciem non sequitur affirmativ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> so that though, when the
Law requireth, that he who sinneth shall suffer, &amp; die, &amp; another suffereth
&amp; dieth, in the room &amp; stead of him who sinned, it may be said, that in so
farr <hi>aliud solvitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> Yet it cannot be hence inferred, that the death or suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of him, who sinned not, is quite of another kind, &amp; differeth in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
from that death, which the Law made due to the sinner.</p>
               <p>He mentioneth afterward in the 2, 3, 4. &amp; 5. places some particulars,
which were not in Christ's sufferings, &amp; yet would have been in the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of sinners themselves: But all this is to no purpose; for the question is
not, whether Christ's sufferings were the same every way with the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of the damned, as to all circumstances, &amp; consequents, flowing from
the Condition of sinners suffering; But whether they were the same, as to
kind, with that death &amp; Curse, which was threatned in the Law, by way
of punishment, &amp; which was therefore due by Law unto the transgressour.
Let us now see the particulars. 2. <hi>And</hi> sin (saith he) <hi>itself (though not as sin</hi>)
<hi>was the greatest part of the sinners</hi> punishment. <hi>To be alienated from God, &amp;
not to Love him &amp; delight in him, but to be corrupted &amp; deluded &amp; tormented by
concupiscence. Ans.</hi> These are indeed necessary consequents of sin in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who is a sinner, and are consequently punishment; but not directly
such; neither were they threatned as punishments by the Law, &amp; so do not
belong to the essence &amp; substance of that punishment, which the Law threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
&amp; which Christ was called to undertake. 3. Saith he. <hi>And the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat
unavoidable consequents resulting from sin itself, were punishments, which
Christ did never undergo, (as to be</hi> hateful <hi>&amp;</hi> displeasing <hi>to God, as contrary to
his holy nature, to be</hi> related <hi>as</hi> criminal, <hi>to lose</hi> right <hi>to God's</hi> Favour <hi>&amp;</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<hi>Ans.</hi> To be hateful &amp; displeasing unto God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> agreeth only to a creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
(which God doth not hate, as such) as a sinner inherently: and though
Christ did not feel God's hatred &amp; anger against his own person, yet he felt
his anger &amp; hatred against sin, &amp; sinners. And Christ was also related as
<hi>Criminal,</hi> not inherently, but by imputation, when he was <hi>made sin for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s.
2. Cor.</hi> 5: 21. The sinner that is such inherently only, loseth right to God's
Favour, &amp; Christ missed the sense thereof, when he cried out, <hi>my God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken me? And</hi> 4. (saith he) <hi>none of the further punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:104357:227"/>
which supposed real faultiness, could fall on Christ, as the torment of an</hi>
accusing conscience, <hi>for rejecting &amp; offending God, for casting away our own fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
&amp; running into hell &amp;c. the sense of God's</hi> hatred of us, <hi>as</hi> real sinners. <hi>Ans.</hi>
All this is granted, but these belonged only to the punishment as inflicted on
the sinner &amp; transgressour himself, but did not belong to its essence &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
abstractly confidered, &amp; so could not accompany the same, as infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
upon one, who was in himself wholly free of all sin. And this is yet
more manifest in that which he mentioneth. 5. Saying <hi>much less the</hi> Deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Spirit of holiness, <hi>to be left without</hi> goodness, <hi>in a state of sin, &amp;
to</hi> hate God <hi>for his justice &amp; holiness, which will be the damneds</hi> case; for these
did not belong to the essence &amp; substance of the punishment, threatned in
the Law; but were only consequents thereof, as inflicted on sinners inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently.
We do not say, that Christ suffered, what the damned do suffer,
or that he was in the damneds case. Thus, though we make them not of the
same kind, with all that the damned do suffer; Yet without any blind zeal
(as he is pleased to censure) we may say, that Christ suffered the same cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
&amp; death, that was threatned in the Law properly, as a punishments,
as to substance; and yet no way be guilty of intollerable blaspheming of our
Saviour.</p>
               <p>The same answer may serve to that, which he saith (n. 50.) <hi>Nor could
Christ's</hi> sufferings <hi>be equal in</hi> degree, intensively <hi>&amp;</hi> extensivly, <hi>to all that was
deserved by the world, as is easily discernable by perusing what is now said, seing
our deserved suffering lay in things of such a nature, as to</hi> be left in sin itself, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of God's image &amp; love &amp; communion, <hi>under</hi> his hatred, tormented
in conscience, <hi>besides</hi> the ever-lasting torments in hell, <hi>which are more than
these, upon all the millions of sinners, which were redeemed.</hi> This is already
answered: &amp; it is not demonstrated, that all these consequents &amp; concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the punishment, as inflicted on such as were sinners inherently, did
properly belong to the essence &amp; substance of the punishment threatned, in
itself considered; And of this we only speak, for as to this, we only say,
that Christ suffered the same. If two men be condemned to pay, each a
thousand pounds, which none of them are well able to do, &amp; a rich man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh
to pay the summe for one of the two, that rich man may well be
said to have payed the same summe, that the poor man was obliged to pay,
though his paying of that summe be not attended with such consequents &amp;
circumstances, as it would have been, if the poor man himself had been put
to pay it, or as the other poor man findeth it, who is made to pay it; in the
poor man it is necessarily attended with poverty to himself &amp; all his family,
&amp; possibly he &amp; all his must be sold for slaves to make up the summe; but the
rich man can pay it without any such concomitants, or consequents, &amp; yet
be said to have payed the same summe.</p>
               <p>It is to be observed, that <hi>Papists</hi> &amp; some others use all these same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove, that Christ did not suffer any thing of the penalty of sin in
his soul, as may be particularly seen in <hi>Parker de descensu lib.</hi> 3. But Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
granteth (n. 51.) that Christ did suffer more in soul, than in body: And
yet what answers are made by <hi>Parker</hi> &amp; other reformed divines, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:104357:227"/>
against Papist's, may also serve our turn against Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> &amp; others:
<hi>Socinians</hi> also, (as may be seen in <hi>Smalci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Refut. lib. de Satisf. Christ Chap.</hi> 6.
&amp; 7.) upon these same grounds, deny, that Christ's sufferings were a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
satisfaction, he thereby not paying the <hi>Idem,</hi> the same, that man should
have suffered. And <hi>Socinus Prael. Theol. Cap.</hi> 18. fol. 205. saith in plaine ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
That Christ did no way satishe the justice of God by his sufferings,
unless it be said, that he suffered the same things, which we should have
suffered because of our sins. Therefore there is a necessity, to hold that
Christ suffered the same for substance, that the Elect were liable to suffer,
that it may the more clearly appear, that his sufferings were indeed a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tels us, in the same book (n. 149.) <hi>that</hi> Solution <hi>of the</hi>
debt <hi>&amp;</hi> satisfaction, <hi>strickly taken, thus differ, that</hi> Satisfaction <hi>is</hi> solutio tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidem,
vel aequivalentis, alias indebiti. <hi>And if Christ be said to have paid
the very</hi> same duty <hi>&amp;</hi> punishment, <hi>which the Law required, he is denied to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve</hi>
satisfied, <hi>for our</hi> non-payment; <hi>for a Law that is fully performed can requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
no more, nor the</hi> Law-giver <hi>neither: And therefore both</hi> Satisfaction <hi>&amp;</hi> Pardon
<hi>are shut out. Ans.</hi> Thus we seem to be hardly straitned, for if we say, that
Christ paid the <hi>Idem,</hi> the <hi>Same, Mr. Baxter</hi> thinketh we destroy thereby
all Satisfiction &amp; all Pardon, and so yeeld the cause to the <hi>Socinians:</hi> If
upon the other hand, we say, that Christ did not suffer the <hi>Idem,</hi> we yeeld
the cause unto the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and deny all Satisfaction, in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er judgment;
and their consequence seemeth to be as rational, as Mr. <hi>Baxter's.</hi> But truth
may be affirmed, without all hazard: And to make such a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Solution</hi> &amp; <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> is to play needlesly upon words, &amp; at length will
but recurre unto this, <hi>Sialius solvit, aliud solvitur;</hi> and so by saying that
Christ's Satisfaction was also <hi>a solutio ejusdem,</hi> we shall deny both Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
&amp; Pardon; or by calling it so: But, as was said above, it is not fit to
lay so much weight upon the simple use of a <hi>terme</hi> or <hi>word;</hi> and sure it is most
unfit for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to do so, who on all occasions, venteth his displeasure so
much against others, who lay so much weight on meet <hi>termes of art,</hi> or
<hi>words.</hi> But, as to the thing, sure, the creditor will think himself satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
when the same summe, which was oweing by one, is payed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
for the debitor, &amp; that in the same <hi>species</hi> of Silver, or of Gold. And
if that hold, that <hi>sialius solvit, aliud solvitur, Mr. Baxter</hi> may see, that
if another pay, his payment may become a Satisfaction, because it is so far
<hi>aliud</hi> another thing, though really &amp; upon the matter, it be the same. And
here lieth the truth, that we assert, Christ paid the very same suffering,
that we were obliged to pay; but he being another, and not the persons
guilty themselves, his sufferings were not only <hi>a solutio debiti,</hi> a payment of
our debt, but also, as being performed by him, they were a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to
justice, and so much the rather a compleet Satisfaction, that they were the
same sufferings, we were liable to, &amp; not strickly equivalent. And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
to me the more clear from what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> said before (n. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. &amp;
53.) where he hath these words. [<hi>The true reason of the</hi> Satisfactorieness <hi>of
Christ's suffering was,</hi> that they were a most apt meanes for the demonstration
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:104357:228"/>
of the Governing justice, holiness, Wisdom &amp; Mercy of God, by which
God could attaine to the ends of the Law &amp; Government, better than by exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
the Law on the world in its destruction.] Where we hear no word of
its being <hi>solutio equivalentis alias indebiti.</hi> and next, all this is more clear by
Christ's suffering the very same, that we were to suffer, than by saying that
he suffered some other thing; The most clear demonstration of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
justice of God was in exacting of Christ the full penalty, &amp; the very
same punishment both in Soul &amp; Body, that the Law of God made due unto
transgressours; No other thing could give such a demonstration hereof, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
could not have required more; and justice had not fully been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by exacting less: and the exacting of the very same, both as to Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
and as to degrees keeped a just correspondence with the requisite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of the Governing justice of God. Hereby also was his Holiness
Wisdom &amp; Mercy, whereby he attained the ends of the Law &amp; Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
most clearly manifested, when he did not execute the Law upon the
sinful world, but upon the substituted Cautioner, that the Elect world
might be saved: This, I am sure, was evidently a full <hi>salvo to Gods justice,</hi>
when the same punishment was paid down, that Law &amp; justice called for.
Not that <hi>God might give pardon &amp; life to sinners, upon the new termes of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace</hi> (as he speaketh n. 53.) for that looketh too like the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Satisfaction : as if nothing but a possibility &amp; freedom were here obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for God to bestow pardon &amp; life, upon such conditions; whereby not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
of this Satisfaction, it might come to passe, that not one
should be saved. See <hi>Colloq. Hag.</hi> p. 172. <hi>Impetratio salutis pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Cathol. Theol. part.</hi> 2. n. 176. speaketh thus. <hi>It is
ordinary</hi> (saith he) <hi>with some writers &amp; preachers, to tell men, that</hi>
no part of their Righteousness is in themselves, <hi>&amp; with others, that
at least,</hi> none which they are justified, by in any part is in them; <hi>And that it
is</hi> all in Christ only: <hi>And that nature is loth to yeeld to this, but thinketh it a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:104357:228"/>
thing, to have some little part of the honour to itself: And as to the honour of a
good Action, if it be but 999. parts, that it ascribeth to God, &amp; taketh one part
of a thousand to ourselves, it is a dangerous arrogation: We must have none.</hi> And
it might be thought, that such as ever understood the Gospel, considered
the particular expressions, used in Scripture, to abase man, yea &amp; the whole
Contrivance of the Gospel Salvation, through a Crucified Cautioner, and
that such as ever understood &amp; were acquanted with the Natural Pride, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
&amp; Treacherie of their own heart; and had any experience in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
of Satan, in &amp; about wakened consciences, to keep them from an hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
closing with &amp; willing accepting of, and cleanly resting upon the way of
Salvation, revealed in the Gospel, should be far from condemning this
saying, &amp; from making exceptions against it. But indeed, the grounds,
that <hi>Papists, Socinians</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminians</hi> lay down, as the Basis of their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evangelick
Fabrick, &amp; Contrivance of the way of Salvation, are more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to <hi>Self,</hi> and are therefore the more cordially embraced by many,
&amp; more stiffly maintained. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> seemeth to say here, that these are
different things, to say, That <hi>no part of our Righteousness is in ourselves,</hi> and
<hi>that no part of our Righteousness, by which we are justified, is in ourselves,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
with the Orthodox, these are but different expressions of the same thing;
for when they deny a Righteousness within ourselves, it is not a denying of
begun Holiness &amp; Sanctification; but a denying of a Righteousness as the
ground of justification, for all this they acknowledge to be wholly &amp; only in
Christ, <hi>the Lord our Righteousness.</hi> And to adjoine to this, the Question
about the honour of a good Action, as whether that should be wholly ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to God, or <hi>one</hi> part of a <hi>Thousand</hi> may not be ascribed to ourselves; is
neither very savourie in itself, nor pertinent to the clearing of the other.</p>
               <p>But what answereth Mr. <hi>Baxter? This</hi> (saith he) <hi>well explained may be
made sound : But thus grosly delivered, it is but a popular cheat, under the taking
Pretence</hi> of self abasement <hi>&amp;</hi> giving Christ all. <hi>Ans.</hi> I should readily feare,
that Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> explication should be so far from making the expressions
sounder than they are, that it should rather prove a Commentary corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the text, seing I finde him thus dissatisfied with expressions so consonant
to the straine of the Gospel, to the holy genius of all savingly illuminated,
and to the very language of the Saints, in Scripture. But as to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
calling this no less than <hi>a popular cheat,</hi> it is sharpe, and, more
befitting, in my judgment, a <hi>Papist,</hi> or a Non-Christian <hi>Socinian,</hi> than
<hi>Mr. Baxter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet let us hear the ground of this so sharp &amp; so unseemly censure. <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
(saith he) <hi>is as willing as any one, that you should have nothing honourable
or praiseworthie in you; &amp; be as vile, as he can make you. Ans.</hi> If it would not
be displeasing, I would say, that this answere is a plaine cheat: for the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is not, whether we should have any thing in us, truely honourable &amp;
praise worthie, or whether we should be as vile, as the devil would make
us; No protestant ever spoke so; But the question is. Whether for any
thing in us truely honourable &amp; praise worthie, we should Sacrifice to our
own net, &amp; burne incense to our own drag; or give the glory unto God,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:104357:229"/>
who worketh all our works in us; and worketh in us both to will, &amp; to do
<hi>Esai.</hi> 26: 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2: 13. The question is not, whether we should have good
in us, or not? but whether we should not say, with <hi>Paul 1. Cor.</hi> 4: 4. Even
when we know nothing by ourselves, yet are we not hereby justified? and
whether we should not say with him <hi>Phil,</hi> 3: 8, 9. that we count all things
but loss, for the excellency of the knowledg of Christ Jesus, our Lord, &amp; count
them dung, that we may win Christ, &amp; be found in him, not having our
own Righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the
Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith. The question
is not, whether Christ be made Sanctification to us; but whether that San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
be any part of that Righteousness, which Christ is made of God
to be unto us? What more?</p>
               <p>He addeth. <hi>It is God, who</hi> honoureth these, that honour him, <hi>&amp; praiseth
his Saints,</hi> as the excellent on the Earth, <hi>&amp; his</hi> Jewels &amp; peculiar Treasure,
<hi>adorneth with his own</hi> lovely image, &amp; partakers of the divine Nature, and
members of Christ, as his own flesh. <hi>And it is Satan &amp; wicked men that vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
&amp; dishonour them. Ans.</hi> This is but a Continuance of the same cheat: for
it is no part of the question, whether the Saints should be vilified, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured?
But the question is, whether the Saints should rob God of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and ascribe that unto themselves, which is due unto him, be it in less,
or in more? We know, the Saints are God's excellent ones, his Jewels &amp;
his peculiar treasure; but all this is through the free underserved grace of
God, making them beautiful &amp; lovely with his own graces, and partakers
of his divine Nature: And therefore we say, that for all that they ought to
be humble, knowing what their birth &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ativity was, and whence all this
is come; and who ought to have the glory of all this; and notwithstanding
of this, what is the sole ground of their justification before God, and what
is that Righteousness, upon the account whereof they are justified in the
sight of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I have oft lamented it</hi> (saith he furder) <hi>that these very men, that hold this
kind of doctrine of self-abosement, as having no part</hi> of Righteousness, <hi>nor sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
at all in any</hi> good work, <hi>are yet too oft so proudly conceited of their own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
(<hi>even for holding, that</hi> they have none for which they are praise worthie)
<hi>as that their pride is no small trouble to the Churches &amp; all about them. Ans.</hi> I shall
not plead for pride, or proud conceits in any: but whether such as lay down
doctrinal grounds of pride, and teach men to be proud, or such as lay down
contrary grounds, but do not practise accordingly, be most blame worthie;
I leave Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to judge. One thing I would ask: How Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> came
to know, that such, as he opposeth here, were proudly conceited of their
own goodness? Pride &amp; a proud conceit lyeth most within, &amp; is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
to the view of every one, especially being upon such a ground. I hope
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not take upon him to judge of hearts: And if it be by their
contendings for that, which they conceive to be truth: If this be an infallible
mark, no man can be judged more proud, than is Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> none having
in this matter contended by so many &amp; so great volumnes, as he hath, since
his <hi>Aphorismes</hi> come abroad, &amp; that indeed to the no small trouble of the
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:104357:229"/>
Churches. And further, some might think, that if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did aright
lament, that any were proudly conceited of their own goodness, he should
not have laid doctrinal grounds for fomenting of this pride; nor moved such
an objection against himself, as he doth here; for no man can rightly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the practice of that doctrine, which himself embraceth &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth.</p>
               <p>He proceedeth (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>dable or praise-worthie, &amp;</hi> meriteth <hi>to be</hi> esteemed as it is. <hi>Ans.</hi> True, &amp;
therefore God, who is the Author thereof, should have the glory, &amp; it
should be esteemed, as it is, to the glory of God, &amp; not to puff us up with
proud conceits, or to be the ground we leane to, in order to be justified &amp;
accepted of God. He addeth (n. 178.) <hi>All the Sanctified are inherently righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
but with an</hi> imperfect Righteousness, <hi>which will no further justifie them
in judgment, save only against this Accusation, that they are unholy. Ans. Mr.
Baxter</hi> then is much to blame, who will have this Imperfect Righteousness
to be a perfect Righteousness, as being our Gospel Righteousness, and the
Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>estative condition of our Justification &amp; absolution at judgment, and so
the immediat &amp; sole formal ground of our Justification before God. But this
answere is also impertinent; for these he here writteth against, speak not of a
particular justification, from this or that false Accusation; but of that justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
before God, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> treateth, in his Epistles to the <hi>Romans</hi>
&amp; <hi>Galatians,</hi> &amp; which is a justification of the ungodly. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 5.</p>
               <p>He addeth (n. 179.) <hi>There is no Righteousness, which will not justifie him,
that hath it</hi> in tantum, <hi>so far as</hi> he is Righteous: <hi>for the contrary is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
for to be just, is to be justifiable. Ans.</hi> This is sick of the same imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
with what went before: for the question is not concerning a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Righteousness, &amp; a particular justification, upon that account; but of
a general justification, as to our state &amp; that from the just accusation of Law
&amp; justice, under which we stand by Nature, in reference to which, all our
inherent Righteo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sness, how great so ever it be, is no ground, nor part of
the merite, or <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of that. <hi>Paul</hi> had no small share of this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
when he said, <hi>he knew nothing by himself:</hi> And yet he addeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Yet am I not hereby justified 1. Cor.</hi> 4: 4. and we would say the same, &amp; speak
after this manner, if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would suffer us.</p>
               <p>Next (n. 181. for 180.) he saith. <hi>All the</hi> Righteousness, <hi>which</hi> formally
justifieth us, <hi>is our</hi> own, <hi>or on</hi> ourselves, <hi>where it justifieth us: for to be</hi> made
just <hi>or</hi> justified, <hi>in the first sense</hi> constitutivly, <hi>is nothing else, but to be made
such, as are</hi> personally themselves just. Pardon of sin <hi>is made our</hi> own, Right
<hi>to Christ &amp; glory is made our</hi> own; <hi>though</hi> Christ's Righteousness <hi>was the only</hi>
meritorious cause <hi>of all this; which therefore is &amp; may be called our</hi> Material
Righteousness, <hi>as that, which</hi> meriteth <hi>it, is</hi> the matter. <hi>Ans.</hi> There seemeth
to be nothing here, but confusion: for (1) he speaketh ambiguously, when
he saith, that all that Righteousness, which formally justifieth us, is our own,
or on ourselves; for this may be true, whether by that <hi>Righteousness,</hi> he
mean the Surety-Righteousness of Christ (which he doth not meane, for
he is too much against the imputation of that, as we have seen) beeause we
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:104357:230"/>
say, that is made ours by imputation, in order to our justification upon the
account thereof: or whether he mean our own inherent Righteousness; but
then if this be his meaning, it is false, that we are hereby formally justified,
unless he mean, as before, only a particular justification, which is nothing
to the point, as was said. (2) To be <hi>made just</hi> &amp; to be <hi>justified,</hi> are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
the same, but to such only, who Love confusion. (3) He who is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
just, is but constituted justifiable, &amp; is not <hi>eo ipso constitutive</hi> justified: But
<hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> loveth his own Expressions &amp; Explications of them. (4) When
he saith that <hi>to be justified constitutively is nothing else but to be made such, as
are personally themselves just,</hi> he speaketh very indistinctly; not only as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding,
being <hi>made just</hi> &amp; being <hi>justified,</hi> as if they were formally the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me;
but also as not giving us to understand, what he meaneth by these
words <hi>personally th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mselves just:</hi> Hereby he would seem to say, that only
by something inherent in our persons, we are constituted Righteous, &amp; are
justified; and not by any thing imputed to us: And if so, the ground of all
Anti-evangelick boasting &amp; glorying in ourselves is laid. (5) Pardon of sin,
as such, is neither a making a just, nor a justifying: and the same we say of
Right to Christ &amp; to Glory. (6) Christ's Righteousness, according to Mr.
<hi>Baxter,</hi> can not be called the meritorious cause of our pardon, justification, &amp;
Right to Glory &amp;c. because it is only made by him the meritorious cause of
the New Covenant, wherein pardon, Right to Christ &amp; to Glory are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon New Conditions, &amp; so is made the meritorious Cause of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection
betwixt the performance of these New Conditions, &amp; the obtaining
of Pardon &amp; that Right; so that by vertue of Christ's Merites, these New
Conditions are made the proper &amp; immediat meritorious cause <hi>ex pacto</hi> of
these favours: And by this way, Man can not but boast &amp; glory in himself
immediatly, and give Christ only some remote far-off thanks, for procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the New termes. (7) Christ's Righteousness cannot be called our Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Righteousness, any other way, than as it hath purchased the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
according to <hi>Mr. Baxter;</hi> &amp; this being equally for all, Christ's
Righteousness shall be the Material Righteousness of the Reprobat, as well
as of Beleevers: And how can that be called ours, which is not ours, nor
our own, nor are we by it made personally just ourselves? as he spoke befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
(8) According to this doctrine, Christ Righteousness meriteth to us an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Righteousness, which is our own &amp; on ourselves &amp; by this we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
justified: that is, according to what went before, &amp; to what follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
we are formally justified by our own personal inherent holiness (for
of this, he is speaking only) and yet that which he here mentioneth, as the
Righteousness, which formally justifieth us, is said to be pardon of sin, &amp;
a Right to Christ &amp; to Glory, which formally is no Righteousness at all, nor
no where so called in Scripture, &amp; is but a consequent of that, which
elsewhere he calleth our Gospel Righteousness, and the Condition of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</p>
               <p>He goeth on (n. 182.) <hi>He that is no</hi> cause <hi>of any</hi> good work, <hi>is no</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<hi>but a damnable wretch, &amp; worfe than any wicked man I know in the world:
And he that is</hi> a cause of it, <hi>must not be</hi> denyed <hi>falsly to be a cause of it. Nor a
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:104357:230"/>
Saint denied to be a Saint, upon a false pretence of self-denyal. Ans.</hi> Of such a
cause of any good work, he knoweth the objection speaketh, that should
have the glory &amp; praise thereof; and &amp; of good works, as the ground &amp;
formal Cause of justification; which these against whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here
disputeth, do deny. But we may see here, what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> accounteth good
works; even such as the most damnable wretch, and possiblie the devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
may do; that is a work materially good, though far different from the
good works described to us in Scripture. And thus the Justification upon
good works, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here meaneth, must be a Justification, that
all Heathens, damnable wretches, yea &amp; devils themselves are capable of:
But this is not the justification we speak of, of which who ever are partakers
shall be glorified <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 30. We say nothing, that giveth him ground to
think, that our thoughts are, that a Saint should be denyed to be a Saint,
upon pretence of Self-denyal. Only we say that such as are Saints indeed
will be loth to rob God of his glory, or take any of that to themselves,
which is due to him alone, in so far as they act as Saints; And they should
not, because Saints, glory &amp; boast, as if their justification before God,
were by their Sanctity &amp; good works; &amp; not of meer grace, through the
imputation of the Surety-Righteousness of Christ. One thing I would ask.
Doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> think, that Christ's Righteousness hath merited that justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
which those damnable wretches &amp; devils may partake of, by any
good work, which they do? himself told us in the foregoing (n. 81.) that
all Righteousnuss which formally iustifieth, is our own, &amp; that to be made
just &amp; to be justified are the same, or equipollent; and to be Justified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutively
is nothing else, then to be made such as are personally them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
just. Now, when devils &amp; damnable wretches may be the causes of
some good work, that good work cannot but formally justifie them, and
they thereby become constitutively justified, I would enquire, whether this
Justification be purchased by Christ or not? And againe I would enquire,
whether this Justification be accompanied with pardon of sin, &amp; with Right
to Christ &amp; to glory, or not? If not, how can it be called a justification? &amp;
if it be not a justification, how can they be hereby formally justified, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutively
justified?</p>
               <p>He tels us next (n. 183) <hi>As God is seen here in the glass of his works, so he
is to be loved &amp; praised, as so appearing.</hi> This is, say I, good &amp; reasonable.
What then? <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith he, <hi>he that dishonoureth his work, dishonoureth
God, &amp; hindereth his due love and praise.</hi> This consequence, I grant, is good;
but what is it to the point in hand? <hi>And his most lovely &amp; honourable work</hi> (saith
he) <hi>on earth is his holy image on his Saints; &amp; as Christ will come to be admired &amp;
glorified in them at last, so God must be seen &amp; glorified in them here in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
Neither, say I, is any thing of this to the purpose in hand. He addeth.
<hi>And to deny the glory of his image is the malignants way of injuring him, &amp; that
in which the worst will serve you.</hi> And what then? <hi>He that will praise God</hi>
(saith he further) <hi>as Creator &amp; Redeemer must praise his works, of Creation &amp;
Redemption: And is it the way of praising him, as our Sanctifier, to dispraise
his work of Sanctification? Ans.</hi> What maketh all this to the purpose? Must
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:104357:231"/>
all such be guilty of this malignant wickedness, who tell men, that no part
of their Righteousness is in themselves, by which they are to be justified,
but that it is all in Christ only: or that say, that God must have all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of what good action they do? This is hard, that either we must be
wicked Malignants, or Sacrilegious robbers of God of the Glory, due
unto him, But I see no connexion, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
the same. He must then prove the Consequence of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueing.</p>
               <p>He addeth (n. 184.) <hi>Those poor sinners of my acquantance, who lived in
the grossest sins against Conscience (as Drunkeness, &amp; horedome &amp;c.) have been
glad enough of such doctrine, &amp; forward enough to beleeve, that</hi> there is nothing
in man, that in any part can justifie him, or that is any part of Righteousness,
<hi>but it</hi> is all out of us in Christ, &amp; <hi>therefore they are as justifiable, as any. But
Conscience will not let them beleeve it, as they desire, Ans.</hi> To this cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
not knowing, nor having acquaintance with those poor sinners; Yet
this I may say, (&amp; others will say the same with me) that Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi>
way is that, which I finde more relishing unto carnal Souls, than the self
denying way of the Gospel, which we use to preach: And that the way,
which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is not satisfied with, is the way, that is most pleasant
&amp; acceptable unto the truely gracious, and rightly exercised Souls. But
surder, what of all this? Knoweth not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that some can turn the
grace of God into lasciviousness? Must therefore the mountains be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for them?</p>
               <p>He saith Moreover (n. 185.) <hi>It is arrogant folly to divide tho praise of any
good act between God &amp; man, &amp; to say God is to have so many parts &amp; man so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
for the whole is due to God; &amp; yet some is due to man: for man holdeth his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
only in Subordination to God, &amp; not dividedly in Co-ordination. And therefore
all is due to God: for that which is Mans is God's; because we have nothing; but
what we have received. But he that arrogateth any of the honour due to God or Christ,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffendeth. Ans.</hi> If it be thus, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is the more to blame, in being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied
with such, as are but expressing their care, that God have all his
due, and that man do not proudly arrogat to himself any of that honour &amp;
glory, which is due to God alone: And if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knoweth not, that
there is a strong propension in corrupt nature, to spoil God of his glory, he
knoweth nothing: And wo to such, as would indulge nature in this Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge.
Them that honour God, He will honour. What honour is justly due
unto man, in subordination unto God, none of those, I suppose, whom
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> here opposeth, will grudge him of; but all their care is, to have
God's due keeped for himself, &amp; that is all; &amp; it is not commendable in any,
to oppose them in this.</p>
               <p>But next he saith (n. 186.) <hi>If all had been taken from God's honour, which
had been given to the creature, God would have made</hi> nothing, <hi>or made</hi> nothing
good; <hi>heaven &amp; earth &amp; all the world would derogate from his honour; and none
of his works should be praised. And the better any man is, the more he would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
God, &amp; the wickeder the less. But he made all good, and is glorious in
the glory, &amp; honourable in the honour of all: &amp; to justifie the holiness of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:104357:231"/>
is to justifie him. Ans.</hi> All this is little or nothing to the purpose: for
such as are carefull that man rob not God of his glory, do not deny the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
due to the creature, knowing that when honour is given to the creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
upon a right ground, and in the right manner, it redounded unto the
honour of the Creator: But who knoweth not, how ready the Creature is to
steal into the throne of God; and how ready men are to transcend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and
transgress all due limites? And is it not saifest to keep far from such a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
precipice? Is it to edification thus to gratifie with our pleadings proud
Nature, and to blow at this fire of corruption, that the Saints have daily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard
work about to suppress &amp; exstinguish? Must we thus, on so small occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
plead so stoutly for man, &amp; pretend to plead for God too?</p>
               <p>He addeth next (n. 187.) <hi>If these Teachers mean, that</hi> no man hath any
power freely to specifie the acts of his own will by any other help of God,
<hi>besides necessitating predetermining premotion; &amp; so that every man doth all that
he can do, &amp; no man can do more than he doth; They di honoure God by denying
him to be the Creator of that</hi> f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee power, <hi>which is essential to man, &amp; which God
himself accounteth it his honour to creat. And they feigne God to damne &amp; blame all,
that are damned &amp; blamed, for as great impossibilities, as if they were damned &amp;
blamed for not making a world, or for not being Angels. Ans.</hi> This is not a fit pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to treate of that Question of Predetermination, though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> pull
it in here by the eares; It is enough for us, that we see now, whither all
that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath here been saying, tendeth, even to give unto Man,
the glory of all the good he doth, of his Faith, Repentance, Love of God,
obedience &amp; perseverance, in the first, chiefe &amp; immediat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ace; for by
his own Natural Power he did freely specifie the acts of his own will, and so
beleeved, when he might have rejected the Gospel, Loved God &amp; Christ,
when he might have hated both, Repented, when he might have remained
impenitent, Converted himself, when he might have remained in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
state (&amp; Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> maketh no difference of acts here, and so his words
must be looked on as meaned of supernatural acts, as well as of Natural)
&amp; that without any predetermining grace or motion of God. This glory
shall we never yeeld to be due unto man, Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> load the Doctrine
of Predetermining grace, with all the reproaches, and absurdities, he can
invent. He needs not think now to restrick his opinion of denying Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
unto natural acts, for as the good spoken of by those he here
opposeth, is supernatural good, as such; so his discourse here is expressive
enough of this: And thus the cause is yeelded unto <hi>Pelagians, Iesuits</hi> &amp;
<hi>Arminians,</hi> and the crown is put upon the head of man, and he is to honour
&amp; praise himself for what good he doth, for all began at his own self-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
power &amp; will; and the Almighty himself could not have bowed &amp;
predetermined his will, except he had overturned the course of Nature, &amp;
destroyed that <hi>free power,</hi> which is essential to man. And thus it is made
to be to the honour of God, to creat a Creature, that is absolute Lord &amp;
Master of all his own actions, &amp; so must be the first Cause of his own actions,
as to their specifick moral nature, &amp; what is this, but to make man an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Creature, as to his actions, &amp; consequently a God to himself:
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:104357:232"/>
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hinteth some other help of God besides Predetermination; but
what that is, he telleth us not; is it his Concourse? From this the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
will flow, that flow from Predetermination. And beside Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> seemeth to incline more to <hi>Durandus's</hi> his opinion, &amp; <hi>A dola's,</hi> which
even the Jesuites are ashamed to owne, and his friend D. <hi>Strang</hi> doth directly
confute; as loving to set man yet higher up, than they dar do. Doth Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> think that it is essential to man to have such a <hi>free power,</hi> as that of
himself he can specifie the acts of his own will, without any predetermining
Motion of God? Can he then beleeve in Christ. Hope savingly in God, yeeld
Christian Obedience to all the commands of God, without God's Predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
motion upon his heart? And is that Common General influx, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby
he is preserved in his being, &amp; his faculties &amp; power not taken away,
enough to make a man turn from Nature unto Grace, if he will be so good
natured as to bow his own will, &amp; determine himself, as he may? Why do
we then condemne the <hi>Pelagians?</hi> What did or could <hi>Pelagius</hi> say more?
But enough of this here.</p>
               <p>In the following, Paragraph (n. 188.) He tels us, that some men teach,
that Christ strippeth a Christian of two things, his <hi>Sins,</hi> &amp; his <hi>Righteousness.</hi>
Or that two Things must be cast away for Christ, <hi>Sins</hi> &amp; <hi>Righteousness.</hi> And
he is not satisfied with such speeches, though they be consonant to, yea upon
the matter, the very same with the speeches of <hi>Paul Phil.</hi> 3: 8, 9. He faith
<hi>they should speak better, if they would not deceive.</hi> And why saith he not so of the
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> also? May it serve him, that we speak, as <hi>Paul</hi> did? <hi>Nothing</hi>
(saith he) <hi>is to be cast away, as evil, but sin.</hi> True; and yet the Apostle
desired to be found in Christ, not having his own Righteousness; &amp; what
was a Righteousness in his eyes before; and was a Righteousness, which is
in the Law, and wherein he was blameless, he now accounted loss for
Christ, yea he accounted them but dung; which includeth a rejecting &amp;
casting of it away with detestation. He addeth, <hi>Righteousness truely such is good,
&amp; never to be cast away. If it be no Righteousn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ss, why do they falsly say, that
we must cast away our Righteousness? Ans.</hi> Let the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> answere this,
whom it concerneth as much, as us: And let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in soberness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how this reflecteth upon the Spirit of the Lord, inspiring the Apostle
to speak so. As for us, we are not very anxious in this matter, but can free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that though our personal Righteousness be good; Yet in
the matter of justification before God, and absolution from the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
sentence of the Law, &amp; adjudication to life, we must lay it aside, and
betake ourselves solely to the Righteousness of Christ, and seek to be found
in him alone, after the example of the Apostle, &amp; according to the clear
doctrine of the Gospel; And this we are resolved to do, how displeased soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> be with us upon that account.</p>
               <p>He addeth. <hi>To cast away</hi> a false conceit of Righteousness, <hi>is not to cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
Righteousness, <hi>but</hi> Sin <hi>only; indeed beside</hi> sin, <hi>we are said justly to cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
that, which would be the</hi> object &amp; matter of sin: <hi>And the phrase is fitlier
applied to a thing</hi> Indifferent; <hi>than to a thing</hi> necessary, <hi>lest it seduce. Ans.</hi> To
account our Righteousness, consisting in our obedience to the Law, to be dung,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:104357:232"/>
as <hi>Paul</hi> did, in the business of justification, is all we plaid for, let Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
call it <hi>a casting away of a false conceite of</hi> Righteousness, if that will satisfie
him, but even in this we cast away our Righteousness, when we will not
trust to it, as our Righteousness, in order to justification; or as that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
upon the account of which we expect to be justified in the sight of
God. And if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> be afraid of Seducing here, he may know where
we ground our expressions: I suppose <hi>Paul</hi> was far from seducing, when he
spoke, as he did <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 8, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is nothing so good</hi> (saith he) <hi>which may not be made the object of sin;
not Christ, or his Righteousness, or God himself excepted; But we must not thus
objectivly abuse them. Ans.</hi> And what is all this to the purpose? Doth he think
that those teachers, he here opposeth, were enemies to holiness; or would
have men laying aside all thoughts of it, and care about it when they spoke
so? He may as well inferre such things from the Apostles speaches. But
what is meaned <hi>secundum quid,</hi> should not be understood as spoken <hi>simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer.</hi>
His reasoning here then is impertinent, as also is that which follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
when he saith. <hi>So holiness &amp; true Righteousness (inherent or imputed)
may be objects of sinful pride &amp; boasting; But it is not edifying doctrine therefore to
say, that we must cast away inherent &amp; imputed Righteousness.</hi> For we plead
not for casting away every thing that may be abused, but for casting away
our own Righteousness, in the matter of justification, that impured Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
may only take place. But how imputed Righteousness can be the
object of sinful pride &amp; boasting, he would do well to teach us; that Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Righteousuess may be so, we know; and to plead for justification upon
that account, is to lay the foundation of sinful pride &amp; boasting, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
teach us.</p>
               <p>He addeth. <hi>But yet true self deny<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l requireth that we deny our</hi> Righteousness
(<hi>inherent or Imputed) to be that which indeed it is not. Ans.</hi> And therefore we
deny, that our inherent Righteousness is the ground, or <hi>formalis ratio obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiva</hi>
of our justification: But what way Self-denyal teacheth us to deny our
imputed Righteousness to be what it is not, he must be pleased to informe
us; and to speak thus alike of both our inherent &amp; imputed Righteousness,
is not very faire; as if there were no difference.</p>
               <p>Further he tels us. <hi>And so when men accounted the jewish observations to be a</hi>
justifying Righteousness, <hi>in competition with, &amp; in opposition to Christ,</hi> Paul
<hi>counteth it as</hi> loss <hi>&amp;</hi> dung, <hi>&amp;</hi> nothing <hi>in that respect: when yet elsewhere he saith,</hi>
I have lived in all good conscience to this day: <hi>And Christ himself fulfilled that</hi>
Law &amp; Righteousness. <hi>Ans.</hi> What meaneth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> by these <hi>jewish ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations?</hi>
Meaneth he nothing but their observance of the Ceremonial Law?
But did <hi>Paul</hi> meane nothing but his consciencious observance of this Law,
when he said, <hi>I have lived in all good conscience to this day?</hi> And did he mean
nothing else, by that Righteousness, which he counted loss &amp; dung. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3?
The Apostle himself distinguisheth betwixt the Law, touching which
he was a Pharisee; and that Law touching the Righteousness whereof, he
had been blameless: And sure before the writting of this Epistle, he had
preached down the observation of the Ceremonial Law, and was far from
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:104357:233"/>
the observation thereof, &amp; yet now, he accounted that same Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which formerly was gaine to him, now to be loss &amp; dung, so that
this could not be, his Ceremonial Observances; for it had been a small de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of his excessive desire to win Christ, to count tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>loss now,
which he had before comdemned as unnecessary. Yea as unlawfull, &amp; had
laid aside, as such. So that he meaneth all that, which could be called his
own Righteousness, &amp; which is of the Law, and was not that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which is through the Faith of Christ, and of God by Faith. And it is
also observable, that the Apostle useth a very comprehensive terme beside,
saying, <hi>And I count all things but losse</hi> &amp;c. Moreover, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> jewish observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
while that Law stood in force, were useful &amp; good, &amp; a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as well as the observation of the moral Law, to which they were also
reducible, being enjoined by vertue of the Second Command. And if these
observances could be brought (through mens corruption,) in competition,
with &amp; set in opposition to Christ, and therefore were justly accounted as
loss &amp; dung &amp; nothing, in that respect: why ought not also moral obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o accounted, seing they through mans corruption, can be &amp; are
too oft brought in competition with, &amp; set in opposition against Christ, &amp;
his Righteousness? If Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will yeeld to this, he needs disput no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
at this rate.</p>
               <p>He addeth. <hi>So if a man will conceit, that his</hi> common grace <hi>will justifie
without holiness; or his</hi> holiness without pardon, <hi>&amp;</hi> the Righteousness of
Christ, <hi>he must</hi> deny <hi>this</hi> Righteousness; <hi>that is, he must deny it</hi> to be what
it is not, <hi>&amp; must cast away (not it, but) the</hi> false conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>its of it. <hi>Ans.</hi> We
think them in an errour, who conceit, that either <hi>common grace</hi> will justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
without holiness, or <hi>holiness</hi> with or without pardon &amp; the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ: and it is not proper for him, who will not hear others saying,
that Faith justifieth, to say, that holiness justifieth. And it is as impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to say, that pardon justifieth: Let him tell me, how holiness with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
can justifie? And as for the Righteousness of Christ, all men (with
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) are justified by it alike, for it only purchased the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and that it did to all alike, and is no other way imputed unto any
whatsomever. And so, according to his judgment it must be denied, that
Christ's Righteousness becometh the beleevers through God's imputation, &amp;
that beleevers are there with clothed, and thereupon made juridically Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and then justified, or pronunced Righteous, through that imputed
Surety Righteousness of Christ: this is the self-denyal that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will
teach us; and stead of this Surety-Righteousness of Christ, we must be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
(according to him) with our own Gospel Righteousness, Faith &amp;
New Obedience, and upon that ground, as the only neerest formal reason;
or meritorious cause, expect to be justified; because Christ's Righteousness
hath purchased this Covenant, and connexion. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> must not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
that I mention the word <hi>Merite</hi> here, remembering what he saith
himself (n. 194.) where his friendliness to Papists, &amp; his displeasure at
Protestants is so remarkable, in these words. [And those that reject the
saying of some Papists, who in this <hi>sence</hi> say, that <hi>Christ merited that we might
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:104357:233"/>
merite,</hi> placing our Evangelical merite in a meer subordination to Christ's,
do but shew, what prejudice &amp; partiality can do, and harden those, who
perceive their errors.]</p>
               <p>Finally he saith here. <hi>And so if any Libertine will say, that</hi> Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
imputed to him, <hi>will justifie him without</hi> Faith, <hi>or be in stead to</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
<hi>to him, he must deny</hi> imputed Righteousness <hi>thus to be, what indeed it is
not. Ans.</hi> Though I know, the Lord hath thought good to ordaine Faith, as
a mean, whereby we may be made partaker of Christ's Surety-Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and so be justified; Yet I may say, that Christ's Righteousness impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as being the sole meritorious cause &amp; <hi>Ratie formali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> objectiva</hi> of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
will justifie without Faith, as any part of that Righteousness,
which we are considered as clothed with, when declared &amp; pronunced Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.
And though it be not in stead of holiness, as if holiness were no
more required of us; Yet it is &amp; must be in stead of that holiness &amp; Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
which was required of us in the Old Covenant &amp; by the Law, in
order to our being accepted &amp; justified thereupon.</p>
               <p>He tels us in the margine, that none deny. That all that are saved have
inherent Righteousness; and that <hi>in tantum</hi> we are Righteous by it; That a
man accused, as being an Insidel, Atheist, Impenitent, Ungodly, a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
&amp;c. must be justified by pleading all the contraries in himself; or else
perish; And that this inherent Righteousness is imperfect, and in us found
with sin, &amp; that therefore no man can be justified by it without pardon of sin,
nor at all against the charge of being a sinner, &amp; condemnable by the Law
of innocency. But what is all this to the point? Must we not therefore say
with <hi>Paul,</hi> that in the business of justification, we must account our own
Righteousness to be but dung, and only lean to the Righteousness of Christ?
What would he hence conclude? <hi>And what remaineth then</hi> (saith he) <hi>but to
trouble the world with contending</hi> de nomine, <hi>whether this Imperfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
shall be called Righteousness, &amp; the giving of it, called justifying, or making
us Righteous so far. Ans.</hi> And who, I pray, more guilty of troubling the
world with these contendings, than he? But to the matter, it is no meer
contending <hi>de nomine,</hi> that he hath caused, when in stead of the Surety-Righteousness
of Christ, with which the Orthodox Asserted beleevers to be
clothed, as the immediat ground of their justification before God, and
which they by Faith were to lean to, and rest upon in order to justification,
he substituteth, in its place, our imperfect holiness, &amp; maketh that to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
justification &amp; Salvation, as a subordinat Righteousness (so called,
though indeed in this case the principal.) advanced to that dignity by the
merites of Christ's Righteousness; and as all that Righteousness, which
can properly be said to be ours, and to be imputed to us, as the only Pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stative
Condition of our Justification &amp; Salvation, according to the New
Covenant, purchased by Christ. This is something more, and a great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mething
more, than a meer contest about a word, or a name. This tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
the foundation of the Gospel, let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> think as little of it, as
he will. I need not take notice of his making these two one thing, <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi>
&amp; <hi>making us Righteous,</hi> and of his calling the <hi>giving of Righteousness</hi>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:104357:234"/>
or holiness <hi>a justifying of us,</hi> for this is but sutable to him, who would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
all.</p>
               <p>This is all he speaketh to this matter in this place: But thereafter Sect. 5.
<hi>of merite</hi> (n. 196.) he tels us, <hi>It is a great question, whether a man may trust
to his own Faith, Repentance or Holiness.</hi> And I should think, that no ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
man should once make a question about it; but should reject the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation
of such a thing with detestation: seing Trusting to these things is
the native consequent of the <hi>Popish, Socinian</hi> &amp; <hi>Arminian</hi> errour about ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification;
or of all, who speak of the Imputation of Faith &amp;c. as our
Righteousness, in stead of the imputation of the Righteousness of Christ.
What answere giveth he? <hi>But some men</hi> (saith he) <hi>will trouble the world with
unexplained words, where no sober men differ. Ans.</hi> The words are plaine enough,
and need no explication, &amp; every ordinary Christian understand their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
but against such, as will seek knots in rushes, and raise dust in the most
clear aire, for their own ends, there is no remedie. I am afraied the point
of difference shall be found such here, as that our agreement shall not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>haste, unless our sobriety be such, as well make us embrace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistences.</p>
               <p>Let us hear what he saith. No <hi>wise man can dream, that we may trust to those
for more than their proper part, as that we may</hi> trust <hi>them to do anything proper
to God, to Christ, to the Spirit, to the promise &amp;c. And to use the phrase of</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
<hi>to our own</hi> Faith, <hi>or</hi> holiness, <hi>when it soundeth absolutly, or may tempt the
hearers to think, that they may trust them for God's part, or Christ's part, &amp; not
only for their own, is a dangerous deceiving course. Ans.</hi> It is true, no wise man
will say, that we may trust to these for more than their proper part, but
when we are mistaken about their proper part, &amp; conceive them to have
that place &amp; part, which they have not, and accordingly trust unto them,
do we not amisse? And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> maketh it their part to be the immediat
meritorious cause expacto (which he otherwayes expresseth to be the Pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stative
Condition) of Justification &amp; Salvation: which we say is the part of
Christ &amp; his Righteousness alone: And sure, who ever shall trust unto them
for this part, which according to the Gospel is Christ's part, trust unto them
for more than their proper part. Neither is it any dangerous or deceiving
course, to speak thus, when the meaning is obviously known (except to
such as have wit enough to darken things) to be this, that we must not Trust
to Faith &amp;c. as the price, the merite, <hi>ex pacto</hi> (as perfect obedience was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the first Covenant) of our Justification, Adoption, &amp; Salvation. But
it is a most dangerous &amp; deceiving course to call them only Conditions, or
<hi>cause fine quibus non,</hi> when in the meane time, they are made to have the
same place in the New Covenant, that perfect obedience had in the old; &amp;
are made our Gospel-Righteousness, for which we are justified, yea &amp; put
in the same place, that the Orthodox put Christ &amp; his Surety- Righteousness,
that is, to be the immediat ground, formal cause, <hi>Ratio formalis objectiva</hi>
of our Justification.</p>
               <p>What more? <hi>But that really they may be</hi> trusted, <hi>for their</hi> own part, <hi>and
must</hi> be so, <hi>no sober person will deny: for so to beleeve, obey, pray to God &amp;c. &amp;
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:104357:234"/>
not to trust to them in their place, that is not to think, that we shall be ever the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for them, is unbeleefe &amp; indeed distrusting God, &amp; saying, it is</hi> in vain to see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
him,
and what profite is it that we call upon him <hi>&amp; such diffidence &amp; des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
will end all endeavours.</hi> Let every man prove his own work &amp;c. This is
our Rejoicing &amp;c. <hi>If we are justified by</hi> Faith, <hi>we may trust to be</hi> justified by
it. <hi>But the rare use of such a phrase in Scripture, &amp; the danger of it, must make us
never use it without need. Ans.</hi> As I said, all the question is concerning what
is their own part: And by saying that they are not to be trusted unto, we
deny them to have that part, or place in the matter of our Justification &amp;
Salvation, that others give unto them: And if there were no more, this
is a shreud ground of presumption to us, that Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> owneth not the
Orthodox doctrine in this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> That he cannot with patience heare
it said, That <hi>we must not trust to our own Faith, Repentance or Holiness,</hi> but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
such expressions dangerous, aud deceiving. (2) It is but a wrong
gloss put upon this expression, <hi>We must not trust to our own Faith &amp;c.</hi> to make
the meaning of it to be, <hi>we must not think, that we shall be ever the better for
our Faith.</hi> &amp;c. And therefore his following words are vaine, and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
(3) It is one thing <hi>to trust to be justified by Faith,</hi> which is but beleeve
God, and trust in his word; and a far other, <hi>to trust in our Faith;</hi> For this
is to lay our stress, &amp; lean our weight, &amp; found our hopes of Justification
&amp; Salvation on our weak &amp; feckless Faith, in stead of trusting to, &amp; relying
upon Jesus Christ &amp; his Surety Righteousness, as the only immediat ground,
&amp; as that Righteousness by &amp; upon consideration of which, we are justified,
&amp; have a Right to Glory: And if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> do not see a difference betwixt
these two, it is not because he cannot, but because he will not, as some
may suppose. (4) He talks of the rare use of such a phrase in Scripture; but I
would know, where he findeth it used at all iu Scripture? And it is well,
that he confesseth there is danger in it: which two, me thinks, should be
enough to make him, as great an enemie to this expression, as we are: But
the truth is, according to his principles, we are as much now to Trust to
our Faith Repentance &amp; Holiness, in order to Justification &amp; Salvation, as
<hi>Adam</hi> was to trust to his perfect obedience, according to the Covenant of
works; &amp; as much, as, according to our doctrine, we are to trust to Christ
&amp; his Surety-Righteousness.</p>

what Evasions they can, to evite the force of the Apostles a gueings &amp;

and what are the works thereof, our Adversaries are not at all agreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

shall heare.</p>
               <p>Some by the Law, and the works thereof, which <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth from
justification, do mean the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> and the <hi>Observances thereof;</hi>
or as others express it, the <hi>Iewish Law,</hi> including their <hi>judaical Law,</hi> &amp;

<hi>Ephes. 2. Tit.</hi> 3. doth simply exclude works, making no mention of the Law
of <hi>Moses:</hi> The <hi>Socinians</hi> do chuse this way of interpreting the Apostle, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
may be seen in the Author of a book, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

               <p>But this opinion doth not correspond with truth, as may be manifest from
these particulars.</p>
               <p>1. If <hi>Paul</hi> disput only against Justification by Ceremonial Observances, he
had a far shorter cut, to confute that conceite, than the way he took, <hi>to wit,</hi>
to tell them: that shortly that Law, with all its observances, was to be laid
aside &amp; no more to be observed, by vertue of the Gospel Administration, &amp;
because the end of all these observances, &amp; He, who was typified thereby,
was come, and had put an end to that dispensation. But we finde not the
Apostle making any use of this One &amp; Onely Argument, which had sured
that purpose; but on the contrary he useth such <hi>Mediums</hi> &amp; Arguments, as
suite no less, if not more, other Lawes, beside the Ceremonial.</p>
               <p>2. Yea before the writting of these Epistles, wherein the Apostle did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put
against Justification by the Law, at least, before he wrote that to the
<hi>Galatians,</hi> he had by his preaching &amp; practice, opposed the observation of
the Ceremonial Law, as himself telleth us <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. And in that same Epistle
Chap. 3. &amp; 4. he condemneth the observation of that Law, in most perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory
termes, as being no less, than a falling from grace: And yet when
he is treating of Justification not by the works of the Law <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. he mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not this ground, which would have taken away the very subject of the
debate. Shall we think, that the Apostle would have disproved Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
only by the works of the Ceremonial Law by such Arguments and
Tipicks, out of Scripture, when he was within a little by forcible reasons
to remove the very Law itself, and condemne all observation thereof?</p>
               <p>3. It is strange, that <hi>Paul</hi> in writting to the Gentils, should deny Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be by the works of the Law, meaning the Ceremonial Law only;
and <hi>Iames</hi> writting to the Jewes, should cry up the observation of that Law,
and plead for justification thereby: This would say, that Jewes &amp; Gentiles
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:104357:235"/>
were not both to be justified one way: or that <hi>Iames</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> do clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
other; neither of which must be said. That <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Law, than <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of, cannot be made good. And therefore
when our Adversaries will prove from <hi>Iames,</hi> that we are justified by
works, their meaning is, that we are justified by the Observation of the
Ceremonial Law.</p>
               <p>4. The several things mentioned of this Law, whereof the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
sheweth, that he is not speaking of the Ceremonial Law only: as
(1) <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 19. It is a Law that stoppeth all mouthes, &amp; whereby all the
world becometh guilty before God: But this is not the Ceremonial Law,
or the jewish, or Moses Law, under which the Gentiles were not, nor yet
are. (2) <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 20. It is that Law, by which is the knowledge of sin: but
this is not by the meer Ceremonial Law, as we see <hi>Paul</hi> himself professing
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7: 7 (3) <hi>Rom.</hi> 2: 13. It is that Law, the döers whereof shall be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
But this can not be asserted of the meer Ceremonial Law, or of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses's</hi>
Law. (4) <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 27. It is that Law, which doth not exclude boasting:
but it cannot be said, that the Law of Moses is only that Law. (5) <hi>Rom.</hi> 3:
31. It is that Law, that is not made void, through Faith. But this is not
the Ceremonial Law; The Ceremonial Law is not established by Faith.
(6) <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 28. It is that Law, justification by which is inconsistent with &amp;
opposit to justification by Faith: but this is not the Ceremonial Law only.
(7) <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 1, 2. It is that Law, by the works whereof <hi>Abraham,</hi> was not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.
But the Apostles argument from the Instance of <hi>Abraham</hi> had not
been pertinent, if no Law had here been understood, but <hi>Moses's</hi> Law;
which was not in being in <hi>Abraham's</hi> dayes. (8) <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 2. It is that Law,
&amp; works of obedience to it, that would give ground to man of glorying:
But this is not true only of the Ceremonial Law. (9) <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 4. It is that
Law, obedience to which is a working, and maketh the reward of debt:
But this cannot be said only of the Ceremonial Law. (10) <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 15. It is
that Law that worketh wrath: But other Lawes do this, than the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Law, (11) <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 3, 4. It is that Law, that was weak through the
flesh, and the Righteousness of which was to be fulfilled in us: but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be applied to the Ceremonial Law only. (12) <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 10. It is that Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
of the works of which as many as are, are under the Curse, and of which it
is said, cursed is every one, that continueth not in all things, which are
written in the Law to do them. But this agreeth not to the Ceremonial Law
only. (13) <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 12. It is that Law, by the doing of which, man should
live: But by perfect obedience to the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> alone life was not to be
had. (14) It is that Law, that cursed all transgressours, &amp; under the Curse
whereof all thoselay, for whom Christ died. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 13. But that is not the
Ceremonial Law, which laid no Curse upon the Gentiles. (15) <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
10. It is that Law, that enjoineth those good works, which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ordained, that we (even Gentiles) should walk in them: But that
is not the Ceremonial Law. (16. It is that Law, the works whereof are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with grace, as the ground of Election: <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 6. But this is not
Ceremonial Law only, else we must say, that Election is for works of the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:104357:236"/>
Moral Law, and yet is for grace. (17) <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9. It is that Law, obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to which can be called <hi>our Righteousness:</hi> But this is not the Ceremonial
Law only.</p>
               <p>5. If <hi>Paul's</hi> minde had been only to disput against Justification by Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Observances; after he had stated the question, and proposed the Truth,
he was minded to confirme <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: 17. to what purpose did he insist so much,
to shew, how guilty the Gentiles were, who were never under <hi>Moses's</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and thereby clear, what need they had of a justification by free grace
through faith without the works of the Law? This seemeth not to have a
clear tendency unto the clearing of justification to be by Faith, &amp; not by
Mosaical Observances; for what had the Gentiles to do with these?</p>
               <p>6. We finde like wise the Apostle to convince the Jewes themselves to be
under sin, in order to the necessity they had of being justified by faith,
holding forth their breaches of the Moral Law <hi>Rom.</hi> 2: 21, 22. and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of a Law distinct from that, to which Circumcision belonged, saying
<hi>vers.</hi> 25. &amp;c. <hi>for Circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the Law; but if
thou be a breaker of the Law, thy Circumcision is made uncircumcision:</hi> And
this Law, is a Law, that he, by supposition, saith, one not circumcised,
might observe, and so could not be the Law of Ceremonies. See also <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19.</p>
               <p>7. The Arguments, which the Apostle adduceth to disprove justification
by the Law, cannot conclude against the Ceremonial Law only: for (1) all
the world are not guilty of transgressing only the Ceremonial Law: and yet
because all the world are become guilty before God, the Apostle inferreth
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 20. <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law, there shall no flesh be justified.</hi>
(2) So that other Argument <hi>ibid. for by the Law is the knowledge of sin,</hi> cannot
conclude against the Ceremonial Law only. (3) Justifieation by the deeds of
the Ceremonial Law only, repugneth not to the justification through the
Righteousness of God without the Law, and which is by Faith of Jesus
Christ; and through the Redemption, that is in Christ. (4) The Law of
Ceremonies alone doth not exclude boasting. (5) <hi>Abraham's</hi> works were not
works of the Ceremonial Law only (6) works of the Ceremonial Law only
do not exclude glorying, nor make the reward of debt &amp; not of grace. (7)
Beleeving on him, that justifieth the ungodly, is opposed as well to him that
worketh according to other Lawes, as to him, that worketh according to
the Ceremonial Law <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 5. (8) Imputed Righteousness, mentioneth
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 7, 11. is as much opposite, in the matter of justification, to other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances,
as to Mosaical Observances. (9) Forgiveness of sins, mentioned
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 7, 8. is as inconsistent with the observation of other Lawes, as of the
Ceremonial Law. (10) Justification by the Faith of Christ is as opposite to
the Moral Law, as to the Ceremonial Law: And thus reasoneth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 16. (11) That Curse denounced <hi>Deut.</hi> 27: 26. by which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
proveth <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 10. that justification can not be by the works of the Law,
is not against transgressours only of the Ceremonial Law. (12) Obedience,
to the moral commands, is as little a living by faith, as was obedience to the
Ceremonial Law: And by this Argument <hi>Paul</hi> proveth <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 11. that no
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:104357:236"/>
man is justified by the Law, in the sight of God, because the just shall live
by faith. (13) This is clear also from <hi>vers.</hi> 12. &amp; 13. to mentione no more.
<hi>And the Law is not of faith</hi> (which holdeth not true only of the Ceremonial
Law) <hi>but the man that doth them shall live in them</hi> (which was the Tenor of
the Old Covenant <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 5. <hi>Levit.</hi> 18: 5.) <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the
Curse of the Law</hi> (And sure this is from the Curse of other Lawes, than of
the Ceremonial Law.)</p>
               <p>8. Though it were true, that <hi>Paul's</hi> conclusion was only against Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Mosaical Observances: Yet by good consequence it might hence be
inferred, that there is no Justification by the works of the Moral Law. <hi>Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
because the Apostle's <hi>Mediums</hi> &amp; Arguments are general, &amp;, as we saw,
reach further than to the Ceremonial Law: <hi>Partly</hi> because if it were not
thus, all the Apostles disput should be of no use or value unto us, now the
subject of that controversie being quite removed: <hi>Partly</hi> because the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law belonged to the first table, being God's institute worshipe, &amp;
obedience thereunto required by the Second Command: <hi>Partly</hi> because so
long as that Law was not abrogated, obedience thereunto was their Gospel
Righteousness, as well as obedience to other Law's is now called our Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Righteousness:
And if that could not then justifie them, no more can
this now justifie us.</p>
               <p>We do not by all this say, that the Ceremonial Law had no place or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in this disput; for the Jewes being pertinacious adherers unto this, &amp;
the false Teachers urging the observation of this, even upon the Gentile
Churches, gave occasion &amp; first rise unto this Question; for they alleiged, there
was no Justification, or Salvation without the observation hereof: But as
they did not restrict the Law &amp; the works thereof, purely unto the Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Rites &amp; Typical Ceremonies; but urged the observation of the whole
Law, which comprehended moral precepts, as well as Ceremonial Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
so the Apostle argueth against Justification by the works of the Law
in general, without any particular limitation (expressed or hinted) unto the
Ceremonial Observances.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his <hi>Cathol. Theol. part. 2. Sect.</hi> 26. where he would tell
us, how <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Iames</hi> agree, about <hi>justification by works</hi> (n. 362.) saith
that, <hi>The key of understanding</hi> Paul's <hi>discourses of justification is, to know 1. That
the grand question, which he first manageth, is,</hi> whether the <hi>Gentiles</hi> may not
be saved, without keeping the <hi>Iewish Law,</hi> as well as the <hi>Iewes</hi> with it?
<hi>Ans.</hi> (1) But our Principal difficulty here is to understand, what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
meaneth by the <hi>Iewish Law?</hi> for if he meane all that, which was prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
unto the Jewes, as a Rule of their obedience, we assent; but then
the <hi>Moral</hi> Law is as much concerned here, as the Ceremonial, or judicial:
And these, as such being abrogated, the disput concerneth us, as well as
them, in respect of the Moral Law: But if he mean hereby, only the Law
of Ceremonies, we have shown, that howbeit this might have given the
first rise unto the disput, yet the disput was not wholly &amp; purely restricted
thereunto; Nor doth the Apostle only speak to that abstracted or restricted
consideration of the Law, in his pleading against a justification by the works
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:104357:237"/>
of the Law; as we have seen; This he doth, when he pleadeth for the
Abrogation of that Law, &amp; against the observation of it. (2) <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi>
as it would seem, supposeth, that <hi>Paul</hi> made no question concerning the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
themselves, but yeelded that they were justified &amp; saved by their Law:
for the question was, saith he, whether the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might not as well be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thereby, as the <hi>Iewes?</hi> But where findeth he this, either asserted, or
granted by the Apostle, or the Question thus stated by the Apostle?</p>
               <p>2. Saith he. <hi>To prove the Affirmative, he proveth, that the Jewes themselves
cannot be saved or justified meerly or primarily by the Law, notwithstanding the
divinity &amp; great excellency of it; But must be justified by a Saviour, &amp; free given
Pardon &amp; Right to life, &amp; to which the sincere keeping of</hi> Moses <hi>Law was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be but subservient. Ans.</hi> (1) Then the Question concerned the Jewes, as
well as the Gentiles, &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> did no more grant justification by the Law to
the one, than to the other. (2) Where findeth <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> these restrictions,
<hi>Merely</hi> or <hi>Primarily,</hi> in all the Apostles disput? This is not faire, to pervert
the Apostles plaine peremptour, &amp; absolute Conclusions, &amp; restrick them
to a certain limited sense, that they may the better be subservient to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
&amp; our Hypotheses. Do the Apostles <hi>Mediums</hi> only serve to prove,
that justification is not by the Law <hi>Meerly</hi> or <hi>Primarily?</hi> Which of them all,
I pray, hath only this force? (3) Though the keeping of <hi>Moses's</hi> Law be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
said to be but subservient; Yet, according to <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> it was all their
Righteousness, no other was properly imputed to them, &amp; upon it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
they received Pardon &amp; Right to life, as merited thereby <hi>ex pacto,</hi> the
Saviour only procuring the New Covenant: that is, that all, who work
well &amp; keep the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> shall have free Pardon &amp; Right to life. And
thus they were as well justified by the works of the Law, as by faith: for
faith was also required of them: And then the meaning of the Apostles Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 28. is, therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by faith,
and by the deeds of the Law: for both faith &amp; works with <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi>
belong to this Subservient Righteousness, as he calleth it. If this be conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Apostles doctrine, which doth so contradict it, let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
judge.</p>
               <p>3. Saith he. <hi>That therefore it appeareth, that the</hi> Jewes <hi>did so fondly admire
the Law, &amp; their National Privileges under it, that they thought the exact kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of it was necessary &amp; sufficient to Iustification &amp; Salvation. And they thought
the Messiah was not to be their Righteousness, as a Sacrifice for sin, &amp; meriter of
free Pardon, &amp; the Gift of life, but only a great King &amp; Deliver, to redeem them
by Power from all their Enemies &amp; Bondage. Ans.</hi> This mistake of the Jewes,
concerning the Messiah, speaketh nothing to the point, whereupon we are;
that is, that <hi>Paul</hi> denieth justification to be by the Law: And their errour
&amp; mistake about the Law, is not to be limited &amp; restricted to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Law; &amp; so the thing, that we say, is confirmed hereby. (2) They thought
the Messiah was not to be their Righteousness: And <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> will not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
him to be our Righteousness, save only, in that he hath purchased the New
Covenant, wherein our faith &amp; obedience to the Law, is to be looked
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:104357:237"/>
upon as all our proper &amp; immediat Righteousness, upon the account of
which we are to receive Pardon &amp; Right to life.</p>
               <p>4. He saith. <hi>That is was not</hi> Adam's <hi>Covenant of Innocencie, or persection,
which the</hi> Jewes <hi>thus trusted to, or</hi> Paul <hi>doth speak against, as to justification
(though</hi> a minore ad majus, <hi>that is also excluded) for the</hi> Jewes <hi>knew, that they
were sinners, &amp; that God pardoned sin, as a Merciful God, &amp; that their Law
had Sacrifices for Pardon &amp; Expiation with Confessions &amp;c. But they thought that
so far as God had made that Law sufficient to Political ends, &amp; to Temporal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
&amp; Punishments, it had been sufficient to Eternal Rewards &amp; Punishments,
&amp; that of it self, &amp; not in meer subordination to the typified Messiah. Ans.</hi> Though
the jewes knew, that they were sinners, yet they did also suppose, that by
their works of obedience to the Law Moral, as well as Ceremonial, they
might make amends, &amp; so think to be justified &amp; pardoned thereby, and
that God would accept of them, &amp; grant them life for their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
sake, &amp; therefore did they laboure so much to establish their own
Righteousness, &amp; followed after the Law of Righteousness, &amp; sought Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
as it were by the works of the Law. What <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> talks he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
of the jewes not using of that Law, in subordination to the Typified Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,
hath need of Explication: for as to his sense of it, we see no ground
thereof in all the Apostles discourse.</p>
               <p>5. He saith, That the thing, which <hi>Paul</hi> disproveth them by, is. 1. <hi>That
the Law was never made for such an End. Ans.</hi> Yet he said, that the man,
which doth those things shall live by them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 5. <hi>Levit.</hi> 18: 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3:
12. &amp; that the doers of the Law are justified <hi>Rom.</hi> 2: 13. And therefore spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of that Law, which according to its primitive institution, was made
for such an end 2. saith he. <hi>That even then it stood in subordination to Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; free given life. Ans.</hi> This we cannot yeeld to, in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> sense,
often mentioned, for <hi>Paul</hi> no where giveth us to understand, that their
obedience to this was their immediat Righteousness, &amp; Condition of
Justification, &amp; the meritorious cause (<hi>ex pacto</hi>) of their Right to Christ,
&amp; to life &amp;c. 3. saith he. <hi>That the free Gift or Covenant of Grace, containing
the promise of the Messiah, and Pardon &amp; life by him, was before the Law, and
justified</hi> Abraham <hi>&amp; others without it. Ans.</hi> It is true, this Argument did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
militate against the Ceremonial Law; Yet, this not being the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
onely Argument, &amp; other Arguments reaching the Moral Law, as
well as the Ceremonial, we must not limite the Apostles disput only to the
Ceremonial Law. 4. saith he. <hi>That their Law was so strick, that no man could
perfectly keep it all. Ans.</hi> Adde also, that they could not perfectly keep any
one command thereof. 5. saith he. <hi>That every sin deserveth death indeed, though
their Law punished not every sin with death by the Magistrate. Ans.</hi> And this
holdeth true of the Moral, as of the Ceremonial Law. 6. saith he. <hi>That
their Law was never obligatory to the</hi> Gentile <hi>world, who had a Law written in
their hearts; &amp; therefore not the common way of justification. Ans.</hi> The Apostle
maketh no such conclusion, that therefore it was not the common way of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
for this would suppose, that it were the way of justification unto
them, which is directly against the Apostles disput. 7. saith he. <hi>That their
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:104357:238"/>
Law, as such, discovered sin, but gave not the Spirit of Grace to overcome it:
in so much, as though he himself desired perfectly to fulfill it without sin, yet he
could not, but was under a Captivity, that is, a moral necessity of Imperfection,
or sins of infirmity, from which only the grace of Christ could, as to guilt &amp; power,
deliver him. Ans.</hi> Therefore the Moral Law is as well here to be understood,
as the Ceremonial; as is manifest. 8. saith he. <hi>That no man ever come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by that way of merite, which they dreamed of, but all by the way of Redemption,
Grace, free Gift, &amp; Pardoning Mercy. Ans.</hi> But that way of merite attendeth
all works, in the matter of justification; as the Apostle assureth us <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 4.
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 8, 9. &amp; is opposed to the way of Redemption, Grace, free Gift, &amp;
Pardoning Mercy. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 6. &amp; 3; 21, 24. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 5, 7.</p>
               <p>From these things <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> draweth this Conclusion. <hi>Therefore their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite,
that they were just in the maine &amp; forgiven their sins; &amp; so justifiable by
the meer dignity of</hi> Moses <hi>Law, which they keept, &amp; by the works of the Law, &amp;
not by the free Gift, Pardon &amp; Grace of a Redeemer, &amp; by the Faith &amp; Practical
Beleife of that Gift, and acceptance of it, with thankful penitent obedient hearts,
was a Pernicioue Errour. Ans.</hi> 1. Nothing is here said to ground a restriction of
this erroneous conceite of theirs unto the Ceremonial Law: for this concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
of being justifiable by the Law, and the works thereof, in opposition to
the free Gift, Pardon &amp; Grace of a Redeemer, is as applicable to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
as to the Ceremonial Law. (2) The Apostle doth not ground his disput
upon the <hi>Iewes</hi> their express rejecting of a free Gift, &amp; of Pardon &amp;c. But
from justification by Faith, laying hold on the free Grace &amp; Merites of a
Mediator, he argueth against justification by the Law &amp; the works thereof:
And according to the Apostle's Methode do we argue. (3) To cover Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by our own inherent Righteousness, having the same place in the
New Covenant, which inherent Righteousness &amp; Obedience had in the
old, by these fine words, <hi>Faith, &amp; a Practical beleef of the Gift, &amp; acceptan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of it, with thankful penitent &amp; obedient hearts,</hi> is not such ingenuous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
as the Importance of the matter requireth: But this will be clearer by
what followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (saith he) <hi>the true way of Righteousness was to become true Christians,
that is, with such a penitent, thankful accepting, practical beleefe, or affiance
to beleeve in God, as the giver of Salvation, in Christ as the Redeemer, &amp; his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as our life &amp; Sanctifier; and to accept Christ, and all his procured Benefites,
Iustification &amp; Life, as purchased by his Sacrifice &amp; Meritorious Righteousness, &amp;
given in the New Covenant on this Condition, and so to give up ourselves to his who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
saving work, as to the Physician of our souls, &amp; only Mediator with God. This
is the summe of</hi> Paul's <hi>doctrine on this point. Ans.</hi> Not to speak of this matter he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
which is elsewhere done, I shall only say, that we are not enquiring
after the true way of Righteousness, but after the true way of Justification
before God; And enquire where the Apostle teacheth, that all the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
required unto justification, must be within us, &amp; none at all impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
as this Summe holdeth forth? Where he teacheth that this faith, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
works &amp; all obedience, is the only meane of justification? Where
he teacheth, that this inherent imperfect Righteousness of ours, is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:104357:238"/>
ground, and meritorious Cause (<hi>ex pacto</hi>) of our justification &amp;
Salvation? Where he teacheth, that Christ's Righteousness is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
ours, than as purchasing the New Covenant, wherein our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Righteousness is made the Potestative Condition of our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; Salvation? And yet these and several other Particulars of this
alloy doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hold forth, as taught, in Scripture; as hath been
seen elsewhere.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <head type="sub">Works excluded in Justification are not works only done
before Faith, nor perfect works required in the Law
of Innocency, nor outward works only.</head>
               <p>THe other Evasion, which such, as plead for the Interest of Works
in Justification, fall upon, to evite the dint of the Apostle's argueing
&amp; concludings against Works, is, That by the works of the Law,
which <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth from justification, works are meant, which are done
before Conversion &amp; Faith, by the strength of Nature; &amp; not the works of
grace done after. This is the Evasion of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> &amp; others.</p>
               <p>But against this we have these Reasons to propose.</p>
               <p>1. When the Scripture saith, we are justified by faith, the meaning is
that so soon as a soul beleeveth in Christ, by a true Faith, he is justified befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
God: But this opinion saith, That a man is not justified when he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in Christ; No not untill he performe Works of Righteousness after he
hath beleeved: And thus, we may conceive a man to be a beleever, &amp; yet
not to be justified; which is contrary to the Gospel.</p>
               <p>2. If we were justified by the Works of Regenerat persons, we should
be justified by works, that are imperfect; and consequently by an imperfect
Righteousness: for these works being made our Righteousness, if we be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by them, as our Righteousness, we must be justified by an imperfect
Righteousness; for they are not perfect, neither as to parts, nor as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
<hi>Esai.</hi> 64: 5. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 8, 10. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8: 46. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 6: 36. <hi>Eceles.</hi>
7: 20.</p>
               <p>3. Regenerat persons have renunced their own Righteousness, in the
matter of justification before God; therefore they judged, that they were
not justified thereby: And this is registrate in the word for our Instruction
&amp; example; that we may learne also to renunce our own works in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
The <hi>Antecedent</hi> is clear from these Instances (1) <hi>David</hi> saying <hi>Psal.</hi> 130:
3. <hi>If thou Lord shouldest mark iniquity, o Lord, who shall stand:</hi> And in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to this, he betakes himself to free Remission, saying <hi>vers. 4. But the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is forgiveness with thoe.</hi> So <hi>Psal.</hi> 143: 2. <hi>And enter not into judgment with thy
servant; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.</hi> So that if God should
enter in judgment with the best, even with his servants; they could not
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:104357:239"/>
expect to be justified by their works, even by their best works. So when he
saith <hi>Psal.</hi> 32: 1, 2. <hi>Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
&amp;c. he renunceth all justification by the best of his works; for <hi>Paul Rom.</hi>
4: 6, 7. giveth the meaning hereof to be, that <hi>David describeth the blessedness
of the man, unto whom God imputeth Righteousness without works.</hi> (2) <hi>Paul</hi> also
renunceth his Righteousness in this matter, &amp; that several times? for he saith
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 4. <hi>for I know nothing by my self, yet am I not hereby justified.</hi> And he
speaketh of himself, while in the State of Regeneration. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 16.
<hi>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by the Faith of
Iesus Christ, even we have beleeved in Iesus Christ, that we might be justified by
the Faith of Christ, &amp; not by the works of the Law.</hi> And <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9. he desired to
be <hi>found in Christ, not having his own Righteousness, which is of the Law.</hi> No
man can think, that by <hi>his own Righteousness</hi> here he meaneth only works, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
before he was regenerate.</p>
               <p>4. The Instances, whereby <hi>Paul</hi> proveth Justification by Faith, without
the works of the Law, confirmeth this, that works after regeneration are
excluded as well as works before: for (1) <hi>Abraham</hi> was a regenerat man when
his saith was said to be imputed to him <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 1, 2, 3. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi>
15. for before this time <hi>Gen.</hi> 12: 1. he obeyed the call of God by faith. <hi>Heb.</hi>
11: 8. See also <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 9, 10, 11. (2) <hi>David</hi> (another Instance of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Faith) was also regenerat when he was justified, as <hi>Paul</hi> cleareth
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7. by the imputation of a Righteousness, without the works of
the Law.</p>
               <p>5. The Apostle excludeth simply the works of the Law, from being the
Righteousness of any, in point of justification: And we have no warrant to
except or distinguish, where the Law excepteth not, nor distinguisheth.
The works of Regenerat persons are works, &amp; works of the Law, as well,
as any other: And <hi>Paul</hi> doth absolutely &amp; simply exclude works &amp; the works
of the Law, from being the ground of justification.</p>
               <p>6. By what reason can it be evinced, that the <hi>Law,</hi> or the <hi>Works of the
Law</hi> signifie works before Regeneration, or works done before faith, more
than other works? Do these words carry this sense, where ever they are
used? Or can it be demonstrated, that they carry this express sense any
where?</p>
               <p>7. Are only regenerat persons said to be under the Law? Now the Apostle
speaketh of all the works of those, who are under the Law, that every mouth
may be stopped, &amp; all the world become guilty before God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 19.</p>
               <p>8. The Righteousness of God, which is by Faith of Jesus Christ, is as
much without the Law, or the works of the Law, done by Regenerat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as without the Works of the Law, done before Regeneration: And
justification by these works after Regeneration, is as much inconsistent with
justification by faith without the works of the Law, as justification by the
works of the Law, done before regeneration; as is manifest, from the true
sense of justification by faith.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth all works of the Law from justification, that giveth
any ground of boasting: and of glorying, as we see <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 27. &amp; 4: 2.
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:104357:239"/>
But if justification were by works of the Law, done after Faith &amp; Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
all boasting &amp; glorying should not be excluded <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 9. <hi>Not
of works lest any many should boast:</hi> And what these works were, the next
Argument will shew.</p>
               <p>10. Even works are excluded, unto which we are created &amp; which God
hath before ordained, that we should walk in them <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 8, 9, 10. <hi>for by
grace are ye saved, through Faith, &amp; that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.
Not of works lest any man should boast: for we are his workmanship, created in
Christ Iesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we should
walk in them.</hi> Now these works are works done after regeneration, as is
manifest.</p>
               <p>11. All works are excluded in this matter, which make justification not
be of mercy or of grace. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 24. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 8. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 5, 7. But this do
works after Regeneration, as well, as before, as <hi>Paul</hi> cleareth <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2:
8, 9, 10. &amp; works &amp; grace cannot consist, in being the ground of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
no more, than in being the ground of Election. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 6.</p>
               <p>12. Works done after regeneration belong to that Righteousness, which
is of the Law, which <hi>Paul</hi> describeth <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 5. from <hi>Levit.</hi> 18: 5. to be,
<hi>that the man, which doth those things shall live in them.</hi> But the Righteousness
of the Law, &amp; the Righteousness of Faith are opposite &amp; inconsistent, as
the Apostle cleareth there <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>13. Works done after regeneration, if made the ground of justification,
will made the reward of debt &amp; not of grace <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 4. as well as works do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
before regeneration; for the Scripture holdeth forth no ground of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
in this matter.</p>
               <p>14. If works done by Faith, and after Regeneration, be admitted, as
the ground of justification, God should not be said to justifie the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for a Regenerat beleever, working works of Righteousness, is no whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
in Scripture called an ungodly man. But the Scripture speaketh this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 5.</p>
               <p>15. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 16. that the promise <hi>was of Faith, that it might
be by grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only
which is of the Law, but to that also, which is of the Faith of Abraham, who is
the Father of ut all.</hi> Now this seed which is of the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
or Regenerat persons; And yet as to these the Law is excluded, &amp;
the works thereof; because if they which are of the Law be heirs, Faith is
made void, &amp; the promise made of none effect <hi>vers.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>16. If Justification were by the works of the Law, done after Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
we could not, upon first beleeving, be justified, &amp; have peace with
God, through our Lord Jesus Christ; nor could we rejoice in hope of the
glory of God, &amp; glory in tribulation &amp;c. And yet this the Apostle expresly
affirmeth <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 1, 2, 3. &amp;c. If justification did depend upon our after
works, we could not as yet have peace &amp; reconciliation, or assurance, or
joy &amp;c. because of the uncertainty of our obedience.</p>
               <p>17. If <hi>Paul</hi> had not excluded works done after Faith &amp; Regeneration,
from being the Cause &amp; ground of our justification, what seeming ground
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:104357:240"/>
or occasion had there been for that objection <hi>Rom.</hi> 6: 1. What shall we say
then? <hi>Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</hi> What ground could
any have to say. We are justified by our works done after Regeneration; the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
we may continue in sin, that grace may abound? Any might see at
first, how ridiculous this was.</p>
               <p>18. And if we are justified by works done after Regeneration, is it not
strange, that in all <hi>Paul's</hi> answers unto this objection, he never once sayeth,
nor hinteth, that by these works we shall be justified, &amp; no other way, and
yet this had been the shortest &amp; clearest solution of the objection, if it been
according to the doctrine of justification, delivered by <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>19. The false Apostles, who were corrupting the doctrine of the Gospel
&amp; of Justification, did not urge works done before Faith in the Gospel, as
the ground of justification, for they were corrupting such, as had already
embraced the Gospel &amp; beleeved in Christ? as is clear out of the Epistle to
the <hi>Galatians.</hi> Therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> is confuting their errour, &amp; oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
himself unto them, he must deny that we are justified by works done
after Faith in Christ.</p>
               <p>20. Justification by works done after regeneration, is as opposite to faith,
&amp; to living the life of justification by faith, as justification by works done
before Regeneration for the Law is never of faith, so reasoneth <hi>Paul Gal.</hi> 3.
11, 12. <hi>But that no man is justified by the Law, in the sight of God, it is evident:
For the just shall live by Faith: And the Law is not of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>21. All the works of the Law are excluded: But works wrought after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
&amp; after Regeneration, are works of the Law, being required thereby
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119: 35. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: 22. Therefore even these works are excluded.</p>
               <p>22. When the Apostle excludeth works from being causes of justification
he must meane good works, for no man was ever so mad, as to imagine, that
he could be justified by bad works. But no works can be called good works but
such as flow from faith, &amp; from the Spirit of grace, granted in Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Therefore while good works are excluded, these done after Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
are excluded.</p>
               <p>What is said by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in confirmation of his sense of these works
of the Law, which are excluded from justification, is abundantly ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered
by all, that write against him; &amp; therefore we need not take any
notice thereof.</p>
               <p>There is another Evasion, found out by our Adversaries in this matter, &amp;
another glosse put upon these works. <hi>By the works of the Law there shall no
flesh be justified.</hi> For some say, that hereby the Apostle only excludeth those
works, that are perfect, which were required by the Law in Innocency. This
Evasion granteth, that the Law here spoken of is not the Ceremonial Law,
for that was not required in Innocency; but the Moral Law. The end why
they invent this Evasion is not, to exclude works in the matter of justification;
but to establish their own fancie of asserting justification by other works,
than perfect works, required by the Covenant of works, to wit by imperfect
works, which they say, are required in the Gospel: And therefore their
meaning is, we are not justified by perfect sinless obedience; but by imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:104357:240"/>
obedience to the Law. This is the Evasion of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who say,
the Apostle speaketh of the <hi>works of the Law,</hi> to shew, that he speaketh of
those works, which are enjoined by the Law, to wit of perpetual &amp; perfect
obedience required by the Law: And they say, that by Faith he meaneth
that confidence &amp; obedience, which every one is able to performe, and
which is endeavoured after &amp; studied.</p>
               <p>That this cannot be the meaning of the Apostles conclusion, we suppose
will be clear from these Considerations.</p>
               <p>1. This supposeth, that they against whom the Apostle is here dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
were of opinion, that men could yet be justified, &amp; must be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by perfect obedience to the Moral Law: But it is hardly imaginable,
that men in their wits did ever so dreame, or think, that they were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
&amp; could expect to be justified before God by their own perfection, or
perfect obedience to the Law in all points: for this were to say, they never
had sinned:</p>
               <p>2. When the Apostle, in the beginning of his disput, in his Epistle to the
<hi>Romans</hi> proveth, that all have sinned, &amp; are guilty before God, both jew &amp;
Gentile, he thence inferreth, that by the works of the Law, no flesh shall
be justified in God's sight <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 20. Whereby he giveth us to understand,
that there is no justification by the Law, unless it be perfectly keeped: And
because no meer man did ever keep it perfectly, or can so keep it; therefore
he concludeth, that no man can be justified thereby. There is no justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by works, unless the works be perfect; &amp; consequently that such as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
justification thereby, be wholly sinless.</p>
               <p>3. If the Apostle had so disputed against justification by perfect works, as
to have granted, or established justification by imperfect works; he needed
not have used any moe arguments to that end, than what was mentioned &amp;
cleared <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. &amp; in the beginning of the 3. <hi>Chapter:</hi> for his evincing
that all had sinned &amp; come short of the Glory of God, had been sufficient to
this end, without the addition of any one argument more, seing it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that sinners can be perfect obeyers. And we must not think, that all
the Apostles further argueings are meerly superfluous, for this would reflect
upon the Spirit of God, who acted <hi>Paul</hi> in this.</p>
               <p>4. How strange is it to imagine, that the Apostle should disput against
perfect works, that he might establish imperfect works in the matter of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification:
&amp; to think that the Apostle is proving, that we are not justified
by the perfect works of the Law, but by the imperfect works thereof; that
is, we are not justified by such works, as keep a conformity with the Law,
but by such works, as are violations of the Law; as all works are, which
are not conforme thereunto, in all points?</p>
               <p>5. Imperfect works, as to the ground of justification, are not that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of God without the Law, &amp; which is by Faith of Jesus Christ,
but opposite the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eunto, and inconsistent therewith, as well as perfect
works: for as he, that perfectly keepeth the Law, needeth not another
Righteousness, in order to his justification; so neither needeth he, who
hath an imperfect obedience if that be made the formal objective &amp; meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:104357:241"/>
cause of justification. But Gospel-justification is by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of God, which is without the Law, &amp; which Faith laith hold on
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 21, 22.</p>
               <p>6. Gospel justification is by Faith, as the whole Gospel cleareth; but
faith &amp; imperfect works are not one &amp; the same: Yea they are as repugnant
in this affaire, as faith &amp; perfect works are. We are justified by faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the deeds of the Law. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 16. Living by faith &amp; living
by works, are opposite. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 11, 12.</p>
               <p>7. Justification by imperfect works, is not free justification by his grace
through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ, whom God hath set forth
to be a propitiation through faith in his blood: as is manifest: But this is the
Gospel-justification <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 24, 25.</p>
               <p>8. Imperfect works, exclude grace, &amp; are as inconsistent therewith,
as perfect works are. But Gospel-justification is by grace without works
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 24. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 8, 9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 5, 6, 7. The <hi>Major</hi> is clear from the
places cited, as also from <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 6. <hi>If by grace, then it is no more of works
otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
otherwise work is no more work.</hi> Now if it be said, that perfect works
are here understood, and not imperfect works: it must be said also, that
Election (of which the Apostle here speaketh) is upon foresight of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
works.</p>
               <p>9. Imperfect works if made the Cause of Justification, can give ground of
boasting &amp; of glorying, as we see in the Pharisee <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. But Gospel justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
removeth all ground of boasting. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 27 &amp; 4: 2.</p>
               <p>10. Imperfect works can not be accounted a perfect Righteousness, by the
Lord, whose judgment is according to truth <hi>Rom.</hi> 2: 2. But there is no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
without a perfect Righteousness, either inherent, or imputed.
God will pronounce no man Righteous, who is not so, nor justifie any as
Righteous, who is not so indeed: But upon the account of an imperfect
Righteousness, can no man be justified as Righteous.</p>
               <p>11. Even this imperfect Righteousness, when made the ground of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
will make the reward of debt, and not of grace: As <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
works, if he had been justified by them, would have done: for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's</hi>
works were not perfect works, but imperfect works, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.</p>
               <p>12. If justification were not by perfect works, but by imperfect works,
then through faith, or through Gospel justification, the Law should be
made void, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 31. The reason of the consequence is, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
hereby the Law, that requireth perfect obedience, is laid aside &amp; another
Law that requireth imperfect obedience admitted in its place: or rather the
same Law is pretended, but it is made void, as to its requireing perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
&amp; must now be satisfied with an imperfect obedience. But this is not
to establish the Law, but to destroy it, when many Jotes &amp; titles are taken
away from it <hi>Mat.</hi> 5: 17, 18.</p>
               <p>13. The <hi>Iewes</hi> did not imagine, that they were perfect &amp; without sin, but
followed after the Law of Righteousness, &amp; that, as it were (<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi>) by the
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:104357:241"/>
works of the Law <hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 31, 32: And this of necessity must have been
mixed with much imperfection: And yet the Apostle plainly saith in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
cited, that they did not attaine to a Righteousness, nor to the Law of
Righteousness, because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the
works of the Law, so that seeking after Righteousness as it were by the works
of the Law, is opposite to a seeking of it by Faith. And againe <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 3.
they went about to establish their own Righteousness, and did not submit
themselves unto the Righteousness of God; which two are opposite &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent;
And this their own Righteousness, was but an imperfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
which they were labouring to cause stand, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>14. We cannot imagine, that when the Apostle did exclude his own
Righteousness, and desired not to be found therein, he only excluded, that
which was not; &amp; desired not to be found in that, which he had not, and
which he knew he had not, to wit, a perfect sinless obedience. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: 24.
1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1: 13, 15. He confessed he had been a blasphemer, and the chiefe
of sinners, and so was far from imagineing, that his obedience was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
&amp; sinless. This then could not be the Righteousness, whereof he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9. but his imperfect Righteousness, being that only which
he could call his owne, is that only, which he desired not to be found
in, in the day of his appearing before his judge, in order to his justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>15. If <hi>Paul</hi> had disputed only against perfect obedience &amp; had yeelded ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by imperfect obedience. What ground was there for that obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6: 1. <hi>Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound:</hi> seing justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by imperfect obedience doth of it self engadge to all endeavoure after
obedience, &amp; against the allowance of sin?</p>
               <p>16. And the Apostles answere to this objection may fournish us with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Argument against this; for if <hi>Paul</hi> had allowed of, or pleaded for
justification by our imperfect works, he had used this, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> least, as one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to perswade unto an absteaning from sin, by saying, there is no justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
but by endeavouring after obedience; But we hear of no such think
in all the Apostles Arguments, whereby he presseth unto holiness &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
whether there, or elsewhere.</p>
               <p>17. We are not justified by works done after Faith &amp; Regeneration, as
was proved before. Therefore we are not justified by imperfect works; for
works after faith are imperfect, &amp; againe, they cannot but be so, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposing
sin &amp; guilt going before.</p>
               <p>There is yet another Evasion, wherewith some satisfie themselves, for
they say, that when <hi>Paul</hi> saith, we are not justified by the works of the
Law, by these works, he meaneth only <hi>outward works of the Law, performed
without an inward Principle of Grace, of faith, or fear or Love of God.</hi> But we
need not insist in the discovery of the vanity of this Evasion, having before
at large proved, that the works, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, are not works
done before Faith &amp; Regeneration; For all these works, that are done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Faith &amp; Regeneration, are done without any inward Principle of Grace,
&amp; are only outward works, such as Heathens may performe: a few reasons
will serve he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:104357:242"/>
1. When <hi>Paul</hi> denieth justification to be by the Law, or by the works
thereof; he must mean such works, as are enjoined &amp; commanded by the
Law: But the Law commandeth other works, than those outward works,
for it condemneth all works, that flow not from a principle of grace: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Law is holy &amp; spiritual, &amp; the first &amp; chiefe command thereof is,
that we, Love the Lord our God, with all our heart; with all our soul with
all our strength &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: 12, 14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22: 37. <hi>Mark.</hi> 12: 30. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10:
27. <hi>Deut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 13: 3. &amp; 30: 6. If then <hi>Paul</hi> exclude only such works, as flow
not from a principle of grace, he shall not exclude the works of the Law,
but works prohibited by the Law; &amp; his meaning should be, we are not
justified by works, which the Law commandeth not, but we are justified
by works, which the Law commandeth: which is contradictory to the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
scope &amp; designe of the Apostle.</p>
               <p>2. The Apostle doth manifestly exclude the works of <hi>Abraham Rom.</hi> 4: 1, 2.
But the works of <hi>Abraham</hi> were other than such servile works or such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
works, performed from no principle of grace or Love to God; The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
such cannot be here understood.</p>
               <p>3. Outward works, done without any principle of grace, could with no
face or shew of a pretence, lay a ground, or be any occasion of boasting or
of glorying, because they were no other, but manifest sins, being prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
&amp; condemned by the Law, &amp; not commanded or approven: But the
Apostle excludeth such works, as could do this. Therefore he excludeth
good works, which were done in conformitie to the Law, &amp; not such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
lifeless works only, as were meer servile works, &amp; no better.</p>
               <p>4. Such lifeless, servile, &amp; outward works could give no shew of a ground
of making the reward of debt: But <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth such works as would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
the reward of debt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 4.</p>
               <p>5. If <hi>Paul</hi> had meaned here only such outward, servile works, which
are not conforme to the Law; what occasion had there been, for <hi>Paul's</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseing
of that objection. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 31. <hi>Do we then make void the Law through
Faith?</hi> for to lay aside these works, which are not conforme to the Law,
giveth no probable ground of supposal, that thereby the Law is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
void.</p>
               <p>6. Israel could not have been said to have followed after the Law of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
by doing of works meerly ourward &amp; lifeless: And yet this is said
of them, &amp; it is also said, that by all their following of the Law of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
they could not be justified. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 31, 32.</p>
               <p>7. Meer performance of outward servile works, cannot be called a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:
But the jewes went about to establish their own Righteousness,
&amp; therefore missed justification. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 4.</p>
               <p>8. There was never any life had by these outward &amp; servile works alone;
But by the works, which <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth, there was life to be had, if they
had been perfect. <hi>The man, which doth those things, shall live by them. Rom.</hi> 2:
13. &amp; 10: 5. <hi>Levit.</hi> 18: 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 12.</p>
               <p>9. These outward servile works are not good works; but even good works
are here excluded. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 9, 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="481" facs="tcp:104357:242"/>
10. <hi>Paul</hi> did not meane such works only, when he excluded his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9. Nor can such works be called <hi>works of Righteousness;</hi>
which yet are expresly excluded in this matter. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 5.</p>

               <head type="sub">By works, which Paul excludeth, is not meant the

               <p>THere is one other Evasion, thought upon to shift by all the Apostles
argueings, &amp; yet to maintaine the Interest of Works, as the Cause
&amp; ground of justification before God, <hi>to wit.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> only disputs
against a groundless conceite of merite in works; not against the works them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but against a Pharisaical sense of merite &amp; worth in their works, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby
they conceived &amp; conceited, that thereby they could satisfie for their
sins, &amp; buy &amp; purchase to themselves Justification &amp; Salvation. But against
this Evasion, we have these things to say.</p>
               <p>1. By merite here must either be understood, that which is called <hi>meritum
ex condigno,</hi> that is, that merite, which ariseth from the due proportion
of worth, that one thing hath unto another, in the ballance of equity &amp; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
And who ever imagine this merite in their works, must dreame of an
intrinsick worth in their works, which God, if he do according to justice,
cannot but reward with eternal life: or that which is called <hi>meritum ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruo,</hi>
which floweth not from any inward Condignity in the work, but from
a Promise or Covenant, &amp; so it is <hi>meritum ex pacto,</hi> whereby the reward is
not absolutly of grace, but of debt, because of a congruity in the thing, in
respect of the Promise &amp; Compact made. Our Adversaries cannot understand
this last, when they say, that <hi>Paul</hi> disputeth against merite, because them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
owne it, when they make works the Condition of the Covenant, &amp;
God to have promised justification &amp; life unto our works. Neither are they
shy of the word <hi>merite</hi> it self, as we saw lately from Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> But now, that
<hi>Paul</hi> is not disputing against the merite of works, in the first sense, is manifest
from these. (1) The very works required of <hi>Adam</hi> in the first Covenant, had
not in them this intrinsick worth &amp; merite ex condigno, and so the Apostle
shall be disputing against that, which never was nor never will be nay, nor
cannot be. (2) Then the Apostle saith nothing to disprove justification by
the Old Covenant of Works made with <hi>Adam,</hi> but establisheth that, which
who can beleeve? (3) No man, that is right in his wits, can imagine such a
thing. And shall we think that the Apostle is disputing against that, which
none, but such as are transported with mere ignorance &amp; vanity, will owne,
or stand to, in their more sedate &amp; composed thoughts. (4) Even the most
proud &amp; vaine person, that is, will joyn the free mercy of God, with all the
conceite of merite they have; but this merite <hi>ex condigno</hi> leaveth no imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
room for the free mercy of God, in lesse, or more. (5) <hi>Paul</hi> disputeth
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:104357:243"/>
not against the merite <hi>ex congruo,</hi> as separated from the works themselves,
whereupon it is founded. As the following Arguments will evince. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
far less doth he dispute only against the fond &amp; foolish conceite of the
merite <hi>ex condigno.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is strange, that the Apostle should dispute against that, which he
doth never once mentione, in his dispute, or in his Conclusions. He every
where mentioneth works &amp; the Law, &amp; the works of the Law; but no
where mentioneth he this merite of works, as the thing he disputeth against,
as abstracted &amp; distinguished from the works themselves.</p>
               <p>3. And that place, which they think, giveth some countenance unto
their imaginations, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 4: 4. <hi>Now to him that worketh is the rewasd not
reckoned of grace, but of debt,</hi> is directly against them: for, there the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
sheweth that works are excluded, &amp; all works (for there is no distinction
made) are excluded; because, then the reward should be of debt: shewing,
that if works have any place, in the matter of justification, debt must have
place also; but because debt hath no place, but grace (which two are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
&amp; incompatible) therefore all works are excluded. And to think,
that the meaning of the Apostle is, now to him, that worketh, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite
of merite, attending his work, the reward is reckoned of debt; is to
adde to the word of God, to pervert the Apostles Argument, &amp; to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the scope &amp; cohesion of the words; as hath been shown elsewhere, far
less can any hence inferre a restriction of works to such only as make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of debt: for then the reward might be reckoned to him, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
&amp; yet be reckoned of grace &amp; not of debt, &amp; thus the Apostles Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
should be manifestly false, &amp; a plaine <hi>Paralogisme:</hi> which were wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness
&amp; blasphemie to assert.</p>
               <p>4. The Apostle excludeth, in as plaine termes, as can be, all the works
of the Law: but even such works, as are performed without this fond &amp;
groundless conceite of mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te, are works of the Law, being required &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Law. Yea the Law never commanded any works with this
conceite of merite: And therefore by this opinion none of the works of the
Law are excluded.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Adam</hi> was obliged to give perfect obedience to the Law, without the
least
thought of meriteing <hi>ex condigno</hi> thereby: And if no merite or works
with a conceite of merite be now excluded, but the merite <hi>ex condigno,</hi> then
is the Covenant of works established by the Gospel. Nay thus, our imperfect
works, are made to merite as well <hi>ex congruo</hi> &amp; <hi>ex pacto,</hi> justification &amp; life,
as <hi>Adam's</hi> perfect &amp; sinless obedience could have done.</p>
               <p>6. The man that hath works, without this conceite of merite, can not
be called an ungodly man, no more than <hi>Adam</hi> could have been called so,
while he stood in his integritie: But the justification under the Gospel is of
the ungodly, God <hi>justifieth the ungodly. Rom.</hi> 4: 5. Nor can the worker with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this conceite of meriting, be said to be one that worketh not, but belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
on him, that justifieth the ungodly: as is manifest.</p>
               <p>7. Either the Apostle establisheth works of justification by them, &amp; only
condemneth the apprehension of merite in our works: or he excludeth all
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:104357:243"/>
works, in which men may conceite some merite to lye. If the <hi>first</hi> be said,
then I conceive, the Apostle would have once mentioned this in argueings
&amp; conclusions, and not alwayes have mentioned the Law &amp; the works of
the Law; for with our adversaries these are separable, and from the one
the other can not be inferred: but we see not the least appearance of any
such thing in all the Apostles argueings. And if the <hi>last</hi> be said. We
have all we desire, for thus all works shall be excluded, because men
can &amp; ignorant persons too oft do imagine &amp; conceite a merite in what
they do, though not that merite, which is <hi>ex condigno,</hi> Yet that which is
<hi>ex congruo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. If the Apostle disput not against works, but against a conceite of meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
in works, why doth he not oppose works without this conceite unto this
conceite, or to works with this conceite? Why doth he alwayes oppose
Faith unto works, &amp; say, we are justified by faith without the deeds of the
Law? Is works the same with conceite of merite, or with works having
this conceite adjointed? and is faith the same with works, or with works
without this conceite of merite? Then <hi>Adam</hi> should have been justified by
faith, if he had stood in his state of innocency; for he should have been ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by works without this conceite. But what palpable &amp; manifest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
of the Scripture &amp; of the works thereof, is this? To take this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of expounding the words of the Scripture, is plainly to make nothing of
the Scripture, but what we please.</p>
               <p>9. Are there no <hi>mediums</hi> to prove, that there is no merite in our works
in reference to justification &amp; Salvation, but such as the Apostle here useth,
to exclude works from this Interest? If this had been all, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
had intended, his saying with Christ. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17: 10. <hi>So lilkewise ye, when
ye shall have done all those things, which are commanded you, say, we are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
servants; we have done that, which was our duty to do,</hi> had sufficiently
confuted that mistake: But the long series of Arguments, with their varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which the Apostle here useth, manifestly declare, there was some other
thing in his eye; and he levelled at some other mark, even that, which he
plainly declareth, in his repeated conclusions, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are justified by
faith in Jesus Christ, without the works of the Law.</p>
               <p>10. Gospel Justification is of Grace. And therefore is not of works: <hi>Rom.</hi>
4: 4. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. And the Apostle cleareth the consequence, because all
works have a ground of merite with them, &amp; make the reward of debt &amp;
give ground to the worker to boast &amp; to glory before men: thought not befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
God: for upon these grounds doth the Apostle reject all works, in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire;
as we see <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 27. &amp; 4: 2. Now to say, that the Apostle rejecteth
only such works, as men conceite to be meritorious for their intrinsick worth,
&amp; not other works, that merite only <hi>ex pacto;</hi> is to destroy the Apostles
Arguments, &amp; to enervat all his discourse; for even works meritorious <hi>ex
congruo,</hi> or <hi>ex pacto,</hi> will give ground of boasting before men, &amp; make the
reward of debt, as we know it would have been, if <hi>Adam's</hi> Covenant had
stood: But whatever works lay the foundation of due debt, they stand in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the way of grace; for grace &amp; debt are not compatible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="484" facs="tcp:104357:244"/>
11. If any were puffed up with this conceite of the meritoriousness of
their works, <hi>ex condigno,</hi> it could be none beside the proud fantastick Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees;
nor is there any ground to suspect any other. And if so, why, may
we suppose, would the Apostle state a needless controversie, a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
concerning all both <hi>Iewes</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when none of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and
few, if any of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> were concerned therein? And why, may we
enquire, would the Apostle so laboriously prove both <hi>Iewes</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentiles</hi>
to be guilty of sin? and why doth he speak of them all, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
seing the question did only concerne a few, &amp; a very few, &amp; such, as
are never once named in all the dispute? These things look not very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
like.</p>
               <p>12. Can we think, that the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who were seduced by false Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
to adjoine to their Christianity, the practice of some jewish Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
were also carried away with this absurd Phancie, that there was a
meritoriousness <hi>ex condigno,</hi> in all their works? Though there be ground to
imagine such a thing; Yet we see the Apostle followeth the same disput a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, that he did, in writting to the <hi>Romans,</hi> of which no reason
could be assigned if this merite was all, he disputed down.</p>
               <p>13. We finde it said of the Jewes <hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 31. that they followed after
the Law of Righteousness; and yet by so doing did not attaine unto the Law
of Righteousness; because (<hi>vers.</hi> 32.) it was not by Faith, but as it were
by the works of the Law. Now neither were these works of the Law, nor
that Law of Righteousness which they were following after, a meer irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
conceite &amp; groundless fancie of a merite in what they did, or of an
intrinsick worth, meriting <hi>ex condigno</hi> the reward they expected. But a
groundless apprehension, that their works themselves was the way of their
attaining unto life, &amp; therefore they followed that way of works, &amp; would
not take the way of faith, but stumbled at that stumbling stone.</p>
               <p>14. Then, according to this interpretation, works performed without
this conceite of merite, must be God's Righteousness, as works together
with this conceite of merite must be our owne: for these two are opposite.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 3. But there is no ground to imagine; that our works performed
without this fonde conceit of merite in them, are the Righteousness, for
these are not Christ, or his Righteousness: And it is there added <hi>vers.</hi> 4. for
explication of the Righteousdess of God, <hi>for Christ is the end of the Law for
Righteousness, to every one that beleeveth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>15. The Righteousness of the Law is, that the man, which doth these
things shall live by them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10: 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 12. <hi>Levit.</hi> 18: 5. So that
this Righteousness consisteth in mans own doing: and not in a meer irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
apprehension of a merite in what he doth: So that it is not this ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
phancie, that the Apostle is disputing against, but this Righteousness,
which is of the Law, because he is labouring to establish by his doctrine, the
Righteousness of Faith, which is opposite to &amp; inconsistent with the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the Law.
And this Righteousness of Faith is not our own perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Righteousness, or obedience performed to the Law without this appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
&amp; conceite of merite, as is clear from <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11. following,
&amp; from the whole Gospel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:104357:244"/>
16. If this be all that the Apostle is disputing down, to wit, justification
by works, which we conceite to be meritorious, &amp; not all justification hy
works, why did the Apostle adduce the Instance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; insist so
much upon it, as he doth <hi>Rom.</hi> 4? Shall we think, that <hi>Abraham</hi> that holy
Patriarch &amp; friend of God, did obey with any such conceite of intrinsick
worth, in his obedience? Was he infected with that leaven of Pharisaical
pride? And if not, where is the consequence of the Apostles argueing from
his practice? Is it a good consequence to say, Abraham was not justified by
works performed in sincerity, without pharisaical pride &amp; conceite of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites;
therefore we cannot be justified by works, which we conceite to
have merite in them: but by such works we can &amp; must be justified, when
we conceite no merite in them, but a simple merite <hi>ex congruo,</hi> or <hi>ex pacto?</hi>
The like may be said of <hi>David,</hi> who had no conceite of merite in his works,
&amp; yet expected not to be justified by them, but looked for free pardon, &amp;
for justification through imputed Righteousness. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>17. If the Apostle had been establishing justification by works performed
without such a fonde conceite of merite in them; what ground was there for
that objection which he preoccupieth <hi>Rom.</hi> 6: 1. saying. <hi>Shall we sin, that
grace may abound?</hi> The urging of justification by works, could give no shew
or apparent ground for this. Neither can any such purpose be in the least seen
&amp; observed, in all the answere at large prosecuted <hi>Chapters</hi> 6. &amp; 7. which is
given hereunto. There is not the least hint given of his rectifying of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehensions,
that any might have about works, as if they were or could
be supposed to be meritorious <hi>ex condigno:</hi> Nor is there the least ground of
surmise laid down, of their being meritorious of justification or of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>ex congruo,</hi> or <hi>ex pacto:</hi> but all things sound the contrary way: &amp; life
eternal is expresly said to be the free gift of God.</p>
               <p>18. Then all that <hi>Paul</hi> meaned, when he desired to be found of his jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
not having his own Righteousness, which is of the Law, was that he
desired not to be found puft up with a pharisaical conceite of the perfection &amp;
meritoriousness of his works, as meriteing his justification &amp; life <hi>ex condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
by their intrinsick value &amp; worth. But no such thing appeareth <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.
9. where he utterly renunceth his own Righteousness, which is of the Law;
that is, a Righteousness consisting in his obedience &amp; conformity to the Law:
for in opposition to this, he desireth to be found in that Righteousness, which
is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness, which is of God by faith;
&amp; this is some other thing, than his own works, performed without that
pharisaical opinion.</p>
               <p>19. We are saved by grace, through faith, not of works, lest any man
should boast, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 8, 9. &amp; consequently not of any works, seing all
works give ground of boasting. And he meaneth such works, unto
which we are created in Christ Jesus, as his workmanship: and which
God hath before ordained, that we should walk in them <hi>vers.</hi> 10. Now
these works are certainly works done without any vaine conceite of meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te:
and yet we see, that by these works we are not brought into a state of
Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="486" facs="tcp:104357:245"/>
20. The Apostle excludeth works of Righteousness, which we have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
as opposed to Mercy &amp; grace. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 5, 7. Now grace standeth in
opposition to all works, even to works performed without this conceite
of merite, as we see <hi>Rom.</hi> 11: 6. else we must say, that the Apostle there
granteth Election to be for foreseen works, performed without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite
of merite, and nothing must be called works, but what is done
with a Pharisaical conceite of merite &amp; intrinsick worth in them, which is
absurd.</p>

               <p>ALI, who have been of old, and are this day Adversaries to the way
of justification before God, which the Orthodox owne from the
Scriptures, have thought to shelter themselves, under the wings of
of some expressions of the Apostle <hi>Iames;</hi> &amp; have therefore laboured so to
explaine &amp; streatch forth the same expressions, as they with their corrupt
Notions about justification may seem at least to have some countenance the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refrom,
yea and warrandise to hold fast the same: And for this cause they
have laboured so much, and do still laboure, so to expound the words of
<hi>Paul,</hi> as that they may carry no seeming difference unto the words of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes:</hi>
for it is received as a known truth, and it is willingly granted, that
there is no real Contradiction betwixt the two Apostles, but what ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
or seeming disagreement there be betwixt their words; yet all that
difficulty is removable; &amp; their words, how contradictory soever they seem
to be, are yet capable of such an interpretation, as shall manifest their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
agreement in the truth: so that <hi>Iames</hi> saying Ch. 2: 24, <hi>Ye see
then, how that by works a man is justified, &amp; not by faith only,</hi> dot not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who saith &amp; concludeth, <hi>that a man is justified by faith
without the deeds of the Law. Rom.</hi> 3: 28.</p>
               <p>But a question is here made, whether we should interpret <hi>Iames's</hi> words
by <hi>Paul's,</hi> or <hi>Paul's</hi> by <hi>Iames's.</hi> Our Adversaries are much for this later,
to wit, that we must interpret <hi>Paul's</hi> words by the words of <hi>Iames,</hi> becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
as they alledge, <hi>Paul</hi> is obscure in his doctrine, &amp; many were beginning
to misinterpret &amp; pervert the same &amp; that therefore <hi>Iames</hi> was necessitate to
clear up that doctrine of justification, so as <hi>Paul's</hi> words might be better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
But how unreasonable this is, the leamed <hi>D. Owen</hi> hath lately
manifested, &amp; his grounds are indeed irrefragable; for (1) It is a received
way of interpreting Scriptures, that when two places seem to be repugnant
unto other, that place, which treateth of the matter directly, designedly,
expresly &amp; largely, is to regulate our interpretation of the other place, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the matter is only touched <hi>obiter,</hi> on the bye, and upon some other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and in order to some other ends. And that therefore accordingly, we
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:104357:245"/>
must interpret <hi>Iames</hi> by <hi>Paul,</hi> and not <hi>Paul</hi> by <hi>Iames;</hi> seing it is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote of this Subject of Justification, directly &amp; on purpose
to cleare up the same, and that with all expresness &amp; fulness, on severall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
disputing the same, in a clear &amp; formal manner, with all sorts of
Arguments, Artificial &amp; Inartificial, and answereth objections, that might
be moved against the same, at large, and with a special accuracie: But on
the other hand, it is as certaine, that <hi>Iames</hi> hath not this for his scope to
open up the Nature of Justification; but only toucheth there-upon, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the other end, which he was prosecuting. (2) There is no ground to
suppose, that it was the designe of <hi>Iames</hi> to explaine the meaning of <hi>Paul,</hi>
no footstep of any such purpose appeareth. For then his maine business should
be to explaine &amp; clear up the doctrine of justification, which neither is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
from this part of the Epistle, nor from any part of it at all; his desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
being quite another thing, as is obvious. (3) Nor was there any necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
for <hi>Iames,</hi> to Vindicate the doctrine of <hi>Paul,</hi> from such corrupt inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as Adversaries suppose, were made therefrom: for as to any such, as
might be made, <hi>to wit,</hi> as if he had given any countenance unto such, as we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
willing to lay aside good works; he himself did fully &amp; sufficiently Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
his owne doctrine, by showing, on all occasions, the necessity of
good works, and particularly when he is speaking of Justification, not only
in his Epistles to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> where he largly &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly
treateth of that matter, but even when he is but mentioning the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
on other occasions; as we see <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 8, 9, 10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 9, 10, 11, &amp;c. &amp;
<hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 5, 6, 7, 8. So that to imagine that <hi>Iames</hi> asserteth another interest
of works in our justification, than <hi>Paul</hi> doth, and that to explaine <hi>Paul's</hi>
meaning, is not to reconcile these Apostles, but to set them at further va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
&amp; enmity. And it cannot comport with sobriety, to think or say,
that <hi>Iames,</hi> to cleare the Apostle <hi>Paul's</hi> doctrine, and to vindicate it from
objections, should speak to the same objections, which <hi>Paul</hi> himself had
spoken to &amp; fully removed, and that <hi>Iames</hi> should give such answers unto
these objections, as <hi>Paul</hi> would not give, but rather rejected: And yet
this must be said by our Adversaries here.</p>
               <p>It will be of great use to us here, to understand aright, what is the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
scope &amp; drift of the Apostle <hi>Iames;</hi> for as for the designe &amp; scope of
<hi>Paul,</hi> in his discourses of justification, it is so obviously manifest unto all
that read the same, that no doubt can be made thereof, <hi>to wit.</hi> To cleare
up fully &amp; plainely the Nature &amp; Causes of this great privilege of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the hinge &amp; ground work (as it were) of his doctrine of the
Gospel, and to shew how poor sinners, standing under the Curse for sin,
come to be justified before God; as in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans:</hi> And to
Vindicate the same doctrine of the Gospel from the corrupt pervesions
of false teachers, as in his Epistle to the <hi>Galatians;</hi> as also to commend
the free grace of God, in that noble contrivance, both in the places men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and <hi>Ephes. 2. Phil. 3. Tit.</hi> 3. and elsewhere, when he mentioneth
the same.</p>
               <p>Now as to the scope of the Apostle <hi>Iames,</hi> there is nothing to declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:104357:246"/>
us, that it was his Intent, or designe to explaine &amp; make known the way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
how poor convinced sinners, standing under the sentence of the Law, come
to be justified before God, and to receive pardon of their sins. No such
question proposeth he to be discussed; No such point of truth doth he lay
down to be cleared, or Vindicated. But his whole scope &amp; drift is to press
the reall study of holiness, in several points particularly spoken to through
the Epistle. And in that second <hi>Chapt.</hi> from <hi>vers.</hi> 14. &amp; forward (as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
more fully in the explication &amp; vindication of the several verses in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular)
he is particularly obviating that grosse mistake of some, who thought
that a bare outward profession of the Gospel Faith, or of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
was sufficient to save them, and evidence them to be in a justified
state, and that therefore they needed not trouble themselves with any study
of holiness: And therefore sheweth, that all such hopes of Salvation were
built on the sand, for they had no ground to suppose, that they were truely
justified, &amp; so were in any faire way unto salvation, so long as all their faith
was no other, than a general assent unto the doctrine of the Gospel, &amp; to
truthes revealed, &amp; not that true lively faith, hold forth in the Gospel,
whereby sinners become justified before God.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tels <hi>Cath. Theol. part.</hi> 2. n. 364. that St. James <hi>having to do
with some, who thought that the bare profession of Christianity, was Christianity;
&amp; that faith was a meer assent to the Truth; &amp; that to beleeve that the Gospel is
true, &amp; trust to be justified by Christ was enough to justification, without Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
&amp; fruitful Lives; &amp; that their sin &amp; barrenness hindered not their justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
so that they thus beleeved (perhaps misunderstanding</hi> Paul's <hi>Epistles) doth
convince them, that they were mistaken; &amp; that when God spake of</hi> justification
by faith, without the works of the Law, <hi>he never meaned a faith that contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not a resolution to obey him in whom we beleeve, nor that is separate from actual
obedience in the prosecution: But that as we must be justified by our</hi> Faith <hi>against
the charge of being</hi> Insidels; <hi>so must we be justified by</hi> our Gospel personal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and sincere obedience, <hi>against the charge, that we are</hi> unholy <hi>&amp;</hi> wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
<hi>or</hi> impenitent, <hi>or</hi> hypocrites, <hi>or else we shall never be adjudged to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is justified by God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> (1) It is true, for it is manifest, and undeniable, that <hi>Iames</hi> had to
do with some, who thought that the bare profession of Christianity was
enough, &amp; that an assent unto the truth, was that faith that would prove
justifying &amp; saving. But (2) it is not so manifest that <hi>Iames</hi> had to do with
such, as thought that to trust to be justified by Christ, was enough to justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
without holiness &amp; fruitful lives, &amp; that their sin &amp; barrenness hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
not their justification: for whatever Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> imagine, we finde
not in Scripture, that justification followeth lives, that is, that there is no
justification, before this fruitfulness of life appear: And himself useth to say,
that in order to the first justification, this holiness of life is not requisite:
And beside this, which he calleth the first, we know no other; unless he
mean glorification. But then (3) as to glorification &amp; final Salvation, we
grant, that <hi>Iames</hi> hath to do with such, as thought a meer assent to the
truth, without holiness, was sufficient hereunto; but that their beleeving
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:104357:246"/>
thus could flow from their misunderstanding of <hi>Paul's</hi> Epistles, is not any
way probable, seing <hi>Paul</hi> in all his Epistles, even where he speaks most of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by Faith without the deeds of the Law, presseth the necessity of
holiness in order to Salvation, so as no imaginable ground hereof can with
the least of shewes be pretended. (4) That when <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>justification was
by Faith, without the works of the Law,</hi> he meant a true &amp; lively faith, which
only is to be found in that soul, in which the seed of grace is sown, and
which is made partaker of the holy Ghost, and of the divine Nature, is
true; but yet justifying faith, doth not formally containe in it a resolution
to obey him, in whom we beleeve, as was shown elsewhere. (5) Then we
see, that the faith, whereof <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh, is not the same with that
Faith, whereby <hi>Paul</hi> said, we are just<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fied: And seing both do not speak
of the same Faith, there can be no appearance of discrepance. (6) When he
saith, <hi>we must be justified by our</hi> Faith, <hi>against the charge of being infidels.</hi> I
would know, what he meaneth, by this charge of infidelity; If he meane,
the charge of not beleeving the Gospel, he knoweth that a meer assent to
the truth, will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ustifie from that Charge. If he meane the charge of not
receiving &amp; resting upon Christ, according to the Gospel, even that will
be but a particular justification from that particular charge; and is not that
justification from the sentence of the Law, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh. (7)
That we must be justified (as he saith) by our Gospel personal holiness &amp;
sincere obedience, against the charge, that we are unholy &amp; wicked, or
impenitent &amp; hypocrites, is true; but what can all this say, for a justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the sentence of the Law, under which we are all lying by Nature;
and of which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh? And if <hi>Iames</hi> speak of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by works, in reference to this accusation, he speaketh of no other
kind of justification, than that which the most wicked wreatch, yea &amp; the
devils are capable of, when, to wit, they are falsely accused of having done
some evil, which they have not done. And how can Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> inferre
from what <hi>Iames</hi> saith, (if he speak of no other kind of justification) that
works are required unto our justification, as to state, or unto our general
justification from the sentence of the Law, adjudging us to death because
of transgression? (8) But he addeth, <hi>or else we shall never be adjudged to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that is, justified by God.</hi> Then the Justification, that <hi>Iames</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of, &amp; that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> meaneth, is final Salvation: And we willingly
grant, that there must be personal holiness &amp; sincere obedience before this,
and that no wicked or impenitent person, or hypocrite shall be adjudged to
Salvation. But the justification, which <hi>Paul</hi> treateth of, is different from
this, though it be the sure way to this, seing all who are justified, shall be
thus saved. Thus we see, that according to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> the meaning of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>
is, the same with <hi>Paul's,</hi> when he saith <hi>Heb.</hi> 12: 14. <hi>Follow peace with
all men &amp; holinoss, without which no man shall see the Lord.</hi> And then, <hi>Iames</hi>
speaketh nothing of that justification, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> treatch &amp; this is, what
we say; whence it is manifest, that there is no appearance of contradiction
betwixt the two holy writers.</p>
               <p>But that we may come to some further clearness in this matter, we must
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:104357:247"/>
see, whether <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Iames</hi> mean &amp; speak of one &amp; the same Faith: for
if it be found, that they speak of diverse Faiths, all appearance of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
is removed. Now that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth of a true, lively,
saving Faith, which is a saving fruite of the Spirit of God &amp; the special
Gift of God, is easily granted on all hands: All the question is of that faith,
which <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of, <hi>Papist's</hi> say, that it is true justifying, that <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>
speaketh of: for justifying. Faith, with them, is nothing but a real as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto the Catholick Doctrine, or to divine Revelation: And indeed if
Justifying. Faith be nothing else, it can not be well denyed, that <hi>Iames</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
here a justifying faith. But the folly of this ground is obvious to all,
that understand the Gospel: and we need not here insist in confuting the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
That which <hi>Iames</hi> here saith of this Faith, is enough to demonstrate of
what Nature it is; and the Epithets he giveth it, do sufficiently manifest,
that it is not Faith of the Right stamp, nor that true &amp; lively Faith, by
which <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that we are justified: and the discovery of this will be
enough to our purpose; and every <hi>verse</hi> of his discourse hereanent will help
us herein for (1) <hi>vers.</hi> 14. it is a <hi>profitless</hi> Faith, which cannot be said of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
Faith, as the whole Scripture cleareth. (2) <hi>Ibid.</hi> it is a Faith, that
hath no ground or reality, but a mans saying, nor no other evidenee, or
proof, <hi>What doth it profite, my Brethren, though a man say, he hath Faith?</hi>
There is no other proof adducable but his say so; which cannot be justifying
Faith. (3) <hi>Ibid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>can</hi> Faith <hi>save him;</hi> so that, it is a Faith, that hath no sure
connexion with, nor tendency to Salvation; which cannot be supposed of
the true, lively justifying Faith, as is known. (4) <hi>vers.</hi> 15, 16. It is no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
true Faith, than that is true charity, which saith to the naked &amp; destitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
brother, depart in peace, be thou warmed &amp; filled &amp; notwithstanding
giveth not those things, which are needful to the body. (5) <hi>vers.</hi> 17. It is
expresly called a <hi>dead Faith.</hi> But the precious Faith of God's elect is a lively
Faith. (6) <hi>ibid.</hi> It is a Faith without works, having no connexion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
nor being any ground thereunto; but the true Faith, that justifieth,
worketh by Love, &amp; is a living principle, and floweth from the infusion of
life. (7) So <hi>vers.</hi> 18. It is a Faith uncapable of any true evidence, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
as to its being, from works of holiness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so is not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with any real change of soul: But it is not thus with true &amp; saving
Faith. (8) <hi>vers.</hi> 19. It is such a Faith; as devils may have: But devils are
not capable of justifying Faith. (9) <hi>vers.</hi> 20. It is the Faith, that a Vaine
man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> never humbled in the sense of his own lost Condition, nor driven out
of himself to seek reliese elsewhere, in the free mercy &amp; grace of God,
through Jesus Christ, may have: But that is not the Faith of the humbled,
hear broken man, that's sleeing to Christ for refuge, (10) <hi>vers.</hi> 21, 22, 23.
It is not such a Faith, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had, that made him willing to offer up
his son <hi>Isaac,</hi> when commanded, &amp; so wrought with &amp; was evidenced &amp;
demonstrated by works. (11) <hi>vers.</hi> 25. Nor is it like the Faith of <hi>Rahab,</hi>
which prompted her to receive the Messengers, and send them out another
way. (12) <hi>vers.</hi> 26. It is such a Faith, that is no better than a carcase with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
breath, which is no essential part of a living man. But the Faith that
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:104357:247"/>
justifieth, is a far other thing. By these particulars, it is manifest, that this
Faith, whereof <hi>James</hi> speaketh so much, and which he opposeth unto
works, &amp; denieth justification, &amp; salvation unto, is not the precious faith
that <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of.</p>
               <p>We have seen, that <hi>Paul &amp; James</hi> speak not of one &amp; the same faith, we
shall now enquire, whether they speak of One &amp; the same <hi>Justification:</hi>
And if it be found, that therein they differ, all ground of imaginable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
will be further removed. What that justification is, whereof <hi>Paul</hi>
speaketh, is manifest, &amp; needeth not here be declared, for it is plaine,
that he treateth of that justification, whereby a poor sinner, convinced of
his sin &amp; misery, in lying under guilt, &amp; under the Curse of God because of
sin, is absolved before God from the sentence of the Law, &amp; accepted of
Him, and brought into an estate of Favour &amp; reconciliation, having a right
unto Salvation, through Faith in Jesus Christ. Upon the other hand, it is
as obvious &amp; cleare, that <hi>James</hi> is not treating of this justification, whereby
a change of state is made in the man. But of a justification of a far other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
even such a justification, whereby the Mans Faith, the reality of his
Christianity, &amp; his justification before God, is evidenced, or may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced
to himself, or to others. So that, whether we take justification
here, as mentioned by <hi>James,</hi> for the evidence &amp; demonstration of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or for a justification of the truth of the Mans Faith &amp; Christianity,
it cometh all to one; for where true faith &amp; true Christianity is, there is
justification, and there only; so that what demonstrats the one, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrat
the other; and a justification, or manifestation of the one will be
a justification of the other. Nor is this sense of the word <hi>justifie,</hi> or <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>
alien from the Scriptures, as we see <hi>Psal.</hi> 51: 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 4. for God
can not other wayes be justified, but by being declared, avowed, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed
to be Righteous. So <hi>Ier.</hi> 3: 11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16: 51, 52. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11: 19. <hi>Luk.</hi>
7: 35, 29. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3: 16.</p>
               <p>Now that this is the justification, whereof <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh, may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
cleared by these particulars. (1) The scope, that <hi>Iames</hi> here levelleth at,
being not to clear up the way &amp; manner, how, or the causes by which, this
change of Relation &amp; State is wrought &amp; brought about, but to discover
the groundlesness of the vaine pretenses of such, as supposed they were justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
&amp; in a sure way to be saved, who had no more for their ground, but
a loose &amp; verbal outward profession of the preached truth, without any real
fruit of godliness: So that this Enquirie is, what can truely evidence a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be justified indeed before God? And he sheweth that an empty fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
profession will not do it, but works of Faith, or Faith proving it self
lively by works. (2) The very Instance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he adduceth,
cleareth this; for he saith <hi>vers. 21. Was not Abraham our Father justified by
works, when he had offered his Son upon the altar?</hi> Now twentie five yeers, or
as some compute, Thirtie yeers, or thereby before this time the Scriptures
say, that <hi>Abraham beleeved God, &amp; it was reckoned to him unto Righteousness.
Gen.</hi> 15. &amp; hence <hi>Paul</hi> proveth <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. that he was justified by Faith. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
if now he was justified, when he offered, his Son, he must have
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:104357:248"/>
been twice justified &amp; that in the same sense, with the same kind of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which can not be said. Nor will it avail to say, That <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. he
was justified by the first justification, which was by Faith, of which <hi>Paul</hi>
speaketh <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. But <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. he was justified with the second justification,
which is by works; &amp; of this <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh: for this distinction of justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
into First &amp; Second, is but a meer device of the <hi>Papist's,</hi> having no
ground in, nor countenance from the Scriptures: and beside, it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that a meer historical, dead Faith is sufficient unto the first justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that <hi>Paul</hi> understandeth such a faith only, when he said <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.
that <hi>Abraham beleeved God, &amp; it was counted to him unto Righteousness,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
whereof is manifest. Nor will it serve here to say, that <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh
of justification as begun: but <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of justification as continued:
for then it would follow, that justification at first, or as begun, is by a
dead faith, and by such a kind of faith, as devils may have, &amp; consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that of such a faith, as this, <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh; because of such a faith <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>
speaketh, as we have seen: But this cannot be said, for it was a true &amp;
lively faith, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had, when he beleeved the promise of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah
&amp; a dead faith is not the faith, that justifieth, first, or last. Yea because
<hi>Iames</hi> maketh an opposition betwixt faith &amp; works, in reference to justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
in the sense, wherein he speaketh of it, it will follow, that faith
should not be requisite unto the Continuance of justification. (3) <hi>Iames</hi> said
<hi>vers.</hi> 20. that Faith without works was dead: and to confirme this, he addeth
<hi>vers. 21. was not Abraham our Father justified by works</hi> &amp;c. As if he had said.
The faith by which Abraham was brought into an estate of justification &amp;
life, was a lively faith, having works of obedience attending it, and his
obedience declared that his faith was lively, and that he was truely justified
by faith, <hi>Ergo</hi> a faith, that is lifeless, and wholly without works of obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
is but dead, &amp; can give no ground to conclude one justified, &amp; in the
way to life; So that what mention he maketh of justification by works is but
to prove the reality of lively faith; &amp; by works true justification by faith is
evidenced &amp; demonstrated, &amp; not by a bare idle &amp; vaine fruitless profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
(4) When <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by his works, <hi>the Scripture was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
which saith, Abraham beleeved God, &amp; it was imputed unto him for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi>
as is manifest from <hi>vers.</hi> 22, 23. Now by this mentioned of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
in the Scripture <hi>Gen.</hi> 15: 6. <hi>Paul</hi> proveth <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. that he was justified by
faith. But if <hi>Iames</hi> were here speaking of the way of our becoming justified,
before God, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, there could be no connexion here, yea the proof
should contradict the thing to be proved; for to say, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by faith, will not prove, that he was justified by works: nor could
his being justified by works, be a fulfilling, a clearing &amp; confirming of that
truth, that faith, he was justified by faith; for faith &amp; works, in the matter
of justification, are inconsistent, &amp; perfectly opposite, as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth
us, &amp; as here <hi>Iames</hi> also teacheth us. But taking justification here for its
declaration &amp; manifestation, it can be by works, and a declaration of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by works can be &amp; is a very signal confirmation &amp; clearing of that
Testimony, which saith, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by faith. (5) By that
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:104357:248"/>
work of offering up his son, at a the command of God, <hi>Abraham</hi> declared,
that he was no hypocrite, but a true beleever, and thus was he justified (as
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will have it, as we heard lately) from any such accusation. But
a Justification from this accusation, is but a justification of the truth &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie
of faith, &amp; so a confirmation &amp; evidence of justification; or justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
as evidenced &amp; declared; and not justification as produced by its cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
(6) When <hi>Iames</hi> saith <hi>vers. 23. That the Scripture was fulfilled, which
saith, Abraham beleeved God &amp; it was imputed to him unto Righteousness,</hi>
when he was justified by offering up his son <hi>vers.</hi> 21. this fulfilling of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-testimony
was, either because at that time, when he offered up his
Son, Righteousness was imputed unto him, &amp; he was justified, or becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
it was then manifest, to be a truth, that he was justified indeed: But the
former can not be said, because Righteousness was imputed unto him, and
he was justified long before this. Therefore it can be only understood, as
to its manifestation. (7) This is also clear from what the Lord spoke at that
time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22: 12. <hi>Now I know, that thou fearest God, seing thou hast not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
thy Son, thine only Son from me.</hi> No word here of imputing Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
unto him, or of his being brought into a justified state; but only God's
solemne declaration, that he was a true fearer of God, &amp; so one, that
had true faith, &amp; was really justified. (8) <hi>Vers.</hi> 22. he saith <hi>Seest thou, how
faith wrought with his works &amp; by works was faith made perfect.</hi> But how could
this follow upon what he had said <hi>vers.</hi> 21? Justification by works (if justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
be taken absolutely here &amp; not for its declaration &amp; manifestation,)
will not prove faith's working with works. But if justification be here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for justification declared &amp; manifested, the sense is plaine: for such works
as do evidence &amp; declare, that a person is justified, will manifestly prove,
that faith is working with these works, because justification presupposeth
alwayes a true &amp; lively faith, that will work with works of obedience. (9)
Far less could it follow from justification (taken absolutly) by works, that
faith was made perfect by works: but from such a work as will evidence a
man to be justified, it is manifest to every one, that that work is a clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a true &amp; lively faith, &amp; by it faith is perfected, that is declared,
evidenced &amp; demonstrated, to be faith indeed, as the word <hi>perfected</hi> is used
2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12: 9. <hi>for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</hi> (10) That other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<hi>vers. 24. ye see then, how that by works a man is justified &amp; not by Faith
only:</hi> will not follow from what went before, if justification be here taken
absolutely: for the command so <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his son was no promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
and to did not call for faith, but for ready obedience, though upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
account he beleeved that God was able to raise him up from the dead
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11: 17, 18, 19. But <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. promises were made unto him, &amp; he is
said to have beleeved, &amp; upon this Righteousness was imputed unto him.
So that <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. he was justified by faith only, as the Apostle proveth <hi>Rom.</hi>
4. for thereby he confirmeth his Conclusion set down <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 28. that <hi>a man
is justified by faith without the deeds of the Law.</hi> And from that other place
<hi>Gen. 22. Iames</hi> could not inferre, that Justification is by faith &amp; works toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for then he could not inferre therefrom that the Scripture was fulfilled,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:104357:249"/>
which said, Abraham beleeved God, &amp; it was imputed unto him for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
because <hi>Paul</hi> doth hence inferre <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. that justification is by
faith without works: And what is a ground for justification by faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
works, cannot also be a ground for justification by works &amp; not by faith
only; And thus the Apostles are made in plaine termes to contradict other:
by inferring contrary or contradictory conclusions from the same premises:
which ought not to be thought, let be said. But it will be said, that <hi>Paul</hi>
speaketh of the beginning of justification, which is by faith without works;
but <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of justification, as continued, which is by works, and
not by faith only. This cannot satisfie: for beside what is said, it must first
be granted hereby, that this faith, which <hi>Iames</hi> mentioneth, when he saith
<hi>&amp; not by saith only,</hi> must be the same faith, that <hi>Paul</hi> faith, we are justified
by, without the deeds of the Law: but this cannot be, for the faith, that
<hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of is, as we saw above, a dead, useless, fruitless carcass
&amp; no saving Faith, as that is, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, and whereby we
are justified. But now taking justification for its manifestation &amp; declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the words of <hi>Iames</hi> are most clear, &amp; carry no appearance of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
unto what <hi>Paul</hi> taught; For his meaning is, ye see then, how that
by works, a man evidenceth, proveth &amp; declareth his Justification, or
maketh it manif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st, that he is a justified person; &amp; not by that faith only,
which is but a naked fruitless, &amp; dead profession. (11) The same may be
said of the other Instance of <hi>Rahab vers.</hi> 25. She was justified by works, when
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he had received the messengers; not that she was brought into a justified
state by that act; for she received the Spies by faith <hi>Heb.</hi> 11: 31. &amp; declared
her faith unto them <hi>Ios.</hi> 2: 10, 11. And so was a beleever &amp; consequently
justified, before she received the Spies, or they came to her. Yet by this
deed, accompanied with so much hazard, unto her self &amp; all her families,
she proved &amp; evidenced her faith &amp; justification. (12) The Conclusion of
his discourse <hi>vers. 26. for as the body without the Spirit is dead, fo faith without
works is dead also,</hi> declareth manitestly, what he would be at, to wit, to shew,
that works can only demonstrate trew faith &amp; consequently prove justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for a naked profession of faith, that wanteth works, is dead, and
like a body wanting breath &amp; soul, which is but a dead carcass. This cannot
be said of that faith, whereby <hi>Paul</hi> saith and proveth, that we are justified,
for it is true &amp; lively, flowing from the Spirit of life, although it be not as
yet proved by outward works of obedience, whereof there may be, as yet,
no opportunity or call.</p>
               <p>What is brought against this sense, of the word <hi>justifie</hi> &amp; <hi>justification,</hi>
which we have now confirmed, by the <hi>Socinian Author</hi> of the book, intituled

Cap.</hi> 10. is of no great weight. When they say. <hi>That the proposition
set down vers. 14. is subordinat to what is said vers. 12. where the judgment of
God is spoken of, &amp; therefore saving justification must be here understood. Ans.</hi>
We grant, that It is saving justification, but yet it is justification that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from Final Salvation. We grant, that <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh here of saving
justification; Yet he handleth not that question, how &amp; by what Causes
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:104357:249"/>
this justification is brought about; but how it is evidenced &amp; proven to be
true, and not a meer presumptuous conjecture. They say <hi>next.</hi> It is said
<hi>vers. 25. that the Scripture was fulfilled;</hi> not, <hi>that it was shown to be fulfilled.

comp. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 9, 10, 11. And therefore was not now first
fulfilled, or verified. And to talk of the increase of imputation according
to the increase of Faith, and to measure the excellencie of faith, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
of that obedience which it produceth, as that <hi>Socinian</hi> Author
doth, is to give us nothing but the Popish justification; for Relations (of
which Nature we hold Justification to be) are not intended &amp; remitted in
themselves, but only as to their evidence: We esteem it a <hi>Socinian</hi> dream,
to say, that the first Narration of Faith &amp; Justification, which is <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.
was but a rude draught of that, which was afterward <hi>Gen. 22. Abraham's</hi> faith
was afterward said to be perfected by that special work, of offering up his

demonstrated to</hi> Abraham's <hi>two servants, who went with him to the mountaine, &amp;
by them to others; But then it must be supposed, that before this time, that which
passed Gen. 15. was known unto them: &amp; it must he said, that by a work done
long afterward, men may see, that the worker was justified. But that should not
sutte</hi> James's <hi>scope, seing by this meanes they might think to delay for a long time
their good works, &amp; yet suppose themselves presently justified. Ans.</hi> All this is
but vaine language; for it is all one to the scope of <hi>Iames,</hi> whether this come
to the actual knowledge of few, or of many, &amp; who they were to whose
knowledge it came; He is only shewing, that such, as had but a dead faith,
that brought forth no works of obedience, when called for, had no eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
or clear ground to assert their own justification, seing <hi>Abraham's</hi> justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
was thus declared by his signal obedience, to all that came or ever
should come to the knowledge of that act of obedience of his, to the end of
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:104357:250"/>
the world: Yea, had it been unknown to any, yet hereby he had a sure proof,
to ascertaine his own heart &amp; conscience of his justification. But say the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,
Good works cannot be such a proof &amp; demonstration, because it cannot
be known to others, whether these good works proceed from faith, or not. Ans.</hi>
Nor is any infallible judgment here necessary, or requisite; nor doth the
scope of <hi>Iames</hi> require any such thing, who is only shewing, that such as
wrought not works of obedience, when called for, could not conclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
justified, &amp; in a saife estate, notwithstanding of all their faire profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Notwithstanding we cannot judge infallibly of principles, motives &amp;
ends of the good works of others, yet by what may be seen of these, God
may be glorified <hi>Mat.</hi> 5: 16. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 12.</p>
               <p>Thus we have seen, that neither is that faith, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh,
when he saith. <hi>We are justified by faith without the deeds of the Law;</hi> &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof
<hi>Iames</hi> speaketh, when he saith. <hi>Ye see then, how a man is justified by works
&amp; not by faith only,</hi> is not one &amp; the same. Nor is it the same justification,
or justification in the same sense &amp; consideration, that both the Apostles
speak of. And therefore how ever, as to their words, they seem to speak
contrary to other: Yet in their true sense &amp; meaning, there is nothing but
a sweet harmony &amp; agreement. But now as to <hi>works,</hi> whereof both make
mentione, the question remaineth, whether they be one &amp; the same? The
forenamed <hi>Socinian</hi> Author saith, that both do not speak of the same works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth from justification only legal works, &amp; not Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical.
And consequently, that <hi>Iames</hi> must speak of Evangelical works on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
But sure we are, <hi>Iames</hi> cannot be supposed to speak of Evangelical works,
in their sense; seing, they cannot say, that <hi>Abraham's</hi> offering up <hi>Isaac</hi> or
<hi>Rahab</hi> her receiving &amp; sending away the spies, were Evangelical works.
James speaketh of works commanded by the Moral Law, which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
both in general, &amp; in its particular commands <hi>Iam.</hi> 2: 9, 10, 11.
And all the duties, which he presseth them unto, &amp; the sins, which he
disswadeth them from, relate unto the Moral Law. And what these works
are, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, we have seen before. Others think, that <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>
by <hi>Works</hi> here meaneth a <hi>working</hi> faith: &amp; so that his meaning, when
he saith, <hi>that by works a man is justified,</hi> is, that by a working faith, such
as <hi>Abraham</hi> had, a man is justified. But though it be a truth, that justifying
faith is a working lively faith? And that we are justified only by such a faith,
as is lively, &amp; prompteth to obedience, in every duty called for; &amp; though
this truth will follow by consequent, from what the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> here saith;
Yet I judge, that both <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Iames</hi> understand the same thing by <hi>works,</hi>
even duties of obedience, performed to the Law of God, &amp; that by <hi>Works</hi> here
in <hi>Iames,</hi> is not meant a working faith, this not being the scope &amp; designe
of <hi>Iames</hi> to clear up justification in its Causes, or to shew by what meanes
it is brought about; but only to shew, what way it is or may be evidenced
proved &amp; demonstrated to ourselves or others, so as we may not be deceived
thereanent; And real works of obedience, as they evidence a true &amp; lively
faith, so they prove the reality of justification: And the Apostles intention
being, to shew the vanity of that pretence, whereby many deceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:104357:250"/>
thinking that their profession of the truth of the Gospel was
enough to secure their Salvation, &amp; to prove them to be in a justified saife
state, though they indulged themselves a liberty to walk loosly, according
to the flesh; this acception of the word <hi>works,</hi> in a proper sense, is most
contributive unto that designe, &amp; no other acception, how consonant so
ever unto the Analogy of Faith, doth so directly &amp; clearly contribute assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
thereunto. Therefore he opposeth faith &amp; works, &amp; denieth that
to faith, which he ascribed unto works: though by consequence he put he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby
a difference betwixt a dead faith, &amp; a working faith; Yet his principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
<hi>Thesis vers.</hi> 14. is, that by works, &amp; not by a bare profession of the truth,
we come to Salvation. And the enquirie prosecuted is, whether we have
that faith, that will indeed prove saving, &amp; this can only be evidenced by
works, as his whole following discourse evinceth, especially when he saith
<hi>vers. 18. shew me thy faith without thy works, &amp; I will shew my faith by my
works.</hi> And <hi>vers.</hi> 20. when he saith, <hi>faith without works is dead &amp; vers.</hi> 26. that
it is as dead, as a body is without breath or Spirit. And this he fully confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by the following instances of <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; <hi>Rahab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what is said, it is apparent, how little ground there is to think, that
there is any real appearance of contradiction betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>James;</hi> &amp; how
needless it is, in order to a reconciliation, to say with <hi>Papists,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi>
speaketh of a <hi>first justification</hi> &amp; <hi>Iames</hi> of a <hi>second;</hi> or with others, that <hi>Paul</hi>
speaketh of <hi>justification, as begun,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iames</hi> of <hi>justification as continued,</hi> or
with <hi>Socinians,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> denieth justification by the works of the Law, <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>
affirmeth justification by the works of the Gospel.</p>

notwithstanding that what was said concerning this passage, in the fore

pretence, where it was showen, that the whole face of this place looked
towards another airth, and had not the least aspect unto any such conclusion;
Yet for a fuller Vindication of this place from this too ordinarie abuse &amp;
perversion, we shall examine every part thereof, &amp; see, what ground
there is; for any to alleige the same, for confirmation of their particular
opinions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Papists</hi> generally say, that this place speaketh of the Second Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
But their opinion of a <hi>first</hi> &amp; <hi>second justification</hi> is vaine, having no
ground in the word, and the whole of their fabrick is sufficiently demolished
by the Reformed, writting against them; so that we need not insist there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:104357:251"/>
Others there are, who suppose that <hi>James</hi> is here shewing, how ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
is continued, &amp; therefore say, though faith alone be the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Justification, as begun; Yet unto the continuance thereof works are
required, as the Condition. But all that speak thus, &amp; think that <hi>Iames</hi>
pointeth forth the Condition of Justification as continued, must say, that
those persons, who had this faith, whereof <hi>James</hi> speaketh, were really
justified, &amp; that <hi>James</hi> doth presuppose them to be justified, &amp; speaketh to
them &amp; of them, as such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But then it must be granted, that the Popish faith,
consisting in a meer assent unto the truth revealed, is justifying faith; and
that that faith, which is no more true &amp; saving faith, than that is true &amp;
Christian Charity, which saith to a brother or sister, that is naked &amp; desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of daily food, depart in peace, and giveth not those things, which are
needful to the body, is sufficient to bring one into a justified state; and that
a dead faith, &amp; a faith of the same nature &amp; kinde, with the faith of devils
&amp; a faith, which a vaine man, puft up with a vaine conceite &amp; a fleshly
mind may have, &amp; a faith, that cannot &amp; will not worke with works, is a
justifying faith: which if true, it would follow, that all men, who beleeve
that God is, &amp; Devils also, who beleeve this, should be justified. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
who understand the Gospel can think or speak thus. And therefore this
place carrieth no shew of proof, that works are the Condition of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as continued.</p>
               <p>Nor can this place give any countenance to such, as say that Faith &amp;
Works together are the Condition of Justification, making no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
justification, as begun, &amp; as continued. For (1) <hi>James'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> scope (as
we manifested above) is not to cleare up &amp; explaine the way, how justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is brought about, or to shew, what are the Causes, or Conditions
thereof: but to discover the vanity of that ground, whereupon some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours,
who indulged their Lusts, deceived themselves &amp; supposed that
they were in a state of justification, &amp; salvation, notwithstanding they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
all duties of holiness. (2) <hi>James</hi> opposeth a faith here unto works, a
faith, which he called unprofitable, dead &amp;c. &amp; doth not ascribe justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hereunto, as to a Condition, in whole, or in part: But such, as speak
thus, include faith &amp; works, as making up one full &amp; compleat Condition.
(3) The Instances, which <hi>James</hi> here adduceth, should not then serve his
designe, if his purpose was to prove faith &amp; works to be the Condition of
Justification; for <hi>Abraham</hi> was long justified before that particular act of
obedience in offering up his son <hi>Isaac,</hi> was called for: And so was <hi>Rab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
justified before she sent away the spies. (4) This work, by which <hi>Abraham</hi>
is said to have been justified, was a work, that seemed contrary unto the
Moral Law: And therefore if this be urged, as a ground of justification
by works, it will rather prove justification by other works, then by works
commanded in the Moral Law of God. (5) The works, mentioned
in both the Instances, are outward external works, obvious to the eyes
&amp; eares of others: And hence it may as well be proved, that only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
works, are required unto justification, and no other. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if it had been <hi>Iames's</hi> designe to prove justification by works, he had
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:104357:251"/>
named other works, then meerly external, that he might have prevented a
mistake.</p>
               <p>But more fully to discover the vanity of this supposition, let us see, what
can be alleiged from the several parts of this passage, for justification by
works, from <hi>vers.</hi> 14. it is said. <hi>Faith alone cannot save, but is unprofitable;
but yet faith &amp; works is profitable &amp; will save. Ans.</hi> This maketh nothing for
justification by works; because it is denied, that whatever is requisite befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
Salvation, is requisite also before justification, for if so, no man could
be said to be justified, as long as he lived. But next, the faith, whereof <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>
here speaketh, availeth not to Salvation, because it is not of the right
kinde, &amp; we say also, that this faith availeth not to justification, because
it is but meer empty profession, deceiving &amp; puffing up &amp; it is but a faith,
that a man saith he hath.</p>
               <p>From <hi>vers.</hi> 15, 16, 17. It is said <hi>As charitable wishes, joined with real acts of
Love &amp; Alms deeds is, profitable &amp; no other charitable wishes; so Faith with works,
is available to justification, but not without them. Ans.</hi> These charitable wishes,
not accompanied with Alms deeds, as they are not profitable unto the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
brother &amp; sister, so they are far from that Christian charity, that is
called for in the Gospel: &amp; as that charity is not true, Christian &amp; saving
charity; so neither is the Faith, which he proveth to be dead, true, saving
or justifying Faith. Nor doth the Apostle say, that faith with works is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable
unto justification; but that that faith, which hath not works, is
dead, &amp; not available to prove &amp; evidence, that the man that hath it, is
in a saife &amp; in a justified state.</p>
               <p>But the maine ground of this apprehension is <hi>vers.</hi> 21, 22, 23, &amp;c. for it is
objected <hi>that it is expresly said, that Abraham</hi> was justified by works. <hi>Ans.</hi>
That it is so said, we grant; but the difference is about the sense &amp; meaning,
in which it is said so. We have shown, that the meaning is. That by works
<hi>Abraham</hi> was declared, proved &amp; manifested to be a justified person, and
one that had a true &amp; lively faith; for it is added, that hereby the Scripture
was fulfilled declaring him to have been justified by faith, or that he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
God, &amp; it was accounted to him for Righteousness. And this is it,
which others have called justification before men, in opposition to justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before God, that is, a justification declared &amp; manifested to the mans
own conscience &amp; to others, &amp; not the justification before God in its cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
And this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> seemeth to have mistaken in his <hi>Aphorismes,</hi> when
he argued against this justification before men, as if it had been meerly a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
from Mens Accusation, &amp; not the true justification before God,
as evidenced &amp; proved to men: And when we speak of justification in this
sense, we do not make the world lawful judges of our Righteousness before
God, or in reference to the Law of God, or say, that they are competent,
or capable judges: But we only say, that by works of obedience Faith &amp; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by Faith is evidenced. And where as he saith. That works are no
certaine <hi>medium,</hi> or evidence, whereby the world can know us to be Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:
for there is no outward work, which an hypocrite may not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
&amp; inward works they cannot discerne: nor yet the principles from
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:104357:252"/>
which, nor the ends to which our works proceed &amp; are intended. There is
as much need of a divine heart-searching knowledge, to discerne the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of works, as of faith it self. He may see, that all this will make as much
against Christ's saying <hi>Mat.</hi> 5: 16. <hi>Let your light so shine before men, that they
may see your good works, &amp; glorifie your Father, which is in heaven.</hi> And that
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 13: 35. <hi>By this shall all men know, that ye are my disciples: if ye love one
another:</hi> and that 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 12. <hi>Having your Conversation honest among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles—
they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorifie God, in the
day of Visitation.</hi>
Nor is it to the purpose to say, that he was the justifier,
who was the imputer of Righteousness, that is, God; for works of obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
may declare, that God hath imputed Righteousness unto the person, &amp;
hath justified him; and this is all; we say that <hi>Abraham</hi> was in this sense ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by his works, that he was declared to be justified indeed before God,
by his works.</p>
               <p>Some were pleased to express their sense of <hi>Iames's</hi> words thus, That <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>
speaks of works as justifying our faith, &amp; not as justifying our persons,
meaning only, that the Apostle did not consider works here, as the Cause,
or Condition of the persons being justified before God, but as the effect &amp;
evidence proving the mans faith to be sound &amp; saving, and consequently the
man thereby to have been justified: which sense is the same with what we
have given: but Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> saith, it is <hi>as plaine, as can be, that it is the
person &amp; not his Faith, which is here said to be justified. Ans.</hi> The person, it is
true, is said here to be justified, but not causatively, but declaratively,
that is, It is not said, that by works his justification is effectuated, but that
it is declared, &amp; that because it is hereby declared, that the man is a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever,
&amp; thus his faith is manifested to be of the right kind, which is all
that was intended by that expression.</p>
               <p>Yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will <hi>not say, that works do effectually produce our justification
(for Faith doth not so.)</hi> But yet he will have both to justifie, as Conditions, or as
parts of one Condition: Only he addeth, <hi>that they do not justifio, as equal
parts of the Condition; for Faith is the principal; but as the secondary less principal
part of the Condition. Ans.</hi> Yet, <hi>Iames</hi> hinteth at no such thing, but giveth
the preference to works: Yea excludeth the faith, whereof he speaketh;
altogether from having any interest in justification, as being nothing but a
dead, carcass, a vaine, fruitless &amp; unprofitable thing, &amp; so hath no kind
of causality or procurement in justification. But he addeth as a reason. 1. <hi>That
when it is said we are</hi> justified by works, <hi>the word</hi> by <hi>implieth more than an idle
concomitanoy. Ans.</hi> I shall easily grant this, but withall say, that this will not
give unto works any causality in justification; but only evince works to be an
evidence of justification, as the cause is said to be manifested by the effect.</p>
               <p>He addeth 2. <hi>When the Apostle saith.</hi> By works &amp; not by faith only, <hi>he
plainly makes them concomitant in procurement, or in that kind of causality,
which they have. Especially seing he saith not, as he is commonly interpreted,</hi>
not by faith, which is alone; <hi>but</hi> by faith only <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Then
hath fruitless dead faith, which devils may have, a kind of causality in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification;
which is expresly contrary to the scope &amp; all the reasonings of
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:104357:252"/>
the Apostle: And therefore the common interpretation must be admitted;
But he addeth. 3. <hi>Therefore he saith,</hi> that faith is dead being alone, <hi>beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se
it is dead, as to the use &amp; purpose of justifying;—This appears from his compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the former vers. 16. that this is the death he speaks of; &amp; so works make faith
alive, as to the attainment of its end of justification. Ans.</hi> If it be thus, how
could he then say before, that faith was the principal part of the Condition?
can that be the principal part of the Condition, which is dead &amp; useless
without the other, &amp; must be quickened, in order to its usefulness by the
other: I would think, that other looked rather like the principal part, and
most considerable &amp; necessary, seing this were but a dead Cypher without
it. But the truth is, the Apostle, as is said, hath a far other designe, &amp;
sheweth, that that faith, which they pretended unto, as sufficient to ground
their concl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sion of their justification, &amp; hope of Salvation, was no true
saving faith at all, but a dead thing &amp; so no works could make it of any use
as to justification; because it behoved first to flow from another principle,
even from a principle of saving grace; and then it would evidence &amp; prove
itself to be of the right kind, by good works, that would flow from it.</p>
               <p>But saith he. <hi>When the Apostle saith, that</hi> faith did work in &amp; with his
works, <hi>it clearly aimeth at such a working in &amp; with, as maketh them conjunct
in the work of justifying. Ans.</hi> No such matter; for the Apostle is only there
shewing (as the whole context cleareth) that <hi>Abraham's</hi> faith was another
sort of faith, than that, whereupon they relyed; even a faith that did
prompt to the most difficulte duties, when the call of God came, &amp; so did
work in &amp; with his performances; but not in order to justification, for he
was justified already, many yeers before this.</p>
               <p>He addeth. <hi>And when he saith, that</hi> Faith was made perfect with works,
<hi>it is not only a manifesting to be perfect, But as the habite is perfected in its acts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are the end to which it tendeth: &amp; as marriage is perfected per congres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum
&amp; procreationem; or any Covenant, when its Conditions are performed. Ans.</hi>
The whole of the context sheweth, that faith was perfected purely, as to
its manifestation, as by the like expression is clear 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12: 9. <hi>Col.</hi> 4: 12.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5: 48. Nay, though It were granted, that faith were perfected by
works as the end to which it tendeth, that would say nothing for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of faith in justification, but in Salvation; let is be granted, that justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
is perfected by faith without works, as marriage is by consent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
what he addeth, &amp; we have what we desire. That works are a Condition
of entering into Covenant, or of the Covenant, in order to justification,
as required before justification, is still denied. He saith further elsewhere,
against Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> p. 212. <hi>That by works faith was made perfect, as is hath</hi>
naturam medii <hi>viz.</hi> conditionis <hi>to the continuation &amp; consummation of justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Ans.</hi> That the continuation of justification hath other <hi>media</hi> or Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
than the beginning hath, is not yet made apparent: far less can any
such thing be drewn from this passage to continuance the same, the Apostles
scope not being to speak to any such thing; nor can it be supposed, that he
looketh on such, whose proud conceits he was here depressing, as already
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:104357:253"/>
justified, as to the beginning of justification, seing a dead faith, (which
was all the faith they had) is no Condition of justification at all. And as to
consummation of justification (as he speaketh) <hi>Abraham's</hi> saith was not
yet perfected, neither could be before his death. He addeth finally. <hi>That
obedience perfecteth faith, as it is part of that necessary matter (not necessary, at
the first moment of beleeving, but necessary afterward, when he is called to it)
whereby he is to be justified against the charge of non-performance of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
Condition, even against the Accusation of being an unbeleever or hypocrite.
Ans.</hi> If obedience perfect faith thus, it is only as evidenceing &amp; proving the
man a true beleever, &amp; no hypocrite, or one that hath only a meer profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
which is the thing we say? if it be looked on as the Condition of the
Covenant, &amp; so as the ground of justifying the man from the charge of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance
of that Condition, it standeth only for itself, &amp; for its own
part, &amp; cannot not be said upon that account, to perfect faith; as when
both abstaining from murther, and from stealing is called for; the abstea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from stealing cannot be said to perfect the other, though it ground
a Mans justification from the charge of stealing. And therefor by this
assertion, faith can as well be said to perfect works, as works be said to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
faith.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> giveth this ground of Agreement betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Iames;</hi> that
<hi>Paul</hi> is about this question, <hi>What is the Righteousness, which we must pload,
against the Accusation of the Law? or by which we are justified as the proper Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of that Law? And this he well concludeth is neither works, nor faith: But
the Righteousness which is by faith, that is, Christ's Righteousness, Ans. Paul</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to this question, how sinners come to be justified before God, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cleareth up the matter of justification, in all its causes; and not only
sheweth what that Righteousness is, which must be pleaded against the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
of the Law; but also what way we come to be partakers of that
Righteousness in order to our being justified before God, <hi>to wit,</hi> by faith,
without the deeds of the Law. If faith be not that Righteousness, why did
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. where it is said, that <hi>faith is imputed unto
Righteousness,</hi> faith is taken for our act, &amp; not for the object of faith, or
Christ's Righteousness laid hold on by faith. But now, what question hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>Iames?</hi> His question is, saith he. <hi>What is the Condition of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ustification
by this Righteousness of Christ, whether faith only, or works also? Ans.</hi> And doth
not <hi>Paul</hi> also speak to this question, when he saith. We are justified by
faith? Will not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> grant, that faith is the Condition of our justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by this Righteousness? If <hi>Iames</hi> then handle this question, there
shall be no agreement betwixt him &amp; <hi>Paul,</hi> but a manifest contradiction, for
<hi>Paul</hi> saith that we are justified by faith without the deeds of the Law, that
is upon Condition of Faith, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will grant, &amp; <hi>Iames</hi> saith, that
we are justified not by faith only, but by works, as the Condition: &amp; here
is a perfect contradiction, both speaking <hi>ad idem</hi> &amp; the one saying we are
justified by faith without works, &amp; the other saying by faith &amp; works. What
the true question is, whereof <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh, we have shown above; &amp; the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eby manifested a cleare harmonie betwixt the Apostles, &amp; left no ground of

               <p>
                  <pb n="503" facs="tcp:104357:253"/>
He saith, next that Paul <hi>doth either in express words, or in the sense, &amp; scope
of his speach, exclude only the works of the Law, that is, the fulfilling of the
Conditions of the Law ourselves. But never the fulfilling of the Gospel Conditions,
that we may have part in Christ. Ans.</hi> Whether the works of the Law, which
<hi>Paul</hi> excludeth, be so to be understood, or not, we have seen above: only
I say, now, that both speak of the same Law, that is, the Moral Law,
&amp; both consequently, speak of the same obedience, that is obedience to the
same Law: And nothing can be alledged to prove that <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth works
as taken for the fulfilling of the Conditions of the Law ourselves &amp; <hi>Iames</hi>
meaneth the same works as taken for the fulfilling of the Conditions of the
Gospel ourselves. And further, the faith that <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh so much of,
is none of the Gospel Conditions of justification, for it is but a dead carcass,
&amp; an unprofitable thing. But his following words, saying. <hi>Indeed if a man
should obey the commands of the Gospel with a legal intent that obedience should be
but legal</hi> shew that by the works of the Law he meaneth some thing in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the commands of the Gospel, wherein he joineth with <hi>Socinians.</hi>
But we owne no commands of the Gospel, but such as are enjoined by
the Law of God, even the Moral Law, of which <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>vers.</hi> 10, 11.</p>
               <p>He tels us 3. for clearing of this agreement, <hi>That</hi> Paul <hi>doth by the word</hi>
Faith <hi>especially direct our thoughts to Christ beleeved in: for to be justified by Christ,
&amp; to be justified by receiving Christ, is with him all one. Ans.</hi> This is all very
true, &amp; sure, he must also say, that to be justified by Christ, &amp; to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by works, is not all one, for all obedience or works is not receiving
of Christ. But now, what doth <hi>Iames</hi> direct us to by the word <hi>Faith,</hi>
which he mentioneth? doth he not direct our thoughts to Christ beleeved
in? If not, it cannot be justifying Faith, he speaketh of, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
supposeth. If yea, why doth he adde works more than <hi>Paul</hi> doth? Shall
<hi>Paul's</hi> directing our thoughts to Christ beleeved in, exclude works, and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes's</hi>
directing our thoughts the same way include them? Where is then the
agreement?</p>
               <p>But 4. he addeth, that when <hi>Paul doth mentione Faith, as the Condition, he
alwayes implieth obedience to Christ. Ans.</hi> It is denied, that he implieth obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
as the Condition of Justification: And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself will
grant this, I suppose, as to justification begun, or as to our fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as he speaketh, in replying to Mr. <hi>Cartwright:</hi> which is enough for us,
for we know no second justification, distinct from the first, whereof either
of the Apostles do speak. And I like not that which he addeth, saying.
<hi>He i.e. Paul) implieth obedience in requiring Faith, as truely, as he that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth
himself to a Prince, doth imply future obedience, in his engagement to obey:</hi>
for this maketh justifying faith a plaine engagment to obey. And thus to be
justified by faith is to be justified by a formal engagment to obey, &amp; a formal
engagment to obey, is a receiving of Christ: for to be justified by faith, &amp;
to be justified by receiving Christ is all one.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Catholick Theol. part.</hi> 2. n. 365. giveth us five particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of justification by works, that <hi>Iames</hi> standeth for, &amp; that he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:104357:254"/>
undeniable by any thing but prejudice, Ignorance, &amp; siding peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
So that it must be unquestionable, that <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of all those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
&amp; that he speaketh of justification by works, in no other sense,
the contrary whereof we have seen already: Yet let us see what these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
respects are, wherein (as he saith) works are not excluded from being
<hi>Conditions</hi> of our justification, or the matter of it.</p>
               <p>1. Saith he. <hi>That faith itself, which is our act, &amp; an act of obedience to God,
&amp; is</hi> the fiducial accepting beleefe <hi>in God the Father Son &amp; Holy Ghost, for the
benefites of the Covenant, is the Condition of our first Cevenant-Right to these bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites.
Ans.</hi> To speak of Saving Faith in its full latitude, or of that faith, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby
the Covenant is fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st made up, as such, is not to the present purpose;
but of faith only, or of its acting, in order to justification: and as to this,
himself lately told us, that <hi>Paul</hi> by the word <hi>Faith</hi> doth especially direct our
thoughts to Christ beleeved in: so that faith in this matter is not considered
as our work, or as an act of obedience in us, &amp; as our personal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but as the Mean, Hand, or Instrument laying hold on Christ &amp; his
Righteousness. And if this be the meaning of <hi>Iames,</hi> when he saith, <hi>we
are justified by works,</hi> that, we are justified by faith, we shall not contend,
as to the thing; though we conceive <hi>Iames</hi> handleth another purpose, as
is said.</p>
               <p>2. Saith he, <hi>That this faith is not</hi> actual obedience to Christ, as Christ
(<hi>at first, but only to God, as God) But it is the souls</hi> subjection to Christ, as
Christ, <hi>which is our Covenant-consent, to our future obedience, &amp;</hi> virtually,
<hi>though not</hi> actually, <hi>containeth our future obedience in it. Ans.</hi> This upon the
matter, is but the same with the former, &amp; needeth no furder answere,
as to our present question, concerning the meaning of <hi>Iames,</hi> when he saith
we are justified by works; for if this faith be not actual obedience, <hi>Iames</hi>
doth not mean actual obedience by the word <hi>works,</hi> but only that Faith,
which is a consent to future obedience. But what the Faith is, whereby we
are justified, &amp; what is its peculiar acting, in order to justification, we have
shown elsewhere. And to distinguish betwixt obedience to Christ, as Christ,
and to God as God, is to be unnecessarily critical: &amp; by Mr. <hi>Baxeer</hi> we see,
that all the after obedience of beleevers is obedience to God, as God, though
their first Faith be said to be a fiducial accepting beleefe in God the Father,
Son &amp; Holy Ghost, and this be said virtually to containe after obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
which therefore must be obedience, to God Father, Son &amp; Holy
Ghost; And their first Faith is no obedience to Christ, as Christ, though
Christ, as Christ call &amp; invite, yea &amp; command sinners to come unto him,
&amp; beleeve in him.</p>
               <p>3. He saith. <hi>That there is somewhat of</hi> Love Consent <hi>or</hi> willingness, <hi>of</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
<hi>of</hi> Hop, <hi>of</hi> Repentance, <hi>which goeth to make up this</hi> Moral work <hi>of</hi>
Faith, <hi>as it is the Condition, even our first</hi> Christianity <hi>itself. Ans.</hi> All this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewhat
of <hi>Love, Consent</hi> &amp;c. which necessarily attendeth Faith (for that
they make up this moral work of Faith, as integral parts thereof, I see no
ground to assert) only shew the true nature &amp; genius of that Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are justified, for it is no where said, that we are justified by Love,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:104357:254"/>
Hop, or Repentance (as for Consent or willingness &amp; desire, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in Faith.) But all this yet saith nothing for the Interest of Works (as
it is pleaded) in our justification: And if <hi>Iames</hi> mean no other thing by
<hi>works</hi> he shall give little ground to any to assert justification by works, as is
done this day, by too many.</p>
               <p>4. He saith, <hi>That at the</hi> making of a Covenant, <hi>is for the</hi> performing <hi>of it;</hi>
&amp; subjection <hi>is for</hi> obedience; <hi>&amp;</hi> Marriag <hi>for</hi> conjugal duties; <hi>so our said</hi> first
Covenanting-faith <hi>is for our future faith, Hop, Comfort, &amp; grateful obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
&amp; Holiness. And these are the secondary parts of the Condition of Salvation. And
so are the secondary parts of our justifications Condition, as continued, or not lost
&amp; consummat. For to justifie us is to justifie our Right to Impunity &amp; Glory. Ans.</hi>
How different Faith as justifying, or in its acting in order to justification, is
from this Covenant making, Subjection &amp; Marriage, as explained &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to this purpose by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> is elsewhere showne. (2) That these
graces are required in order to Salvation, we grant, &amp; shall not stand to
call them secondary parts of the Condition of Salvation, as to its possession.
But (3) we are here speaking of justification, and not of Salvation, which
two differ, as we conceive, much more being required to the one, in case
persons live after their first Faith, than to the other. (4) We have shown
elsewhere, that justification, as continued hath the same Conditions, that
justification as begun hath, &amp; of loseing of justification we read not in the
Scriptures, nor yet consummat justification: these are Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> new
Notions, with which we are not satisfied. (5) Our Right to Impunity &amp;
Glory is had by Christ alone, when we are possessed of his Surety-Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
through Faith; and thus are justified by Faith: And how ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
is a justification of that Right, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would do well to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine.</p>
               <p>In the last place he saith. <hi>That our own performance of the Condition of the free
Gift of Impunity &amp; Glory, by the New Covenant, purchased by Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is the thing to be tried &amp; judged in God's judgment. And therefore</hi> we must so
far <hi>be then</hi> justified <hi>from the charge of not performing that Condition of being Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
unsanctified, Impenitent, hypocrites, Apostats; &amp; so of having no part in
Christ &amp; the free gift, even by our personal, Evangelical</hi> Faith, Holiness, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
Sincerity &amp; Perseverance, <hi>Ans.</hi> Then, it seemeth, <hi>Iames</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
only of works, in order to final Salvation, or our justification; at
the day of judgment, and not in order to our justification here, when first
brought out of nature into the State of Grace: And if so, what ground
can any hence have, to inferre our present justification to be by works, unless
they think, that whatever is required antecedent unto our Final Salvation,
is required also antecedent to our first justification? which I know Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
will not say. And if this be all that <hi>Iames</hi> saith, why did not Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
give this as a ground of reconciling <hi>Iames</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>Iames</hi> speaks
of works, in order to Final Salvation, but <hi>Paul,</hi> excludeth them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to justification? This would have had greater agreement
with what the Orthodox say, than to tell us of works being the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
parts of the Condition of our Justification, and that <hi>Iames</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:104357:255"/>
them as such, when he saith, <hi>we are justified by works, and not by
Faith only.</hi>

itself standeth, which is imputed to us, &amp; those things, which are

                  </gap>e in Christ, to the end, that in the other he may be Righteousness
unto us. And this distinction is good in itself; but not rightly applied,
when he referreth all to this last head, which Christ did and suffered, except
only in his death.</p>
               <p>He granteth <hi>pag.</hi> 95. that the word <hi>obedience</hi> is oft times in the Scripture
referred to the whole work of Christ's humiliation: But we do not take it
so largely here, as to comprehend even his Incarnation; but as comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that, which belonged to his work of Mediation, as our Sponsor, in
satisfying the Law &amp; the Law-giver, for what we were owing, and were
not able to pay: Nor can we so restrict it, as he doth: Let us therefore see
his grounds.</p>
               <p>His <hi>first ground</hi> is this. <hi>We are not to esteem Christ to be our Righteousness, in any
thing, but in that only, wherein God hath purposed, &amp; according to his purpose
ordained, &amp; according to his ordinance set forth Christ to be our Righteousness &amp;
Propitiation.</hi> For the <hi>purpose</hi> of God, he citeth <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 19, 20. for the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
1. Pet.</hi> 1: 18, 19, 20. For his <hi>setting forth Rom.</hi> 3: 25. <hi>Ans.</hi> We are not
to esteem Christ to be our Righteousness in any thing, but in that only whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
in the Scriptures hold him forth to be so: And in that, wherein the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
holdeth him forth to be so, God purposed, ordained &amp; set him forth
to be so: But we must not restrict the whole Seripture to these three or four
places cited: If the Scriptures elsewhere pointe forth Christ to be our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
in other acts, than in his death, all this argueing is to no purpose.
Sure the Scriptures speak of his sufferings in soul, &amp; of his being made a curse
for us, &amp; of his being obedient even to the death, of his being made under the
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:104357:255"/>
Law to redeem them, that were under the Law: And that what the Law
could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending his own
Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, &amp; for sin condemned sin in the flesh, that
the Righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 2: 7, 8. <hi>Gal.</hi>
4: 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 3, 4. (2) There is nothing in these texts exclusive of Christ's
obedience: And it is loose argueing to say, Christ's death only is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in three or foure places of Scripture. <hi>Ergo</hi> nothing else is mentioned, or
to be understood, any where else: the particle <hi>Only</hi> is not here to be found,
neither expresly, nor tacitely. (3) Beside that in all these passages, there is
not one word of a Righteousness, no expression, signifying the matter of
imputed Righteousness to consist therein; or that Christ was our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
upon the account thereof: Nay, neither here, nor no-where finde
we Christ called our Righteousness, because he died for us. Nor doth the
Apostle attribute our Righteousness unto his blood only <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 9. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1:
7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 14. No such thing appeareth there. Neither Pardon, nor Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which only are there spoken of, are a Righteousness, or our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
but the consequences, fruites or effects thereof.</p>
               <p>His argueing, <hi>That without shedding of bloud, there is no remission, &amp; from
Heb.</hi> 6. &amp; 10. <hi>That Christ dieth no more. Therefore Christ is appointed our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
&amp; peace, in nothing, but in his death &amp; bloud of his crosse,</hi> is most loose,
&amp; can only conclude against those (if there be any such, that say, By Christ's
obedience active only, &amp; not at all by his death &amp; sufferings have we peace &amp;
remission of sins. We willingly grant, that without shedding of bloud
there is no remission; But this saith not, that shedding of bloud alone is all
our Righteousness. We conjoine both his active &amp; his passive obedience, &amp;
so we take in his whole Mediatory work, which maketh up his compleat Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety-Righteousness:
and say that this must be imputed to us, in order to our
Justification, Peace, Pardon &amp; Acceptance.</p>
               <p>He<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> argueth next from <hi>Adam,</hi> as the Type <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. &amp; sayeth, that <hi>this Type
teacheth us foure things. 1. That our Righteousness should proceed from one man
Iesus Christ. 2. That our Righteousness should consist in the obedience of that one man.
3. That our Righteousness should consist in one obedience only of that one man.</hi> 4.
<hi>That our Righteousness should consist in the only one obedience of that one man, once
only performed. Ans.</hi> (1) If our Righteousness consist in the obedience of
Christ, &amp; that in opposition to <hi>Adam's</hi> disobedience to the Law; then it
must not consist in his sufferings alone; for sufferings, as such, are no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Law: And further Christ's obedience is called his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 18. but suffering &amp; dying is no Righteousness. (2) There is no
ground to assert either of the two last, much less both: for though <hi>Adam's</hi>
act of disobedience was one, and that done at once; Yet it will not follow
that therein he was a Typ of Christ; or that therefore Christ's obedience
must be one act only, &amp; that performed at one time only: for <hi>Paul</hi> hinteth
no such comparison, and we must not make typical similitudes without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand.
And againe, one act of disobedience, once committed, is a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law, &amp; enough to constitute one unrighteous; but one act of
obedience, howbeit frequently performed, far less once only performed,
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:104357:256"/>
cannot be a compleet Righteousness, which requireth conformity to the
whole Law, in all points, &amp; that all the dayes of our life. Wherefore
Christ's obedience, being a Righteousness (which consisteth in full confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the Law) must be perfect, &amp; correspond with the whole Law, &amp;
cannot be one only act, once only performed; &amp; that such an act too, is no
formal act of obedience to the Law at all.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Second ground</hi> is taken from the signes &amp; seals of the Righteousness,
which is by faith, that is Baptisme &amp; the Lord's supper, &amp; tels us, <hi>that
they signifie &amp; represent to us, what is the Righteousness it self, whereby we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
&amp; seale &amp; confirme unto us, that that Righteousness is ours. Ans.</hi> I should
rather think, that they represent &amp; exhibite whole Christ, &amp; seal to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
or the worthy receivers their interest in Him, &amp; Right to Him, and
to all his Spiritual benefites. And though these Sacraments, do in a more
special manner, represent Christ, as suffering, or as dying; Yet it is no
good consequence hence to inferre, that his dying alone &amp; shedding his
blood is our Righteousness; for his death is principally &amp; specially there
held forth, as being the last &amp; compleeting act of his Mediatory obedience,
in his state of humiliation, unto which all his former acts of obedience had
a special respect; &amp; in which they did all ultimatly terminate. And by what
reason, will it be proved, that nothing done or suffered by Christ, can be
any part or portion of our Righteousness in him, but what is distinctly &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
represented &amp; pointed forth by these seales; What shall then beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of his soul sufferings in the Garden, &amp; on the Crosse? these were not
his bloud, nor his broken body: &amp; therefore, according to him, make
no part of our Righteousness in Christ. But we dar not say this.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Third ground</hi> is from <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 5, 6, 7. &amp;c. cited out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. And
thus he argueth. <hi>The obedience of Christ, in the matter of our Righteousness, is
of no larger extent, than is the will of God, which he did obey &amp; by which we are
sanctified. But this is restrained only to the offering of Christ. Ans.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is
here denied, there being no such restraint made, as is alleiged: for he came

                  </gap>ving to the Apostles scope, to mentione any
other act of obedience, than his offering up of himself; but his mentioning
no other there, will not exclude all, mentioned elsewhere: Sure, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarie
will not exclude the promptitude &amp; readiness of mind, that Christ
had unto the offering up of himself, long before the appointed time, as being
no part of that obedience, that he performed; It cannot then be said, that
by his once offering up of himself, at the last, alone, we are sanctified, &amp;
by nothing going before in conjunction with this. But he tels us, that <hi>our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
Reconciliation, &amp;c. are ever attributed unto the bloud, death &amp; Crosse of
Christ. Ans.</hi> Never exclusively as to his preceeding obedience: Yea we are
to be saved by his life <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 10. &amp; justification is upon Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>vers.</hi> 18. And all this will as well conclude for the exclusion of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
obedience from being requisite in Christ (as he said above) to the
end he may be Righteousness to us, as for excluding of it from being any
part of our Righteousness: as also the <hi>next</hi> thing he saith, concerning <hi>Paul's</hi>
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:104357:256"/>
respecting in his preaching only the crosse of Christ: for the Apostle is not
there speaking meerly of the matter of our Righteousness, but of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
way of Salvation, through a crucified Mediator, which the wisdom of
this world despised; And to this, sure, our Author will willingly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that more belongeth, than his death abstractivly considered.</p>
               <p>His <hi>fourth ground</hi> is from <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 18. <hi>whence it followeth,</hi> saith he, <hi>that
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> nothing, which is in Christ himself, before his death, consisteth the remission of
our sins, &amp; so consequently our righteousness. Ans.</hi> We willingly grant, that in
nothing, that Christ did before his death, considered abstractly from his
death, and separatly by it self, did remission of sins consist, or to speak mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
properly, was satisfaction made, in order to remission; Yet hence it will
not follow, that all his preceeding obedience was no part of his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or of that, whereof we are made partakers in him; more than it will
follow, that it was not requisite in him, to the end, he might become
Righteousness to us: If any said (as he seemeth to alleige) that all our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
both original &amp; actual were pardoned in his preceeding actual obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
(which I shall be loath to say, nor know I who speaketh so) then
his argueing were good, that then Christ should be made to dye without a
cause. If any say, (as he insinuateth also <hi>pag.</hi> 104.) that Christ was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
only to remove the punishment of our sin, and not the sin, or guilt the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof,
I shall not approve of it. Yet I cannot assent to what he saith. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
That the very offering of Christ for sin, secludes all things preceeding what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
from all vertue or efficacy of removing iniquity; for then it should
seclude his soul sufferings, which, sure, were no small part of the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
made by him for sin. Neither will it hence follow, that all his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
acts of obedience made no integral part of that Surety-Righteousness,
which he undertook to performe. He citeth for his <hi>first ground 1. Ioh.</hi> 1: 7.
To which we say, That it is true, the bloud of Jesus Christ cleanseth from
all sin, because it was the bloud of him, who had fulfilled all Righteousness,
&amp; in his death had compleeted that Satisfaction he undertook to do: He
tels us againe <hi>pag.</hi> 105. from <hi>Rom. 4. That unto eternal blessedness it is sufficient
to have remission of sins.</hi> But he remembereth not, that all such as have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins, there, have Righteousness also imputed without works: &amp;
we deny, that Righteousness consisteth, in remission of sins alone: But in
all this, he is disputing only against such, who say, that remission of sins is
had by the imputation of Christ's actual obedience, &amp; by his death, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from punishment is obtained; &amp; with such, I have nothing to do.
To what he here addeth of the difference betwixt an innocent man, &amp; a just
man, enough hath been said already elsewhere.</p>
               <p>His <hi>sixt</hi> &amp; last <hi>ground pag.</hi> 108. is builded upon the Law of the <hi>Priesthood,
which</hi> saith he, <hi>was ordained of God, for this end to make expiation of our sins,
&amp; to bring us unto God, which two were shadowed in two actions, in the day of
Expiation viz. in offering sacrifice &amp;c. &amp; in carrylng the names of the tribes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
in the stones on his shoulder &amp; brest plate.</hi> And this is so far from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
against us, that it consirmeth rather our opinion: for that carrying of
the names of the Tribes, on the Ephod, which was upon the other holy
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:104357:257"/>
garments, together with that plate of pure gold, that was upon the mitre,
on the forefront having engraven upon it HOLINESS TO THE LORD
<hi>Exod.</hi> 28. was sufficient to typifie &amp; hold forth Christ's holy obedience &amp;
Righteousnest, &amp; could not typifie his death &amp; sacrifice. And without a
Righteousness, there is no coming or approaching unto God, &amp; this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
is some other thing, than meer remission of sins. His argueing
from the Priests first entry on their office at 30. Yeers of age, &amp; Christ's
doing the like <hi>Luk.</hi> 3: 21. to inferre, that no action performed by Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time, can be accounted the action of expiation of sin, or of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
of us to God, is most vaine; for (1) we make no limitation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction
of his expiatory work to what he did before he was 30 yeers of age.
(2) This will make against himself, &amp; nothing for limiting &amp; restricking all
to his last act of death. Therefore he addeth. <hi>That no action done after by Christ,
can be accounted a Priestly action of expiation except only the offering of himself, &amp;
entering with his own blood into the heavens for us.</hi> But then (1) what will he do
with his prayer &amp; intercession before his death, specially <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17? (2) There
was more than expiation of sins requisite to bring us unto God; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the High Priest was to carry that memorial on the front of his Mitre.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Wendeline,</hi> in his <hi>Great Systeme</hi> of <hi>Theology lib. 1. c. 25. Thes.
7. pag.</hi> 1116. &amp;c. disputeth against the imputation of the <hi>Active</hi> obedience of
Christ together with the <hi>Passive,</hi> making it only a Condition requisite in the
Mediator, so as without it, he could not be our Mediator, &amp; merite any
thing to us, by his death: So that in his judgment, Christ's active obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
whereby his obedience to the Law of God is understood, &amp; that no
doubt, moral, Ceremonial &amp; Judicial, did only contribute to qualify him,
to be a fit Mediator, which it seemeth then, according to him, he was not
by his hypostatical union; &amp; to put a value upon his passive obedience, (by
which he understands his suffering &amp; dying, so undergoing the Curse of the
Law, &amp; paying the penalty in our room) which his being God did not, as
it would seem, sufficiently doe: And thus all his acts of obedience, while
under the Law, &amp; in the state of humiliation, howbeit in all he may be
conceived as a sufferer, are excluded from being any part of the Satisfaction,
he was to make unto justice, &amp; to the Law-giver, for us &amp; in our room,
or any part of that Righteousness, which is imputed to us, in order to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</p>
               <p>He first proposeth his Arguments &amp; Vindicateth them, &amp; then proposeth,
some, used for the contrary opinion, adding his Answers.</p>
               <p>His 1. <hi>Arg.</hi> is, <hi>Christ, as man, was bound to give active obedience to the Law,
for himself; every Creature is bound to obey his Creator. Therefore it is not imputed
unto us. Ans.</hi> The <hi>Antecedent</hi> is denied; neither doth the proof adduced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
it; for the humane Nature of Christ, now in the state of glory, is &amp;
will be a creature for ever; Yea the consirmed angels, &amp; Saints made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
are Creatures, yet not subject to any Law as <hi>Viatores,</hi> but as <hi>Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sores;</hi>
such was not the obedience of Christ, while in the flesh. He was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
as a <hi>Viator,</hi> but in respect of himself, he cannot be looked upon as a
meer <hi>Viator,</hi> his Humane Nature being personally united unto the divine,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:104357:257"/>
&amp; subsisting therein, in respect whereof he became heir of all things, &amp; Lord
of life; &amp; therefore stood in no need of working out a life of obedience for
a crown to himself: wherefore, what he did as a <hi>Viator</hi> was for us, for whom
he subjected himself, &amp; became obedient, even to the death: And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
all his acts of obedience were not the acts of obedience of a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
out of one who was God-man; for his humane Nature did not subsist
of it self, and so did not of it self as a nature not subsisting, performe acts of
obedience, but in the Godhead, &amp; performed acts of obedience, as so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting.
We have said enough to this at several occasions before.</p>
               <p>It was Answered Christ was made man, not for himself, but for us; The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
he obeyed not for himself, but for us, that is, in our place. He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth.
1. <hi>The Anteced. is ambiguous: If you say Christ was made man for us,
that is,</hi> for our good, <hi>it is granted, if for us, that is in</hi> our room, <hi>it is denied:
for what Christ was made, in our place, that we are not bound to do &amp; to be, as he
was made a curse for us, that we might not be an eternal curse. But Christ by his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
did not obtaine, that we should no more be men, or be bound to do things
congruous to humane Nature. Ans.</hi> We grant that he was made man for us, not
in our room, but for our good: Yet do hence gather, that he being made
man for our good, to the end he might come under the Law, both as to its
duty, &amp; as to its curse, under both which we were lying, what he did, as
well as what he suffered, while in that Condition, in order to the ends of
his being made man, for our good, was in our room &amp; stead; because this
was our debt &amp; he became man for our good, that in our stead, he might
pay our debt. The reply is not grounded upon that word alone, <hi>he was
made of a woman,</hi> but on that, with what followeth. <hi>Made of a woman, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
under the Law.</hi> And if it would have necessarily followed, from his being
made of a woman, that he would have been under the Law for himself; to
what purpose was this added, <hi>made under the Law?</hi> And yet we see the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
emphasis lyeth here, because of what is added <hi>to redeem them, that were
under the Law.</hi> And why did the same Apostle <hi>Phil.</hi> 2: 7, 8. after he had said,
that he <hi>took upon him, the forme of a servant, &amp; was made in the likeness of men,
&amp; found in Fashion, as a man,</hi> tell us moreover, that <hi>he humbled himself, &amp;
became obedient unto death,</hi> seing this did necessarily follow his being man, &amp;
that for himself? And may it not hence be inferred, that the exaltation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
mentioned <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9. was given to him, not as Mediator, but for
himself, as an humble, obedient man?</p>
               <p>He R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>plieth 2. denying the Conseq. <hi>for</hi> (saith he) <hi>albert Christ was made
man, not for his own, but for our good; Yet after he was made man, he was a
man by himself, &amp; therefore subject to the Law by himself, &amp; for himself, as man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
as after he assumed a body subject to corruption of itself, he stood in need for himself,
of meat, drink, rest &amp;c. As it was not necessary for man to be created, so nor for
the</hi> Word <hi>to be incarnate, &amp; to assume the forme of a servant, but only upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
Yet as man, being created, is necessarily subject to the Law of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
So the</hi> Word <hi>being made man, is, as man, necessarily subject to the Law
of God. Ans.</hi> (1) Christ, being made man, for our good, &amp; particularly for
this end, that he might come under the Law, &amp; pay our debt, he was not
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:104357:258"/>
subject to the Law for himself. (2) Though he was true man, having mans
Nature, yet he was not made man, as other men are; for his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had no subsistence of its own, as other men have; &amp; therefore could
not for it self be subject to the Law, as other men are. (3) How or what way
Christ's body was subject to corruption, of it self, we need not here deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te;
it is sufficient, to note, that our question here is about moral actions as
such, the performance of which was a part of our debt. (4) What is added,
is but a repetion of what is denied, <hi>to wit</hi> that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>word,</hi> beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
man, did become, upon that account, necessarily subject to the Law
for himself.</p>
               <p>His 2. <hi>Arg.</hi> is. <hi>If Christ did performe active obedience, in our room, so as it
might be imputed to us unto Righteousness, then we should be no longer obliged to
performe active obedience to the Law.</hi> The reason of this, he taketh from the
like, saying; <hi>as we are not obliged to undergo eternal death, because Christ hath
sustained that, in our room. Ans.</hi> To this enough hath been said elsewhere:
I shall only here say, That it will no more hence follow, than from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of Christ (whatever <hi>Socinians</hi> alleige) that we are loosed from all
obedience to the Law; but only that we are loosed from that obedience,
which was required, under the Old Covenant of works, <hi>to wit,</hi> to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte
obedience, &amp; thereby obtaine the prize, as our reward of debt; and
faile in the least, &amp; lose all, which were the Conditions of the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
and as to this we deny the <hi>minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He replieth by denying, what is now in question, to wit, <hi>That Christ
performed active obedience, in our room, to procure eternal life to us, affirming that
he was bound to do it for himself, &amp; so did merite nothing to ut thereby. Ans.</hi> This
is but, what was said above; &amp; hence it is cleare, that, in his judgment,
Christ wrought for the crown of glory to himself, &amp; did merite it to himself:
&amp; so had no Right thereto before, by vertue of his hypostatical union, let
be possession, albeit all the Angels were to worshipe him, &amp; his throne was
for ever &amp; ever <hi>Heb.</hi> 1: 6, 8.</p>
               <p>He addeth. <hi>If notwithstanding of Christ's active satisfaction, we be obliged to
satisfie actively; so, notwithstanding of his passive satisfaction we should be bound
to satisfie passively, that is suffer eternal death. Ans.</hi> All the obedience now
required, is no satisfaction to the Old Covenant-Conditions: Christ
hath satisfied that, and left no part thereof for us to do; And therefore
it will not follow, that we are bound to suffer eternal death, or any part of
the Curse, as such.</p>
               <p>To that answere, that some gave, that by Christ's active obedience we
have this advantage, that we are more obliged unto rigide &amp; exact obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
He replieth. <hi>That then we should not sin by short-coming,</hi> or <hi>negligence.
Ans.</hi> But by that rigide &amp; exact obedience, is not meaned full conformitie
unto the Law; but such a conformitie, as was the Condition of the Old
Covenant, as is said; that is, we are now freed from obtaining the crown,
or right thereto by perfect conformity (which to us is impossible) &amp; from
loseing of the crown upon the least escape or failing. All obedience runneth
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:104357:258"/>
now in another channel, though the commands &amp; the Law, as a Law &amp;
rule of walk, remaine the same.</p>
               <p>His 3. <hi>Arg.</hi> is. <hi>The Scripture every where, speaking of our justification &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
mentioneth Christ's passive, &amp; not his active obedience. As Esai.</hi> 53: 5, 6.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3: 24, 25. &amp; 5: 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 13. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 7. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is denied, that the
Scripture doth every where mentione only Christ's passive obedience, and
the contrary hath been frequently showne. And as to the places mentioned,
none of them containe any exclusive particle, or hinte the exclusion of his
active obedience: And our Adversaries themselves must understand these
&amp; the like passages, Synecdochically, otherwayes they shall exclude Christ's
soul sufferings, as well, as his active obedience, &amp; restrick all to his death &amp;
bloud shed on the crosse; which yet they will not do.</p>
               <p>Now followeth his answere to some Arguments for the contrary <hi>Arg.</hi> 1.
Two things are required unto our Salvation, delivery from death, &amp; the
gift of life; that is had by expiation of sin by his suffering, this by the dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Righteousness, or imputation of his active obedience.</p>
               <p>He <hi>answereth. The passive obedience of Christ both expiateth sin, &amp; giveth life,
his death giveth life 1. Pet.</hi> 2: 24, &amp; 3: 18. <hi>Ans.</hi> True, but the reason is,
because it was the death of one, who had fulfilled all Righteousness: we need
not speak of his obedience &amp; of his sufferings, so distinctly, as to ascribe to
each severally, these several effects; It is better, I judge, to take both
conjunctly, as one compleet Righteousness, for us, &amp; one meritorious cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of all the benefites procured thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. (for the <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. I passe, as judging it not cogent.) The actual
disobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> made us sinners.</p>
               <p>He answereth. <hi>If by actual obedience of Christ, in the Conseq. his active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
be understood (for his passive may also be called actual, in that actually &amp;
not potentially only he suffered) &amp; that imputed to us, the consequens is denied:
for Christ's passive obedience imputed hath restored unto us what we lost by Adam's
disobedience. Ans.</hi> But thus the comparison, that <hi>Paul</hi> maketh <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Adam's</hi> disobedience &amp; Christ's obedience is taken away: He oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Righteousness of Christ to the offence of <hi>Adam:</hi> now Christ's death
&amp; suffering is no where called his Righteousness: So he opposeth obedience
to disobedience, &amp; therefore, as the disobedience was the violation of the
Law, obedience must be the keeping of the Law. Christ's death imputed is
no Righteousness answering the commands of the Law; and therefore,
though it did merite the recovery of what we lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> being the
death of one, that fulfilled all Righteousness; Yet considered abstractly, by
it self without his active obedience, it cannot be our formal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
with which we must be covered &amp; as having which we must be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
when justified of God, who pronunceth none Righseous, but such
as are Righteous indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. With Christ's active obedience, his passive was conjoined.</p>
               <p>He ans. <hi>Denying the conseq. that therefore the one cannot be imputed without the
other: for things conjunct can be distinguished; &amp; as the one can be known, so also
imputed without the other. Ans.</hi> But they are so conjoined, as being integral
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:104357:259"/>
parts of one compleat Surety-Righteousness &amp; Satisfaction for our debt; &amp;
therefore belong to his Estate of humiliation; during which in all his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
there was suffering, for a part of his subjection was, that he was
made under the Law, even under the commanding power thereof; becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
otherwayes, being God &amp; Man in one person, he was not subject to the
Law, as a <hi>Viator,</hi> in reference to himself. So in all his sufferings, there
was obedience. And what is thus inseparably conjoined, we ought not
to separate, especially seing our case &amp; necessity calleth for the imputation
of both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. If only Christ's passive obedience were imputed, then only the
halfe of Christ should be given unto us; contrary to <hi>Esai,</hi> 9: 6.</p>
               <p>He <hi>Ans.</hi> denying the Conseq. <hi>because it is one thing to be given to us, &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
thing to be imputed, even Christ's humanity &amp; deity is given unto us. Ans.</hi>
But Christ was so given, as that all he did &amp; suffered, as such a given &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
person &amp; which our case called for, was to be made over to us, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to our receiving the grand benefites of pardon &amp; life: Now it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for us, to have a Righteousness, consisting in perfect obedience to
the Law, because of that Constitution, <hi>Do this &amp; live,</hi> &amp; Suffering, as such,
is no obedience to the Law.</p>
               <p>He addeth. <hi>Their opinion is hard, who deny that Christ's passive obedience is
imputed to us unto Righteousness, &amp; that it is the cause of the reward, or of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
How could</hi> Christ's blood purge us from all sin, <hi>if it were not the Cause of
our Righteousness? how should</hi> he give his flesh for the life of the world, <hi>if life
were not restored to us thereby; ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce, there is no middle state. Ans.</hi> (1) We deny only, that Christ's
passive obedience alone is imputed to us, unto Righteousness; for alone
considered, being only the paying of the penalty, it is not the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
required in the Law. (2) The paying of a penalty, though it may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
from punishment; yet cannot procure a right to the reward, promised
to keeping of the Law; as is manifest; &amp; therefore Christ's passive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
considered alone, cannot procure a right to that reward of life,
that was promised to the fulfilling of the Law by obedience. (3) Christ's
blood, being the blood of one, that fulfilled also the Law; and conjunct
with that obedience, both purgeth from sin, &amp; meriteth life: And so we
say of the rest following; only I cannot see how pertinently, in the last,
sanctification is mentioned; for we are speaking of right to life eternal.
(4) It is true, as to us now, there is no midd'le state, betwixt freedom from
the Curse of the Law, &amp; Right to the Inheritance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> because Christ's whole
obedience both active &amp; passive is imputed, as a compleat Satisfaction &amp;
Righteousness, whereby we come to obtaine both a freedome from the
Curse, &amp; a right to the Inheritance: But in <hi>Adam</hi> before he fell, there was
a middle state, for so long as he stood, he was free of the Curse, &amp; yet was
to finish his course of obedience, in order to obtaining the right to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
reward; unless it be said, that no more was promised, than the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of what he possessed.</p>

It was <hi>excpted,</hi> That the Law is not fulfilled by suffering the punishment:
for the Law &amp; the command is one; but punishment fulfilleth not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
it only satisfieth the threatning. Therefore the suffering of the
punishment can not be the cause of the reward.</p>
               <p>He <hi>ans.</hi> by <hi>denying the Antec.</hi> &amp; saying, <hi>that by suffering of the punishment
the Law is fulfilled by the Mediator, partly</hi> formally, <hi>in that he suffered the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
due to us by the Law, partly</hi> efficiently, <hi>in that by his sufferings he not
only took away the Curse, but acquired a holiness to us, &amp; with holiness, life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
Ans.</hi> This answere is no way satisfying; for suffering of the punishment,
as such, is no obedience to the Law; and of the fulfilling of the Law by
obedience to the commands thereof, did the Exception only speak, no man
will say, that such as are now suffering the punishment in hell, are any way
fulfilling the Law. Neither is that holiness, procured by Christ's death, any
fulfilling of the Law, according to the Old Covenant; &amp; such a fulfilling
is required, in order to the obtaining of a right to the reward of life, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
in that Covenant.</p>
               <p>He answereth againe, <hi>that when the threatning of the Law is satisfied, that
is done, which the Law commandeth to be done; &amp; so in part the Law is fulfilled.
Ans.</hi> Suffering as such is no commanded thing, &amp; the Law constituting a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
maketh only suffering to be due, but doth not enjoine any suffering:
So that though the Law be satisfied with a Satisfaction laid down by another,
so far as that the other is not to suffer; Yet by this paying of the penalty, the
Lawes commands are not fulfilled, in whole, nor in part; And the Law,
as to the commands, must be fulfilled, ere a right to the reward, promised

<hi>Phil.</hi> 2: 8.</p>
               <p>He <hi>Ans. 1. That these places do not prove, that Christ's active obedience is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
so as by it we are accounted observers of the Law. Ans.</hi> These passages suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
prove, that his active obedience belongeth to that Righteousness
&amp; Satisfaction, which is imputed unto us; &amp; the fruites of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, imputed, are here as well ascribed to his active, as to his
passive obedience: of the places in particular, we have said enough else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where:
our disput here is not about imputation, but about that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
or that, which is reckoned to us, as our Righteousness, &amp; this, we
say, cannot be pure suffering of the penalty; for that, as such, is no Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
nor no where is it so called.</p>
               <p>He <hi>Ans. 2. That it only followeth, that the reforming of our corrupt nature could
not be had from Christ &amp; by Christ, without his active obedience. Ans.</hi> The same
may as well be said of the passive obedience; &amp; so the cause shall be yeelded
unto the Socinians: But the matter is clear. That Christ is our compleat
Righteousness, not effectivly: for he worketh no compleat legal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in us, that is a Righteousness according, as was required in the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:
And beside the expiation of sin, he brought in a Righteousness,
which is called everlasting <hi>Dan.</hi> 9: 24. which can not be understood of our
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:104357:260"/>
imperfect sanctification. And beside that he is our Sanctification, he is our
Righteousness 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 30. &amp; therefore must be our Righteousness another
way, than by working it in us; for so is he our Sanctification. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.
our justification &amp; life is directly ascribed to his Obedience &amp; Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>To that <hi>Phil.</hi> 2: 8. he saith. <hi>The meaning is, that Christ from his birth to his
death, did so accommodate himself to his Fathers will, that he suffered all most
patiently, that was to suffer, even the cursed death of the crosse. Ans.</hi> It was a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of what he was to suffer, even to come under the Law, for that was
a part of his humiliation; &amp; the text saith, he humbled himself, &amp; beca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

Ans.</hi> Why may not we as well admit the same sense of Christ's being
said to be made a curse for us, <hi>to wit,</hi> that it was only for our good; and so
give up the Cause to the <hi>Socinians?</hi> Then it seemeth all the Hypostatical

which was his own, &amp; was according to the Law; &amp; only betaketh himself,

               <p>He <hi>Ans. Christ maketh us perfect in justifying, sanctifying &amp; glorifying us, by
the imputation ef his passive obedience only. Ans.</hi> This is but to assert the thing,
that is a disproving: we say, we cannot be justified, without the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a compleat Righteousness, because in justification we receive a
right to life, &amp; this cannot be had, according to the Constitution of God,
<hi>do this &amp; live,</hi> till the Law be satisfied by obedience, &amp; because we could
not do it, we must have it in &amp; from Christ, in whom we are compleat, &amp;

obedience, &amp; of suffering for disobedience <hi>Col.</hi> 2: 14.</p>
               <p>He <hi>Ans.</hi> He denyeth this, &amp; sayeth; <hi>Christ hath not delivered us from giving
perfect obedience, for we remaine obliged thereunto, &amp; wherein we come short it is
pardoned for his satisfaction imputed to us, &amp; it is piece &amp; piece made up by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
holiness, which hereafter shall be perfected. Ans.</hi> This looseth not the force
of the argument; for though we be obliged to keep the Law in all points,
yet we are not under that obligation, by vertue of the Old Covenant, so
that the least breach should frustrate us of heaven, &amp; so as the reward should
be of debt, and of this obligation the Argument is to be understood: Now
because, by vertue of this Covenant, which must be satisfied, we cannot
partake of the prize, because it is violated, therefore, it must be satisfied
by the perfect obedience of another, of our Surety, which must be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto us, in order to life; for all our begun sanctification will not avail
us; &amp; Christ's satisfying by his suffering, according to that, <hi>that day thou
eats, thou shalt die,</hi> doth not withall satisfie that other part of the Law, <hi>do
this &amp; live.</hi>

have life eternal. Therefore Christ's Righteousness must be imputed, as

               <p>He <hi>Ans.</hi> denying the <hi>Conseq.</hi> And saith. <hi>We are freed from the Curse of the Law
by Iustification, whereby the Passive Righteousness of Christ is imputed to us: Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is begun in us in Sanctification. Ans.</hi> By justification we have no Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
imputed to us, for we must be Righteous, before we be justified; &amp;
therefore must have a Righteousness imputed before. (2) Our begun Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
is no purchase of the reward of life (3) delivery from the Curse,
is but a freeing us from punishment, or from the guilt of punishment, but
this is nothing but a being not unjust, as <hi>Adam</hi> was before he fell; It is not a
being positivly just, in order to the reward; for to this is required compleat
obedience to the Law, &amp; that unto the end, in which respect <hi>Adam</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
just, having never finished his course of obedience, that he might have
had a right unto the reward promised, I mean in himself.</p>

&amp; the same is so. The Prince of the world came, &amp; found nothing in the
Saviour, &amp; when notwithstanding he put hands on the Innocent, he lost
those most justly, when he held; when he, who owed nothing to death,
having received the injurie of death, he did by right loose him, who was
liable to the debt of death, &amp; deliver him from the Dominion of Satan,
for by what Right could he exact that the second time? seing as it was man,
who owed, so it was man, who payed: for if one, he saith, died for all,
then are all dead, that, to wit, the Satisfaction of one, might be imputed
to all, as that one did bear the sins of all; Neither now is it found, that one
did the wrong &amp; another satisfied, for the Head &amp; the body are one Christ:
the Head therefore did satisfie for the members; Christ for his own bowels.

think, that it is piously &amp; christianly said, that we ought to lean (I say
lean, as to a stable thing, that shall certainly hold us up) unto Christ's
Righteousness, given unto us; but not unto the Righteousness &amp; holiness,
that is inherent in us: for this Righteousness of ours is inchoate &amp; imperfect,
that cannot hinder us from ssinning dayly; therefore we cannot for this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:104357:265"/>
in the sigt of God be accounted just &amp; good, as would become
the Sones of God to be: but the Righteousness of Christ is true &amp; perfect
Righteousness, which every way pleaseth God's eyes, in which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that can displease God, &amp; doth not highly please him: Therefore
we must only leane to this certaine &amp; stable thing, and beleeve, that for
it alone we are justified before God; that is, accounted Righteous, and
so called. This is the Precious Treasure, which who findeth, he selleth all
he hath, &amp; buyeth it.</p>

               <head>Arguments against Universal Redemption.</head>
               <p>AS concerning the point of <hi>Universal Redemption,</hi> we finde various
sentiments, or various explications of the matter, given to us by
Adversaries; for they do not all agree in their apprehensions of the
thing. Some explaine the matter thus, God sent his only begotten Son to
be a Redeemer and Propitiator for <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Posterity; who by his
death did pacific an angry God, and restore Mankinde to their lost inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
so as all, who are now condemned, are not condemned for their
former sins and guilt; for Christ hath abundantly satisfied for these; but for
their Unbeleef, for not beleeving in the Redeemer of the world, and for
rejecting the Reconciliation made, &amp; the grace of God declared in the
word. And thus, they must say, that Christ hath died for all sinnes, but
Unbeleefe; and that salvation doth not certainly follow upon this Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation;
and so that it is rather a Reconciliableness, than a Reconciliation;
and they must necessarily maintaine, that this matter is revealed unto all and
every son of <hi>Adam,</hi> who otherwise cannot be guilty of Rejecting this recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:104357:265"/>
other wayes it shall be of no advantage to them; unless they say,
that the want of the Revelation putteth them out of a capacity of being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Unbeleefe; and so they must necessarily be saved; and thus their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
shall be undoubtedly better, than is the condition of such, as hear the
Gospel; and then the revelation of the Gospel shall be no Favour, but a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
rather. And in reference to this, they devise an Universal Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danious
Love, whereby God, out of his Infinite Goodness, was inclined
to desire the happiness and salvation of every mothers son; and therefore to
send his Son to die for: as if God had such Natural &amp; Necessary Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and as if all his Love to Mankinde, and every appointment of his
concerning us, were not the free act of his good pleasure; and as if there
were any such Antecedent &amp; Conditional will in God, that could or might
have no issue or accomplishment, but as Lord <hi>Freewil</hi> would; and as if the
Love that sent Christ, were only such a Poor Conditional Inclination towards
all Mankinde, which the Scripture holdeth forth, as the greatest of Loves,
&amp; as the ground or all the Effects &amp; Grants, which mans full Salvation cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
for. But why could not this Love effectuat the good of all? Therefore,
they tell us, that Justice being injured by sin, unless it were satisfied, that
Love of God, whereby he wisheth well to all sinners, could effectuat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
as to the recovery of any: &amp; upon this ground they imagine, Christ
was sent to make an Universal Atonement; &amp; so, Justice, being satisfied,
might not obstruct the salvation of any, whose Freewill would consent unto
termes of new to be proposed.</p>
               <p>Others hold forth the matter thus [Christ, according to the eternal
Counsel of God, did properly die for this end, and by his propitiatory sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
obtaine, that all and every man, who beleeve in Him, should for
his sake actually obtaine Remission of sins, &amp; Life Eternal; but others, in
case they would Repent &amp; Beleeve, might obtaine it.] But thus we hear
no word of Christs obtaining any thing to any in particular; no word of his
obtaining Faith &amp; Repentance: and what Counsel of God can this be, to send
Christ to die for persons, upon that condition, which he knew they would
not &amp; could not performe? And what by this meanes hath Christs Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Sacrifice obtained more, than a meer possibility of salvation, to either
one or other? Shall we imagine, that God designeth good to persons, who
shall never enjoy it? Or that God hath Conditional Intentions &amp; Designes?
By this means, Christs death was designed, and no person designed thereby
to be saved, yea Christ should be designed to die, and that for no certain
end, unless to procure a meer possibility, by stopping the mouth of justice,
that it should not stand in the way: but then we can not say, that God sent
Christ to die for any man, much less for all.</p>
               <p>Others express the matter thus [Christ, out of the gracious Decree &amp;
Purpose of God, did undergoe death, that he might procure &amp; obtaine
Reconciliation with God for all sinners whatsomever, without any differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
before that God would open againe the door of salvation, &amp; enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a new Covenant of Grace with sinners.] But this Reconciliation hath no
more force, or import, but that God might enter againe into a Covenant
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:104357:266"/>
with sinners: and so there is no Actual Reconciliation of sinners unto God.
And all that is obtained, is for God, &amp; nothing for man, save a Possibility
of Salvation by a new Covenant; nor are we told, whether Christ hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
for the breach of the First Covenant, so that that sin is fully pardoned
unto all; or not, untill the condition of the second Covenant be performed:
nor are we told, upon what account the sins against the second Covenant are
pardoned; Or if they be unpardonable.</p>
               <p>Others explaine the matter thus [Christ died for all and every man, not
only that God might, without any violation of Justice, enter into a new
Covenant with sinners, upon what condition he pleased; but that it should
be upon this Condition, that man should be united with Christ the Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
and not only, that Redemption &amp; Salvation should be possible to all,
but that really &amp; most certainly Salvation should be bestowed on such, as
Christ thought good.] But seing Christ knew, that his death would profite
none, but these few, whom he had designed, to what purpose should he
have laid downe his life for the rest? And how can his death be a price of
Redemption for the rest? How can Christ be said to satisfie for the rest? Did
he purchase Faith to these few; and would he not purchase Faith to the rest,
&amp; yet lay downe the great price for them? What was the end obtained for
the rest? was it only a Possible Call of all, Justice bein satisfied? But of
what import could that Possible Call be, if Salvation was not also possible
unto them? And whereunto is that Call? They will not say, it is unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
but to Faith: But did not Christ know, that this call would not be
obeyed by them? Did he procure Grace unto them, to obey it? then he
procured Faith, and if he procured Faith, than he procured Salvation.
Againe, if Justice be satisfied for these others, why are they not liberat? If
they say, the new Condition is not fulfilled. Then it cannot be simply said,
that Christ satisfied Justice on their behalfe, for he knew before hand, that
these would not performe the new Condition; how can he then be supposed
to die for them not withstanding?</p>
               <p>Thus we see what difference is among men, that hold Universal Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
about the Proper &amp; Immediat End &amp; Aime, of the purpose of God,
in sending Christ to die; and of Christ in comeing to died: and how, for the
most part, it cometh all to little, or nothing, for <hi>it was,</hi> saith <hi>Arminius,
That God might save sinners, what way it pleased Him, his Iustice, which
stood in the way, being satisfied,</hi> or as <hi>Corvinus: That God might will to
save sinners, &amp; That Christ intended by his death, to make such satisfaction to
justice, as that he might obtain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to himself power of saving upon what Condition the
Father pleased.</hi> And thus Christ is said to have obtained Reconciliation &amp;
Redemption to all, not that they should actually be partakers thereof, but
that God, his justice now being satisfied, might prescribe a Condition,
which when they had performed, he might &amp; would actually make them
partakers thereof: Some say, that all men are put into a new Covenant, in
which <hi>Adam</hi> was a common person, as well, as in the old, by vertue whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof,
none shall be damned that do not sin actually against the Condition, &amp;
fall thereby from that new state, whereunto they are borne. And this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:104357:266"/>
differeth not much from that of <hi>Iacobus Andreae</hi> at the conference at
<hi>Mompelgard,</hi> which afterward <hi>Huberus</hi> maintained (as <hi>Kimedoncius</hi> she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
in his refutation of the same) which was this in short, [That Christ
suffered &amp; died for all, none excepted, Effectually, and obtained for all a
Reconciliation, without any respect to Faith, or Unbeleefe; so that all
who receive this Reconciliation &amp; continue in it, shall be saved, but as to
those who refuse it by unbeleef, it is made null, and they perish.] Others
say, [That Christ by his satisfaction removed Original sin in all, so that all
Infants, dying in infancy, are undoubtedly saved.] Others [that he died
for all sinnes alike, but conditionally.] Some say, [that after the price
was payed, it was absolutely undetermined, what condition should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed;
so as God might have re-established the Covenant of works:] O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
[that the procuring of a new way was part of the fruit of Christ's
death.] As for this condition, some say, [that man can performe it with
the help of such meanes, as God affordeth to all] and thus establish the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
of Freewill. But others [assert the necessity of grace flowing from ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
hereunto,] and so destroy Universal Redemption, which yet they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert.
So that some say [Christ died for all Conditionally, if they beleeve]
making the Act the cause of its own object; for Faith with them is a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that Christ died for them. Some say [that he died for all Absolutely;
Yet so as they partake not of the benefire, until they performe the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was to be prescribed;] and thus they affirme, that Christ did
no more sustaine the persons of the Elect, than of the Reprobat, but of all
alike. If we enquire therefore, what was the Immediat Result &amp; Product of
the death of Christ, they agree not to tell us, whether it was a <hi>Power,</hi> or a
<hi>Will,</hi> or a <hi>Right,</hi> to God, to save any he pleased.</p>
               <p>However all the <hi>Arminians</hi> &amp; <hi>Camero</hi> with them agree in this. That Christ
did not purchase faith for any: and that as to all (say some) or as to the
most part (say others) Christ hath only procured a Possibility of Salvation:
And what is this Possibility? Some call it an Exemption from that necessity
of perishing, under which they came by the violation of the former Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
if a satisfaction had not interveened; and by this Exemption, they say,
it cometh to passe, that Christ, if he will, justice being now satisfied, may
bring all to life: And hereby also, say they, all may be saved, if they will:
But what is this else then a meer Possibility? What efficacy hath it, seing
notwithstanding thereof, all may perish againe? They say, it is really Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious
as to this Possibility, which was not, before Justice was satisfied: But
yet notwithstanding of this Efficacious Possibility, it might come to passe,
that not one should have been saved: for how can salvation be possible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
faith? So that if faith be not hereby purchased, it would seem, that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is not possible. And further, it doth hereby appear, that all which
is procured, is but some power to God &amp; to Christ; But what is mans advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?
They say, That a way to life is opened unto man, that so he may
now come to God by Faith &amp; Repentance. But how can he come, who hath
no power to Beleeve or Repent, without grace? Or is it in corrupt mans
power to Beleeve or Repent?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="530" facs="tcp:104357:267"/>
                  <hi>What that truth is, which we stand for, is plainly &amp; fully enough set
downe in several places of Our</hi> Confession of Faith: as Chap. 3. §. 6. As God hath
appointed the elect unto glory; so hath he, by the Eternal and most free purpose of
his Will, fore ordained all the meanes thereunto. Wherefore they who are Elected,
being fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> are redeemed by Christ, are effectually called unto faith in
Christ by his Spirit, working in due season; are Justified, Adopted, Sanctified, &amp;
Keeped by his power through faith unto salvation. Neither are other Redeemed by
Christ, effectually Called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iustified, Adopted, Sanctified &amp; Saved; but the Elect
only. So <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. §. 1. It pleased God, in his eternal purpose, to chose &amp; ordaine
the Lord Iesus, his only begotten Son, so be the mediator between God &amp; man. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom he did from all eternity give a people to be his seed, and to be by him in time
Redeemed, Called, Iustified, Sanctified &amp; Glorified. <hi>And</hi> ibid. §. 5. The Lord
Iesus by his perfect obedience, &amp; sacrifice of himself; which he through the eternal
Spirit, once offered up unto God, hath fully satisfied the Iustice of his Father, &amp;
purchased, not only Reconciliation, but an Everlasting inheritance in the Kingdom
of heaven, for all those, whom the Father hath given unto him. <hi>So</hi> ibid. §. last,
To all those, for whom Christ hath purchased Redemption, he doth certanely and
effectually apply &amp; communicate the same, making intercession for them, &amp; revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
unto them, in &amp; by the word, the mysteries of salvation, effectually perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them by his Spirit to beleeve &amp; obey; and governing their hearts by his word &amp;
Spirit, overcoming all their enemies by his Almighty power &amp; wisdom, in such
manner &amp; wayes, as are most cansonant to his wonderful &amp; unsearchable dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Our judgment is this, in short, That Christ, according to the good
pleasure of his Father, laid downe his life a Ransome for the Elect only,
who were given to him to save from Wrath, and Destruction; and by that
price purchased Salvation, &amp; all the Meanes necessary thereunto, for them
only to whom in due time, &amp; after the method, which he thinketh best,
doth effectually apply the same unto them, &amp; actually save them.</p>
               <p>Though grounds sufficient, considering the places of Scriptures, annexed
in the margine of the Confession, confirming all, are clearly hinted &amp; laid
downe, in these passages cited; yet I shall, with what brevity is possible,
point forth our grounds in plaine termes. And (1.) The Scripture is full &amp;
plaine, in holding forth 2 Covenant betwixt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ehova, and the Mediator, a
transaction concerning man; or the purposes of God concerning the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Man, in way of a mutual Compact; both for our better understa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of that solide ground of our Peace &amp; Hope, &amp; for the confirming of our
staggering &amp; weak Faith. And though the full explication &amp; confirmation
hereof, would, I judge, fully undermine &amp; destroy the rotten grounds of
<hi>Socinians &amp; Arminians,</hi> and of all, who are for the <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Freewill,</hi> and
enemies to the Grace of God; yet I cannot digresse thereunto here; and
shall only referre such, as would see the same confirmed, unto Mr. <hi>Dick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
Therapeutica sacra,</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Rutherfords</hi> book upon the <hi>Covenant.</hi> Taking
it therefore for granted, till what is by these Worthies said anent it, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed;
and finding, that <hi>Arminius</hi> himself in his <hi>Orat. de Sacerdotio Christi,</hi>
saith, there was a Covenant betwixt the Lord &amp; Christ, I shall but shortly
inferre therefrom, That it is repugnant to reason, to say, that the result of
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:104357:267"/>
that Eternal Transaction: and the whole intended by it, was only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a meer Possibility of Salvation; and that such a Possibility, as that
though it was equally for all; yet it might so fall out, that not one person
should be saved, among all the sones of <hi>Adam.</hi> How unreasonable is it to
imagine such a bargane betwixt the Father and the Son, as among men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
what they are doing, can have no place? If Christ was to see his
seed, by vertue of this Contract, then certainly God had a special eye and
respect unto that seed; and that feed must be distinguished from all the rest,
for it cannot be all, else all should be saved: and so Christ did not undertake
to buy all, nor did the Father give him all, for his feed: and in reference
to that feed, the Redemption purchased must be an Actual, &amp; not a meer
Potential, or Possible Redemption; and the Lord must have full Power &amp;
Dominion over the Will of that Seed, whereby he may determine their
hearts unto a following of the Method, which he was to prescribe; and all
these meanes, whereby this actual Closeing with the Conditions was to be
effectually wrought, must have been secured: for a transaction betwixt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
infinite in Wisdom, must of necessity be, in all things, contrived in
deep Wisdom. So then, if by vertue of this Covenant, a feed was ensured
to Christ, it was these concerning whom the transaction was made; for what
interest could others have in this, or advantage by it? And so the Radem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
was neither Universal; nor yet meerly Possible, &amp; no more.</p>
               <p>Againe (2.) The Scripture every where pointeth out the end of Christs
coming &amp; dying, to have been, to Procure &amp; Obtaine some good to man;
it were endless to cite the Scriptures speaking this out plainely: But if it had
been only to have procured a Possibility, then the proper &amp; immediat end
of his dying, had been only to have procured something to God, <hi>viz.</hi> a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to Him, that he might, without hurt to his Justice, prescribe a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
way of salvation. Now, not to discusse that question, agitated among
Orthodox Divines, <hi>viz.</hi> whether it was impossible for God to have pardoned
the sins of man, without a satisfaction made by his Son, or not; meaning
antecedently to a decree, determineing this way of manifestation of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God; only I must say, that as yet I can see nothing from Scripture,
determineing the egresses of the Relative Justice of God, to be more essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to God, &amp; less subject to the free determinations of his good will and
pleasure, than are the egresses of his Mercy; nor do I see any necessity for
asserting this against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> seing our ground, walking upon a decree,
is proof against all their Assaults; far less see I any necessity of founding our
whole debate with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> upon that ground; yea I cannot but judge
it the result of great imprudence so to do, seing the <hi>Socinians</hi> may reply, that
the sole ground of that Opposition to them is not only questioned, but plainly
denyed, by such as we account Orthodox &amp; learned; and may hence ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that we have no other solide ground, whereupon to debate with them,
but such as the learned of our owne side overthrow. The depths of God's
Counsel are beyond our fathoming; and it is hard for us to say, hithertil the
omnipotent can come, but not one ince further. I dar not be wise above
what is written; and I would gladly see one passage of Scripture, declareing
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:104357:268"/>
this to have been in itself utterly impossible, &amp; inconsistent with God. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
whatever may be said of this. what Scripture tels us, that Christ was sen
to die, that he might obtain this Power unto God? And further, what
was this power? Was it a meer Power &amp; Liberty, that should never have
any Effect? If it was to have an Effect, what was that? Was it only to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
a new Transaction with man, in order to his salvation? If that was all,
notwithstanding of all this Power &amp; Ability, not one man might have been
saved. Was it certanely to save some? Then, the Redemption cannot be
called Universal, nor yet meerly Possible. Nay, if by the death of Christ
a Right &amp; Power only was obtained to God, God was at full liberty to have
exerced that Right &amp; Power, or not, as he pleased; and so notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thereof man might have remained in the same Condition, whereinto
he was, and never so much as have had one offer of life, upon any termes
whatever; or only upon the old termes of the Covenant of works; and
what then should the advantage of this have been? The whole Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
speaking of the death of Christ, mentioneth far other Ends, respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
man.</p>
               <p>If we (3.) Consider how the Scripture mentioneth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> number given of
the Father to Christ, to be Redeemed &amp; Saved, we shall see, that there
is neither an Universal, nor yet a meer Possible Redemption: for this gift
is utterly repugnant to, &amp; destructive of both: for if, conforme to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
betwixt the Father and the Son, there were some given to Christ to
save &amp; redeem, these he must actually save &amp; redeem; and for these only,
was Christ ordained &amp; designed of the Father to be a Redeemer; and upon
the account of these only, did he undertake the work, &amp; lay down the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some-money:
for it is not rational to suppose, that, the designe of Father
&amp; Son being to save actually these gifted ones, Christ would shed his blood
for others, who were no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> given to him, &amp; who should receive no salvation
by his blood; for <hi>cui bono?</hi> what could be the designe of Father &amp; Son in
this? The matter goeth not so in humane transactions, where the price is
considerable. Now, that the Scripture mentioneth some given to Christ,
&amp; that in distinction from others, is clear <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17: 2.—<hi>that he should give
eternal life to as many, as thou hast given him.</hi> So <hi>vers. 12. Those that thou gavest
we, I have keept, and none of them are lost, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6: 37. <hi>All that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath given me, shall come unto me, &amp; vers. 40. And this is the Fathers will,
that hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing Joh.
17: 9. I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them, which thou hast
given me; for they are thine. 10. And all thine are mine &amp; mine are thine, and I
am glorified in them. 11. - Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou
hast given me. 24. Father I will, that they also whom thou hast given me, be with
me where I am,</hi> &amp;c. Whence we see, that Christ had no charge of the rest;
was under no tye to save them, nor would be so much as pray for them: but
as for the given ones, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. called his <hi>sheep,</hi> for these he laid downe
his life, &amp; prayed; and for these was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to give an account: nay, which
is more, these had a special Interest in God's heart &amp; affection &amp; were the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reupon
given to Christ. They were the Father's, &amp; given of the Father
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:104357:268"/>
to the Son; and so fully discriminated from all the rest; and both Father &amp;
Son stand engadged to carry these thorow unto salvation: all which conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
it is most plaine, that the Redemption was Particular &amp; Actual, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to the Undertaking, &amp; Transaction.</p>
               <p>Nay (4.) If we will consider the fountaine love, from whence the sending
of Christ came, we will see how unreasonable it is to imagine an Universal
meer Possible Redemption, as the proper end &amp; effect, of Christ's death
&amp; merites. It is said <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: 16. A place, which our Universalists look upon,
as most favourable for them) <hi>that God so loved the world, that he gave his only
begotten Son, that all beleevers in him, might have eternal life.</hi> This love is held
forth as unparallelable, a love greater than which cannot be conceived, &amp;
a love demonstrated by the greatest effect imaginable, sending &amp; giving his
only begotten, to give his life a ransome, &amp; to die for sinners; and it must
be contrary to all reason, to imagine, that all this was to procure a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
by which it was possible, that not one man should be Actually
Redeemed. Christ himself saith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15: 13. <hi>greater love hath no man, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> See also <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 8. And shall
we think, that the effect of all this Non-such Love, both of the Father, &amp;
of the Son, was only a Possible Salvation, and Redemption? and that all
this love should be outed; and possibly not one man saved? Either the Lord
knew, that some would get good by this fruite of wonderful love, or not?
then he was not omniscient: and then the Father gave his Son, &amp; the Son
came, &amp; both were the effect of the greatest love imaginable, &amp; yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them knew, that any one soul should be saved for all that. If he knew,
that they would get good by it, either by themselves alone, without his
Grace, or not. If the <hi>first,</hi> why would he send his Son to die, &amp; why
would Christ come to die for such, as they saw would never have a will to be
saved by his death? If the <hi>last</hi> be said, then, seing the greatest expression of
of love was to send his Son, &amp; in the Son to come &amp; die, how can we think,
that that was for all, when the grace to improve that death, &amp; profite by
it, was not designed for all? Sayeth not <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 8: 32. <hi>He that spared not
his owne Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall not with him also freely
give us all things?</hi> Importing that that was Impossible. Shall we imagine that
that is the greatest love, which is common to all, &amp; is not able to effectua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
the salvation of those upon whom it is set? and how can this be, that the
greatest effect of this greatest love shall be common to all, &amp; smaller effects
not common also? See also 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4: 9, 10, 11. where this speciall love, by
which Christ was sent, is made peculiar unto beleevers; for <hi>Iohn</hi> is spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of none else: So is this love peculiarly terminated on Christ's Wife &amp;
Church <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5: 26, 26. &amp; hath gracious &amp; saving effects <hi>Gal.</hi> 2: 20. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3,
4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 4; 5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 36, 37. 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2: 16, 17. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1: 5, 6.
Beside, that this love is mentioned as an Old, Everlasting, &amp; Unchanga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Love, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31: 3. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 3, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9: 11. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13: 1. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3: 17. And
is all this nothing but a General Common thing, that cannot save one soul,
if Lord <hi>Freewil</hi> do not consent, of his own accord?</p>
               <p>Moreover (5.) if we consider the ends assigned to the Death of Christ,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:104357:269"/>
mentioned in Scripture, we shall see that it was some other thing, than a
meer Possible Delivery &amp; Redemption, common to all mankinde. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8:
11. He <hi>came to save that which was lost;</hi> and not to make their salvation meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
possible; for if that were all, Christs argument should have had no
strength: So 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1: 15. - <hi>Iesus Christ came into the world to save sinner:</hi>
if it were a meer possibility, that might never take effect, how should this
faithful saying be worthy of all acception; So <hi>Luk.</hi> 19: 10 where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is exemplified in <hi>Zaccheus Mat.</hi> 1: 21. the reason of the name Iesus, given
to the Redeemer is, because <hi>he shall save his people from their sinnes,</hi> that is,
Actually &amp; Really, and not Potentially or Possibly only: and this cannot
be meaned of all; for he saveth not the Reprobat from their sins; at least,
not from the sin of unbeleef, by the confession of Adversaries; But here,
no sin is excepted, and therefore is his death restricted to <hi>his people,</hi> whom
he saveth from all their sinnes. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2: 14, 15. there is another end of his
death mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>he might destroy him that had the power of death, that
is the devil, and deliver them, who through fear of death, were all their life time
subject to bondage.</hi> This was no meer Possible Deliverance, but Actual &amp; Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual;
and it was not common to all; for it is restricted to his <hi>Brethren
vers.</hi> 11, 12, 17. and to sones 13. &amp; <hi>to the children which God gave him vers.</hi> 13,
14. &amp; <hi>to the Seed of Abraham vers</hi> 16. and againe <hi>vers 17. wherefore in all things
it behoved him to be make like unto his brithren, that he might be a Merciful &amp;
Faithfull High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the
people.</hi> Behoved Christ to be a Merciful &amp; Faithful High Priest in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to God, only to make a Possible Reconciliation, whereby it might
be, that not one person should be reconciled? &amp; are the Reprobate his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then?
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 5: 25, 26. To what end did Christ give himself for his Church?
(And all the world of mankinde belong not to his Church.) It was, <hi>that
he might sanctifie &amp; cleanse it with the washing of water, by the word, that he might
present it to himself a glorious Church, not having spotor wrinkle, or any such thing,
but that it sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uld be holy and without blemish.</hi> Is this a meer Possibility? Then
might Christ have died, &amp; have no Church to present to himself faire &amp;
spotless: his Church might have remained full of spots &amp; wrinkles, unholy
&amp; full of blemishes, yea should have been no Church. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2: 14. He <hi>gave
himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a peculiar people zealous of good works.</hi> Do all the world belong to his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
people? doth Christ redeem all the world from all iniquity? Is all the
world purified &amp; made zealous of good works? Or is all this meer <hi>may be,</hi>
which may not be? 2. <hi>Corinth. 5. vers. 21. He hath made him to be sin for us,
who knew no sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</hi> Was
Christ made sin, or a sacrifice for sin, that all the world might possibly be
made the Righteousness of God in him? that is, that possibly not one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
might be made the Righteousness of God in him? who can dream thus,
that God's intentions &amp; designes should be so loose &amp; frustrable, &amp; that God
should be so uncertain in his purposes? <hi>Gal.</hi> 1: 4. why did the Lord Jesus give
himself for our sinnes? It was, <hi>that he might deliver <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

world, according to the will of God and our Father.</hi> This is no meer Possible
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:104357:269"/>
Deliverance; and it is such as was designed not for all the world, but for the
<hi>us,</hi> there mentioned. So <hi>Chap.</hi> 4: 4, 5.—<hi>God sent forth his son, made of a
woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we

Redemption to be called <hi>an eternal Redemption?</hi> and was that all that Christ
obtained? Then Christ's blood was more ineffectual in the truth, than the
type was, in its typicalness; for the blood of buls &amp; goats, and the ashes
of an hiefer sprinkling the unclean, did not obtaine a possible and <hi>may-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctification,</hi>

shall separate them from the love of God. <hi>Act.</hi> 20: 28. Christ hath <hi>purchased

               <p>If we will (7.) Consider some other Ends of the death of Christ, which
the Scripture pointeth forth, which are not to be found among Heathens,

fruit left at an Uncertanty? Shall we thinks, that Christ might have died,
&amp; yet one man receive this Adoption? Was this Adoption purchased upon
an uncertain Condition? Or was this purchased equally for all? Then such
as received it, might have thanked their owne well natured <hi>Freewill,</hi> upon

without the gate, <hi>that he might sanctify the people Chap.</hi> 13: 12. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1:

all? No, it is added, <hi>And hath made us Kings &amp; Priests unto God, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
So <hi>Ch.</hi> 5: 9, 10.—<hi>thou was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tain, and hast redeemed us to God, by thy
blood;</hi> and what more? <hi>And hast made us unto our God, Kings &amp; Priests, &amp;c.</hi>
So 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 15. <hi>He died for all:</hi> But for what end and purpose? <hi>That they
which live, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him, which died
for them, and rose againe. See Col.</hi> 1: 22. These &amp; the like passages do clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pointe forth a special end of Christ's Death, which was designed both by
the Father, that sent him, &amp; by himself: and shall we suppose, that this
great &amp; chiefe designe was made to hang upon the lubrick &amp; uncertain will of
man? Shall Christ be beholden to mans good will for the purchase he made,
at so dear a rate? If not, why are not all these ends attained, in all, for whom
he died? Did Christ fail in laying down the Ransome? Or doth not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:104357:271"/>
keep condition? Who can say either of these? Then surely, there can
be no reason to say, that Christ made an uncertain bargain, &amp; purchased on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Possibility of these fruites, which he knew not if ever he should attaine,
in any one; Nor to say, that he died for all.</p>
               <p>Let us further (8.) take notice: That for whom Christ died, he died to
take away their sins; And that so, as they may be fully Pardoned, &amp; never
brought on reckoning againe: that is, that they be Remitted &amp; Pardoned;
and that the poor sinner may not suffer therefore. This sure must be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of that prayer, <hi>forgive us our trespasses.</hi> If then Christ by his death hath
taken away sin, and purged it away, making satisfaction to justice therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
how can we think, that justice can punish the sinner in hell fire, for
these same sinnes? But let us see, what the Scripture saith, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: 5.—
<hi>he was manifested to take away our sins. Ephes.</hi> 1: 7. <hi>we have redemption in his
blood:</hi> what Redemption? <hi>forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</hi>
So likewise <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 14. Now when sinnes are thus taken away, they are
<hi>blotted out,</hi> &amp; <hi>not remembered Esai.</hi> 43: 25. <hi>Fer.</hi> 31: 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8: 12. Yea they
are <hi>blotted out as a cloud,</hi> and as a <hi>thick cloud Esai</hi> 44: 22. So they are said to
be <hi>subdued,</hi> &amp; <hi>casten into the depths of the sea. Mica.</hi> 7: 19. Shall we now
say, that Christ hath died, to purchase this Redemption, the Forgiveness
&amp; blotting-out, as a thick cloud, and casting into the depths of the sea, of
sin; and yet multitudes of those; for whom this was purchased, and that
by the blood of God, should never obtaine this benefire, but have all their
owne score? This so pincheth the Adversaries, that the best evasion they
can fall upon, is to say, that none shall have Original sin charged upon
them: But the Scripture no where restricteth this Remission to that sin only.
Others therefore say, That no sin now shall be be charged upon any, but
the sin of Unbeleef. Then <hi>Iudas</hi> doth not suffer to day, for betraying his
master: was it for this sin only, that the Old World was drowned; or that
the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> are suffering the vengeance of eternal fite? <hi>Iude</hi> seemeth
to say some other thing <hi>vers.</hi> 7. so are there other sins there reckoned up <hi>vers.
8, 9, 10, 11, 12. to which is reserved the blakness of darkness for ever, vers.</hi> 13.
But some say, that these are all but pardoned upon condition. Then the
Redemption is neither Actual &amp; Real, nor Compleat, but a poor <hi>may be,</hi>
and a may not be: and how can such sins be said to be forgiven or blotted
out, and casten behinde God's back, and into the depths of the sea? Did
Christ know, whether or not this condition would be performed? If not,
then He is not the omniscient God. If he knew, that it would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the greatest part, how can we imagine, that he would notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
lay downe his life to purchase a Remission for them? And how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
we think, that He should purchase a Pardon to all, and let the event hang
upon the pendulous tottering will of a sinfull creature? But as to that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we shall.</p>
               <p>Propose (9.) this consideration. The not performance of that Condition
was no doubt a sin, and if Christ died for all the sinnes of the world, he
died for that too: And if he died for that too, that is taken out of the way,
or there must be another Condition imagined, upon performance of which,
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:104357:271"/>
that is to be taken our or the way; and the non-performance of this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being also a sin, our proposition will recurre upon this, and so <hi>in infinitum:</hi>
but if this sin be taken out of the way, it cannot prejudge them of the pardon
of therest: and thus all their sins being pardoned, they must needs be saved:
and yet it is not so. But it is said, that Christ died not for the sin of Final
Unbeleef; yet it seemeth, that it will be granted, that he died even for the
sin of Unbeleefe of all the world, and for unbeleefe continued in, until the
last houre of a mans life; but not for that last act; which yet is but the same
Unbeleefe continued in an hour longer; and shall we think, that Christ ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the Unbeleefe of 20, 40, 60. or moe yeers, in his body, on the crosse, &amp;
not the same Unbeleefe for one houre or halfe houre, yea or quarter of an
houre? Who seeth not, how little ground there is for such an imagination?
But the thing I would have mainly here considered, is this. That for whose
sinnes Christ hath died, he hath died for all their sins; and therefore, if he
died for the sinnes of all the world, he died for the Final Unbeleefe of all
the world: But this will not be granted; therefore neither can it be said,
that he died for the sinnes of all men. Whose sinnes he took upon him to
make satisfaction for, he left none for them to answere for; for he is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Mediator, and is sole Mediator. If he died for all the rest of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the Reprobat, and of the whole world, why not for that also? Sure,
when the Scripture speaketh of Christs taking away of sin, and of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
that is, forgiveness of sins, which people enjoy through him,
there is no sin excepted, <hi>He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised
for our iniquitie; Esa.</hi> 53: 5. the <hi>Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all vers.</hi> 6. or
made the iniquitie of us all to meet on him; there is no ground for any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
here: when <hi>he was stricken for transgression vers.</hi> 9. and <hi>his soul was
made an offering for sin, vers.</hi> 10. is there any appearance of the exception of
any one sin? when <hi>he bear their sin and their iniquities vers.</hi> 11, 12. what inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
is given of an exception of any? Yea, if this exception was to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
which would null &amp; destroy all, what consolation could the declaration
of this Redemption, remission of sins, yeeld unto poor sinners? <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 14.
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 7. When the Lord <hi>made him to be sin for us,</hi> was it only in part?
how then could we <hi>be made the Righteousness of God in Him 2. Cor.</hi> 5: 21? was
the Lord in Christ reconcileing the world unto himself, not imputing only
part of their trespasses to them? but the imputing of one sin would mar the
reconciliation for ever. Is not final unbeleef a dead work? Doutbles; yet
the blood of Christ purgeth Consciences from dead works <hi>Heb.</hi> 9: 14. Did
the blood of buls &amp; goats so sanctify, as to the purifying of the flesh, as to
leave the most defileing spot of all untaken away? How could healing come
by his stripes, if he bear but part of our sins, in his body on the tree, seing
final unbeleef alone would mar all? for where that is, there is no coming
to God imaginable. But moreover, the Scripture tels us, that <hi>the blood of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ his Son oleanseth us from all sin 1. Ioh.</hi> 1: 7. and that <hi>if any man sin,
there is an Advocat with the Father,</hi> who is a <hi>propitiation for sins, 1. Ioh.</hi> 2: <hi>vers.</hi>
1, 2. and so must be for all sins, otherwayes there were little ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
here: And it was foretold by <hi>Daniel Chap.</hi> 9: 24. that he <hi>should make an
end of sin, &amp; finish the transgression,</hi> &amp; so <hi>bring-in everlasting Righteousness.</hi>
                  <pb n="540" facs="tcp:104357:272"/>
Doth this admit of exceptions, and of such an exception, as would unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably
make all null? No certanely. But you will ask of me, if I think, that
Christ did die for final unbeleefe? I <hi>Answ.</hi> Not: for I judge, it is the sin on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Reprobates, who hear the Gospel: and I judge that Christ did not die
for any sin of Reprobats: But this I hold, and have cleared, That for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
sinnes soever Christ hath died, he hath died for all their sins: And becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
he hath not died for Final Unbeleef, therefore he hath not died for
any sin of such, as shall be guilty of this: and as for his owne, he died to
prevent their falling into, and to keep them from this sin; for he died <hi>to bring
them unto God, that they might have the Adoption of sons,</hi> that <hi>they might be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,</hi>
and <hi>live unto Righteousness,</hi> be <hi>made Righteous,</hi> yea <hi>the Righteousness of
God;</hi> as is clear 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 10. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 21. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3: 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5:
19. what then will they say to this? Final unbeleef is certainly a sin;
and Christ either died for it, or not; if he died for it, than it can be laid to
no mans charge; or Christ's death is of no value. If he died not for it, he
died not for all the sinnes of all men; but at most, for some sinnes of all men;
and if that was all, no man could thereby be saved, for one sin is enough to
procure damnation.</p>
               <p>Moreover (10.) we finde the Persons, for whom this price of blood was
laid down, designed more particularly, and the Object of this Redemption
restricted; and so it could not be for all &amp; every one. It is said to be for
<hi>Many Esai</hi> 53: 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20: 28. &amp; 26: 28. <hi>Mark</hi> 10: 45. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9: 28. and
what these many are, is abundantly declared in other Scriptures, where
they are called <hi>Christ's Sheep Ioh.</hi> 10: 15. Christ's <hi>People Mat.</hi> 1: 21. <hi>His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
whom according to the predictions of <hi>the Prophets, which have been, since
the world began, he should save from their enemies, and from the hand of all, that
hate them, to performe the mercy promised to the Fathers, and to remember his holy
Covenant, the oath, which he swore to Father Abraham; that he would grant
unto them, that being delivered out of the hand of their enemies, they might serve
him without fear, in holiness &amp; Righteousness, before him, all the dayes of their

               <p>Further (11.) if Christ died for the sinnes of all persons, how cometh it
that they are not all actually pardoned? It cannot be said, that Christ's death
was not a satisfactory price, nor that the Father did not accept of it: If then
he shed his blood for the remission of sins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26: 28. are not all these sins
pardoned virtually &amp; fundamently? or shall they not all actually be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in due time? If it be said, they shall be pardoned upon Condition of
their faith. But if the sinnes of all be equally payed for, and equally in a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
manner discharged, in Christ's being actually discharged from that
debt, in the day of his Resurrection; and the actually discharge depending
upon the uncertain Condition of mans Will; man, who willingly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the Condition, shall praise himself for the actually pardon, and none
else; for Christ did no more for him, as to the Actual Pardon, than for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who never shall be blessed with actual forgiveness: and yet forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is held forth, as a special act of free grace; forgivenesse of sinnes is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the riches of his grace <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 7. Moreover as to that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether did Christ purchase it, or not? If he did not purchase it, than
man is not beholden to Christ, for the Condition; be it faith, or what ye
will, it is no purchased mercy, but man is beholden to his good Lord-<hi>Free
Will,</hi> for it, and so he may sacrifice to his own net, and sing glory to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
for making himself to differ, and for obtaining to himself Actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of all his sinnes, and consequently blessedness <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7, 8. for had
not his owne well disposed Lord-<hi>Free Will</hi> performed that Condition, all that
Christ did, had never more advantaged him, than it did others that perish.</p>
               <p>If it <hi>be said,</hi> that grace to performe the condition, though it be not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
by the blood, of Christ, yet it is freely given by God, to whom he
will. <hi>I Answer</hi> Not to insist here, on the proof of faith's being purchased by
Christ; because we shall cleare it afterward, &amp; there is nothing else assigned
for the condition, I would enquire, whether Christ knew to whom this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
would be given; or not? if not, then we must deny him to be God: if
he knew, why shall we suppose, that he would lay down his life equally for
all, when he knew before hand, that many should never get grace to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
the condition, upon which his death should redound to their actual par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
&amp; justification? what Ends, or what Advantages can we imagine of such
an Universal Redemption?</p>
               <p>(12.) If the Condition, upon which actual pardon &amp; justification is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in the blood of Christ, be purchased by Christ; then either all shall
certainly be Pardoned &amp; Justified, or Christ hath not purchased an Equal,
Common, &amp; Possible Redemption, to all and every man: But the former
is true, &amp; it is not true that all shall certainly be pardoned &amp; actually justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
for then all should be glorified. That the condition, to wit, Faith,
&amp; Repentance is purchased by Christ, who can deny, seing, he is expresly
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:104357:273"/>
called the <hi>Author of Faith, Heb.</hi> 12: 2. and a <hi>Prince exalted to give Repentance
&amp; forgiveness of sins Act.</hi> 5: 31? So that as forgiveness of sins is founded upon
his death, as the Meritorious cause; so must Repentance be; and Christ, as
an exalted Prince &amp; Saviour, hath this power to dispose of his owne purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
legacy, which he hath left, and ensured by his death, unto the heires
of salvation. Upon his Death, &amp; Satisfaction made in his death, hath he
gote all power in heaven &amp; earth, a power to quicken whom he will <hi>Matth.</hi>
28: 18. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5: 21, 22, 27. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2: 9, 10. Hence we are said to <hi>be compleat in
him Col.</hi> 2: 10. &amp; to <hi>be blessed with all spiritual blessings, in celestials</hi> (to which,
no doubt, Faith &amp; Repentance do belong) <hi>in him Ephes.</hi> 1: 3. Is it not from
hence, that <hi>the divine power hath given unto us all things, that pertaine unto life
and godliness 2. Pet,</hi> 1: 3? Nay <hi>Paul</hi> tels us expresly <hi>Phil,</hi> 1: 29. that it is <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to us, in the behalfe of Christ, to beleeve on him.</hi> And certainly there is a
promise of Faith &amp; Repentance; and all the promises are yea &amp; amen in
Him 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 20. all the Blessings contained in the Covenant, are made su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
by his death, who was the surety of this better Testament <hi>Heb.</hi> 7: 22. &amp;
this Testament was to have force by his death <hi>Heb.</hi> 9: 15, 16, 17, 18, &amp; the
<hi>New heart &amp; heart of flesh,</hi> is promised in the Covenant, &amp; comprehendeth
Faith &amp; Repentance, they being some of his Lawes, which he hath also
promised to write in the heart <hi>Ier.</hi> 31: 33, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8: 10. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 11: 19, 20, &amp;
36: 26, 27. We have moreover seen that Sanctification &amp; Holiness, from
which, Faith &amp; Repentance cannot be separated, were purchased by Christ,
&amp; intended in his death: whence <hi>he is made of God unto us Sanctification 1. Cor.</hi>
1: 30. If it be not purchased by Christ, how come we by it? is it a thing in
our Power, and an act of our owne Free Will? Then, as I said before, we
are beholden to ourselves, for Faith and all that follow upon it, &amp; then fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewell
all Prayer for Faith &amp; Repentance, &amp; all Thanksgiving to God for it.
This is pure <hi>Pelagtanisme.</hi> If it be said, that it is the free gift of God <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2:

saved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 6, 7, 8. But all for whom Christ died shall have this Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 14. (11.) All they, whom Christ knoweth &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledgeth,
shall be saved, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7: 23. But he knoweth all them for his
sheep, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10: 14, 17. for whom he died. (12.) All, for whom Christ ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
againe, shall be saved, seing he rose for our justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 25. But
he rose againe for all those, for whom he died, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 25. <hi>who was delivered
for our offences, and was raised againe for our justification, Rom.</hi> 8: 34. (13.) All
who shall be planted together with Christ, in the likeness of his resurrection,
shall be saved: But that is true of such as he died for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6: 5. (14.) All
they in whom the old man shall be crucified, that the body of sin might be
destroyed, that hence-forth they should not serve sin, shall be saved: But
that is true of such as he died for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6: 6, 7, 8. <hi>knowing this, that our old
man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth
we should not serve sin: for he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with
Christ, we beleeve, that we shall also live with him, &amp;c.</hi> (15.) All they, who
shall be made Kings &amp; Priests unto God, shall be saved. But all the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
shall be such, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1: 5, 6. &amp; 5: 10. See worthy Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> on the
<hi>Revel. p.</hi> 303. (16.) If Christ must see of the travail of his soul, then these he
died for must be saved: But the former is true, <hi>Esai.</hi> 53: 11. (17.) All whom
Christ shall Justifie shall be saved, But he shall justify all, whose iniquities he
beareth, <hi>Esai.</hi> 53: 11. Thus is this sufficiently proved.</p>
               <p>It is also considerable (14.) That no where in Scripture, we finde it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
said &amp; affirmed, That <hi>Christ died for all men;</hi> Far less finde we it said,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:104357:274"/>
that <hi>Christ died for all and every man.</hi> Why then is all this trouble made? But
they say, as much as all that is said by consequence. And this we deny: if
they will rationally presse this matter, they should evince, that such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
as they make so much work about, can be no otherwise under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
than they suppose, in the places, where they stand: and this they
shall never be able to do. Though it be said, that Christ gave his life a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<hi>for all;</hi> yet no reason can evince, that that is necessarily to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of all &amp; every man: so nor can they conclude any thing rationally from
the word <hi>world.</hi> They may as well inferre from these words <hi>all,</hi> and the
<hi>world,</hi> that Christ died for devils, beasts &amp; sensless creatures, as that he
died for all &amp; every man; for they are comprehended under these terms, as
well as Men: And if they will restrict these termes to men, because of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scriptures; why may not we restrick them also to the Elect, because of
the correspondence of other passages of Scripture? They cannot deny us the
liberty, they take to themselves. If they say, that there is a vast differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
betwixt Devils an Men, in reference to such favours. We deny it not:
but shall adde, that in reference to spiritual favours, amongst which we
cannot but reckon, with the good leave of our Adversaries, the death of
Christ, being the fruit &amp; expression of the greatest Love of God to Man, we
finde also a great difference in Scripture. Some are <hi>Loved,</hi> some <hi>Hated Rom.</hi>

               <p>If we would consider aright. (15.) What Christ did undergoe &amp; suffer,
while he was made sin, or was making satisfaction for sin; we should hardly
think it probable, that Christ Jesus, God-man, who was <hi>the brightness of tho
Fathers glory, and the express image of his person, Heb.</hi> 1: 3. <hi>and thought it no
robbery to be counted equal with God, Phil.</hi> 2: 6. Should have undergone what he
did undergoe, and that the Father should have laid all that upon him, which
he did lay upon him, and that to purchase only a meer Possible Redemption
from sin &amp; wrath, whereby not one person should be saved or pardoned, if
so it had seemed good to captaine <hi>Free will.</hi> Not to mention his condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

drops of blood falling down to the ground Luk.</hi> 22: 43, 44. and at length was made
to cry out, <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me Psal.</hi> 22: 1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27:
46. <hi>Mark.</hi> 15: 34. This was no mean business, when the Rayes &amp; Irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Divine Love were drawn-in &amp; withheld from him, who had such a
sharp sense of the happiness in the enjoying of God's favour, because of the
Personal union with the Godhead. But that which is most of all to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
is his <hi>being made a Curse Gal.</hi> 3: 13. and so made to wrestle with the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Wrath of a sin revenging God. This was the gall and the worm wood,
that made him cry <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12: 27. <hi>Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I
say? Father save me from this hour.</hi> Shall we suppose, that all this was about
an Uncertane Bargane? Shall we think, that he died the cursed death of the
crosse, and bore the weight of God's wrath <hi>Luk.</hi> 22: 41. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27: 46. and
so became a sacrifice to satisfie divine justice <hi>Heb.</hi> 9: 14, 18, &amp; all to purchase
a meer Possibility; or a meer Possible Redemption? Shall we think, that
the Second person of the Trinity should do &amp; suffer all these things, for to
redeem man, when possibly, if <hi>Freewill</hi> should be so ill natured, not one
man should reap any advantage thereby? Me thinks, the asserting of this
should be a great temptation to cause people turne <hi>Socinians,</hi> and deny all
these soul sufferings of Christ, &amp; his bearing the wrath of God, &amp; making any
satisfaction to justice.</p>
               <p>Adde to this (16.) That the Scriptures speak of Christ's Death &amp; Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
as being not for himself, but for others; and that not only for the
good &amp; advantage of others (and doubtless the advantage of all this should
be but little, if it were nothing else, but a meer Possible Redemption, which
<hi>Free will</hi> might make actual, or not Actual, as it pleased) but in their Roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

                  </gap> hath this import. And this truth is abundantly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
out by our Orthodox Divines, writting against the <hi>Socinians;</hi> so that I
need say no more of it; only I think, such as assert the Redemption purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Christ to have been a meer General Possible Redemption, do streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
the hands of the <hi>Socinians;</hi> and joyn with them against the Orthodox:
But to our purpose, Such as Christ did thus die for, &amp; in their room &amp; place,
are accounted to have died in Him, &amp; so freed: as in <hi>Ter. Pro illo te ducam, Ego
pro te molam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover (17.) If we consider the furniture, which Christ as mediator
had given to him of the Father, we shall see more of the unreasonableness
of this opinion, which the <hi>Arminians</hi> embrace: Not to speak of what he
had as God, the Fathers Fellow &amp; Equal, let us but take notice of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
furniture, which he had as Mediator between God and man, 1.
<hi>Tim,</hi> 2: 5. and our <hi>Emmanuel, Esai.</hi> 7: 14. We see he is called <hi>Wonderful,
Counsellour, &amp;c. Esai.</hi> 9: 6, 7. He is that Candlestick, whence the golden pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
do empty the golden oile, <hi>Zeoh</hi> 4: 12. He was <hi>full of grace &amp; truth Ioh.</hi>
1: 14. Was this fulness for a meer Possible effect? Or had he it so, and for
such an end, as none might possibly be the better thereof? No; <hi>and of his
fulness have all we received grace for grace Ioh,</hi> 1: 16. He <hi>had not the Spirit by
measure Ioh,</hi> 3: 34. <hi>It pleased the Father, that in him should all fulness dwell.
Col.</hi> 1: 9. In <hi>him are hid all the treasures of wisdome &amp; knowledge Col.</hi> 2: 3. <hi>and in
him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily vers.</hi> 9. And wherefore is all
this? Even that all his <hi>might be compleet in him vers. 10. Grace was poured into
his lips Psal.</hi> 45: 2. <hi>and he was anoynted with the oyle of gladness above his fellowes
vers.</hi> 7. And <hi>Esai.</hi> 61: 1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4: 18, <hi>&amp;c. The Spirit of the Lord God was upon
him, because the Lord had anoynted him.</hi> And for what end? <hi>To preach glade
tideings unto the meek, to binde up the broken hearted, to proclame liberty to the
captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.</hi> See further <hi>vers.</hi>
2, 3. Sure, this was no uncertain end, nor left to the discretion of <hi>Free will.</hi>
                  <pb n="547" facs="tcp:104357:275"/>
So <hi>Esai.</hi> 11: 2. <hi>And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wisdom
and understanding, &amp;c.</hi> Shall all this be, and further shall <hi>Righteousness be the
girdle of his loines, and faithfulness the girdle of his reines vers.</hi> 5. And may it
notwithstanding so come to passe, that the Wolf shall not dwell with the
Lamb, nor the Leopard lye down with the Kid, &amp;c. nor the earth be full
of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea? <hi>Vers.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9.
How absurd is it to imagine this? All this furniture saith, that it was no
Uncertain General End, which he had before his eyes, in undertaking
this work; and the Father in sending him, and granting to him this ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>Adde to this (18.) The Titles &amp; Relations, which Christ took upon him:
for they cannot be meer insignificant and empty Names. He is called a <hi>Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

shall haste forward.</p>
               <p>(19.) Our Adversaries say, That Christ by his Death &amp; passion did Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
even according to the Intention of God, purchase Remission of sins
&amp; Reconciliation with God, and that for all &amp; every man: Others say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally:
But withal as to the application of this purchase: it is made to
depend upon faith: and so they distinguish betwixt <hi>Impetration</hi> &amp; <hi>Application.</hi>
And though it is true, the purchase made is one thing, and the actual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of the thing purchased is another thing: Yet we may not say, with
our Adversaries, that the Impetration is for moe, than shall have the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;
But we assert, that both Impetration &amp; Application, in respect
of the designe of the Father, which is absolute &amp; certain, and the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ the Mediator, which is fixed &amp; peremptory, are for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
individual persons; so that for whomsoever God sent Christ, &amp; Christ
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:104357:276"/>
came to purchase any good, unto these same shall it actually, in due time,
&amp; in the Method &amp; manner Condescended upon &amp; prescribed, be given; &amp;
upon them, &amp; none else, shall it actually be bestowed: for (1.) No other
thing, beside this Application, can be supposed to have been the end of the
Impettation; And sure, Christ was herein a Rational Agent: Nay, it was
the Intention &amp; designe of the Father, that the Application of these good
things should be by the meanes of this Impetration, as is abundantly cleared
above. (2.) We cannot suppose that either Christ, or his Father, should
faile, or come short of their end designed; but by our Adversaries, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration
might have been obtained, and yet no Application made of the
good things impetrated &amp; obtained. (3.) If no Application was intended by
the Father or by Christ, then it must be said, that both were uncertain, as
to what the Event should have been, or at least Regardless &amp; Unconcerned;
either of which to affirme were blasphemy. (4.) The very word <hi>Impetrate,</hi>
having the same force &amp; import with, <hi>Purchase, Procure, Obtaine, Merite,</hi>
and the like, doth say, that such, for whom this Impetration was made,
have a right, upon the Impetration, to the thing Acquired &amp; Purchased:
And if they have a right thereto, that Possession should follow. (5.) Yea the
word importeth, the actual conferring of the good, to be the very end of
the Purchaseing &amp; Impetrating; and so, in this case, the very Impetration
is ground of Assurance of the Application, considering, who did impetrate,
and at whose hands, and withall, what was the ground of the Fathers sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Christ, and of Christs coming to impetrate, even inconceiveably
wonderful &amp; great Love. Nor doth the intervening of a condition, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before the actual collation of some of the good things purchased, hinder
at all; for all these Blessings, some whereof are as a condition to others, are
the one good thing Impetrated, and the very conditions are also Impetrated,
as we declared above: and so this pointeth forth only the methode of the
actual bestowing of these good things purchased. (6.) How absurd is it to say,
a thing is Impetrated or Obtained, and yet may, or may not be Bestowed;
may be Possessed, or not Possessed? Or to say, that such a good thing is Obtained
by price or petitioning, and yet the same good thing, may never be Bestowed,
or the Bestowing of it hangeth &amp; dependeth upon an Uncertain Condition,
which may never beperformed? (7.) How unreasonable is it, that such should
have right to the Merites, that have no right to the thing Merited? Doth
not an interest in the Merites, procureing any thing, include an interest in
the thing Merited? When a ransome is payed for captives, to the end they
may be delivered, have not these Captives a right to the deliverance, upon
the payment of that ransome? (8.) The Scriptures do so connect these two,
that it argueth contempt thereof, to imagine such a separation: as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4:
25. Yea the one is assigned as a certain Effect &amp; Consequent flowing from
the Other, as its Moral cause <hi>Esai.</hi> 53: 11. <hi>By his knowledge shall my righteous
servant justify many,</hi> this Justification is the Application; &amp; whence cometh it?
<hi>For he shall bear their iniquities,</hi> there is the Impetration given as the ground
hereof: So further <hi>vers. 5. he was wounded for our transgressions, &amp;c.</hi> and what
followeth upon this Impetration? <hi>And by his stripes are we healed.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 5:
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:104357:276"/>
                  <hi>vers. 18. By the Righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men to justification.</hi>
So that the Application reacheth an <hi>all,</hi> that is, all who have interest in the
Righteousness, which is the thing Impetrated see also <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 10. (9.) If
Christs Intercession be for the same persons, for whom he died, then the
Application is to the same; for this Intercession of Christ is in order to the
Application: But that Christs Intercession is for the same persons, for whom
he died, we shall see hereafter. (10.) If all things be ensured to such, for
whom Christ died, then certanely this Application cannot fail but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is true <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 32. <hi>He that spared not his owne Son, but delivered him up for
us all, how shall he not</hi> (mark this manner of expression which importeth the
greated of absurdities to think otherwise) <hi>with him also freely give us all things?</hi>
(11.) And in that same place <hi>vers.</hi> 33, 34. Christs death is given as the certain
ground of Justification, &amp; Salvation, so that such, as he died for, shall certa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely,
in due time, &amp; after the methode prescribed, be Justified &amp; Saved; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes,
there were no sure ground in the Apostles argueing; for if all the
ground of this certanty, as to Application, were from their Faith, or fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Condition, the Apostle would have mentioned this, as the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
ground, &amp; not have led them to a ground common to others, who never
should partake of the Application. (12.) This matter is abundantly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from what we said above, concerning Christs purchasing of Faith, and
dying for our sanctification, &amp; to bring us to God, &amp;c. so that more needeth
not be added here.</p>
               <p>(20.) For further confirmation of this, and because our Adversaries think
to salve the fore mentioned separation of Impetration &amp; Application, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us, that where good things are Absolutely purchased, then Application
must follow; But not where good things are purchased only Conditionally,
as in our case: we shall therefore shew, how this will not hold, nor advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
their cause: for (1.) If all be Redeemed Conditsonally, that condition,
whatever it be, must in equity be revealed to all. (2.) Either God &amp; Christ
knew, who would performe this condition, or not: If not, then they were
not omniscient: If they did know; then sure, this death was more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
&amp; designedly intended for them, than for the rest: and upon what
account, &amp; to what end, should Christ lay down his life a Ransome for such,
as he knew certainly should never be the better thereof? And why would
the Father send him to die for such? (3.) This Condition is either in mans
sole power, without the help of the Grace of God, to performe, or not:
If it be in mans power, from what Scripture shall this <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed?
How shall then the new Covenant of Grace be distinguished <hi>in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi>
from the Covenant of Works, made with <hi>Adam?</hi> If this Condition be
not in mans power, but the Grace of God must work it. Then either God
will work it in all, or not: If not, why would God purchase good things to
people upon a Condition, which they could not performe, &amp; which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
could work in them, &amp; resolved not to worke in them? If he will worke
it in all, then all shall certainly be saved. Againe, if this Condition be the
free gift of God, then either God will give it Absolutely to all; and so all shall
certainly be saved: or Absolutely to some, &amp; then none but they shall be
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:104357:277"/>
saved, and why should Christ die for the rest? Or Conditionally to all: And
if so, the doubt will recurre concerning that Condition, which either must
be Absolutely given, &amp; so we are where we were, or Conditionally, and
so still the doubt recurreth. (4.) This condition is either purchased by Christ,
or it is not. If not, then we owe no thanks to Christ for it, nor for what
is obtained upon that Condition, more then others who performe not the
Condition, &amp; so obtaine nothing: but to ourselves only, who make our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to differ; and so may we sing praises to ourselve, &amp; put the crown
upon our owne heads, and give no song of praise to the Redeemer, but what
such as go to hell are bound to give, contrary to all Christian Religion: If
Christ hath purchased this Condition, then it is done either Absolutly, of
Conditionally: If Absolutely, than all shall Absolutely have it: if Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,
we enquire, what is the Condition? And whatever it be, we
may move the same questions concerning it. (5.) By this meanes the act should
creatits owne object; for Faith in the death of Christ is ordinarily given as
the Condition, and this faith maketh the death of Christ valide, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes
would not be. (6.) This maketh all the vertue of Christs death to
depend upon mans act; so that if man will, all shall be saved; if not, no
man shall be saved, notwithstanding that Christ died for them. (7.) This
makes Christ but, at most, a half Mediator, doing one part of the work;
and man, coming in to compleete it must be the other half mediator; and
so, at least, must have the halfe of the Praise. (8.) where saith the Scripture,
that if we beleeve, Christ died for us? or that Christ died for all, or for
any, Conditionally? It is true, some of the effects of Christ's death are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
Conditionally, (taking the word <hi>conditionally</hi> not <hi>properly,</hi> as if the
performance of that Condition, did in proper Law sense procure a right to
these mercies; for through the merites of Christ's blood have we a right pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
to all; but <hi>improperly</hi> as denoteing nothing but the Methode &amp; way of
God's bestowing the blessings purchased, first this, and then, upon the souls
acting of that, another; as for example, first faith, then upon the souls
acting of Faith, Justification, then Sanctification &amp;c. and upon the souls
acting of Sanctification, Glorification) but the death of Christ cannot the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
be called Conditional, more than the will or purpose of God can be
called conditional, because some of the things willed, may depend upon
other, as upon a condition. (9.) Then by performing the Condition, man
should procure to himself a Legal Right, and Title not only to the death of
Christ, but to Justification, Adoption, Sanctification, yea &amp; to Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
yea and that a more near &amp; effectual Title &amp; Right, than what was
had by Christ's death; for the Title had by Christ's death (if it can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Title) was far Remore &amp; Common to such, as shall never have any
profite by it; but the other is Certain, Particular, Proxime, &amp; giveth
possession, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us in re.</hi> (10.) Then Christ's blood, as shed upon the crosse, was
but a Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ntial thing, having no power or vertue in it self to redeem any,
it was but a poor Potential price: and all its vertue of actual purchasing &amp;
procureing is from mans performing the Condition; this, and this only, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
it Power &amp; Efficacy: and so Christ is beholden to man for giving ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:104357:277"/>
unto his Blood, and making it effectual, which before was a deadin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
thing. Then let any judge, who should have the greatest share of
the Glory of Redemption, Man or Christ. (11.) was Christ's death Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
in no respect; or was it, as to some things, I mean, belonging to Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
&amp; Glory, Absolute? if in nothing, then Man must certanely have a great
share of the glory: if it was Absolute as to any thing, what was that? and
why was it more Absolute as to that, than as to other things? And why
should it then be simply, &amp; without limitation, said that Christ died for all
Conditionally?</p>
               <p>For Further confirmation of our 19. Argument, &amp; confutation of our
Adversaries position, we adde (21.) That Christ Jesus is heard of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in all that he asketh <hi>Psal.</hi> 2: 8. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11: 41, 42. and as <hi>an High Priest he
entred into heaven Heb.</hi> 9: 11, 12. <hi>now to appear in the presence of God for us vers.
24. to prepare a place Ioh.</hi> 14: 2. &amp; to act the part of an <hi>Advocat,</hi> interceding
with the Father, in the behalfe of all such, for whom he died 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2: 1, 2.
If then Christ, whom his Father heareth alwayes, intercedeth in the behal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe
all these, for whom he died, either he did not die for all, or all must
certainly be saved. That Christ's Intercession, &amp; Death are for the same
persons, will be, and must be denyed by our Adversaries: But to us it is
most manifest from these grounds. (1.) To Intercede &amp; pray are as Essential
&amp; Necessary Acts of the Priestly office, as to offer sacrifice: and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. cleareth up, how Christ did in truth, what the High Priest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Jewes did in the type; for as the <hi>High Priest alone went, once every
yeer, into the second</hi> tabernacle, or holy of holies, <hi>not without blood, which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for himself, and the errours of the people vers.</hi> 7. So Christ, <hi>being come an
High Priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, by his
owne blood, he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
vers.</hi> 12. Hence he is said to <hi>Live for ever to make Intercession for us. Heb.</hi>
7: 25. and he is <hi>an Advocat with the Father 1. Ioh.</hi> 2: 1. Hence then it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that Christ must Intercede for such, as he did Offer up himself for,
or he shall not be a Perfect &amp; Compleet High Priest; or not faithfull to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
all the Offices of the High Priest: neither of which can be said. (2.)
The ground of his Intercession, is held forth to be his Oblation: as the High
Priest went into the holy of holies with the blood of the sacrifices, which he
had offered; so Christ entered into the holy place, having first obtained by the
sacrifice of himself an Eternal Redemption. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9: 12. So he is an Advocate
with the Father, being first a Propitiation for sinnes 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2: 1, 2. (3.)
Both his Death &amp; Intercession make up one Compleet <hi>Medium,</hi> &amp; are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
&amp; designed, as one <hi>Medium,</hi> for the end designed, <hi>viz.</hi> the bringing
of many sones unto glory, saving to the uttermost all that come to God
through him &amp;c. (4.) How unreasonable is it to think, that Christ would
refuise to Pray for such, whom he loved so dearly, as to lay down his life
for? yet he saith expresly, that he <hi>prayeth not for the world,</hi> but for others,
distinguished from the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17: 9. (5.) As His Death was for such as
the Father had given him (is we saw above) so his Intercession &amp; Prayer is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricted
to such <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17: 9. - <hi>I pray not for the world; but for them which thou hast
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:104357:278"/>
given me, for they are thine.</hi> (6.) Christ's end in coming into the world, was
to save his people; Hence he gote that name <hi>Iesus;</hi> but he should not be
able to save them, Perfectly, Compleetly, &amp; to the Utermost, if he did not
joyne his Intercession, with his Oblation; Yea upon this account he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
ever a Priest, having an unchangable Priesthood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2: 24, 25. <hi>But
this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangable Priesthood, wherefore
he is able to save them to the uttermost, that come unto God by him, seing he ever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to make intercession for them.</hi> (7.) The Apostle so joyneth them together
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 34. that they must do manifest violence to the Apostles reasoning,
who would pull them asunder, &amp; separate the one from the other. <hi>It is</hi> (sais
he) <hi>Christ that died, yea rather that is risen againe, who is even at the right hand
of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</hi> (8.) Yea, they are so joyned together
here, that his death alone considered could not yeeld that ground of triumph
&amp; boasting, nor security from Accusations: <hi>Yea rather, that is risen againe,
&amp;c.</hi> (9.) So that the separating &amp; taking of these asunder, is greatly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to the consolation of his people; for though they should attaine to some
apprehensions of Christ's dying for them, as an Advocate with the Father,
upon new sinnes 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2: 1, 2. Though Christ died, yet they might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
for he must also Interceed; and if he do not Intercede for them,
their Hopes, &amp; Comforts are gone: And so there should be no force in
that, <hi>who is he that condemneth,</hi> it is Christ that die<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 34. And a poor
soul might be hal saved, but not to the uttermust, contrare to <hi>Heb.</hi> 2: 25.
(10.) And that place <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 33. restricteth both equally unto the Elect: <hi>who
shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?</hi> (11.) When Christ laid down his
life a Ransome for sinners, he could not but know, that by that Ransome
none should be actually saved, without his Intercession, it being accorded
betwixt Father &amp; Son, that the mediator should mediate both by Price &amp;
by Prayer: And he could not but know, for whom he purposed &amp; intended
to Interceed; how shall we then suppose, that he would lay down his life
for those, for whom he was purposed not to Pray? Or that he would do the
most for them, For whom he would not do the least? (12.) Christ's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
is really a presenting unto God the Oblation made: Therefore sayes
the Apostle <hi>Heb.</hi> 9: 24. that <hi>Christ is entered into heaven it self, to appear in the
presence of God for us:</hi> And so by appearing he Interceedeth: &amp; his appearing
is in his owne blood, whereby he obtained Eternal Redemption <hi>Heb.</hi> 9: 12.
&amp; so his Intercession must be for all, for whom the Oblation was, &amp; the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Redemption was obtained. (13.) Yea both these are so joyned together
by <hi>Esaias Chap.</hi> 53: 12. as that they are made one ground, &amp; procureing cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of God's divideing him a portion with the great, &amp; of Christs own divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deing
the spoile with the strong; <hi>Because he hath poured out his soul unto death,
and he bare the sin of many, and made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntercession for the transgressours.</hi> (14.) This
is further clear from the reasons, we gave to confirme that fast connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Christ's <hi>Impetration</hi> &amp; <hi>Application,</hi> in the foregoing paragraph, for the
Actual Application of the benefite &amp; fruit of his oblation is attributed to his
Intercession. (15.) Nay, that whole <hi>Chapter Ioh.</hi> 17. confirmeth this; for
there Christ is both Offering himself, or sanctifying himself thereunto <hi>vers.</hi>
                  <pb n="553" facs="tcp:104357:278"/>
19. and Interceding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and these are so lincked together, both in themselves,
&amp; as to the persons for whom, that it must argue, at least, much incogitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to imagine a divulsion, &amp; separation of these two acts of his Priesthood.
(16.) If Christ Intercede not for the same persons, for whom he died, we
ask for whom he Intercedeth? Is it for actuall beleevers? Then we ask a Scripture ground for this restriction? And then it is manifest hence, that
Christ Intercedeth not for the working of faith in any: And yet <hi>Esaias</hi> tels
us, that <hi>he maketh Intercession for transgressours.</hi> And we see <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17: 20. that
he prayeth not only for those, who were already beleevers, but for such
also, as were not yet beleevers. He told us Himself also, that he would pray
the Father for the Spirit, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14: <hi>vers.</hi> 16. And among other things, this is
one work of the Spirit, to cause a sinner beleeve, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 13. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 17,
18, 19.</p>
               <p>The point we are upon will be further cleare, if we consider. (22.) That
Christ's death was a <hi>Redemption,</hi> &amp; we are said to be Redeemed thereby <hi>Gal.
4: 5. &amp; 3: 13. Rom.</hi> 3: 24. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 14. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he died not for all, seing all are not redeemed &amp; saved. His Ransome, or

must be saved, is cleare; for (1.) Other wayes it were no Redemption, a
Ransome given for Captives doth say, that these Captives, in Law &amp; Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
ought to be set at liberty. (2.) This Redemption is the same with, (as

was a Redemption from the Law, <hi>for God sent forth his son—made under the

there is a liberation had from the Law, &amp; its Curse &amp; Penality. (8.)
And it is a Redemption of such as were under the Law, for this end, that <hi>they
might receive the adoption of sones Gal.</hi> 4: 5. But this Adoption of sones is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all. (9.) All which receiveth confirmation from this, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who received this ransome, did himself send his Son to lay it down,
&amp; so it was his own Ransome; and therefore must have been payed, upon
a certaine designe of actually Redeeming &amp; delivering from Sin, Satan, Death
&amp; Hell, those, for whom it was laid downe. (10.) So is there an other end
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:104357:279"/>
of this Redemption mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 13, 14. <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the

of a mediation; &amp; of Love &amp; free grace to provide a Redeemer; we
cannot but in reason think, that His good pleasure did regulare this matter,
as to the Persons, who should be Redeemed, &amp; as to the manner &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
after which they should actually partake of the Redemption. And that
therefore, the persons to be redeemed were condescended upon, and the

&amp; Redemption of those, who were condescended upon, &amp; of none

where a Testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the Testatour: for a
Testament is of force after men are dead, otherwise it is of no strength, at all, while
the Testatour liveth.</hi> So he said himself of the cup, in the Sacrament, that it
<hi>was the blood of the New Testament Mat.</hi> 26: 28. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14: 24. &amp; that it was <hi>the
cup of the New Testament in his blood Luk.</hi> 22: 20. and <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it, <hi>the New
Testament in his blood 1. Cor.</hi> 11: 25. So that his Death &amp; Bloodshed was the
death of a Testatour, for the confirmation of the New Testament, and for
ascertaneing of the Legatees, of the good things bequathed to them in lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
by the Testament. Now a Testament commonly is a declaration of the
Testatours free, Absolute &amp; Voluntary Purpose of bestowing such &amp; such
benefites, to such &amp; such friends; and so it is the Testatours letter will, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby
he willeth that <hi>this</hi> legacy be given to this person, &amp; <hi>that</hi> to another.
It is true, men may insert some Conditions, as to some legacies, because
they are but men, &amp; know not contingent future things, nor have they the
wils &amp; dispositions of such, they appoint legatees, in their own hand and
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:104357:279"/>
power; But it is otherwayes with our Testatour: and therefore we cannot
think, that He left the legacies in his Testament, at the uncertainty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
to be performed by men; especially considering, how as he died
to ratify the Testament, so he rose againe to administrate the same, as the sole
executor thereof by his Spirit, &amp; that what legacies he left to be bestowed,
upon such &amp; such conditions he left not the matter at an uncertainty; for the
condition it self was bequeathed, as the necessary good of the Testament,
without which all would have been to no purpose. It is unreasonable then to
think, that Christ died to give force to his Testament; and yet it might come
to passe, that he should have no heire, to enjoy the goods left in legacy. Nor
is it reasonable to think, that all the world were equally his heires, seing the
Inheritance, and Kingdom is for the little flock <hi>Luk.</hi> 12: 32. and a peculiar
select number 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 4. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17: 24. <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 12. who are heires of <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
of God, of salvation, of the Grace of God, of the Kingdom &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8:
17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3: 29. &amp; 4: 7, 30. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3: 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1: 14. &amp; 6: 1. &amp; 11: 7. <hi>Iam.</hi>
2: 5. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3: 7. Therefore, all whom Christ hath appointed heires in
his Testament, shall certainly enjoy the good things tested, in due time,
for his Death gave force to his Testament, as being his Last &amp; Unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
will, so that they cannot misse of the inheritance, and be disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
especially considering, that Christ by his death laid down a valuable
&amp; rich price to purchase all these good things, which he left in legacy to his
friends &amp; heires.</p>
               <p>Christ's death moreover (25.) is to be considered, as the death of a <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi>
&amp; Cautioner, and this will further confirme our point: Hence he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>Surety Heb.</hi> 7: 22. and is said to <hi>die for the ungodly Rom.</hi> 5: 6. to <hi>be made a
curse for us Gal.</hi> 3: 13. and to <hi>be made sin. 2. Cor.</hi> 5: 21. and other expressions of
the like Kind have the same import: From whence it is evident, that Christ
took the debt upon him, that was justly to be charged upon the account of
sinners, that he became one person in Law, with sinners the principal deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
that he payed &amp; satisfied for all the debt, and that in their room and
place: and that therefore all these, for whom he died, must certainly be
delivered from the Debt, and from the Charge &amp; Consequences thereof.
These things are manifest of themselves, and need no further confirmation.
Now seing all are not delivered from the debt of sin, nor from the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due because of sin, we cannot say, that Christ died, as a Cautioner,
for all; for sure his death was a compleat payment of all the debt he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to pay, and to satisfie for. Nor can we say, that he died as a Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
for he knew not whom; far lesse, that he died as a Cautioner, and yet
none might possibly receive advantage thereby. Not yet can we say, that he
died, as a Cautioner, and payed for some sinnes of all, and not for all their
sinnes, for whom he died; seing he was a Compleet Cautioner. So then,
as Christ died in their roome &amp; stead, as their Cautioner, &amp; Sponsor, for
whom he died, wrong should be done to Him, if all these, for whom he
was a Cautioner, should not at length actually be delivered out of prison,
&amp; freed from the accusation of the Law: They, for whom he died, being
in him legally, when he died, and morally &amp; virtually dying in him, and
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:104357:280"/>
with him, must not, in justice, be made to pay their own debt, &amp; satisfie
the Law over againe: Christ's stricking hands (as the phrase is <hi>Prov.</hi> 22: 26.)
and so putting his name in the obligation, and accordingly making satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the Principal's name is blotted out, and he free in the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<hi>for he bare our griefs, and carryed our sorrowes &amp;c. Esai.</hi> 53: 4, 5. and by
<hi>meanes of death, he delivered them, who through fear of death were all their life
time subject to bondage Heb.</hi> 2: 14, 15.</p>
               <p>This matter will be further clear, if we consider (26.) How the death of
Christ was a <hi>Satisfaction:</hi> and none can deny this, but Antichristian <hi>Socinian:</hi>
Others willingly grant, that Christ did substitute himself, in the room of
sinners, and was willing to undergo the punishment, threatned in the Law
against sin, that the sinners, for whom he undertook satisfaction, might
be freed: So he <hi>bare their sins Esai.</hi> 53: 11. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 24. And <hi>he was made
sin 2. Cor.</hi> 5: 21. Hence he is called a <hi>Propitiation 1. Ioh.</hi> 2: 3 &amp; 4: 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3:
25. Whereby we see, that Christ took upon him the whole Punishment,
that was due to sin; and that God, whom sinners had offended, was well
pleased with what he did and suffered, according to that undertaking, yea
more pleased, than he was displeased with all the sinnes of those, for whom
he suffered: for hereby His Authority &amp; Justice was made to appear more
glorious &amp; excellent. How then can we think, that many of those, &amp; it
may be all, for whom he gave that satisfaction, may, notwithstanding,
possibly be made to make satisfaction for themselves, as they may by our
Adversaries way? Was not his satisfaction full &amp; compleat? Why should
any then, for whom he gave that satisfaction, be liable to Punishment? Is
this consonant to justice? Did not the Lord Jehovah send Christ &amp; sit him
with a body for this end <hi>Psal.</hi> 40: 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 5. &amp; laid upon Him the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of us all <hi>Esai.</hi> 53: 6. that He might make full satisfaction for them to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
&amp; suffer for them all that the Law could demand of them, or they were
liable unto by the broken Law? Did not Christ do &amp; suffer all, which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to do, &amp; suffer for this end? And did not the Father accept of what
he did &amp; suffered, as a full Compensation, &amp; Satisfaction? And seing this
cannot be denied, &amp; it is manifest that this was done by Christ as a Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7: 22. how can it be imagined, that the Principal debtor shall not
thereupon have a fundamental right to freedom &amp; pardon, &amp; in due time,
after the Gospel method, be actually Discharged, &amp; delivered from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of the Law, &amp; Redeemed by the Satisfactory Price payed by the
Cautioner, &amp; accepted of the Creditour? Doth not the denying of this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
&amp; infallible Effect, call in question the value &amp; worth of Christ's satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and give ground to say, that Jehovah was not Satisfied with the price;
or that Christ made no Satisfaction? Did not Christ make Reconciliation
for the sinnes of his people? <hi>Heb.</hi> 2: 17? <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Adde for a further confirmation of this. (27.) That Christ's death was a
propitiating sacrifice. He <hi>gave himself for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to
God, for a sweet smelling savour Ephes.</hi> 5: 2. He <hi>offered up himself once Heb.</hi> 7:
27. He is a sacrifice for us, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 7. &amp; <hi>the lamb of God, which</hi> beareth,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:104357:280"/>
or <hi>taketh away she sin of the world Ioh. 1: 29. He offered up himself without spot
to God</hi> Heb. 9: 14. &amp; he <hi>was once offered to bear the sinnes of many Heb.</hi> 9: 28.—
<hi>we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Iesus Christ once for all,—he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
one sacrifice for sin for ever Heb.</hi> 10: 10, 12. Now as the sacrifices under the
Law, which were a type of this, did not procure a General, Possible bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
but did procure a Real favour, only to the People of God; for <hi>they san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
to the purifying of the flesh Heb.</hi> 9: 13. So certainly this Real &amp; Perfect
sacrifice must have a Peculiar &amp; Real Effect &amp; <hi>sprinkle consciences from dead
works, to serve the living God: Heb.</hi> 9: 14. And this is not a thing common to
all, nor is it a meer Possible thing: They must then do a great indignity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sacrifice of Christ, who speak of an Universal meerly Possible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
               <p>Adde to this. (28.) How upon this Sacrifice, which Christ offered up, in
his death, we read of a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> made <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 16. <hi>and that he might
Reconcile both unto God, in one body, by the crosse, having s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aine the enmity, by it,</hi>
or <hi>in himself 2. Cor. 5. 10. when we were enemies we were Recenciled to God, by the
death of his Son.</hi> Col. 1: 20. <hi>and having made peace, through the blood of his crosse,
by him to Reconcile all things unto himself.</hi> Therefore is he called <hi>our Peace E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.</hi>
2: 14. &amp; he <hi>maketh Peace vers. 15. we have Peace with God through our Lord
Iesus Christ. Rom.</hi> 5: 1. Now this Reconciliation being of parties, that are
at variance, must be a Reconciliation of both to other, and so a mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation:
and Christ effectuateth both: and both are purchased by his
death: we cannot then imagine with <hi>Socinians,</hi> that all the Reconciliation,
mentioned in Scripture, is of us to God; as if God's Anger &amp; Wrath were
not appeased &amp; taken out of the way; nor with <hi>Arminians,</hi> that Christ ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
an Universal Reconciliation of God to all, but no Reconciliation of
man to God; friendship betwixt enemies must be mutual, if a Reconciliation
be; and our state before this was enmity <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1: 20, 21. and God's
wrath was against us &amp; upon us, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 3. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3: 36. But now, how will this
agree with Universal Redemption? Is God Reconciled to all, when many
perish under his wrath, for ever? Can God be said to be, upon the death of
Christ, Reconciled to all, when it may so fall out, that not one soul shall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
peace with God? How cometh it to passe, that many, whose Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Christ hath purchased, live &amp; die enemies to God? Sure the Apostle
tels us 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 19. that to whom God is reconciled, to them he doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
sin: &amp; he assureth us, that all such, as are reconciled to God, by the
death of his Son, shall be saved. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 10.</p>
               <p>Adde (29.) That it seemeth hard to say, That Christ laid down his life a
Price, a Ransome, a Sacrifice, an Atonement &amp; Propitiation, &amp;c. to
Purchase, Procure, Merite Grace, &amp; Glory, &amp; to make Reconciliation &amp;
Peace betwixt God, &amp; such, as were already suffering the vengeance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
fire, &amp; to satisfie for their sinnes, who were already condemned to the
torments of hell fire: and yet this must be said by such, as assert Universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.
Was Christ so prodigal of his blood, as to cast it away, for such
as were irrecoverably gone? If it be said, that this is no more hard, than to
say, that Christ suffered for such, as were already glorified. Any may see,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:104357:281"/>
how vast the difference is, for such as were glorified, were glorified upon the
account of Christs Death, which was to be, in the time appointed &amp; designed
by Father &amp; Son. When one promiseth a summe for redeeming of so many
slaves, &amp; the summe, according to mutual agreement, is to be payed at
such a day, the slaves may be presently relieved, in contemplation of the
price, which is accepted, &amp; is to be payed hereafter at the time appointed:
But when one cometh to lay down Ransome-money, he cannot be said to lay
it downe for such are are dead, &amp; that he knoweth to be dead many years ago,
&amp; so uncapable of Redemption.</p>
               <p>Further (30.) If Christ died for all, then he intended to die for all; then
the Father also intended, that he should die for all; then he intended that it
should be a Redemption for all, &amp; that thereby all should be Redeemed: for
to what end else should Christ die &amp; redeem, if not that such, as he died
for &amp; Redeemed, be Redeemed &amp; Delivered? Or to what other end should
God intended that Christ should die for all, than to the ends mentioned in
Scripture, of which we have spoken? And how can we say, that God did
intend the Redemption of all, when all are not actually Redeemed? Are
his intentions so fallible, and frustrable? If it be said, that he Intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Possible Salvation, and not Actual. I <hi>Ans.</hi> The Scripture speaketh no
such thing as we have seen: And how unsuteable is it to the wisdom of God,
to send his Son, actually to die, and bear the curse, and only intend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a Possible Redemption, which might never prove Actual to any one soul?
If it be said, That he Intended an Actual Redemption, but Conditionally.
I <hi>Answer.</hi> Redemption upon a Condition is but a Conditional Redemption, &amp;
that is but a Potential, Possible Redemption, unlesse you say, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is also purchased: and then, as to God, it is an Absolute Redemption,
&amp; intended as such: doth it suite the wisdom: of God, to intend Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
to all, and not intend also the Condition, by which alone it must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Actual, &amp; which he alone can work, but will not? Must we thus ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
such intentions to God, as must hang upon mans will, &amp; be subordinate
thereunto? Or if he see, that the Condition will never be performed, how
can we think, that he intendeth any thing upon a Condition, that shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be? But enough of this, at present.</p>
               <p>Moreover (31.) This doctrine of Universal Redemption is derogatory to
the solide consolation of the Redeemed, &amp; Weakeneth the grounds of their
song;
and therefore it is not to be admitted. This Argument is fully &amp; soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely
prosecuted, and vindicated from what can be allaiged against it, by the
learned &amp; solide divine Mr. <hi>Durbam,</hi> in his Comment on the <hi>Revelation pag.</hi>
304. &amp; 305. And to him shall I referre the Reader: only I shall crave lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
to adde this: That by our Adversaries grounds, the song of the Saved
shall not run, as it doth <hi>Revel.</hi> 5: 9, 10. But rather thus, We have saved our
selves, out of every kinred, &amp; tongue; &amp; people, &amp; nation, &amp; have made
our selves unto God, Kings &amp; Priests: For whereas Christ by his blood Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
all of every kinred, and tongue, and people, &amp; nation, and not
some only out of them; we our selves have, by our own free good will, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
a difference betwixt our selves, and the rest; and we are no more behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:104357:281"/>
to Christ for all that we have attained to, then the damned in hell are,
for whom Christ shed his blood, as well as for us, &amp; to whom he purchased
by his blood &amp; death, as much, as for us; as Adversaries say. So that I see
not how <hi>Arminians,</hi> can think to joine in this Song, &amp; have any share of
this Consolation, which is solely founded upon the Redemption of Christ,
as a peculiar &amp; no common blessing. Let them consider it, for it concerneth
them not a little, seing all that come to glory will sing to the honour of their
Redeemer, upon other grounds, as we see, then these are, which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
lay down, and plead so earnestly for. If any say, that Christ more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
hath purchased faith to some, even to all that are actually saved. I <hi>Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</hi>
As neither the <hi>Arminians,</hi> nor <hi>semi-Arminians,</hi> I mean the followers of
<hi>Camero</hi> will say this, or grant so much; so the granting of it, will ever the
other Universal Conditional Redemption; for the Scripture speaketh but of
one kind of Redemption, of one Price laid down, of one Covenant betwixt
Jehovah &amp; the Mediator; &amp; of one Giving unto Christ of Persons to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.
Shall we think, that Christ would lay down as great a ransome for
such, as he was not to purchase faith unto, as for the rest? Shall we think
that he would lay down his life in vaine, &amp; make no purchase thereby? And
of the Reprobat, for whom he was not to purchase thereby? And
of the Reprobat, for whom he was not to purchase faith, he knew he could
make no purchase; for without faith his death would be of no advantage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. And where do we read, that all were given unto him to redeem?
Yea, are not the given ones clearly distinguished from the rest? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17: 6, 9,
as we cleared above.</p>
               <p>Againe (32.) If the Redemption of Christ be Universal, and Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal:
it must necessarily follow, that Christ laid down his life, and the price
of his blood, as much for <hi>Iudas,</hi> and all the Reprobate, as he did for <hi>Iohn,</hi>
and all the Elect: for the Redemption being Conditionally for all, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be more for one, then for another. And yet this cannot be said, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
from the reasons formerly adduced. This would lay, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Christs love was equal towards all; and that no more was purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for the one, than for the other; and that the Elect have no more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
by Christs death, than the Reprobat have; and that Christ had no more
an eye to Redeem the Elect by his death, than to Redeem the Reprobat;
&amp; was no more a Cautioner for the one, than for the other: all which and
the like cannot but be looked upon, as most absurd. Shall we think, that
Christ became sin, as well, or as much, for <hi>Iudas,</hi> as for <hi>Peter?</hi> Shall we
think, that He redeemed all alike from the Curse of the Law? These sound
ill to Christian ears.</p>
               <p>So (33.) we may thus reason: Either Christ's Redemption is Conditional
&amp; Universal, as to the Price laid down &amp; Satisfaction made; or as to the
Application &amp; Actual bestowing of the benefites purchased: But neither can
be said to the advantage of the Adversaries cause; for if the <hi>last</hi> be said, we
willingly grant that some of the benefites, as Justification, Adoption, and
actuall Glorification, are conferred in a manner conditionally: but some,
as faith and the New heart, are given absolutely: and this cannot Help the
Adversaries cause, for they will not say, that either all have faith bestowed
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:104357:282"/>
upon them, or that all are by believing Justified &amp; Adopted &amp;c. and so this
is not Universall: and if the <hi>first</hi> be said, to wit, That Christ laid down his
life Conditionally, it must be said, that Christ did not lay down his life Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
but upon some condition; and what can that Condition be, upon
which the death of Christ was suspended? If it be said, that the faith of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
to whom it was to be preached, was the Condition: then it must be
said, that christ did not die untill these believed, or that his death was no
satisfaction or price, untill they actually believed: and then the Father
could not be well pleased with the price as a satisfaction, until mens Faith
came to make it an Actual price: which is both absurd, and contrary to
Scripture. <hi>If it be said,</hi> That Christ did absolutely lay down his life a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
Ransom, and that for all, yet so as none, that would not fulfil the
Condition, should be redeemed. I <hi>Answer.</hi> If it was an Absolute satisfactory
Ransome, &amp; accepted as such, something must have been purchased there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
&amp; all behoved actually &amp; really to be delivered from the Law &amp; from
the curse, or from something, by vertue of that Absolute Price; and they
could not be made to pay over againe what was payed by the price of his
blood; for Justice could not call for two satisfactions. And if all were, upon
this Absolute Price payed, Redeemed from the Law, the Curse, &amp; the
Sentence of the first Covenant, no man shall now die for that broken Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
<hi>If it be said,</hi> No man was Absolutely delivered even from that, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Conditionally. I <hi>Ans.</hi> How then was it an Absolute Price? Or what was
purchased thereby? <hi>If it be said,</hi> That a possibility of Freedom was absolutely
purchased. <hi>Ans.</hi> This was rejected above: and the Scripture inferreth Actual
Redemption from Christs purchase, <hi>He shall justifie many, for he shall bear
their iniquities Esai.</hi> 53: 11. which saith, That all whose iniquities he did bear,
shall be Actually &amp; Really Justified by him, &amp; not have a meer Possibility of
Justification.</p>
               <p>Further (34.) We may thus argue, If Christ died for all &amp; every one, He
either died for all <hi>Absolutely</hi> or <hi>Conditionally,</hi> The first cannot be said, for the
reasons already adduced militate against that. Nor can it be said, that He
died for all <hi>Conditionally:</hi> for then either he died to purchase Life &amp; Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all upon Condition of their performance of something proposed as a
Condition; or to purchase salvation, and all the meanes thereunto or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
thereof, Conditionally, But neither of these can be said. Therefore
&amp;c. The <hi>major</hi> is clear from this; that the enumeration is full, &amp; noother
way can this Conditional Redemption be conceived or explained. The <hi>minor</hi>
may be thus confirmed, The <hi>first</hi> way cannot be said, to wit, that life and
salvation was purchased to all, upon a Condition to be by them performed,
that is, upon Condition of their believing: for either this Condition is in
the power of every son of <hi>Adam,</hi> or not: if it be not in their power (as all
but <hi>Pelagians</hi> will confess) then this Redemption is no Redemption; for a
Redemption of Captives upon a Condition impossible to them, is as good
as no Redemption. Nor can the <hi>last</hi> way be said, to wit, that Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
and all the Conditions &amp; Means thereof were Conditionally pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased;
for what can be assigned as the Condition of these Conditions?
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:104357:282"/>
And though there were a Condition of the Lords working of Faith assigned,
(which yet we finde not in Scripture) yet that would not help the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for that Condition of Faith would it self be a mean to salvation,
and so purchased Conditionally, upon another Condition, and that other
Condition must be purchased upon another Condition, &amp; so <hi>in infinitum:</hi>
which is absurd.</p>
               <p>As also (35.) this is considerable, That the asserting of Universal Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
goeth not alone; but there are several other Universalities also affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and maintained, either as Consequences, or Concomitants, or
Grounds thereof, which the Scripture knoweth not: such as these. (1.) An
Universal Love &amp; Philanthropie, towards all &amp; every one, without any
difference: which they lay down, as the ground of the Sending of Christ to
die for all indiscriminatly. (2.) An Universal Will in God to save all, which
they call an <hi>Antecedent Will;</hi> and hold forth as a Velleity, or a wish &amp; desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
that all might be saved; as if God could not effectuat whatever he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
or could have a velleity towards any thing, which either he could not,
or would not effectuat. (3.) An Universal Predestination conditional; which
expression <hi>Amerald</hi> used untill the Synods in <hi>France</hi> did disswade him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.
(4.) An Universal gift of all to Christ, or an Universal gift of Christ
to all; that is, a Will &amp; purpose that Christ should lay down his life for all,
and Redeem all; at least Conditionally. (5.) An Universal Justification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional.
And why not also an Universal Salvation conditional? (6.) An
Universal Covenant of Grace made with all mankinde in <hi>Adam,</hi> wherein is
a free universal deed of gift of Christ first, and of Pardon, Spirit &amp; Glory,
in &amp; by him, to all Mankinde without exception, upon condition of acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance;
as also an offer of Faith, Repentance, Conversion, with all the
consequences thereof. (7.) An Universal will in God to call into this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and unto the Participation of the benefites thereof, all &amp; every man.
(8.) An Universal execution of this will, or promulgation of this Gospel or
New Covenant, unto all &amp; every one, by common favours &amp; benefites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on all, whereby all are called to believe in a merciful pardoning God;
and all have abundance of Mercies &amp; Meanes of Recovery &amp; of life; for
the Lord now governeth the world, only on termes of grace. (9.) Upon this
followeth an Universal Command to all men to use certaine duties &amp; meanes
for their Recovery by Faith &amp; Repentance. (10.) An Universal pardon of
the first Sin, so far, at least, that no man shall perish for the meer Original
sin of Nature alone, unless he adde the rejection of grace. (11.) Hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
an Universal Judgment &amp; Sentence on all, in the great day, only
according as they have performed the new Gospel Conditions. (12.) So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
also adde an Universal Subjective Grace, whereby all are enabled to
performe the conditions of the new Covenant. (13.) Universal proper
Fruits &amp; Effects of this death, whereby all the outward favours, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
enjoy are said to be purchased for them by Christ: &amp; why not also what
Devils enjoy?</p>
               <p>Finally (36.) This assertion of Universal Redemption layeth the ground of,
&amp; maketh way to a new frame of the Covenant of Grace, quite overturning
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:104357:283"/>
its Nature, and transforming it into a new Covenant of Works, making it
one &amp; the same with that, as to kinde, &amp; only to differ, as to the change
of Conditions to be performed by man: for as, in the first Covenant, <hi>Adam</hi>
was to obtain right to, &amp; possession of life promised, in, by, for, through and
upon the account of his fulfilling the Condition of perfect obedience, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by the Lord; so, in the New Covenant, man is to obtaine &amp; acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
to himself a right to &amp; possession of the Life promised, in, by, for, through
&amp; upon the account of his performance of the Condition of Faith &amp; new
obedience, now imposed in the Gospel; and all the difference is, that in
stead of perfect obedience to the Law, which was the Condition of the first
Covenant, now Faith &amp; sincere Gospel Obedience is made the Condition:
And thus we can no less he said to be justified by works of the Law, or which
we do, then <hi>Adam</hi> should have been said to have been so justified, had he
stood; and this justification giveth as great ground of boasting unto man,
&amp; of making the reward of debt, &amp; not of grace, as justification by the
first Covenant would have done; for though it be said, that Christ hath
made satisfaction to justice, for the breach of the first Law, &amp; thereby pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
to all, upon Condition, Justification &amp; Salvation; yet this remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not the difficulty; for what is purchased by Christ's death is made Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
&amp; Common to all; and so can be nothing (according to our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries)
but a putting of all men, <hi>in statu quo prius,</hi> in case to run &amp; obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
the prize for themselves; as God's absolute free love put <hi>Adam</hi> in that
Condition at first: Christ's death (though thereby, as they say, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
the New Covenant, which with them is the chiefe, if not the only,
effect &amp; fruit of his Death &amp; Merites) can be no more, than a very remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
ground of Right to Life &amp; Salvation, unto any person; for it is made
Universal &amp; Common to all, so that all have equal share therein, &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
thereby; man himself, by performing the new Conditions, only
making the difference; so that the immediat ground of the Right to life,
which any have, is their own Faith &amp; Obedience, or performance of the
New Covenant-conditions. Whereby it is manifest, that as to our Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and Immediat Right to Happiness, we are to plead our own works,
&amp; lean to them, as our ground whereupon we may stand &amp; appear before
God's Tribunal; and upon the account thereof plead for the crown, as our
due debt, having now run for it, &amp; performed the Condition, agreed u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
and so sing praises to our selves, in stead of singing praises to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.
Hence the Righteousness, wherein we must appear before God,
is not the Righteousness of Christ, but our own; for the Righteousness of
Christ, say they, is only imputed in regard of its effects, whereof the new
Covenant is the All, or the Chiefe; and so that doth not become the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of any man, nor can be said to be imputed to any man properly,
(which also they assert) but his own Faith is only imputed properly (which
also they plead for) as his Righteousness; not, as a Way, Medium, or
Methode, of Gospel-Righteousness (especially when Gospel-Obedience
is adjoyned) The Righteousness of Christ being thereby only accounted to
be imputed, in that it hath procured, that our own Gospel Righteousness,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:104357:283"/>
Faith &amp; new Obedience, shall be imputed to us, as our Immediat Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
&amp; the ground of our Right to Glory. What accord is betwixt
this frame of the Covenant of Grace, &amp; that way of justification held forth
by <hi>Socinians, Arminians</hi> &amp; <hi>Papists,</hi> the learned will easily see; and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
it is to the Covenant of Grace held forth in the Gospel, &amp; hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
&amp; maintained by the orthodox, every one acquainted therewith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ignorant; &amp; it is obvious, how opposite this is unto what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 8, 9. <hi>yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss, for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the knowledge of Christ Iesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of
all things, and do count them but dung; that I may win Christ, and be found in
him, not having mine own Righteousness, which is of the Law; but that which is
through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by Faith.</hi> And <hi>Tit.</hi>
3: 5, 6, 7. <hi>Not by works of Righteousness, which we have done, but according to
his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy
Ghost which he shed on us abundantly, through Iesus Christ our Saviour: that being
justified by his grace, we should be made he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs, according to the hope of eternal life.</hi>
And Rom. 3: 20, 21, 22, 24. <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law there shall no flesh
be justified—but now the Righteousness of God without the Law is manifest—even
the Righteousness of God, which is by Faith of Iesus Christ, unto all and upon all
them that believe—being justified freely by his grace, through the Redemption, that
is in Iesus Christ.</hi> And many other places. It is no less clear, how hereby the
true nature of justifying faith, and Gospel Obedience is perverted: &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
how dangerous this is, if put into practice; or if men act &amp; live according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
every serious exercised Christian knoweth.</p>
