            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <q>Muliere bonâ omnia comprehenduntur.</q>
            <l>A Vertuous Woman, Oye Gods! who dare</l>
            <l>Preſume to ſpeak or write her Character?</l>
            <l>Or what Pot-Poet dare attempt to vex</l>
            <l>By curſed Libels this ſo glorious Sex?</l>
            <l>A Sex that was by Heav'ns Decrees deſign'd</l>
            <l>To be (and is) the beſt of Human kind.</l>
            <l>For Woman has a vertue that's ſublime,</l>
            <l>Above the Battery of Fate or Time.</l>
            <l>And in this Sex there certain Rays are found,</l>
            <l>Which not one Grace can make, but all compound.</l>
            <l>In wit, modeſty, and vertuous deeds,</l>
            <l>This moſt Divine Celeſtial Sex exceeds.</l>
            <l>A beauty alſo, not to Art in Debt,</l>
            <l>Rather agreeable, Divine, than great.</l>
            <l>An Eye likewiſe, wherein at once do meet</l>
            <l>The beams of trueſt kindneſs, and of wit.</l>
            <l>The faireſt Tulips, and the Roſe o'th Buſh,</l>
            <l>Do draw their Tincture from her Lip and Bluſh.</l>
            <l>An undiſſembled modeſt Innocence,</l>
            <l>Apt not to give, nor yet to take offence.</l>
            <l>A Face that's modeſt, charming, and ſerene,</l>
            <l>A ſober; vertuous, and yet lively meen.</l>
            <l>As many Diamonds together lye,</l>
            <l>And dart one luſtre to amaze the Eye;</l>
            <l>So Woman is that bright Etherial Ray,</l>
            <l>Which many Stars doth in one Light diſplay:</l>
            <l>For in her Face ſhe captives modeſty,</l>
            <l>Which is completed in Divinity.</l>
            <l>Her very glances ſet all Hearts on Fire,</l>
            <l>And check them if they ſhould too much aſpire.</l>
            <l>If ſhe but ſmile, no Painter e're would take</l>
            <l>Another object, when he'd Mercy make.</l>
            <l>And Heav'n ſuch ſplendor hath to her allow'd,</l>
            <l>That no damn'd <hi>Mantuan</hi> can her Beauty cloud.</l>
            <l>That if ſhe frown, none would but phancy then</l>
            <l>Juſtice deſcended there to puniſh Men.</l>
            <l>Nay, her common looks, I'm aſham'd to call</l>
            <l>One ſingle Grace, they are compos'd of all:</l>
            <l>And if we Mortals could the Doctrine reach,</l>
            <l>Her very Eyes and looks do Language teach.</l>
            <l>Her Soul's the Image of the Deity,</l>
            <l>That ſtill preſerves its Native purity:</l>
            <l>Which Men can neither threat'n nor allure,</l>
            <l>Nor by their dev'liſh Characters obſcure.</l>
            <l>The Innocence that in her Heart doth dwell,</l>
            <l>Angels themſelves can only parallel.</l>
            <l>Such conſtancy of modeſt witty Law</l>
            <l>Guides all her Actions, that all Men may draw</l>
            <l>From her own Soul the nobleſt precedent,</l>
            <l>Of the moſt ſafe, wiſe, vertuous Government.</l>
            <l>Oh! I muſt think the reſt, for who can write,</l>
            <l>Or into words confine what's infinite?</l>
            <l>For ſtriving to deſcribe quite to the end</l>
            <l>Of her, that all the World doth comprehend,</l>
            <l>Is a moſt wild Ambition; ſo for me</l>
            <l>To draw her Picture, is flat Lunacy.</l>
            <l>But yet by what's here writ, the World may ſee</l>
