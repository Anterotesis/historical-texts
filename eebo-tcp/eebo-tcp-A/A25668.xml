            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>SAmuel Iohnson</hi> having been Arraigned, upon an Information, for high Misdemeanours, in Writing, Printing, and Publishing two Scandalous and Seditious Libels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thereto pleading <hi>Not Guilty</hi>; was, by a Rule of Court, brought again to the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench, Westminster</hi>; on <hi>Monday, Iune</hi> the 21<hi>th.</hi> in Order to take his Tryal: When, as a <hi>Iury</hi> of Knights and Gentlemen of the County of <hi>Surry,</hi> being Sworn, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was read; the Substance of which was, That he, the Prisoner, had, in the Parish of St. <hi>George's Southwark,</hi> on the 25<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> in the Second Year of his Majesties Reign, maliciously and designedly Published two Pernicious, Scandalous, and Seditious Libels, to raise and stir up Sedition and Rebellion in his Majesties Liege-Subjects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Title of One being, <hi>A Humble and Hearty Address to all the Protestants in the Present Army.</hi> And the Other, <hi>Viz. The Opinion is this, That Resistance may be used, in case our Religion and Rights should be Invaded.</hi> Both of which were therein specified at large; tending to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them from their Duty and Allegiance, and to excite and stir up the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to Mutiny and Rebellion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After this, the Information was, by the King's Council, opened to the <hi>Iury,</hi> as to the Nature and Circumstances, together with the evil Consequences that might attend such bold and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Attempts: which being rendred largely and exactly as to the Particulars mentioned in the said Information, wherewith the Prisoner was Charged, they proceeded to call their Witnesses to prove the Fact.</p>
            <p>And <hi>First,</hi> Mr. <hi>Belamy,</hi> at the <hi>Three Brushes</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> being Sworn, gave Evidence, That coming acquainted, sometime since, with the Prisoner; and about a Fortnight before <hi>Whitsuntide</hi> last, discoursing with him, the second of these Libels was mentioned; and soon after, he sent him a Box with some Rheams of them in it, to be dispersed; and gave him notice, that he had a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Paper in the Press; and withal, a Caution not to Publish those he had sent before, till he had received that which proved to be the former Libel before mentioned. And further, That about six or eight Months before that, the Prisoner had sent him other Libels to disp<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>se; and being shewed the Libels mentioned, in the Information, he deposed they were the same that had been sent him. His Man likewise gave Evidence, That he had received a Box nailed up, but could give no account o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> what was in it, as to Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ann Whitny,</hi> sometimes Servant to the Prisoner, being Sworn, gave Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, That by her Master's o<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Mistresses Direction, she was not certain which,

she took a Porter, and caused him to carry a Box, wherein one of the Libels men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (<hi>Viz.</hi> the second) was inclosed to Mr. <hi>Belamy</hi>; and that she had, by the like Order, carried other Papers loose, some of which were the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> &amp;c. And being asked by the Prisoner, how she knew that; her reply was, That she knew it, insomuch that she had read the Title, and very well remembred it.</p>
            <p>The Porter that carried the Box gave Evidence, that the Maid had hi<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed him to carry a Box to the Three Brushes, and that she went with him, and paid him according to Agreement, and that he took it up in <hi>Spittle-fields.</hi> After this, the Messenger who searched the Prisoner's Lodging with the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Sunderla<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi>'s Warrant, being Sworn, gave Evidence, That he found a Paper in Writing upon a Table or Shelf, which appeared in Court to be part of the Copy, or the same with the Paper, Intituled, <hi>The Opin<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp;c. He Swearing upon Sight thereof, that it was the same he found in the Prisoner's Lodging: Then was the Book of the Vestry, or Parish Affairs of St. <hi>Pauls Covent-Garden</hi> produced; wherein the Prisoner sometimes past had given an Acquittance for Money received, as an Assistant Curate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being compared with the Paper, seemed not to differ in the Hand; but no other Evidence appeared in that Case, than that the Book had been always kept in the Vestry, and for the most part under Lock and Key; and it being put to the Prisoner, he did not greatly deny it: when, for a further Confi<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>Iohn Darby</hi> a Printer, and his Wife, were Sworn; the former deposing, That he had Printed a Book for the Prisoner from the Manuscript, and that Hand was very like that of the Libel produced in Court, but he had never seen him write, and therefore could not be positive that that Manuscript was his own Hand: As for his Wife, her Evidence was, That the Prisoner pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her some Money, she had given him an Acquittance, but that, as she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, he wrote all but her Name; for going up Stairs, he soon returned with an Acquittance, which she Subscribed. One Mrs. <hi>Culeford</hi> and her Husband, who appeared to be concerned in the management of the Libels, were called, but the former only appeared, and an Information being exhibited against her, she pleaded, <hi>Not Guilty.</hi> This being what materially was given in Evidence for the King, the Prisoner had leave to make his Defence; who after some Discourse, not pertinent to the matter, alledged, That he had been confined, and had not had opportunity to prepare for his Defence, as not having leave to go to his Council: To which the Court replied, that he had leave upon the Motion made on his behalf, to send for Council, and that they ought not to be refused com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him: Then he urged several other frivolous matters; which being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the Court, he proceeded to intimate, that he hoped, that seeing he was Indicted for a Seditious and Scandalous Libel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Iury</hi> would consider whether those Papers they had heard read, were so or no; but was told, that the <hi>Iury</hi> ought to consider it only as to the Matter of Fact, whether he was Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Writing or Publishing them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that the rest lay in the breast of the Court to consider: Thereupon he urged, that though they might be sent, yet it was no Publication, as it was laid in the Indictment, because the Box was nailed. But being fully answered in that point, and loose Papers appearing likewise to be sent, the Council for the King summed up their Evidence to the <hi>Iury,</hi> none appearing on the behalf of the Prisoner. After which the Court gave the Charge, putting the Prisoner, as well as the <hi>Iury,</hi> in mind of the great Mischief that such Libels might occasion: And minded him likewise, that it was within a small matter of High Treason, and might have been raised to that degree, were not the Laws, and those who managed them, tender of Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After the Charge was given, the <hi>Iury</hi> withdrew, and returning within a quarter of an hour, brought in the Prisoner Guilty of the high Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour.</p>
