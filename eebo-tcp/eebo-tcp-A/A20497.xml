            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

all his titles are Superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, &amp; this very seldome but in presence, and to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few but such as out of whom he may sucke some commodity.

And this for the most part is the signe of a flatterer. Sometimes also it is the marke of a foole. This

flattery is the sweet baite of enuie, the cloake of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, the great pestilence of the world, a monster vgly to behold if it might be seene: very dangerous to trust, if it might bee knowne.

is no flesh, no pilgrime creepe where there is no Crosse, so there is no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasite, or flatterer wil lurke where he findes no gaine. And in these flatterers you may obserue two great faults: The first is, whatsoeuer they praise, say, or do, they do it <hi>ficte, non vere,</hi> fainedly not from the heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are a dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling &amp; vnthankful kind of people. Secondly what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they say or do, they doe it not to the glorie of God, or good of their neighbour, but to their owne priuate ends: and in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17476:18"/>
this respect they are ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile. And certainly, these kind of people are most hurtfull &amp; wicked: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could wish that all men were of <hi>Achilles</hi> mind who as <hi>Homer</hi> reportes, <hi>Hated not the gates of Hell so much as he did them that spake otherwise then they thinke.</hi> But what minde soeuer we are of wee had need thus to hate them: for they are of this nature that though they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected they will please; though they be thrust out of doores they will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued againe: they are such as hang vpon vs,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17476:18"/>
while our fortunes bee good, but if they change then they leaue vs, and therefore they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and wicked companions.

Wherfore it is very dangerous to beleeue a flatterer: for vnder the person of a sweete friend he is a most bitter enemy, who increases all vices, &amp; settles them in vs, either by consent, approbation, or extenuation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as calling anger seuerity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fury: zeale, rashnesse: boldnesse: pride, fortitude: pusillanimitie,

humility: couetousnesse, parcimony, or the like. These are the chaffe that God will separate from the good corne at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day: and these kind of men we need carefully to auoid as hypocrites, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers, and impostures. These are the diuels An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that can transforme themselues into Angels of light; such as onely haue the outward shew of good, but are most vile, and dangerous. This flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery hath onely in the frontispice of it, the name of friendship for it is onely outwardly in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17476:25"/>

And it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practise amongest them, rather to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to imitate the vices of those men with whom they haue to doe. And as tyranny is hidden in the secret bowels of enuie, so is enuie cloked vnder the filed phrase of flattery, and therfore may be very well compared to the Crocodile of <hi>Nilus,</hi> or to the Syrens of the Seas, the one weping &amp; mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the other singing &amp; laughing: the one with mone: the other with mirth studie how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy

vs: still conforming themselues to that which they take, to be most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vnto vs. And of this kinde were King <hi>Xerxes</hi> flatterers, who marching towards the Greeks with a huge armie of soldiers, called some of this sort vnto him; and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them what thing was most to be feared in his iourney; <hi>One</hi> saith, I doe feare that when the Greekes do heare of your power they wil flie &amp; not abide your band: <hi>another</hi> said, he doubted all <hi>Greece</hi> was not able to lodge nor receiue them into their

The thing that I most feare (<hi>saith he</hi>) is this, thath these flatterers wil deceiue you. And this indeed is most certaine, for his base mind is well matched with a mercenary tongue, which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17476:26"/>
is a willing slaue to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans eare: and cares not how true, but how pleasingly he speaks: his art is nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull cosenage, whose tales are smothed &amp; gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with periury, whose scope is to make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fools in causing them to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, still tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d til death.

Neglecting the truth and carried away with the self opinion of our selues; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as it were testimony of our good parts, not from our owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, but from others reports.

and dissembled perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for poison is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs but in a sweet po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: We like well to be praised, but it would bee farre better if wee would seek to deserue those prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17476:34"/>
chiefest vices, as our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test vertues: and account vertue to be vice: so that it is vnpossible for any good man to winne his fauour; from whence as I said before, this Prouerbe comes: <hi>Obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit.</hi> The reason is this, by reason that now we for the most part do seek such as please our humors and blame vs least, &amp; contemne the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for he alwaies praises his Lords vice with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of some ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue neare vnto it: but the true friend neuer seeks to smooth vp our faults, but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17476:34"/>
laies them open vnto vs, thereby that wee might more easily see our vices, and amend them. Happy are they that haue such friends, and they most vnhappy that giue eare vnto these false deceauers: Wherefore we neede to withstand it in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for it is so dangerous that whomsoeuer is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be soothed vp, it hurts not only for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but leaues the relikes and remainder of it in our minds, that although they be gone from vs, yet still the ill remaines with vs, like them who heare Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,

though that be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet carry with them the harmonious sweetnes of the sound, that takes impression in their minds euen so the wicked and flattering praises of flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, remaine longer with vs then the time of our hearing them: and as it is not easie to put out of our minds a sweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant sound, and although sometimes wee forget it, yet oftentimes it comes into our head againe: so fareth it with flatterers, wee should therefore bee deafe to their ill voices, &amp; auoide them in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17476:35"/>
We had all need to bee carefull of this, both fathers and children: for they waying the old age of the one, and youth of the other, present to both by their lewd &amp; wicked cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

to keepe such out of their society and company; for there are no kinde of men doe more hurt to them then these flatterers.

These kinde of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17476:37"/>
men are like the Dog of a certaine sheepheard, who was set by his Master to keepe sheepe, and before him seemed to bee very carefull in the looking to them, and therefore by the sheepheard was kept very well to the end hee should not neede to feede vpon his sheepe, and by him was put only in trust: and yet for al this the dog at his fittest time killed, &amp; stale the sheep; The sheep heard at last found it out, and threatned to kill his dog; who thus pleaded for himselfe, saying, you will not hurt, me for I am
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17476:38"/>
one of your houshold ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, you should rather be reuenged of the wolfe, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually doth you this hurt and dammage: Nay (quoth the sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard) I thinke you more worthy of punishment then hee, for he professes open warre vnto me, but you vnder pretext of loue and friendship, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally decrease my flocke. By this fable you may see that they farre more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue to be punished, who hurt vs vnder shew of loue, then they who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce publike enmity vnto vs: the one we know
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17476:38"/>
his ill mind vnto vs, but the other we take for our friend, though indeed he bee farre otherwise, and comes no more neare it, then like glasse a thing of no regard, which resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles christall a matter of great worth; so he by his flattery which is vile and wicked, only imitates friendship which is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deare: and now the reason why flattery is so hardly discerned is this because that in euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind it is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singly entermingled with friendship, though if you truly vnmaske him they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17476:39"/>
haue no resembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And yet for all this it is strange to see how wonderfully wise and great men are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome by this and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. As for example <hi>Nero,</hi> who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Tyridates</hi> his enimy and Prince of Armenia, was conquered by <hi>Corbulon,</hi> and brought vnto him; Hee falling downe vpon his knees, said, <hi>I Tyridates nephew of Arsacus, &amp; brother to King Vologesus and Pacorus am your seruant &amp; came hither to worship you my Lord and God as the Sunne: for you are my fate and fortune.</hi> This his flattery did so far

worke with <hi>Nero,</hi> that he did not only restore him to his former Kingdome, but also sent him away la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with many giftes, which as my author saith, amounted to the summe of <hi>two million of crownes.</hi>

For these great men, it now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies being such a means to get credit and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, shall haue their kinsfolkes, friends, and

principall officers, who professe this mysterie, and such as they could not well auoid if they would.

comes into their heads, they will headlong goe through with all, and whatsoeuer they doe by these flatterers, you are sure to be soothed vp, so that these are his only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, councellors and friends, &amp; none but these or such as these, custome hath brought him to that habit, that he will endure to haue about him: who vnder the shape of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity beare sway and rule, for who is now more made off then hee that ought least to bee estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? Who is now more trusted then he that decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

These kind of men are not only dangerous

to great men, but women also had neede to haue an antidote against them: for to them this is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dangerous, and no more ordinary way to corrupt their chastity the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this means, by feeding and entertayning them with the commendation of their personage, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, behauiour, discourse, or the like: for they by their naturall inclination are full of vanity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of praise.

vipers ought to be extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and rooted out. The Citty <hi>Troy</hi> which <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi> in ten whole yeares could not subdue, poore <hi>Sinon</hi> with his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery allured the minde of King <hi>Priamus,</hi> deceiued the Nobles, and intised the Cittizens by his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation, to their vtter confusion and ruine: That auncient and renowmed Citty of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when King <hi>Darius</hi> with all the power of <hi>Persia,</hi> lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g wars, losse of men &amp; his owne strength &amp; force, was not able to vanquish any part of it, then <hi>Sopyrus</hi> a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen

of <hi>Phrenitius.</hi> The people of <hi>Samos</hi> were deceiued by false <hi>Apollonius: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus</hi> was beguiled by the flattery of <hi>Paris: Dion</hi> of <hi>Syracusa</hi> was slaine by his flattering friend <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>: Thus you may see how flattery and adulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to Princes, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, vtter ruine, deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and decay. By flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the Prince, they leade and keep him in his vices and errors, to his great shame: by flattering of the people they make themselues popular, and so by that meanes striue to deuise a way, to set
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17476:43"/>
themselues vp, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of their lawfull Prince: Therfore Princes neede to be very carefull, neither to suffer flatterers about themselues: nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues popular by flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the people. VVhat a shame was it thinke you to <hi>Edward</hi> the second, to suffer such a base fellow as <hi>Pierce Gauestone,</hi> wholly to rule and gouerne him? what credit was it for the same King to suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be led away to all wickednesse, by two lewd &amp; wicked fellowes, <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> both the Father and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17476:44"/>
the Sonne? But Princes must haue a double care, not only to keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from being flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but their people also: and to obserue who seeke popularity of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for this is a true max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, that whatsoeuer sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect doth seeke popularity doth neuer desire it with any good and honest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. VVhat was <hi>Absolons</hi> meanes in his treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his father, was it not his making himselfe popular, by flattering of the people? if you reade the story you will say so: <note n="*" place="margin">2. <hi>Samuel cap.</hi> 15. From the second Verse to the sixth.</note> Vers. 2. <hi>And Absolon rose
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17476:44"/>
vp early and stood hard by the entring in of the gate, and euery man that had any matters came to the King for iudgement. Him did</hi> Absolon <hi>call vnto him and say, Of what Citie art thou? And he answered, thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant is of one of the Tribes of Israel.</hi> 3. <hi>Then</hi> Absolon <hi>said vnto him, See, thy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are good and righteous; but there is no man deputed of the King to heare thee.</hi> 4. Absolon <hi>said moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, Oh that I were made Iudge in the land, that euery man which hath any matter or controuersie, might come to me, that I might doe him

iustice.</hi> 5. <hi>And when any man came neere vnto him and did him obeysance, he put forth his hand, and tooke him and kissed him.</hi> 6. <hi>And on this manner did</hi> Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon <hi>to all Israell that came to the King for iudgement: so</hi> Absolon <hi>stole the hearts of the men of Israell.</hi> What was it that raised <hi>Caesar</hi> to that great height and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that he was in? <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> reports, that it was by his exceeding great popularity, in winning the hearts of the people. What was it that set vp <hi>Henry Bullingbrooke</hi> in stead of the lawfull King?
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17476:45"/>
Was it not his flattering and soothing vp of the people? What was it that set vp <hi>Richard the third,</hi> that Tyrant and vsurper? Was it not his flattering, &amp; pleasing of the people? the like being done by his friends, the flattering Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> and a Sermon of Doctor <hi>Shawe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you see you shall hardly finde any treason eyther against Prince, or State, but this was the chiefe way and meanes: and this being so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; as I said before, so I say againe, euery King
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17476:46"/>
that desires his safetie, neede to be as carefull as he can, not to suffer any subiect to make himselfe popular, by flattering of the people. How dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous this is to all estates, Prince and people, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and Citie, man and woman, it hath already beene shewed: therefore we had all neede to take very good heede in auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them; which if wee haue an open eare, is hard to be done, for then wee are sure to bee catched. And of this indeede wee need to be most carefull: for,<note place="margin">

               </note> as the Poet saith, <hi>Vile

poyson lurketh vnder the sweetest Honie.</hi> And if we doe not auoyde them in time, they wil so encrease vpon vs, that when wee would wee cannot: and yet for al this, we stil loue to be flattered, and stil are more desirous of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations by others praises, then to deserue them in our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. And if yet wee will not leaue these flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, we shall in time be made such fooles, as to thinke our selues worthy of those praises vhich are so vniustly laid vpon vs. And therefore by howe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17476:47"/>
much the greater we bee, the more neede wee haue to looke into and auoide these Flatterers, and with a deafe eare to saile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their songs, as the entisements or daunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rockes of <hi>Syrens,</hi> which ascrib those things vnto vs that wee neither ought to take nor deserue, then which there can bee nothing more pestiferous to great men: wherefore wee should rather heare those that admonish vs of our duetie, and put vs in minde that wee are but men, which is the part of a true friend, then to lend
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17476:47"/>
our eares to such impost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors &amp; deceiuers as these, who as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

Now they who for all this will still take delight to heare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues Flattered, I can say of such no otherwise then Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> speakes of them, <hi>Ignauiae videtur,</hi>

and effeminate spirit. But now aboue all times wee neede to bee most carefull in taking heede to them, for they are come to that excellency in their profession, that they will colour their Flatterie so with the shew of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, they will vsurpe the Offices, the voice, nay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen carie the name and counterfeit of Amitie so artificially, that you will say it is the same they stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to content and please, to honor, commend, and acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate themselues to the humours of men; nay it takes vpon it the

highest part of friendship, free reprehension. Hee will seeme to exceede in loue to him he flattereth, whereas indeede there is nothing more opposite to loue, not iniurie, not professed enmitie, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, it is the plague and poyson of true amity, and therefore auoide it: it hath with it these compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, hatred, deceipt, trecherie, lying, couse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and hatred of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie. Wherfore we should haue our cares shutte to these Flatterers, and as the ancient wise men did barre such from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17476:49"/>
of Princes; so wee should barre them our companie, and follow S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his counsell,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Offic. lib.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que adulantes nos, nec adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landos cuiquam exhibere, alterum enim calli ditatis est vanitatis alterum.</hi> Let vs neither Flatter, nor suffer our selues to be Flattered. For the one is signe of craft, the other of folly, and what a happie man is he that neither Flattereth nor is Flattered, deceiues nor is deceiued; neither doeth hurt, nor receiues hurt? Happy indeede shal we bee if wee vnderstand this, more happie if wee
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17476:49"/>
repell it, most happy if we be of Saint <hi>Austines</hi> mind, not to thinke those hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest, who haue most prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but those who deserue those praises. But nowe that we doe not in seeking to auoide Flatterers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect friends, or in hoping to get a friend entertaine a Flatterer, Let vs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how they may bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the one from the other. The first thing, the Flatterer doeth is this, to insinuate himselfe into the councell and affaires of him whom he Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and as much as lies in his power, to keepe him
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17476:50"/>
from being inward with any other, and to haue none about him, but such as are of his own stampe, voyde of all honesty: and then as a shadow fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes a man continually, whatsoeuer hee doth, so will he follow and affect, whatsoeuer it be that his Lord applies himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. He hath salues for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery sore, to hide them, not to heale them, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion for euery face, Sinne hath not any more artificial <hi>Broker,</hi> nor more impudent Baude, there is no vice hath not from him, his colour, his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17476:50"/>
And his best seruice is either to further guiltinesse, or smother it. If he grant ill things inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, and to be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, hee hath yeelded much. Let his friend say it is hot, hee wipes his forehead and vnbraceth himselfe; if cold, hee shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and cals for a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer garment: when hee walkes with his friend hee sweares to him, that no man else is looked on, no man talked off. That whomsoeuer hee vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to looke and nod to, is graced enough, &amp; that he is ignorant of his owne
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17476:51"/>
worth lest he shold be too happie; Whatsoeuer hee saith he yeeldes, giue his consent and approbation, though it bee to things that are out of his owne beliefe. Thus by all these things before specified, you may find him to be a Flatterer, who as <hi>Suidas</hi> saith, is full of deceipt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice, and a great enemy to all Religion, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to Christianitie: and that you may the better discerne him, doe but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, first whether those he commend bee present, or absent; you shall finde him alwayes pleasing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17476:51"/>
your face, neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the absent, but for the most part backe-biting &amp; slandring them. Secondly, do but obserue whether those thinges which hee approues so much in vs, hee allow in himselfe, or not; if you set any other then your selfe to aske him, you shal find that he is of a cleane contrary minde, vnlesse he know that he be set on by your appointment. Thirdly, obserue whether the praises they bestow vpon you, for such, and such things, they onely giue to you &amp; no others,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17476:52"/>
or to you and all others; you shall finde that those things they commend you for, they will discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in others, and those things they commend in others, they will dislike in you. Fourthly, obserue whether whatsoeuer wee say or doe, they holde the same opinion; and for that giue vs praises and commendations, and you shall finde that let vs now say or doe one thing, we shall haue their praise and commendation for it; and sometime after let vs be of a quite contrary opinion, or doe quite contrarily,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17476:52"/>
wee shall still haue their commendations: And lastly, but looke into your owne consciences, you shal find that those things for the w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they so hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extoll you, are vile and wicked, and such things as, notwithstanding their commendations, you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repent and are asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of.</p>
            <p>Moreouer these Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers vsually set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to followe such as are great in the time, with such you shall finde him alwayes: and though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps before he were a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of this mans grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17476:53"/>
enemie, yet if hee see this mans fortune to goe higher and that any thing is to be gotten by leauing his olde friend, he will not only leaue him, but turne to his enemy, and do him all the mischiefe that hee can: but for his new great Master, whatsoeuer he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likes or dislikes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues or disauows, loues or hates, he is of the same minde. Againe, at any publicke Assembly, where many are to speake of some one matter, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the flatterer spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, it is to please some priuate person, not for the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17476:53"/>
publicke profite; making sure that his great Master shal haue first spoken, that he may be sure not to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from him, but that whatsoeuer he hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, be it good or badde, may by him bee applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and if that in any thing that he hath spoken before, any thing hath slipt from him that hath not pleased, he thanks his Reformer, and his note is quite changed; and as it were out of his great loue will extoll this man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond measure, for things that peraduenture deserue reproofe: and do like him
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17476:54"/>
that went about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that he should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer die, but be carried to heauen with his naturall bodie in the flesh. Or like <hi>Varus Seminꝰ</hi> the great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, who amongst many other his flattering spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to <hi>Augustus,</hi> said, that they who called him <hi>Caesar</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knew not his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and they that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him not <hi>Caesar,</hi> were ignorant of his humanity. This man you shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies find to be in a vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with al your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; do you but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alter your course in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17476:54"/>
shew, you shall finde him to goe as the winde doth lie; and if you change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to formes neuer so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he will change too; for he hath no vniforme aequality in all his actions and intentions, because he hath no permane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t seat of his manners, no setled opinon in any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath wholly set himselfe ouer to content and please others; no vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme course of life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is neuer like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but variable and changeable from one forme to another. But this is somewhat open
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17476:55"/>
and plaine flattery, and therefore doth the lesse hurt, because it is sooner found out and auoyded. But there are other flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers more cunning, and therefore more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. For plaine flatterie is easily discerned, as plainely to affirme or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, according as another doth the same; so that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may see this fellowe plainely, when perhaps he cannot discerne the other, who when hee flatters seemes to reproue, and when hee most flatters seemes to be most oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site against it: therefore
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17476:55"/>
this fellow we had neede to be most carefull of, and to search narrowly into all his shifts, and deuices, lest he deceiue vs. Of this sort was <hi>Agis Argiuus,</hi> a cunning flatterer, who seeing <hi>Alexander</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow great gifts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on a certaine ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous fellow, exclaimed that it was a very absurd thing for <hi>Alexander</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow giftes on such a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as this; <hi>Alexander</hi> hearing his voyce, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what he said? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede (saith hee) I must needs confesse, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to see, that all
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17476:56"/>
yee that are descended from <hi>Iupiter</hi> should be so much delighted and taken with flatterers. For as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> had <hi>Vulcan</hi> for his foole, and <hi>Hercules Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copes,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> tooke great delight in <hi>Syllanus,</hi> euen so, such as these are in account, and respected by you. <hi>Tacitus</hi> also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites a very good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a flatterer in this kinde:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tacitus.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror comming into the Senate, there rose vp a certain flatterer, who said, it was fit that euery one should speake freely, and in things belonging to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17476:56"/>
the Republique, no man ought to hold his peace. <hi>Tiberius</hi> and all the rest expected what he should say; Heare (saith he) <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> a thing that we much blame in you, though none dare confesse it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly: you spend your selfe too much for vs, wearing your bodie with daily and nightly labors, in cares for the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, neuer respecting your owne health and safety, but our good and profite. This kind of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, which comes so neere to the colour of franckenesse and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17476:57"/>
of speech, is indeede most dangerous. For who knowes not that franknesse and liberty of speech is a remedy against flattery? and it that which should be remedy against it, be vsed as a meanes to flatter withall, it cannot bee but very dangerous, and these that doe thus, if they finde out any petty faults, they keepe a great coile, and cry out against vs for them, but if wee haue neuer so many great &amp; grosse faults those they winke at. Which kind of flattery as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plutarch.</hi>
               </note> may very well be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17476:57"/>
to <hi>Hercules</hi> in a play with his great club, which shewes to bee heauy and massy, though indeede it be but light &amp; filled with nothing but wool, or such like stuffe. Euen so this kind of free speech which a flatterer vseth, will bee found to bee light and of no force to giue a blow: as for example, if your clothes be not of the new fashion, or your beard not of the new cut, your band not stiffe enough, your pecadill ill made, your cloke not brusht, or the like, here they wil find great fault with you, for
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:17476:58"/>
neglecting your self, that haue so handsome &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable a body, being so carelesse to set it forth. But say that a man should set nought by his parents, neglect his children, abuse his wife, despise his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, spend wastfully and consume his goods, none of all these would touch or moue him, here hee is mute &amp; hath not a word to say, these hee will take no knowledge of nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue: and amongst these sort of flatterers they are most cunning, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue men for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vices to those that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17476:58"/>
are in them, and so still feede them in their owne: as to a miser, if they can by any meanes spie any sparke of spending, for (as the Prouerbe saith) Whose feast so great as a misers? presently with great ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy they blame him, for his great spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and prodigality, and for that hee hath so little care of his owne estate. To a sla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derer whose plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure &amp; delight is (through spite and enuy) to backe-bite and wrong his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if so bee that at any one time he chance to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend some worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17476:59"/>
they presently in a great seeming rage say thus vnto them, This is a fault you euer haue, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d persons of no worth: why should you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend him, what good haue you euer receiued by him, or what good parts doe you know in him? and the like; againe, if there be any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance betweene friends, brethren, or kinsfolkes, they seeke not to appease or remedie it, but still stir the coles, saying thus, It is well enough, you will neuer see nor know who you are, you are the cause of all your selfe, selfe doe,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17476:59"/>
selfe haue, you were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes so plyable and so submisse toward them, that you are nowe but right serued. And thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, those vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that wee haue inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant within vs, they seeke to ingraffe and settle for euer remouing. There are some other flatterers as cunning in their kinde as these, some will not praise a man himselfe, but inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t some good thing, which he faines hee heard some body speaking of him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, which he will say he was very glad to heare, herein imitating the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricians,

who many times in their Orations vse the third person for the first; another will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent some ill which hee faines he heard spoken of you, which when hee tels you, you knowing it to be vntrue, and denying it, then hee takes liberty to praise you, falling into your commendations, shewing how farre you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were from such and such vices, as hee reports you were taxed withall; others if a man bee giuen to any vices, they will not commend them, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue them by disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17476:60"/>
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vertues, as calling temperance ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticity, and such as liue within their estates mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers; and so forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the maintayning of any vice, they thinke a man hath a mind to. One that is well conceipted of himselfe and his owne iudgement, thus they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile. They will make an errand to him for his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile in some waighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires or busines of theirs, as esteeming his wit and iudgement farre aboue their owne, and his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being heard, be it what it will, he will fall into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17476:61"/>
of him, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his counsaile &amp; opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion before any that hee hath heard. But if a man suspect this in any one, the way to finde him out is this, to giue him some ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd counsaile, &amp; he shall finde he comes prepared to commend it whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be. Therefore, all these flatterers let vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide, and bee carefull in the choise of our friends, lest in stead of an honest friend, we find a false flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, and that we be not deceiued, let vs obserue the difference betwixt them both. Friendship
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17476:61"/>
takes no pleasure to bee imployed in ill and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest actions, but in any thing that may be for the profit and good of his friend, none so willing as hee. But the flatterer is quite contrary, whose friendship is farre worse then open enmity, for from them we may get or gaine somthing, but from the flatterer nothing is to bee gotten, but reproch, mischiefe, and dammage. Therefore, it is not good to keepe such friends as shall raise themselues by our fall &amp; hurt, nor such as loue our meate and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17476:62"/>
meanes in a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree then they loue our selues; for none of these sort lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger then our purse perswades them, will bee your friends. But he that is a true friend hath his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection grounded vpon loue and vertue, and no waues of contrary ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune will alter or stir him; Where as the flatterer leaues vs in the lurch, flies to our aduersaries, and commonly is the chiefe cause of our ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. Againe, a true friend imitates not all he seeth his friend doe, nor commends any thing but
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17476:62"/>
that which is good, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a flatterer contrariwise like a Camelion that can turne himselfe to all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours but white, can frame himselfe to any thing but good. A friend orders &amp; frames all his actions to the good of his friend, but a flatterer bends all his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to his own proper good. A true friend mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly blames his friends vices in his presence, and praises his vertues in his absence; but a flatterer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies exaltes him in his presence, rather for his vices then his vertues, &amp; behinde his backe blames
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17476:63"/>
him, and defames him, makes his vaunts that hee only possesseth him, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes him at his pleasure and makes him doe what he will. The true friend serues for a healthfull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, but the flatterer is as a sweet poison. A true friend preserues a man in his estate and wealth, but a flatterer precipitates him to ruine and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Flattery for the most parte respectes it owne particular benefit, and thereby is knowne, but friendshippe seeketh not the good of it selfe. The Flatterer is diuers in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17476:63"/>
his iudgements, like waxe or a looking Glasse that receiues many formes, he is a Camelion, a Polypus, faine to praise, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise, alwayes commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating himselfe to the mind of him hee Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; A friend is firme and constant, a Flatterer vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himselfe too violently in all that hee doth in the viewe and knowledge of him hee Flattereth, euer praising and offering his seruice, <hi>Non imitatur ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citiam sed praeterit,</hi> he hath no moderation in his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise inwardly hee hath
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17476:64"/>
no affection, which are conditions quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to a true friend. A flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer alwayes giues the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie to him he Flatters, alwayes applauding ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other end then to please, whereas a true friende respectes not so much, how he may please as how hee may profit: A friend alwayes respectes, procures, and attempts that which is reason, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie and dutie. The flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer that which belongs to passion, and pleasure, and that which is already a malady in the minde of him that is flattered, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is a friend to licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17476:64"/>
and an enemie to all plaine dealing and honesty. Euery man by nature hath these two parts within him, the one part is giuen to truth and honestie, the other to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth and withall passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the true friend euer assisteth the better part in giuing counsell and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, the Flatterer apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himselfe to the other part, which is voide of reason, and full of passion, still feeding and pleasing it by deuising some vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dishonest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, that they quite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert it from the rule of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17476:65"/>
reason, and they are like some kind of meat, which neither breedeth good blood, nor engendreth spirits, nor addes vigor nor strength to any man, but all the good they doe, is either to prouoke lust, or breede some fogges &amp; rotten humours, that are neither fast nor sound: So if a man looke narrowly to a Flatterer he shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer find any good to com from him, but find them to be sowers of dissensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, breeders of enuie, exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raters of men to lewdnes, nursers of prodigalitie, perswaders to diffidence,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:17476:65"/>
and distrust in our friends, to base and seruile timidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, alwayes making vs worse, and apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ill, still soothing vs vp in our owne ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. Art thou angrie with one, punish him saith he; hast thou a minde to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, buy it and no more a doe: Desirest thou this or that wench, spare no cost for her saith hee, winne her and weare her. Suspectest thou any thing beleeue it confidently saith he: And thus he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haues himselfe still soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vs in those things, that we haue but the least
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17476:66"/>
inclination vnto. For the Office which a Flatterer seemeth to performe, hath in it nothing true, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing iust, nothing sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nothing liberall: for it desires onely to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in shamefull and dishonest actions; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship only in honest ones; a Flatterer seekes to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure vs in those thinges that are vniust: And thus you see a man cannot both be a friend and a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, that is as much as if I should say a friend and no friend, for one friend is to stand to another, to assist him in doing &amp; not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17476:66"/>
in misdoing; in consulting and not in complotting &amp; conspiring; In bearing witnesse with him of the trueth, and not in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting one of falshood: to take part with him in suffering calamitie, and not to beare him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in doing of iniury. But before I go farther I must answere two Obiections: The first is, whether it be vnpossible to praise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Flatterie, and whether it necessarily followes, that all praysers conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently must bee Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. The second is, an answere to an Obiection
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17476:67"/>
to those who think it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Flatter, because they thinke it is no sinne, and if they should aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage themselues and sinne not they see no reason why they should not vse it. But first to the former Obiection, whether it be vnpossible to please with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Flatterie: This is my opinion; that if we truely and moderatly commend any for those things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> iustly deserue praise: our praises tending to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of GOD: or good of him that is praised: that the vertue for which he is commended may increase
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17476:67"/>
in him: or for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of those that heare to the like vertues: and not for any priuate end or profit to our selus: He I say that praises thus and with these cautions cannot bee termed a Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer: For thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> commendes the <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Colossians, Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Ephesians</hi>; And as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did it to their good and Gods glorie. It was Charitie, not Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, it was the marke of true friendship, and not of fained loue. The second is to resolue the Question whither it bee a sinne or
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17476:68"/>
no: for if it were one, why doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>Giue no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, &amp;c. euen as I please all men in all things.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32.33.</note> Seeing that to please all men in al things, cannot be without Flatterie: and if it bee not a fault to dispraise an ill man, why is it not good to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend a good man? To these it may bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that neither to praise nor to please in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are Flatterie, but may bee made so by their ends and circumstances, and so S. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds himselfe in the latter ende of this verse, meaning that hee would haue vs
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17476:68"/>
please all men in euerie lawfull thing, seeking not thereby our owne glorie and profit, but the glorie of God, and good of our neighbour: And if we do thus neither pleasing nor praysing can bee called Flatterie, more then the iust reprehension of him that is faultie, can bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led detraction. And now to return againe as I haue said before, that nothing is more dangerous to a Prince and State then these deceiuers, it will not be amisse a little to shewe vnto you the curiositie of wise men in ancient time
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17476:69"/>
for the abandoning and punishing of these Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, to the intent that they might be safe, &amp; for the safetie of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and states. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would all Princes and Potentates woulde saye vnto Flatterers as <hi>Christ</hi> did to the diuell, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide Sathan,</hi> so they, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt Flatterers.</hi> And to proceede to tell you how many great &amp; good men had diuersly vsed diuers meanes to auoide these, it would aske a farre larger discourse, but a few I will now name to encourage others by their example
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17476:69"/>
to do the like; Some haue punished them by banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so did <hi>Augustus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> who were so strict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Flatterers, that if any (though hee did but extraordinarily bow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) or vsed the least flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie towards them, they were by them presently commanded to bee bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and thrust out of doores.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> no lesse strict in this point, so much feared flattery, that they banished <hi>Archilogus</hi> for his eloquence, onely in a booke he had made.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17476:70"/>
This vice also was so hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in <hi>Rome</hi> that <hi>Cato</hi> the Censor expelled thence certaine fine Orators of <hi>Athens,</hi> lest with faire speech and flattery, they should annoy the State of <hi>Rome. Sigismond</hi> the Emperour to one that extremely flattered him, gaue a boxe on the eare. Why smite you me, saith the flatterer? Why bite you me, saith the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror? There was a certaine Nobleman of Moscouia, who for some crime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imprisoned, in hope of his pardon and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, fained that he dreampt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17476:70"/>
the King of Poland to be taken prisoner, &amp; brought captiue to the Duke of Moscouia. The Duke hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this, and knowing it proceeded from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to flatter him, commaunded he should bee kept more close pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, til he saw the euent of his dreame. <hi>Suetonius</hi> reports, that <hi>Caligula</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling home a certaine man banished in <hi>Tiberiꝰ</hi> time, giuing him his liberty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him what hee did all the time of his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment? I did nothing (saith hee) but pray that <hi>Tiberius</hi> might die, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17476:71"/>
you succeede. For this his flattery the Emperour commaunded, he should presently be put to death. After this sort <hi>Dauid</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the yong man that brought news of <hi>Saul</hi> and his childrens death; who desiring to flatter King <hi>Dauid,</hi> was by him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to bee put to death. Wherfore if Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will auoide these their vndoers, let them shewe how little they desire their prayses, and what small confidence they put in them; as <hi>Canutus</hi> King of this Iland did; who, as <hi>Polidor Virgil</hi> reportes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 8.</note>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:17476:71"/>
walking not farre from <hi>Southampton,</hi> and hauing his souldiers about him, they applauded him, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him King of kings, commander both of Sea and land: the King ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at this flattery, and being willing to shew how litle he was addicted thereunto, commaunded himselfe to be stript, and sate downe close to the water, saying vnto the waues, I charg you touch not my feete; they after their ordinary course, beat vpon the shoare, and washed him. He presently came backe, and said, You
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17476:72"/>
call me King of kings, and Lord of Sea and land, and yet I cannot commaund these waues from touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me. Wherefore you see it is no mortall that deserues that title, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all things are gouerned: Wherfore him alone let vs worship and praise, who is indeed King of kings, Lord of Heauen, and Earth, and Sea, and euery thing, and let vs confesse him alone to be, &amp; besides him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse no other. To such as these <hi>Homers</hi> verse would be a good Antidote:
<q>Nullum ego sum numen.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17476:72"/>
quid me immortalibꝰ aequas?</q>
            </p>
            <p>For indeede if wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the end of a flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, hee neuer cares how falsly or vniustly he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses you, so he may please and gaine well. Such as these were the flatterers of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who perswaded him, that he was the sonne of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>: but one day in his wars, being hurt, he said, <hi>Omnes iurat me esse Iouis filium, sed hoc vuluus me hominem esse clamant.</hi> You all sweare that I am the sonne of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> but this wound shewes, that I am but a man. We know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17476:73"/>
this, it may be a great remedy, if we to keep our selues that we be not prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, doe but consider how false and deceitefull they are, euen in this respect; that for those things that deserues greatest repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, they attribute most commendation: and when they should blame vs for ryote, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend our temperance; when we deserue to bee blamed for folly, they praise our wit: and if we wel obserue how many of our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est actions they applaud for vertues, our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science will tell vs, that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17476:73"/>
they are but Impostors and deceiuers. And if we will be free from them, let vs say to such, as <hi>Seneca</hi> counsels, <hi>Vos dicitis me esse prudentem ego autem scio quam multa inutilia concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscam, nocitura optem,</hi> you call me wise, but it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; for I finde that I couet many things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and wish for many thinges that are hurtfull. And this will be a great remedy against it, if wee can but perceiue how they flatter vs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our vices vertues, and commending vs for such things, as deserue no
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:17476:74"/>
no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendations. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs be carefull in the obseruance of those things they praise vs for, whether they be in vs or no, or whether they speak to humor vs, &amp; not from our desert, or whether they praise vs for such things as deserue truely to be praised, or for their owne profite.</p>
            <p>Therefore consider well thy selfe with thy selfe, &amp; let vs not bee such fooles as to iudge of our selues by the opinion of others, within thy selfe behold well thy selfe, and if thou wilt know what thou art
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:17476:74"/>
then giue no credence to others, follow <hi>Apollonius</hi> counsaile, who being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded howe a man should quietly enioy him selfe, answered; <hi>Si paucis credideris,</hi> if you trust but few: but let your owne conscience be your owne praiser, and be not so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as to be carryed away with things that are not, and take heed you be not to partiall in the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of your selfe, but as your owne conscience telleth you, may bee iustly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to you and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this is the safest way, for as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17476:75"/>
               <hi>Si vera sunt coram magno teste laudatus es,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nat. quaest. l.</hi> 4. <hi>Praefat.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>si falsa sine teste derisus es.</hi> Now if we will auoide this Gorgon, repell this monster, exile this murtherer, let vs loue, desire, and alwaies be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the hearing of the truth, and then wee shall bee sure for euer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king delight in being flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: and moreouer let vs put our full trust and confidence in God, for they that loue to bee flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered neuer doe so. For if they did, then surely they would neuer seeke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause for their wickednes from men, but rather
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17476:75"/>
thinke with themselues, whether that they did were permitted by God or no. Therefore if wee wil haue a remedy against flattery, let vs not put our trust in men, but in God and in him only. Againe, let vs be very carefull lest the cloake of friendship, or friendly carriage, giue some colour to the insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of flatterers, but these if you well looke &amp; search into, will be found to be like false gold, that only hath the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of true, and such as if they were tryed, will hardly abide the touch;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17476:76"/>
these let vs auoide, but of true friendship let vs make great account, and much esteeme. Counting them like the salt that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the ancient sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and flatterers like the honny forbidden in them, for the salt of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension is good and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but the honny of flattery is vile and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable. Againe, if you will auoid this, being flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, wee must not trust our selues to much vpon the prosperity of this tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory life, for this is the greatest way maker for flattery that can bee: for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:17476:76"/>
wee extremely flatter our selues, whilest wee whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rest vpon the prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this transitory life. This was the cause of the ruine and destruction of the Sodomites, who though they liued in all wickednesse, yet had an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that they were in the right way, still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing their ill course of life in pleasure and ease, whilest their arraignment was a making in heauen. And now to conclude, if we can master our selues and our owne affections, that our selfe louing incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation doe not cause vs
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:17476:77"/>
desire to be flattered, then wee shall bee able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster these vnmatchable monsters: for to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it so dangerous, as to such as are desirous of praises, &amp; willingly receiue such as commend them? but if indeede we will haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against them, let vs be deafe to all these, and suppresse our owne selfe loue which is the greatest aduantage to a flatterer that can be: for we are so much enamoured with our selues, that wee are easily taken with those things, which tend to our owne praise, and so much
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17476:77"/>
addicted to this good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt and opinion of our selues, that nothing so much delights vs as to heare our selues praised, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for those vertues, of the which we were neuer guilty, but most impatient to heare our selues blamed for any vices, though wee know them to bee inhabitant within vs: and this most commonly is the nature of high spirits, &amp; haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mindes, not guided by iudgment and reason, but lifted vp with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours of fortune, or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of birth, which doth
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17476:78"/>
