            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the Armie, remained here 20 dayes, for the Souldiers plainly denied to goe any further, imagining now they were led against the King, which they said, was no part of their agreement. <hi>Clearchus</hi> was the first that went about to force his Souldiers to proceed, but they, as soone as he offered to goe forward, cast Stones at him, and at his carriage Beasts.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Clearchus</hi> art in drawing them further.</note> And surely he hardly escaped stoning.
But afterward perceiuing it was in vaine to vse force, he called his Souldiers to an assembly; and first he stood weeping a good time, which they seeing, wondred at, and kept silence. Afterwards he spake thus:<q> My fellow Souldiers, wonder not that the present state of this businesse toucheth me to the quicke, for <hi>Cyrus</hi> hath made himselfe mine <hi>Host,</hi> being banished out of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and not only done me other honours, but also giuen me 10000 <hi>Darickes:</hi> which I taking, hoorded not vp for mine owne priuate vse, and pleasure, but disbursed them vpon you. And first I made warre vpon the <hi>Thracians,</hi> and with your helpes reuenged the wrongs they did vnto <hi>Greece,</hi> chasing them out of <hi>Cheronesus,</hi> whilst they endeuoured to take that Land from the <hi>Grecians.</hi> But when <hi>Cyrus</hi> called for me, I tooke you with me, and went to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to the end in his need to shew my selfe thankful for his former kindnesse and fauours towards me. But since you please to goe no further, I must of necessitie either forsake you and apply my selfe to his friendship, or deceiue his hopes, and remaine still with you. For my part (I know not whether I am in the right or not) I will rather chuse you, and with you partake such fortune as God shall send. Neither shal any man euer say, that I led the <hi>Grecians</hi> against the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> &amp; embracing the friendship of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> betrayed the <hi>Grecians.</hi> And because it pleaseth you neither to be perswaded by, nor yet to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, I will follow you, and with you willingly vndergoe whatsoeuer shall happen. For my resolution is, that you are my countrey, my friends, and my fellowes in Armes, and that with your presence, I shall be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, wheresoeuer I become: Being depriued of you, I shall neither be able to pleasure a friend, nor to be reuenged vpon an enemie. Wherefore I would haue you thinke assuredly, that whithersoeuer you goe, thither
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19391:7"/>
will I goe with you.</q>
Thus he spake. His owne Souldiers, and others hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these words, and that he purposed not to goe against the King, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him much, and aboue 2000 of <hi>Xenias,</hi> and <hi>Pasions</hi> Souldiers ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with them their Armes and Carriages, came and encamped with <hi>Clearchus. Cyrus</hi> doubting the sequell of these things, and somewhat aggrieued in his minde, sent for <hi>Clearchus,</hi> who refused to goe vnto him, but secretly without the Souldiers knowledge willed him to be of good courage, for he doubted not, but all should be well. Onely he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to send for him once more, albeit he signified before hand, that he would denie to come. Afterward, gathering together his owne Souldiers, and the other that quartered with him, and as many besides as list to heare, he said thus:
<q>My fellow Souldiers, the affaires of <hi>Cyrus</hi> with vs, and ours with him, stand almost vpon one foot, and carrie no great difference: For neither are we his Souldiers any more, because we follow him not, nor yet is he to giue vs any more entertainment. I know well he thinketh himselfe much wronged by vs, which is the cause I refused to goe vnto him, when I was sent for, especially being ashamed, &amp; touched in conscience, that I had deceiued his hopes. Further I feared lest lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hands vpon me, he might perhaps inflict some seuere punishment for the wrong I haue done him. I am therefore of opinion, that it is high time for vs not to sleepe, nor be carelesse of our selues, but to take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell what is to be done: for if we be forced to stay here, it is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, after what sort we may stay with most safetie: If to depart, how we may most securely depart, and how recouer things necessarie for our iourney. For without these, neither <hi>Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erall,</hi> nor common Souldier is able to atchieue any thing. As for <hi>Cyrus,</hi> where he is a friend, he is a sure friend, and highly to be prised; where an enemie, no man more sowre, nor more enemie-like. Besides, he hath Forces of Foot, of Horse, and Shipping, which we all see, and verie well vnderstand, as being quartered not farre from his Campe. So that it is high time for any man to vtter what he thinketh.</q> Hauing spoken thus, he held his peace. Then arose some of their owne accord, who deliuered their opinions.
Other some by his subornation, shewed the impossibilitie of going or staying, without the good will of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> One making semblance of hasting into <hi>Greece</hi> with all speed, aduised to chuse other <hi>Generals</hi> quickly, in case <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi> refused to leade away, and to buy things requisite for the iourney (for there was a Market, said he, in the quarter of the <hi>Barbarians</hi>) and immediatly to trusse vp their baggage, and goe to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and require Shipping, to depart in: And in case he refuse to giue them, to desire a guide to leade vs thorow the Countrey as friends. If he refuse that also, then presently to put the Armie in Battell array, and to dispatch away some, to seise vpon the height of the Straights, that neither <hi>Cyrus</hi> preuent vs, nor yet the <hi>Cilicians,</hi> abundance of whose persons and goods, we haue preid and carrie with vs. Thus much spake he. Then answered <hi>Clearchus</hi> in this manner: Let no man once imagine, that I will take vpon me the place of <hi>Generall</hi> ouer this <hi>Armie</hi> (for there are many things that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19391:8"/>
disswade me from it) But if you shall thinke good to chuse any other man, I will not faile to obey him to my vttermost; that you may see, I know as well to be commanded, as any man else whosoeuer. After <hi>Clearchus,</hi> another arose, shewing the simplicitie of him, that aduised to require Shipping of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as though he had no further vse for it, and what a shallownesse it would be, to require that of a <hi>Generall,</hi> which if he granted, his enterprise should be quite ouerthrowne. And if we were in any thing to trust the guide, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> should giue vs, why commanded we not <hi>Cyrus</hi> to take the top of the Hils for vs? For my part, I would be thorowly aduised, ere I went into Ships of his prouiding, lest he sinke both vs and them; and would feare his guide, left he leade vs to a place, from whence there were no comming off. I had rather goe hence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Cyrus</hi> his knowledge, if there were any meanes to hide my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from him: but that is a thing impossible, as also I say, these are all idle conceits: for my aduice, I would thinke it expedient, to send fit men with <hi>Clearchus</hi> vnto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to enquire, wherein he will be pleased to vse our seruice, and if the action be like vnto those, wherein he hath heretofore imployed Strangers, to follow him, and to shew our selues no worse, then they were, that heretofore ascended to his father with him. But if the enterprise seeme greater, and of more labour, and more perill, than other former enterprises haue been, to desire him either to perswade vs, and so to leade vs with him, or else to yeeld to our perswasions, and friendly to dismisse vs. For so both in following him, we shall follow as friends, readie to doe him seruice, and in returning, returne with safetie. What answer he maketh, I thinke necessarie to be reported to the Armie, that we may consult vpon it accordingly. This was decreed by the whole assembly, and chosen men sent with <hi>Clearchus</hi> to make demands to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> according to the resolution of the <hi>Assembly. Cyrus</hi> answered, that he had newes, that <hi>Abrocomas</hi> an enemie of his, was at the Riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which was about 12 encampings from thence: That he went against him, and if he found him there, he would be reuenged vpon him; if he fled away, we will deliberate then, said he, what is to be done. The chosen men made report hereof to the Souldiers, who albeit they had a suspition, they were led against the King, yet decreed to hold on. When they demanded of <hi>Cyrus</hi> an augmentation of pay, hee promised them halfe as much more as they had before,<note place="margin">20 s. and 6 d.</note> namely, in stead of one <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> the month, a <hi>Darick</hi> and an halfe to euery souldier.

               </note> These were two walles, of which <hi>Syennesis,</hi> and a guard of the <hi>Cilicians</hi> had the defence of the inmost next to <hi>Cilicia:</hi> The other next <hi>Syria</hi> was defended by a guard of the Kings souldiers. Thorow the middest of these two runneth the riuer called <hi>Kersos,</hi> being of the bredth of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foot. The whole distance betweene the two walls is three furlongs, and it admitteth no passage by force, the neather way toward the Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing narrow and fenced with strong walles, and the vpper nothing but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible rockes. In either wall there is a gate set. This passage was the cause that <hi>Cyrus</hi> sent for his ships, that in them he might transport armed foot both without and within the gates to force a way, if it were so that the enemy sought to make good that place, which he thought <hi>Abrocomas</hi> with his souldiers, that he had in great number, went about to doe. But <hi>Abrocomas</hi> did it not: For as soone as he heard, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was aduanced into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> he returned with all speed out of <hi>Phoenicia</hi> to the King,<note place="margin">

The territorie of this Countrey was a Plaine all ouer, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen like vnto the Sea, but full of wormewood, and if any shrubs or reeds grew there, they yeelded a sweet sauour like vnto spices, but there was not a tree to be seene. Of vntamed beasts, the most were wilde Asses,<note place="margin">Wilde Asses. <hi>Ostriches. Bustards.</hi>
               </note> and not a few <hi>Ostriches.</hi> There were also <hi>Bustards</hi> and wilde Goats. These asses being chaced first fled on afore, and afterward turned and stood at a gaze (for they were much swifter than a horse) &amp; again did the like when a horse came neere them. So that it was a matter impossible to take them, vnlesse the horsemen hunted with their horses placed in distance, and taking the chace one from another. The flesh of them being caught is in taste like a red Deere, sauing that it is a little more tender. No man could lay hand vpon an <hi>Ostrich,</hi> and the horsemen that gaue her chace soone quitted it. For she runs away flying vsing her feet for course, &amp; lifting vp her selfe with her wings, as it were with the sailes of a ship. As for the <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards,</hi> they are easily caught if a man sodainly spring them: for they both make a short flight as <hi>Partriges</hi> doe, and are soone weary. The flesh of them is very delicate &amp; pleasant. Proceeding on thorow this country the Armie came to the Riuer <hi>Masca,</hi> which carrieth 100 foot in bredth.<note place="margin">A <hi>Plether.</hi>
               </note> Here was a great Citie, but dispeopled, named <hi>Corsote,</hi> which hath the Riuer <hi>Masca</hi> running round about it, where they staied three daies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king prouision for the Armie.

In these encampings many carriage-beasts were lost for want of food. The inhabitants digging out and fashioning milstones about the riuer, carried them to <hi>Babylon</hi> and sold them, buying with the price victualls to maintaine their liues. The Army
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19391:10"/>
was now destitute of victuall, neither was there any to be bought else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where than only in the <hi>Lydian</hi> market amongst the <hi>Barbaria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cyrus,</hi> where a <note n="a" place="margin">

These encampings were a great distance one from another, &amp; they fell out to be the longer because <hi>Cyrus</hi> was forced to march on till he came either to water or fodder. And if it chanced that the way leading thorow streights or mire were hardly passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Chariots, <hi>Cyrus</hi> would stay with the best and gallantest of his traine, &amp; command <hi>Glous</hi> or <hi>Pigres</hi> to take some of the <hi>Barbarian</hi> army, &amp; draw the Chariots out of the mire. And in case they seemed too slow, he would,<note place="margin">The cause of long marches.</note> as it were in anger, command the strongest of the <hi>Persians</hi> that followed him, to put to their hands and free the chariots. There might a man haue beheld no smal peece of obedience. For casting off their skarlet cloaks (called <hi>Candyes</hi>) in the place where euery one stood, they hasted, as if a man should runne for a wager, euen against the steepnesse of hills, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clad with rich coats, and embrodered breeches, &amp; some of them with chaines of gold about their neckes, and bracelets about their wrests; and yet with these leaping quickly into the mire, they hoysed, and brought out the wagons sooner than a man would haue imagined. In a word, <hi>Cyrus</hi> spared no manner of diligence all the way to haste the iourney for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, staying in no place vnlesse there, where he must needs furnish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with prouision, or else set downe for some other necessary cause; conceiuing the more speed he made, the rather he should surprise the King, and fall vpon him at vnawares; and the more he loitered, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Armie the King should be able to raise. For it was easie for any man that would marke, to perceiue, that the Kings dominion was strong in largenesse of Territories, and multitudes of men, but weake in length of waies, and separation of his forces, in case warre were roundly moued against him. Beyond <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and the encampings in the wildernesse, there was a great and rich Citie, the name whereof was <hi>Carmanda,</hi> out of which the Armie made their prouision passing ouer in boats,<note place="margin">

My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the first gaue him to be vnder my command; afterward by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of my Brother, as he professeth, hauing in possession the Citadell of <hi>Sardes,</hi> he made warre vpon me; but I pursued him with armes so neere, that he thought it best to forbeare bearing armes against me, and afterward receiued his, and gaue him my right hand in token of reconciliation. He added, Was there any thing, <hi>Orontes,</hi> I wronged you in after this? <hi>Orontes</hi> answered, Nothing. Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> asked him againe, Did not you afterward, being not wronged by me, as your selfe confesse, reuolt to the <hi>Mysians,</hi> and spoile my Countrey to your vttermost power? I did, said <hi>Orontes.</hi> And when you found your selfe too weake, did you not fly to the Altar of <hi>Diana,</hi> saying, you repented of that you had done, and desired pardon, and gaue and tooke of me assurance of no further enmitie betwixt vs? <hi>Orontes</hi> acknowledged this also. Wherein then (quoth <hi>Cyrus</hi>) haue I wronged you, that you sought to betray me the third time? When <hi>Orontes</hi> confessed, he was not wronged; <hi>Cyrus</hi> asked him, Doe you confesse then, you haue done me wrong? I must needs, quoth <hi>Orontes.</hi> Then <hi>Cyrus</hi> asked him againe, will you henceforward then be enemie to my Brother, and friend, and trustie to me?</q>
Although I should, answered he, I shall not seeme so to you. After this, <hi>Cyrus</hi> said to those that were present: You haue heard, what this man hath done, and said; Begin <hi>Clearchus,</hi> and giue first your iudgement vpon him. Then said <hi>Clearchus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> Mine aduice and counsell is, that he be forthwith dispatched out of the way, that we be not troubled with keeping him, and that he hinder vs not to doe good to those, that willingly would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our friends.

Afterward by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> all they that were present, and his kinsmen also, rising vp, tooke hold of <hi>Orontes</hi> girdle, as of one condemned to die, and men appointed for the purpose led him forth: When he came out, those that were wont to bow to him with reuerence, made then also obeisance, albeit they knew,<note place="margin">His execution.</note> he was led to die.

After musters ended, as soone as it was day, there came Fugitiues from the great Kings Campe, and brought newes to <hi>Cyrus</hi> touching the Armie of the King. <hi>Cyrus</hi> calling together the chiefe Commanders, and the Captaines of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> consulted with them, how he might best order his Armie for fight, and admonished, and incouraged them in these words:
<q>I made choice of you (ô <hi>Grecians</hi>) to be my Companions in Armes, not because I wanted, or might not haue had plentie of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> but I chose you for that I esteemed you better, and more to be valued than many multitudes of <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Shew your selues therefore men worthy of the libertie you enioy, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect whereof, I hold you also happie. For I would haue you know, that I prise libertie aboue all things I possesse, and aboue many more of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worth, than those, I possesse. But to the end you may vnderstand what fight you are at this present to vndergoe, I will in few words declare it vnto you. The number of the enemie is great, and they charge with a great cry. Endure the first, and I am ashamed of the rest: and, am like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise ashamed, what manner of men you shall finde the Inhabitants of these Countreys to be. And in case you shew your selues men, and be couragious, and valiant, whosoeuer desireth to returne to his home, I will so send him away, that at his returne, his fellow Citizens shall haue cause to enuie his good hap. But I thinke so to vse the matter, that many shall rather chuse to remaine, and take such part as I shall haue, than to returne home to their Countreys.</q> Hereupon <hi>Gaulites</hi> a Fugitiue of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> but faithfull to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> replied;
There are (ô <hi>Cyrus</hi>) that say, you make large promises by reason of the perill at hand; but in case the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse be good, you will forget all. Other some,<note place="margin">The largenesse of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kingdome.</note> that although you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and would, you cannot performe what you promise.
<hi>Cyrus</hi> hearing these things, answered, <q>My Fathers Kingdome stretcheth toward the South so farre, that for heat, no man is able to inhabit; toward the North, that no man can inhabit for cold; the middlemost parts, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the gouernment of my Brothers friends. If we get the victorie, I can doe no lesse, than establish you my friends in the possession of them. So that I feare not (if my iourney prosper) not to haue enough, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to pleasure euerie one of my friends, but I feare rather, I shall not haue friends enow to pleasure. But to you, ô <hi>Grecians,</hi> to euerie one of you, I will giue ouer and aboue my promise, a Crowne of Gold.</q> They that heard these things, were much more forward than before, and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to the rest.
Many both of the chiefest Commanders, and also some other of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> went in to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> demanding what should be their reward, in case they won the day; whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> sent away full of good hopes. About that time, <hi>Clearchus</hi> asked <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Doe you thinke

The Fugitiues from the Kings Armie, brought this information to <hi>Cyrus</hi> before the battell; and those of the enemie, that were intercepted after the battel, confirmed the same. From hence <hi>Cyrus</hi> in one encamping, marched 3 <hi>Parasangs</hi>; his whole Armie, both <hi>Grecians</hi> &amp; <hi>Barbarians,</hi> being in battell array: for he thought the king would haue fought that day, because at the end of this halfe daies iourney,<note place="margin">A Fathome containeth two yards.</note> he found a deepe Trench cast, the bredth whereof was fiue Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomes, the depth three Fathomes. The trench ran vp into the Countrie 12 <hi>Parasangs,</hi> thorow the Plain euen as far as the wall of <hi>Media,</hi> where the Channels begin, that are deriued out of the Riuer <hi>Tygris,</hi> being in number foure, each of them 100 Foot in bredth, and verie deepe, so that Ships of burthen doe saile in them. They fall into <hi>Euphrates,</hi> euerie one distant a <hi>Parasang</hi> from other, and euerie one hauing a Bridge laid ouer it of the bredth of 20 Foot. A narrow way was betwixt the Riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and this Trench. The great King caused this Trench to be cast for a Fortification, assoone as he heard that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was on foot. <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his Armie passed ouer this narrow way, and were come within the Trench. The great King ioined not battell this day, but many <hi>Tracts</hi> of men and beasts, that retired, might hereabouts be euidently perceiued. Vpon the same day, <hi>Cyrus</hi> calling to him <hi>Silanus</hi> the Diuiner of <hi>Ambracia,</hi> gaue him 3000 <hi>Daricks,</hi> because 11 daies before offering Sacrifice he told him, that the King would not fight within ten daies. If he fight not within ten daies, quoth <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he will neuer fight; but if thy saying proue true, I promise to giue thee 10 <hi>Talents,</hi> and he gaue him that gold then, because the ten daies were past. Now seeing the King did not hinder the passage of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Armie ouer that Trench, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the rest, were strongly perswaded, that he determined not to fight, which was the cause, that <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> had not so great care of his march the next day; and he aduanced the third day after sitting in his <hi>Chariot,</hi> and the most of his Armie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched confusedly, and many of the Souldiers Armes were put vpon the Waines, &amp; vpon the cariage beasts. Now it was the time, the Market was full, and the place of encamping, where they should quarter, was at hand, when <hi>Patagyas</hi> a <hi>Persian,</hi> one of the faithfullest of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Traine, was seene to come vpon the spur, his Horse dropping with sweat, crying out

There <hi>Cyrus</hi> seemed to be the aptest to learne of all, that were of his age, and to be more obedient to the Elder sort, than those that were farre his inferiours. Besides, to be a great louer of Horses, and to vse them with great skill, and to delight, and be studious of warlike exercise, and of shooting, and darting. When he was in the flower of his age, he

greatly loued hunting, and shunned not danger, when he came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with wilde beasts.

Wherefore the Cities vnder his command beleeued him in all he spake, and particular men euery where beleeued him. And if an Enemie were to come in at any time vpon <hi>Cyrus</hi> his word, he was easily perswaded of his assurance and safetie; which was the cause, when he moued warre against <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> that euery Citie willingly chose to take part with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> rather than with <hi>Tissaphernes, Milet</hi> onely excepted: which feared him, for that he would not forsake, but gaue incouragement to the fugitiues of their Citie. For he declared both in deed and word, that after he had once receiued them into his friendship,<note place="margin">His thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> howsoeuer their number, or fortune afterward fell out to be, he would not cast them off. Besides he made it euident, that in case any man shewed him kindnesse, or were malitious against him, he would doe all he could, to goe beyond him in either of both. And there were, that reported this wish of his, namely, to liue so long, as to be able to ouercome his friends in kindnesses, his Enemies in reuenge. Therefore many men were content to giue vp their riches, Cities, and bodies into his hands,<note place="margin">Strictnesse in punishment.</note> rather than into any mans, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> liued in our age. Neither could it be truly said, that he suffered wicked and loose persons to scorne him. For that kinde of people he punished seuerely, and in the common waies were often to be seene men without feet, and hands, and eyes; so that in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his gouernement both <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> behauing themselues orderly, might walke, where they list without feare, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry such things with them, as they thought fitting for their iourney. By all mens confession he extraordinarily honoured men skilfull in the Art Military.<note place="margin">His esteeme of Souldiers.</note> The first warre he had, was against the <hi>Pisidians</hi> and <hi>Mysians:</hi> Himselfe therefore leading an Army against those countries, if he saw men willingly offer themselues to danger, he made them gouernours of the Country, which he conquered, and honoured them besides with other gifts. Whereby it appeared, that valiant men were happiest, and cowards accounted, as it were, their slaues. And for this cause many willingly put themselues into, and prouoked danger, especially if they imagined, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> should haue notice thereof. Whosoeuer it was that shewed to the world any notable example of Iustice, he much rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched him, than those, that fished for gaine out of vniust dealing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both many other things were rightly administred by him, and also
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19391:14"/>
he had an army, that might truly be called an Army. For the chiefe Commanders and Captaines resorted vnto him no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> for monies sake, but because they knew, that the seruice of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was much more to be prised, than their monthly pay. Now his seruants that executed his commands with dexteritie and diligence,<note place="margin">Loue &amp; kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to his seruants.</note> he suffered not to goe vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.

               </gap>ame went, that there was no kinde of worke to be thought vpon, wherein the seruants and workmen of <hi>Cyrus</hi> did not excell. Ifhe found a man to be a good husband in augmenting his owne wealth without oppression, or in garnishing the Prouince, which he gouerned, with new reuenewes, he was so farre from taking from him, that he gaue him more to that, he had. So that men gladly tooke paines, and boldly held, what they had gotten, and none concealed from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the things he possessed. For he seemed not to enuy them, which in open shew were rich, but would often vse the goods of such, as concealed and kept them close. What friends soeuer he chose,<note place="margin">To his friends.</note> and found well affected to him, and iudged able to effect that, which he desired, by the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all men he vsed most obsequiously.

I haue many causes to thinke, he had more presents made vnto him, than any one man of that age whatsoeuer. All these he distributed especially amongst his friends, hauing consideration of euery mans manner of life, and of their need. The things that were sent him for ornament of his bodie, or else fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it is no maruell, that being of greater ability he ouercame his friends in kindnesse. This rather seemeth a maruell, that he went beyond them in care, to gratifie and doe them good. For <hi>Cyrus</hi> oftentimes, when he happened vpon extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pleasant wine, would send them flaggons, with this message: <hi>Cyrus</hi> hath not tasted more pleasant wine a long time; he hath therfore sent this to you, and desireth you to day to drinke it out with those, that you loue best. Oftentimes also he sent halfe geese, and halfe loaues, and such like, willing the messenger to say, the taste of these pleased <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would haue you also to taste them. If at any time there were small store of fodder, it was easie to him to furnish himselfe, by reason of the multitude and diligence of his seruants. Being then so furnished, he vsed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If he iournied any whither in the sight of many, he would call his friends to him, and finde talke with them of purpose, that it might appeare, who they were, that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. Out of which I may truely coniecture, that no man was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of more either <hi>Grecians,</hi> or <hi>Barbarians,</hi> than hee.

After they were now come as far as the left Wing of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> feared the enemie would charge their Wing, and so wrapping in their battell on both sides, cut it in peeces.<note place="margin">Remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing.</note> They therefore thought fit to draw out that Wing in length, and to apply and set their backes against the Riuer. Whilest they were in this consultation, the King changing the forme he was in, ordered his <hi>Phalange</hi> against them as at first, aduancing as though he meant to charge. And the <hi>Grecians</hi> seeing the enemie at hand, and ordered for fight, began the <hi>Paean</hi> againe, and moued forward with much more alacritie, than in the first fight. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> receiued them not, but fled with greater speed than before. They followed the chace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a certaine Village, where they made Alt.

A man could not see what was to be done; some said, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Kings Standard, a golden eagle with her wings displaied as on a little <hi>Target</hi> fixed to the end of a long woodden staffe. When the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> aduanced thither also, the Horse forsooke the Hill, not in Troopes, but dispersedly, some scattering here, some there, in the end, all vanished away. <hi>Clearchus</hi> therefore ascended not the hill himselfe, but making Alt with the Armie at the foot of the hill, sent <hi>Lucius</hi> the <hi>Syracusian</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, willing them to get vp the hill, and to discouer, and make report to him of that they saw. <hi>Lucius</hi> galloped vp the hill, and after he had taken view, returned and told him, that the enemie fled vpon the Spur.

By this time came <hi>Clearchus,</hi> &amp; asked, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had yet giuen answer to the messengers, or no, <hi>Phalinus</hi> told him that the Coronels answered one one, another another thing. But I pray, said he, let vs heare your answer.
<q>For my part, quoth <hi>Clearchus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Clearchus</hi> his answer.</note> I am glad to see you, <hi>Phalinus,</hi> and so I thinke are the rest of vs here present. For you are a <hi>Graecian,</hi> and we being so many in number, as you behold, and in this estate, would willingly be aduised by you, what were best to be done in that, which is propounded vnto vs. Therefore we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you, for Gods cause, to declare vnto vs, what course in your opinion will be safest and most honourable for vs: which also being reported in time to come may bring you reputation: namely, that <hi>Phalinus</hi> being sent a messenger from the King vnto the <hi>Graecians,</hi> with commandement to deliuer vp their armes, gaue such and such aduice. For you know, that the counsell, which you giue vs, cannot, but be related in <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </q>
Thus much insinuated <hi>Clearchus,</hi> being desirous, that <hi>Phalinus</hi> the Kings mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger should aduise the <hi>Graecians</hi> not to deliuer vp their armes, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might gather heart, and receiue the greater encouragement.
But <hi>Phalinus</hi> withdrawing himselfe a little, and streight-waies returning, spake thus contrary to <hi>Clearchus</hi> his expectation: <q>If amongst 10000 hopes you had but one,<note place="margin">The aduice of <hi>Phalinus.</hi>
                  </note> to saue your selues by bearing armes against the King, I would counsell you not to deliuer vp your armes. But seeing there is no hope to escape danger against his will, I counsell you to seeke your safety by whatsoeuer meanes, you can.</q>
Hereunto <hi>Clearchus</hi> replied: Well then this is your opinion:
<q>But from vs returne this answer to the King; that, if we may be thought worthy to be his friends, we shall be better friends hauing armes, than deliuering them vp to any man else; if no remedy be but warre, we shall better make warre with armes, than without, after we haue rendred them vp.</q>
We will, quoth <hi>Phalinus,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your answer; But we haue futher in charge from the King to say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: That as long, as you stay where you are, you may expect truce; warre, if you march forward, or depart. Say hereunto, I pray, whether you will stay, and haue truce, or else I shall carry tidings of warre vnto the King? <hi>Clearchus</hi> answered:
<q>Carry tidings with you, that we are of the same opinion that the King is of. What opinion is that, quoth <hi>Phalinus?</hi> To haue truce, said <hi>Clearchus,</hi> if we stay; warre, if we depart, or march forward.</q>
But he signified not, what he meant to doe.<note place="margin">The doubtfull answer of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus.</hi>
               </note> So <hi>Phalinus</hi> and those in his company departed. <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

returned from <hi>Ariaens,</hi> but <hi>Menon</hi> remained still with him. They brought answer from him, whereby he signified, that there were many <hi>Persians</hi> in all respects better, than he, who would neuer endure, that he should be King. But if you resolue, said they, to depart with him, he willeth you to come this night; if not, he meaneth to march away early in the morning. <hi>Clearchus</hi> said; we must doe as you aduise, if we goe vnto him. If not, we are to resolue vpon that, which shall be thought most conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for vs. But neither signified he to these men, what he purposed to doe.
After this, about sunne set, he called the Coronels and Captaines together, and spake to them to this effect:<q> Euen now when I asked counsell of the gods by sacrifice, whether we should goe against the King or no, the intrayles assented not; and not without ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Shipping we haue none, and being destitute of victuall we may not remaine here. But the sacrifice was faire, and allowed of our going to the friends of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> This therefore must be our order. We must for the present away euery man to his lodging, and there sup with such as he hath. When the horne giueth signe to rest, let euery man make ready to depart. At the second signe lay your baggage vpon the carriage-beasts; at the third follow your leaders; and in our march the cariage-beasts are to be placed next the riuer, the armed without them.</q>
The Coronels and Captaines hearing this, departed, and did so.

But fortune after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was a better guide for vs. As soone as it was day, all set forward, hauing the sunne on the right hand, imagining that by sun-set they should reach to Villages of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Territorie. Neither were they deceiued in their imagination. About euening they thought they saw the enemies Horse; and both the <hi>Grecians,</hi> which were out of order, ranne to their places, and <hi>Ariaeus</hi> (for he rode on a Waggon, because of his wound receiued in the battell) alighted and put on his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, as did the rest likewise, that were in his Company. But while they were arming, the scouts brought tydings, that they were no Horse, but onely carriage-beasts at pasture, and streightwaies euery man easily coniectured, that the Kings Campe was some where not farre of. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>Clearchus</hi> led not against the enemy, both because our Souldiers courages began to fall, and also because they had beene fasting that whole day, and now it grew something late. Yet turned not out of the way, left hee might seeme to flie, but holding on right forth, by sunne-set he reached to the villages with the Vant-guard, and there quartered. The tymber of the houses of some of the villages was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken downe, and carried away by the Souldiers of the Kings armie. Therefore they, that came first, lodged themselues reasonably well; the last being benighted, euery one tooke vp his lodging, as fell out; and calling one vpon another made a great noise; so that the Kings army heard it. Whereby came to passe, that the enemy next at hand fled out of their tents. This appeared the next day For neither was there car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-beast, nor campe, nor smoake at hand to be seene. The King also (as it should seeme) was terrified with the accesse of our armie, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the next dayes worke. Yet in the processe of the night a feare seised vpon the <hi>Grecians</hi> themselues, and the tumult and hurlibur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley was such, as is wont, when men are possessed with feare.<note place="margin">A Panicall fear amongst the <hi>Graecians.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> in this distresse called <hi>Tolmides</hi> the <hi>Elean</hi> (whom hee had with him, the best Cryer of those times) and after silence enioyned willed him to make proclamation, that the Coronells signified, whosoeuer in generall could bring forth the author of this tumult, should haue a talent of siluer for his reward. By the proclamation the Souldiers perceiued, that their feare was vaine, and their commanders in safetie. As soone as it was day, <hi>Clearchus</hi> commanded the <hi>Grecians</hi> to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19391:19"/>
fall into the same order, they held, when the battell was fought. And where I before wrote, that the King was put into a feare by our accesse, it hereby appeared to be so, because the day before he sent an Imperious commandement to deliuer vp our armes,<note place="margin">The King ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Truce.</note> and now this day he imploied messengers about a truce. They after they came to our out-guards asked for the Coronels. The out-guards aduertised <hi>Clearchus</hi> hereof, who was then viewing the order of our embatteling, and he willed them to say to the messengers, that they should stay, where they were, till his further leasure. After he had so ordered the Armie, that the whole <hi>Phalange</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in a faire thicknesse, well compacted together, and no vnarmed man in sight, he called for the messengers; and both himselfe taking with him some of the best armed and gallantest Souldiers of the Troopes, and willing the other Coronels to do the like, he aduanced to meet them. Meeting together, he demanded the cause of their comming. They said, they came about a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>uce, and had full power to deliuer the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure vnto them, and to returne their answer to the King. <hi>Clearchus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered: Tell the King now from me, that there is no other way, but first to fight. For we haue no dinner, neither dares any man speake a word to the <hi>Grecians</hi> about Truce without offering them meat to eat. The mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers hearing this, posted away, and returned presently. Whereby also appeared that the king was at hand, or at least some other man, that had authoritie about this negotiation. They said, the King allowed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and, if the Truce were concluded, would send guides to conduct them to sufficient prouision. <hi>Clearchus</hi> asked whether the Truce should stretch to all in generall, or to those only, which were to goe betweene. They answered, to all, till your propositions be related to the king. After these things spoken, <hi>Clearchus</hi> fell to counsell with the Coronels. It see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med good to all to embrace a Truce forthwith, and quietly to goe to the place, where the prouision was, and there to take it. I am of your minde, quoth <hi>Clearchus</hi>; but I would not signifie so much to the messengers, but linger a little to put them in feare of our refusall of Truce; and I thinke our Souldiers are in the like feare.<note place="margin">The <hi>Grecians</hi> accept the Truce.</note> When he iudged it time, he told the messengers, he accepted the Truce, and willed them to leade imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to the place, where prouision might be found: which they did. <hi>Clearchus,</hi> albeit he purposed to accept Truce, yet marched on with his Armie in order of battell himselfe following in the Reare. He chanced vpon Ditches and draines full of water, which were not passable without Bridges. Yet framed they a passage with Palme trees, of which some were alreadie fallen to the ground, othersome they felled themselues. A man might hereby perceiue the sufficiencie of <hi>Clearchus</hi> his command,<note place="margin">The diligence and sufficiency of <hi>Clearchus</hi> in his command.</note> who carying in the left hand a Pike, in the right a Trunchion, in case any man appointed to worke seemed to slacke, chusing a fit man in his place, he chastised and put him off, and withall thrusting into the dirt himselfe, set his hand to the worke. So that it seemed a shame to all, that had the worke in hand, not to make haste, and be earnest in it. The worke was by him laid vpon the Souldiers of 30 yeeres of age. But the elder
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19391:19"/>
sort vndertooke it also, when they saw <hi>Clearchus</hi> so busie about it. And he hasted the more, suspecting, that the Ditches were not at all times so full of water (for it was no time of the yeere to water the Plaine) but that the King had let the water in, to the end that the difficulties of the iourney might seeme to the <hi>Grecians</hi> greater and more in shew, than they were in deed. Marching on, they came to the villages, in which the guides assigned their prouision. There was much Wheat,<note place="margin">Palme nuts.</note> and Wine of Palme to be found, and Vineger boiled out of Palme nuts. Those Nuts of Palme, such as are not to be seene in <hi>Greece,</hi> were reserued for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants; but the Masters had other chosen out from the rest, of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beautie and greatnesse: The colour of them nothing differeth from Amber, and being dried some of them were vsually set vpon the Table for dainties. The Wine is pleasant, but raising paine in the head. This was the place,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> where the Souldiers first fed vpon the Marrow of the Nuts of Palme, and many wondred at the kinde and propertie of pleasantnesse of them. This also bred extraordinarie paine in the head. The Palme, when the head is taken out, waxeth wholly dry. Here they rested three daies; and hither <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> and the Kings Wiues Brother, and three other <hi>Persians</hi> with many attendants, came from the great King. When the Coronels of the <hi>Grecians</hi> met them,<note place="margin">A dissembling speech of <hi>Tissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> by an Interpreter began thus:
<q>I (ô <hi>Grecians</hi>) haue my habitation neere <hi>Greece,</hi> and seeing the dangers &amp; misaduentures, which you are fallen into, to be without issue, I besought the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he would be pleased to giue me some meanes, whereby, if possibly I could, I might deliuer you into <hi>Greece</hi> in safetie. For I imagine the doing hereof would be acceptable to you, and to all <hi>Greece</hi> beside. In this minde I made suit to the King, alleaging he had good cause to be gracious in my suit, for that I first brought newes, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> raised an Armie against him, and withall brought him aid, and alone of all, that were ordered in battell against the <hi>Grecia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> fled not, but brake thorow them, and ioined with him in their Campe whither the King came, after he had slaine <hi>Cyrus</hi>; and with those, that are now in my company (who are most faithfull to the King) followed the chace vpon the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that serued <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Whereupon he promised mee to aduise. But he commanded me to goe to you, and demand the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why you tooke vp armes against him. I would counsell you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make a milde answer, that I may more easily compasse the good, which shall lie in my power to doe for you.</q>
After this the <hi>Grecians</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew themselues to consult and giue answer: and <hi>Clearchus</hi> in the name of the rest said:
<q>Wee neither assembled our selues to make warre,<note place="margin">The answer of the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
                  </note> nor did we take this iourney in hand against the King. <hi>Cyrus</hi> found many pretences, as you very well know, to ingage vs and bring vs hither. When we saw him in distresse, we were ashamed, before gods and men, to betray him, hauing in former times addicted our selues to his seruice. Now <hi>Cyrus</hi> is dead, we neither oppose against the Kings gouernment, nor is there cause for vs to infest his Countries, or to seeke his death, but we would without offence of any man returne to our countrey. If wrong
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19391:20"/>
be offered vs, we will by the helpe of God defend our selues, as well as we can.</q>
If on the other side any man shew vs fauour, we will not, to our power, be behinde in kindnesse.
Thus much <hi>Clearchus</hi>; which <hi>Tissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes</hi> hearing,<note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of truce, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</note> said:<q> I will report these things to the King, and to you againe, what the Kings pleasure is. Let the truce continue, till I come. We will exhibite you a market. The next day he came not, so that the <hi>Grecians</hi> were in a perplexitie, and knew not, what to thinke. The third day he came, and said, he had obtained power of the King to preserue the <hi>Grecians,</hi> albeit many gainesaid, and vrged, that it stood not with the Kings honour to suffer those, that had made warre against him, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part quietly. He added at last, you may now take assurance of vs, if you will, to make the countrey your friend, and that without fraud we shall lead you into <hi>Greece,</hi> exhibiting all the way a market of things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for you, and that where you haue it not, you may lawfully take pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of the countrey, as you finde it. You on the contrary side must sweare that you will passe thorow the countrey peaceably, taking onely meat and drinke where you haue no market; where you haue, buying and paying for such things, as you stand in need of.</q> These points were concluded, and <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> and the Kings wiues brother gaue their oathes and right hands,<note place="margin">The assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of truce.</note> to the Coronels and Captaines of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and tooke the like of them.
Afterward <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> said, I must for the present depart to the King. When I haue my dispatch, I will come with my baggage readie both to guide you into <hi>Greece,</hi> &amp; also to return to my gouernment. The <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Ariaeus</hi> encamping neere together, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> more than twentie daies.
In the meane space <hi>Ariaeus</hi> his brother, and many other of his friends came to him, and to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> with him, some encouraging them, other some bringing the Kings right hand,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ariaeus</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to returne to the Kings obeysance.</note> and assurance, that he would forget, that they had serued <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> in his warre, and all things else, that were past: after which it might easily be perceiued, that <hi>Ariaeus</hi> and his armie made small account of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> in comparison of that, they did before; so that this also was not greatly pleasing to the most part of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who came to <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Suspition of the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
               </note> and the other Coronels, saying: <q>Why stay we here? know we not, that the King would giue any thing to haue vs destroied, to the end that other <hi>Grecians</hi> may hereafter be put in feare of bearing armes against him? And now he keepeth vs here, because his armie is dispersed, which being againe assembled, he will in all likelihood set vpon vs. It may be also, hee is intrenching or raising a wall somewhere to blocke vp our way. For he would not willingly haue vs returne into <hi>Greece,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that being so few in number, we haue vanquished his forces, euen before his owne gates, and now depart homeward in scorne and derision of him.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Clearchus</hi> confident in the truce.</note> 
                  <hi>Clearchus</hi> answered them, that so discoursed; The things, you speake, are likewise in my minde. But I conceiue withall, that if we now depart, we shall seeme to depart as men, that seeke warre, and besides doe against the truce. Furthermore, no man will furnish vs with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, nor shall we haue corne in any place. Then who shall be our guide?
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19391:20"/>
Further I know not, whether we haue any other Riuer to passe. For it is impossible to passe ouer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the enemie opposing against vs. And if we chance to fight, we haue no Horse, whereas the enemies Horse are many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and much esteemed: so that albeit we get the victorie, whom shall we kill? If we be beaten, not a man of vs can escape. If therefore the King should harbour so much as a thought to make vs away, I cannot see why in so many aduantages he should sweare, giue his right hand, &amp; adiure the gods, and so eleuate his bands of assurance both with the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and with the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
               </q> He spoke many other things to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. About this time came <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> with his owne Forces, making semblance to march homeward, and with him <hi>Orontes</hi> and his Forces, which last led with him the Kings daughter, whom he had lately maried.
From thence the <hi>Grecians</hi> proceeded in their iourney, <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> being their guide, and exhibiting a market of all things needfull. <hi>Ariaeus</hi> also hauing with him the Armie of <hi>Barbarians</hi> that serued <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ariaeus</hi> ioyneth with the Kings Forces.</note> marched with <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> and <hi>Orontes,</hi> and lodged in the same Campe. The <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> being iealous hereof, marched alone by themselues with their guides. They euer encamped a <hi>Parasang</hi> or little lesse one from another,<note place="margin">Three miles three quarters.</note> and they obserued and watched one another, as enemies are wont, which straightway bred a suspicion betweene them. Sometime going for wood to the same place, and gathering fodder and such like, they fel to blowes, which also set them at further ods. After three dayes encamping they came to the Wall of <hi>Media.</hi>

After they heard this, they led the man to

               <hi>Clearchus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A true conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture about the message.</note> and imparted the message vnto him. <hi>Clearchus</hi> was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and in extreme feare with the newes.
But a young man then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, after he had well ruminated the matter, said:<q> It hangs not together, that <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> should goe about to charge vs, and to breake downe the Bridge. For it is euident, that charging vs he must either ouercome, or be beaten. If he ouercome, what need the Bridge be broken? For ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, there were many Bridges, yet should we haue no where to saue our selues by flight. If he be beaten, whither shall his Armie fly, the Bridge being broken, and most of the Armie being beyond the Riuer, how shall they succour one another, but by the Bridge?</q>
After <hi>Clearchus</hi> heard this, he asked, what quantitie of Land lay betwixt <hi>Tygris</hi> and the Draine? He answered, that the territorie was large &amp; had many villages &amp; great cities in it. Here-hence they perceiued, that the <hi>Barbarians</hi> sent the man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, fearing that the <hi>Grecians</hi> would not passe the Bridge, but remaine in the Island hauing for their Fortification the Riuer <hi>Tygris</hi> on the one side, and the Draine on the other, taking their prouision out of the Countrey, where it was both plenteous and verie good, in which also many Labourers inhabited. Besides the place would be fit for retreat, in case they were disposed to make inroades vpon the Kings dominions. After this they gaue themselues to rest, and yet were not vnmindfull to send a Guard to the Bridge. But neither did any man assault the <hi>Greekish</hi> Campe, nor yet, as the Guard brought newes, did any of the enemie come to the Bridge. Assoone as it was day they passed the Bridge in as good order, as was possible; which Bridge was laid ouer the Riuer vpon 37 Ships.<note place="margin">A Bridge vpon Ships.</note> Some of the <hi>Grecians</hi> in <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> Campe gaue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, they should be charged in their passage ouer.

                  <hi>Caenae,</hi> a Citie. <hi>Zabatus</hi> a riuer 400. footbroad.</note> out of which the <hi>Barbarians</hi> transported Bread, Cheese, and Wine vpon flote-Boates made of Skins. After this they came to the Riuer <hi>Zabatus,</hi> which was foure <hi>Plethers</hi> broad, and there remained three daies,<note place="margin">Distrusts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
               </note> and still they increased their iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, but no manifest deceit or lying in wait of one against the other was perceiued. Therefore <hi>Clearchus</hi> thought it best to conferre with <hi>Tis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphernes,</hi> to allay, if he could, these distrusts, before they broke out into open hostilitie. And hee sent a speciall messenger vnto him to signifie, that hee desired to speake with him, who readily answered, hee might come, when he pleased. At their meeting <hi>Clearchus</hi> begun, and said:<q> I know well, <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conference betwixt <hi>Tis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphernes</hi> and <hi>Clearchus.</hi>
                  </note> that we haue sworne and giuen mutuall right hands not to infest, or annoy, one another. I see notwithstanding, you keepe narrow watch vpon vs, as vpon enemies, and we perceiuing it doe as much vpon you;
But when, according to my poore vnderstanding,<note place="margin">The speech of <hi>Clearchus.</hi>
                  </note> I looked into the matter, and could not finde, you sought to wrong vs, and knew for certain, that to wrong you was furthest from our thoughts, I desired conference, that thereby we might, as much as was possible, take each from other this diffidence. For I am not ignorant, that men fearing one another, whether out of sinister delations, or of iealousie, to the end rather to preuent, than to suffer, bring remedilesse euills vpon them, that neither seeke, nor thinke the harme, which they imagine is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Conceiuing therefore, that such errours are easily laid asleepe by familiar conference, I come to you to signifie that you distrust vs without cause. For first and chiefly, our oathes forbid vs to be enemies, which whosoeuer neglecteth, I cannot account him happy, in what estate soeuer he flourish; considering that neither speed, nor darknesse, nor strength of place, can assure a man from the vengeance of the gods. All things are subiect to them, and nothing exempted from their power. This is mine opinion concerning the gods, and the oath, to which wee haue mutually bound our selues. Now for you, I hold you, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, of all mortall things our greatest good. For with your helpe all wayes are open, all riuers passable, nor can we be destitute of prouision; without you all waies full of darknesse (for we know no foot of them) all riuers shut vp, all gathering of people together fearefull; and solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse most of all, because it is full of difficulties. And say, we were so mad to seeke your life, what should wee thereby else doe, than by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a man of such desert toward vs, bring the forces of the great King vpon vs, who would be your reuenger? Besides, for mine owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I will in a word declare of how many, and how great hopes I should depriue my selfe, if I should goe about to wrong you. J sought the friendship of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in imagination, that he, of all that liued, had the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test abilitie to doe good, to whom he pleased. Now I see the authoritie and countrey of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in your hands, ouer and aboue that, which you had before, and the Kings forces, which <hi>Cyrus</hi> vsed for warre deuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to you alone. This being so, who would be so senselesse not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire your friendship? I will adde the things, which put me in hope, you
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19391:22"/>
will not refuse, nay rather endeuour to be our friend. I know the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> are troublesome vnto you, whom with the forces, I haue, I make no question to humble at your feet. The like I know of the <hi>Pisidians.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides I heare, that many other nations are alwaies malicious and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at your felicitie. As for the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> whom you principally beare vpon the spleene, I see not with what aides you can better reuenge your selues vpon, then with the army vnder my command. Your neighbours, if you please to befriend any, you are of abilitie to doe it munificently of your selfe; in case they molest you, you may chastise them, as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and that much the rather by our seruice, who will follow you not for pay alone, but more for thankfulnesse, in regard you haue preserued and brought vs home safe to our country. When I consider these things, it seemeth so wonderfull vnto me, that we should be distrusted, that I would faine heare his name, who is so powerfull in speech, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, that we lie in await for you.</q>
These were the words of <hi>Clearchus</hi> to <hi>Tissaphernes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> answer.</note> 
               <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> answered in this manner: It is a ioy to me, <hi>Clearchus,</hi> to heare your wise and discreet discourse.
<q>For seeing you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand these things to be so, you cannot wish me ill, without being an enemy to your selfe. But that you may learne, you cannot iustly leaue and forsake the King, heare on the contrary side. If we had any intent, to ruine you, whether doe you thinke, we wanted meanes, hauing mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of horse, and foot, and weapons to cut you in peeces, without any danger of ours? Imagine you, we wanted fit ground to fall vpon you? Passe you not with much labour many plaines, that are friend to vs? See you not, what mountaines you are to march ouer, which if we take before hand, your passage is shut vp? How many riuers are there, where we may make choice, and, as it were, cull out that number of you, with which we list to fight? There are also amongst them some, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not passe without our friendship and assistance. But say we had the worst in all these, yet hath fire the command of all fruit, that ariseth of the earth. Which if we burne, we shall oppose hunger against you in the field, with which you shall neuer be able to fight, were you neuer so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant. How then hauing so many aduantages, and all without our owne perill, should we amongst the rest chuse such a kinde alone, as is impious against the gods, abominable before men, and such a one as befitteth them, that know not what to doe, and are circumuented with distresse, and ouerwhelmed with necessitie, and which is beseeming loose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who care not so they may effect their designes, though it be with periury against the gods, and with vnfaithfulnesse toward men. Wee, <hi>Clearchus,</hi> are not so void of sense, or destitute of reason. When we might haue cut you off, why did we not? It proceeded out of my loue, that I might shew my selfe an entire friend to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> &amp; by my well deseruing descend into my gouernment strong with those forces, with which <hi>Cyrus</hi> ascended, being assured of them, by reason of the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hee gaue them. You haue declared how many waies, you may stead me. But I know my selfe the chiefe and principall. It is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19391:22"/>
for any, but the King, to weare his <hi>Tiara</hi> vpright vpon his head; But with your presence and assistance, perhaps another man may carry it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in his heart. Hauing spoken these words,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tiara</hi> was an attire that the <hi>Persians</hi> wore on their heads.</note> he seemed to <hi>Clearchus</hi> to deliuer that, he thought. Considering then, quoth <hi>Clearchus,</hi> we haue such cause to be friends, are not they worthy to taste extreme punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who by sinister suggestions endeuour to make vs enemies? If you, quoth <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> and the Coronels and Captaines please openly to come vnto me, I will tell you, who they are, that informed me.</q> By these words, and courteous entertainment, <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> preuailed to make him stay, and beare him company at supper that night.
The next day <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> after his returne to the quarter,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Clearhus</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached by the cunning of <hi>Tis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphernes.</hi>
               </note> declared publikely how well hee thought of <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> and related, what he heard from him; and said, That it was fit, that they, whom <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> desired, should accompany him to <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> his campe: and likewise that they, who as traitors, and bearing no good affection to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> had slandered them with false suggestions, might haue their due punishment. He suspected <hi>Menon</hi> to be the tale-bearer, knowing he often resorted to <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> with <hi>Ariaeus,</hi> and that he opposed against him in his command, &amp; sought to supplant him, to the end that gaining the leading of the army, he might shew himselfe a friend to <hi>Tissaphernes.</hi> For <hi>Clearchus</hi> would haue the whole army to cast their eyes vpon him alone; and sought to remoue all, that seemed discontent therewith. Some of the Souldiers spake against the sending of all the Coronels and Captaines, and said, No trust was to be giuen to <hi>Tissaphernes.</hi> But <hi>Clearchus</hi> laboured eagerly to the contrary, till hee brought to passe, that fiue Coronels and twentie Captaines were allowed to goe; two hundred Souldiers followed them,<note place="margin">Fiue Coronels.</note> vnder colour to buy victuall. When they were at <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> his doore, the Coronels were called in, to wit, <hi>Proxenus</hi> the <hi>Baotian, Menon</hi> the <hi>Thessalian, Agias</hi> the <hi>Arcadian, Clearchus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonean,</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> the <hi>Achaean.</hi> The Captaines staid at the doore. Not long after, at one and the same signe hands were laid vpon those within,<note place="margin">The Coronels taken prisoners by <hi>Tissaphernes.</hi>
               </note> and those without were cut in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and some of the <hi>Barbarian</hi> hors-men scouring the Plaine, killed all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> they lighted vpon, free, and bond. The <hi>Grecians</hi> perceiuing these things out of the campe, maruelled at their manner of riding vp and downe, and doubted of the sequell, till <hi>Nearchus</hi> the <hi>Arcadian</hi> came running with his entrailes in his hands after a wound receiued, and told what had happened in the campe of <hi>Tissaphernes.</hi> Hereupon all the <hi>Grecians</hi> affrighted snatched vp their armes, imagining the <hi>Persians</hi> would presently inuade their campe. But there came no more, than <hi>Ariaeus, Artoasus,</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> men of chiefest credit with <hi>Cyrus.</hi> The interpreter of the <hi>Grecians</hi> said, He saw and knew <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> his brother amongst them. About three hundred <hi>Persians</hi> followed them in Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. These, when they came neere, willed, if there were amongst the <hi>Grecians</hi> any Coronell or Captaine, he should come forth, and heare the Kings pleasure. Thereupon after assurance giuen, <hi>Cleanor</hi> the <hi>Orcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian,</hi> and <hi>Sophenetus</hi> the <hi>Stymphalian,</hi> both <hi>Grecian</hi> Coronels, issued
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19391:23"/>
out; and with them <hi>Xenophon</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> to learne what was become of <hi>Proxenus. Cherisophus</hi> chanced then to be absent, being gone to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine village to make prouision. Comming within hearing, <hi>Ariaeus</hi> said:
<q>
                  <hi>Clearchus</hi> (ô <hi>Grecians</hi>) hauing falsified his Oath,<note place="margin">False pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of a foule action.</note> and broken the truce, hath his iudgement, and is dead. <hi>Proxenus,</hi> and <hi>Menon,</hi> are in great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, because they reuealed his treason: and the King demandeth of you your Armes. He saith they are his, because they belonged to <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Seruant. The <hi>Grecians</hi> answered hereto by the mouth of <hi>Cleanor</hi>; O <hi>Ariaeus,</hi> the most execrable of men, and all ye, that were <hi>Cyrus</hi> his friends: Blush you not before the gods and men, that hauing sworne to vs to haue the same friends and enemies, you now seeke to betray vs with <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> a most godlesse and faithlesse man? and after you haue made away them, to whom you gaue your Oath, you goe about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the rest, and come with our enemies against vs. <hi>Ariaeus</hi> answered, <hi>Clearchus</hi> sought first to entrap <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> and <hi>Orontes,</hi> and all of vs, that were with them.<note place="margin">The falsenesse discouered.</note> Hereunto <hi>Xenophon</hi> replied: If <hi>Clearchus</hi> haue against his Oath broken the truce, he hath his iudgement. For it is iust to punish periured men. But <hi>Proxenus</hi> and <hi>Menon</hi> hauing behaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues towards you as friends, being our Coronels, let them be restored vnto vs.</q>
For being friends to both, no doubt they will aduise you, and vs for the best. The <hi>Barbarians</hi> hauing long conferred together, departed without giuing answer hereto: but the Coronels so caught in the snare were deliuered ouer to the King, and ended their daies, being made shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the head.<note place="margin">A description of <hi>Clearchus</hi> his naturall dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</note> Of whom <hi>Clearchus</hi> by consent of all, that had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, was held a man of martiall disposition, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely desirous of warre. For as long, as warre continued betwixt the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Athenians,</hi> he remained at home. Peace being made, he perswaded his Citie, that the <hi>Thracians</hi> wronged the <hi>Grecians.</hi> And vsing all meanes he could, obtained of the <hi>Ephori</hi> a Commission to be General &amp; to goe against them, and shipped himselfe with purpose to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade those <hi>Thracians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> which inhabit aboue <hi>Cherronesus</hi> and <hi>Perinthus.</hi> But after his departure the <hi>Ephori</hi> changed their mindes, and sent to call him home from <hi>Istmos</hi>; which message of theirs he obeied not, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his nauigation to <hi>Hellespont.</hi> Whereupon the Magistrats of <hi>Sparta</hi> condemned him, as a disobedient Subiect, vnto death. Being now a bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed man, he iournied to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whose friendship, after what sort he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I haue written else-where. <hi>Cyrus</hi> gaue him 10000 <hi>Daricks,</hi> which he spent not in idlenesse, but waging an Army therwith, made warre against the <hi>Thracians.</hi> And first he vanquished them in a battell, afterward har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried &amp; spoiled their Countrey, and continued that warre, till <hi>Cyrus</hi> stood in need of his Armie. Then he departed with intent to follow the seruice of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> These therefore were the actions of a man that delighted in warre; who, when he might haue liued in peace without shame or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, chose to be in warre; might haue rested in idlenesse, gaue himselfe to labour, and warre; might without danger haue enioied riches plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously, bestowed them rather vpon warre. Such was his disposition to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19391:23"/>
warre, and he spent as willingly vpon warre, as if it had been vpon loue, or other pleasures. It appeared also, that he was of a warlike inclination, because he loued danger, and led his people as well by night, as by day against the enemie; and demeaned himselfe wisely and circumspectly,<note place="margin">His diligence.</note> when he was in perill, as all, that followed him, confesse. Besides, he was said to be an excellent Commander according to his manner. For,<note place="margin">His skill.</note> if any man else, <hi>Clearchus</hi> knew how to make necessarie prouision for his army, and to supply the wants thereof in time of need: and how to breed an opinion in his Souldiers, that <hi>Clearchus</hi> his command was not to be diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beied. This he effected by his sourenesse, and austeritie,<note place="margin">Seueritie.</note> being sterne in visage, and harsh in voice, and alwaies vsing extremitie in punishment, and somtimes with choler, so that the time was, when he repented of his hastinesse. He chastised his Souldiers of set purpose; thinking an Armie vnpunished to be of no vse. This saying of his is also reported; That a Souldier ought rather to feare his Commander, than his Enemie, in case he were to stand well to his guard, or to abstaine from spoiling his friends, or to goe without refusall against an enemie. Therefore the Souldiers heard him willingly, and required no other Commander in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. They said, that sternenesse then seemed cheerfulnesse in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and sourenesse a kind of strengthening against the enemie. So that now it was no more austeritie, but, as it were, a preseruatiue. When they were out of danger, &amp; might follow other Commanders, many forsooke him. For he had nothing in him to win fauour; but was alwaies soure and cruell, so that Souldiers affected him as children doe their Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master. Neither had he any man, that followed him for loue; but whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer were put vnder his command either by the citie, or else by necessitie and want, they were wonderfully obedient to him; &amp; after they had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the enemy vnder his leading, his meanes were great to make his Souldiers seruiceable. For they marched against the enemy with great assurance, and the feare of punishment kept them in good order. Such a Commander was <hi>Clearchus.</hi> It was said, he had no great desire to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an other mans command. Hee was about fiftie yeares old,<note place="margin">Ambition.</note> when he died. <hi>Proxenus</hi> the <hi>Boeotian</hi> sought euen from his childhood to become a man fit for great employments,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Proxenus.</hi>
               </note> and out of this desire he gaue enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and addicted himselfe a scholar to <hi>Gorgias</hi> the <hi>Leontine</hi>;<note place="margin">His industry being young.</note> and after he had conuersed with him a time, thinking himselfe now both able for gouernment, and also that being in estimation with the greatest, he should not faile of meanes to preferre himselfe, he went and ioyned with <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the same actions, imagining thereby to purchase a worthy name, and great power, and plentie of riches;<note place="margin">His ends.</note> and albeit his desires were such, notwithstanding it appeared euidently in his carriage,<note place="margin">Modestie.</note> that he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed not by ill meanes, but fairely and iustly, and no otherwise to come vnto them. He was able to manage matters of importance, and worth, but yet could neither raise reuerence,<note place="margin">Remisnesse.</note> nor feare in his Souldiers mindes toward him. Nay rather he reuerenced them, than they him; and shewed cleerely, he more feared their hatred, than not to haue them obedient to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19391:24"/>
him. He thought it sufficient to be, and seeme to be, to praise a well-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing souldier, not to commend him, that did amisse. The honester therefore, and better sort of Souldiers were well affected toward him; the other sought to circumuent him, as being easie to be ouertaken. He was about thirtie yeares old, when he lost his life. <hi>Menon</hi> the <hi>Thessalian</hi> made open shew,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Menon.</hi>
               </note> that he greedily coueted riches, and coueted rule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to waxe worthier,<note place="margin">His desire of wealth.</note> and coueted honour to bring in gaine. He insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himselfe into great mens fauour, to shelter his faults from punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To forsweare, to lie, and deceiue, he held the next way to effect his desires:<note place="margin">Impudencie.</note> simplicitie and truth he accounted all one with dulnesse, and want of vnderstanding. It could not be perceiued, that he loued any man. To whom he made most shew of loue, him he sought to beguile. In his common discourse,<note place="margin">Deceitfulnesse.</note> he vsed not to deride an enemie; but scoffed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies at them, with whom he conuersed. He neuer lay in wait for ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies goods, because he iudged it hard to finger that, which was kept, but imagined, that he alone knew, that because the goods of friends were vnder no streight custodie, they might easily be surprised. Periured and wicked folke he feared, as men armed, and abused at his pleasure vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and well-minded men, scarce esteeming them for men. <hi>Menon</hi> no otherwise reioyced, in deceit, forging of lies, and deriding his friends, than another man would in godlinesse, truth, and iust dealing. He estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, that was no circumuenter, to be vnnurtured, and to want edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.<note place="margin">Calumniation.</note> In seeking great mens fauour, he thought there was no other way, than by accusing them, that stood in their speciall grace. He ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to make his Souldiers obedient with societie of villany. He loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for respect, because in many things he had abilitie, and will to doe wrong. If any man forsooke him, he said he dealt kindly with him, for that he had not made him away. But the things concerning him, that are not so openly knowne, may seeme to be fained. Euery one knowes these, that follow. Being in the flower of his age he obtained of <hi>Aristippus</hi> the leading of the strangers in the army; and in the flower of his age he grew into the familiaritie with <hi>Ariaeus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Impudicitie.</note> who was a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> and delighted in young boyes; and hauing yet no haire on his face, he fell in loue with <hi>Tharipus,</hi> that had a beard. When the other Coronels were made away, because they bore armes with <hi>Cyrus</hi> against the King, he scaped being in that same fault.<note place="margin">Death.</note> Yet after the death of the other Coronels was he puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and put to death by the King; not losing his head, as <hi>Clearchus</hi> and the other, (which seemeth to be the fairest and most honourable kinde of death) but he is reported to haue come to his end, as a wicked man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to continuall torments by the space of a whole yeare. <hi>Agias</hi> the <hi>Arcadian,</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> the <hi>Achaean,</hi> lost their heads at the same time, whom no man euer scorned as slacke and sluggish Souldiers, nor bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as disloyall and vntrue friends.

But seeing you haue propounded your question in this forme, quoth <hi>Socrates,</hi> you are to doe that, which the god commandeth you. <hi>Xenophon</hi> therefore sacrificing, as the god had commanded, tooke shipping and sailed away, and found <hi>Proxenus</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> at <hi>Sardes</hi> (who were now readie to take their iourney vpward) and was forthwith presented to <hi>Cyrus.

                  <hi>Xenophons</hi> griefe.</note> And being now in this distresse, he was sorrowfull with the rest, but yet taking a little nap he fell into a dreame.

Being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, he started out of his sleepe, iudging that the dreame was good in part, because being in trauell and danger he saw a great light proceed from <hi>Iupiter:</hi> In part he feared it, because it seemed to come from <hi>Iupiter</hi> being a King, and to shine in a circle; imagining he should not be able to get out of the Kings Countrey, but be inuironed on all sides with some one distresse or other. Now what the signification and effect of such a dreame was, might be easily perceiued by the sequell. For it fell out, that, straight after that he awaked,<note place="margin">His discourse in minde.</note> he entred into this cogitation with himselfe: Why lie I here? The night passeth away; and it is likely that the enemie will fall vpon vs, as soone as the day appeareth. If we come into the

Kings hands, what shall hinder, that hauing first seene with our eyes all manner of scornes, and next felt all kinde of torments, we die not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a shamefull and villanous death? Now no man maketh prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for defence, nor so much as once thinketh vpon it: but we lie still, as though we were in securitie. What Commander therefore doe I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect out of any other Citie to direct vs? Or what age doe I looke to attaine vnto? If to day I betray my selfe to the enemie, I shall neuer be an houre elder. Hereupon he presently arose,<note place="margin">His resolution. His speech to the Captaines of his owne Regiment.</note> and first called together the Captaines of <hi>Proxenus</hi> his Regiment. Then he spake thus:
<q>Worthy Captaines, the consideration of our estate will neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> case as well as mine) nor yet to lie still and giue my selfe to rest. Our enemies, vntill they imagined they had brought their designes to a wished end, forbore to offer open hostilitie. Of vs on the other side there is no man that casteth in his minde, how we may best come to fight, and defend our selues against the enemie. For if we yeeld and subiect our selues vnto the Kings power, what hazard shall we not incur? He cut off the head and hand of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and fastened them to the Gallowes, who was his Brother both by the same Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and alreadie dead. We then, who haue here no kinred, who tooke vp armes against him, who sought to establish his seruant in his Throne, and to make away the King himselfe, if it lay in our power, we I say, what may not we expect to suffer? Will he not vse all meanes possible to lay vpon vs extremitie of punishment, thereby to strike a feare into other, that they presume not to warre against him? Surely we are to trie our vttermost endeuours, that we fall not into his hands. For my part I ceased not, euen while the truce endured, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moane our case, and to esteeme the King, and such as followed him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, seeing with mine eyes, how large and goodly a countrey they enioyed, what plentie of prouision, what a number of attendants, how many carriage-beasts, what quantitie of gold, and of apparell they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed; and on the contrary side, comparing the condition of our army, that enioyed nothing of value, but what was bought with mony (which I knew but few had) &amp; was debarred of other means of prouision, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their oath and agreement. Casting, I say, these things in my minde, I feared then the truce more, than I doe now the warre. And conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the enemy himselfe hath broken the truce, I thinke, that both their insolencie and our suspitions are come to an end. For now all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages, whereof I spake, are laid in the middest, as it were, betwixt vs both, as rewards for those, that shall behaue themselues most valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The gods are Iudges, and giue successe to battells, who in all reason will be on our side. Our enemies in forswearing themselues, haue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their faith vnto them: We contrariwise, hauing many faire aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages offered vs, constantly forbore to take them for our oathes sake made to the gods. So that, me thinkes, we ought to goe forth to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell with much more courage and assurance, than they. Further, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are more able to endure cold, and heat, and labours, than theirs,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19391:26"/>
and, by the fauour of the gods, our mindes more noble. Besides, they will be more subiect to wounds, and death, than we, in case the gods (as they haue done heretofore) vouchsafe to giue vs victory. But it may be, that other men harbour these cogitations, as well as we. For the loue of God let vs not expect, that other come and encourage vs to be braue and resolute, but let vs begin to excite other to valiance. Shew your selues gallantest amongst Captaines and most fit to command amongst Coronels. My selfe, if you shall be pleased to leade me, will follow; if you appoint me a leader, will not excuse my selfe by want of yeares, but rather conceiue that youth may strengthen and preserue me from many mischances.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apollonides</hi> a harsh counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</note> Thus much he spake. All the Captaines hearing it, willed him to proceed, except one <hi>Apollonides,</hi> a man that clattered rudely in the <hi>Boeotian idiome.</hi> He said, they spake idlely, that sought to perswade, that there was any other hope of safetie, than in the Kings fauour, if it might be gained, and withall began to reckon vp the distresses, we were in. <hi>Xenophon</hi> in the meane time interrupting him replied: O strange man, that you are, who neither seeing know, nor hearing remember. You were present, when the King, proud of his victory, after the death of <hi>Cyrus</hi> sent vnto vs, commanding to deliuer vp our armes. When we refused, and marched forward in armes, and encamped close by him, what did he not to procure truce, sending Ambassadours, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cessation of hostilitie, and offering to furnish the army with proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But after the Coronels and Captaines (as you now would haue vs) in confidence of the truce, went without armes to conferre with them; are they not now scourged, wounded, and scorned, and yet cannot die poore men, albeit, I perswade my selfe, they infinitely desire it? All this you see, and say notwithstanding, they speake idlely, that aduise to stand vpon our defence; and would haue vs to sue to the King anew to obtaine his fauour. For my part (Companions) I hold this fellow not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnfit henceforward to be admitted into our societie, but also worthy to lose his Captaines place, and no otherwise to be employed, than as a carriage-beast; because in bearing this base minde, he both shames his countrey, and besides disparages the whole <hi>Grecian</hi> nation. Hereupon <hi>Agasias</hi> the <hi>Stymphalian</hi> replied: This fellow hath nothing in him at all, that sauours of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> or <hi>Greece.</hi> For I haue seene both his eares, which are boared thorow, like as are the <hi>Lydian</hi> slaues.</q>

               <hi>Xenophon</hi> hereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus:
<q>We all know, that the King, and <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> haue laied hands vpon as many of vs, as they could, and that they lie in wait for the rest to cut them off. Therefore mine opinion is, that we leaue nothing vndone to auoid the snares of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> nay rather to become their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, if it be possible. And you cannot be ignorant likewise, that being so many, as you are here assembled, your demeanour will bring forth effects of great consequence. The eies of the whole army are cast vpon you. If they perceiue, that you faint in courage, you must expect the like from them. But if you appeare resolute against the enemy, and stirre vp the rest, and hearten them, you know well, they will follow, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to imitate your example. And doubtlesse it is reason, you should carrie brauer mindes than they; you are their Coronels,<note place="margin">
                     <p>
                        <hi>Taxiarchs</hi> are the Captaines of the light armed.</p>

                        <hi>Lochagi</hi> the Captaines of the armedfoot.</p>
                  </note> you their Taxiarchs, and Captaines. In time of peace, you enioy more wealth and honour, than they; and now in time of warre it behoueth you to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the multitude, and as need shall require, to goe before them in counsell, and paines taking. For the present, first I thinke, you will much aduantage the Army, in making choice of new Coronels and Captaines in stead of them, that are lost. For without rulers nothing that is good or profitable can be administred (in a word) any where, but especially in matters of warre. For as good order seemeth to preserue, so disorder hath ouerthrowne and vndone many. After you haue appointed so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Commanders, as are needfull, if then you call the Souldiers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and confirme their mindes, you shall not doe it out of season, as J thinke. Now you perceiue as well, as I, how heauily, and drowsily they goe to Armes, how drowsily to the Watch; In which case, as long, as they remaine, I know not, what vse may be had of them night or day. But if a man stirre vp their mindes, and represent, not only what they are to suffer, but to doe also, it will greatly enhance their courage. For you know, that it is neither multitude, nor strength, that giueth victory in warre, but which side soeuer goe (by the fauour of the gods) into the field with brauer and gallanter resolutions, they for the most part preuaile. It commeth besides into my minde, that whatsoeuer he be, that seeketh by all meanes he can to saue his life in warres, he commonly dies a vile and dishonourable death. But they which know, that death is common and vnavoidable to all men, and that striue to die with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I see them much sooner reach to old yeares, and spend the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their life in happinesse. Which we should doe well to consider, especially in this hard time, and both our selues be couragious, and also excite other to valour, and forwardnesse. So much he spake, and held his peace. After him <hi>Cherisophus</hi> spake and said:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cherisophus.</hi>
                  </note> Heretofore I knew you <hi>(Xenophon)</hi> thus farre, that you were reported to be an <hi>Athenian.</hi> Now I commend both your speech and actions, and could wish, we had many such, as you are.

that want, choose your Commanders. When they are chosen, come and bring them into the middest of the campe, and present them vnto vs. Then will we assemble the rest of the Souldiers. And let <hi>Tolmides</hi> the Crier come likewise vnto vs.</q>

Besides, the Armie of <hi>Ariaeus,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were our confederates, hath betraied vs. Notwithstanding it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth valiant Souldiers to lift vp their heads, and to make way tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row these euils, and not to faint, but endeuour, as much as in vs lieth, to saue our selues by obtaining a noble victorie against the enemie, and if we faile thereof, to die an honorable death, and not to come aliue into their hands, lest we suffer such things, as, I pray God to turne vpon their owne heads.

As for <hi>Ariaeus,</hi> whom we would haue made King of <hi>Persia,</hi> to whom we gaue, and from whom we tooke assurance by oath, not to betray one another, he also neither fearing gods, nor men, nor reuerencing <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that is dead (being most of all other, whilest he liued, respected and honoured by him) reuolting to his greatest enemies, goeth about to worke vs mischiefe, who were <hi>Cyrus</hi> his friends. But the gods will reuenge our wrongs vpon such men. It behoueth vs, hauing these things before our eyes, to be no more ouerreached by them, but with our Swords in hand, and fighting valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to expect, whatsoeuer it shall please the gods to lay vpon vs.</q>
Then <hi>Xenophon</hi> stood vp, hauing apparelled himselfe as brauely, as he could, for the warre; conceiuing, if God gaue victorie, that the fairest furniture was most befitting victorie; if he should be slaine, it would not be amisse to end his daies in his best ornaments.

doe it with great distrust, setting before our sight the miserable case of the Coronels, who vpon trust permitted themselues to their hands. But if we seeke reuenge by Armes for that, wherein they haue wronged vs, and hereafter prosecute all manner of warre against them, we haue, by the fauour of the gods, many and faire hopes of safetie. Whilest he was speaking these words, one of the Souldiers neesed:<note place="margin">The superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>

For when the <hi>Persians</hi> and their alies came with a mightie Armie to destroy <hi>Athens,</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> being not afraid to meet them, fought with them and had the victorie. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a vow to <hi>Diana,</hi> to offer vnto her so many Goats, as they killed enemies, when there were not so many to be found, they made a Decree to offer yeerely 500, which number they offer also at this present. Afterward when <hi>Xerxes,</hi> raising an Host without number, came against <hi>Greece,</hi> euen then also our Ancestors ouercame their Ancestors both by Sea and Land, whereof the Trophees erected are tokens. But the greatest testimonie is the freedome of the Cities, in which you were borne and bred. For you worship no man as Lord, but the gods alone, of such Ancestors are you descended. I speake not this, as though you degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from them. For many daies are not past, since ordering your selues in battell in the Field against these their posteritie, by the fauour of the gods you ouercame them being many more in number than your selues. And at that time you shewed your selues valiant to the end to make <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> King. Now when the fight is for your owne safetie,<note place="margin">A man is nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to himself.</note> you ought to be much more forward and resolute. Besides you ought to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident now than at that time; for then hauing had no triall of them, albeit you saw their number infinite, yet you durst charge them with braue <hi>Grecian</hi> mindes; now finding by experience that, though their number were neuer so great, yet they had not the heart to abide you;<note place="margin">Experience of an enemie.</note>

It is true, they haue left you, and are fled to them, and for my part, whosoeuer beginneth first to run, I had rather see them with the enemie, than on your side. But if any of you faint in minde, because the enemy hath many, you haue no horse, let him consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">Horse in the field.</note> that ten thousand horse are no more than ten thousand men. For no man was euer slaine in battell by the biting or stroke of a horse. Men they are that performe, whatsoeuer is done in fight. As for vs, our mounting is much more firme, and stedfast, than theirs. They hang vpon their horse, and are not only in feare of vs, but to be shaken off also from their horses, and fall to the ground. We contrariwise haue sure footing, and shall be able with more assurednesse, to strike any man, that approcheth vs, &amp; to direct our aime with more certainty. One aduantage the hors-men haue, that they may more securely run away, than we. But in case you feare not to fight, but mislike only that <hi>Tissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes</hi> will not be your guide,<note place="margin">Scarcitie of prouision.</note> nor the King prepare a market for you, you shall doe well to consider, whether is better, to haue <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> your guide, who euery where seekes to entrap you, or to take guides of your owne choice, who if at any time they proue false, offend against their owne soules and bodies. As for prouision, whether is it better to buy a poore pittance for much mony (which now, being out of pay, will grow scant amongst vs) out of a market, which they shall furnish, or hauing the victory, to vse what measure euery man thinketh fittest for his owne turne. But if you know these things to be so, and feare notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the passage of riuers,<note place="margin">Passage of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</note> thinking it will be deceitful and dangerous for you, consider if the <hi>Barbarians</hi> haue not herein also notably plaid the fooles; For all riuers, albeit farre from their springs they haue hard passage, yet at their heads a man may go ouer without wetting his knees.

Besides to leaue behind vs our vnnecessarie stuffe, and to take with vs only such as for warre, or for meat, or drinke we stand in need of, to the end that most of vs be in Armes, and as few, as may be, busie themselues with vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie cariage.

For you see, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie durst not make open warre against vs, till they had laid hold vpon our Coronels, imagining, that so long as we had Coronels, and were obedient vnto them, we were able enough to goe thorow stich with the warre.

If any other man, albeit but a priuate Souldier, conceiue of a better course, let him speake. For we all in common stand in need of safetie. Then said <hi>Cherisophus</hi>: If ought else be needfull besides the things, that <hi>Xenophon</hi> hath mentioned, it may be done hereafter: Those things, he hath spoken of, it seemeth fit, they should be decreed. All, that are of the same opinion, let them hold vp their hands. They all held vp t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If now therefore it be agreed vpon, who shall leade the <hi>Plesium</hi> and order the Front, who the Flankes, who the Reare, we shall not be driuen to consult, when the enemie approcheth, but only execute that, which is concluded. If any man can aduise vs better, let vs giue eare to him; if not, let <hi>Cherisophus</hi> haue the leading, because he is a <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> two of the eldest Coronels command the Flankes, I and <hi>Timasion,</hi> as the youngest, be in the Reare. And from hence forward, after we haue made triall of this forme, we will vpon all occasions take counsell, what is best to be done.</q>
If any man can direct vs better, he hath libertie to speake. When no man spake against the motion, he said: They that allow of that, which is propounded, hold vp their hands.
So it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed. <q>Now, quoth he, you are to depart, and put the decree in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And whosoeuer he be amongst you, that desireth to see his kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and friends, let him remember to shew himselfe a man of valour. For otherwise there is no hope thereof: and he, that desireth life, let him endeuour to ouercome.

And if he couet riches, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie must be the meanes to obtaine them. They that are Masters of the Field, are Masters of their owne, and of their fortunes also, whom they subdue.</q>
Assoone, as these things were spoken, all arose and departing, set fire on the Carts, and Tents, and on the things, that might wel be spared. Some they parted with their friends, the rest they burned; and so went to break-fast. Whilest they were at break-fast, came <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> with about thirtie Horses, and called out the Coronels to parley. He spake thus:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mithridates</hi> fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned speech.</note>
               <q>I, ô <hi>Grecians,</hi> was (as you know) faithfull vnto <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as long as he liued, and now am a well-willer of yours, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but remaine in great perplexitie. If then I could see, you tooke any safe course, I would come vnto you my selfe, and bring my followers with me. Tell me then, I pray, what your purpose is, as to one, that is your friend, and wisheth you well, and resolued to proceed with you in the same iourney. The Coronels consulting together resolued vpon this answer, and <hi>Cherisophus</hi> deliuered it: Our purpose is, if we be not impeached, to returne home, and to passe thorow your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try endammaging it as little as may be: and if any man hinder vs, to open the way with our Swords.</q>
               <hi>Mithridates</hi> sought to perswade, that without the Kings will and pleasure,<note place="margin">He discouers himselfe by accident.</note> it was impossible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in safetie. Whereby wee vnderstood, there was no great trust to be reposed in him. Besides it was obserued, that one of <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> his familiar friends was in his Traine to see, what was done. And thereupon it seemed good to the Coronels to make a Decree,<note place="margin">Messengers from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> that hereafter no Messenger should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from the Enemie as long, as wee were in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. For with their entercourse they corrupted the Souldiers,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19391:29"/>
and corrupted one Captaine, to wit, <hi>Nicharchus</hi> an <hi>Arcadian,</hi> who in the night time fled to the enemie with about twentie men. When breakfast was ended, passing the riuer <hi>Zathe,</hi> we marched in good order,<note place="margin">

We had not marched far, before <hi>Mithridates</hi> appeared againe, with 200 horse, and 400 archers and slingers, which were very nimble and light. He, as a friend, came close vp to the <hi>Grecians.</hi> Being neere, some of his horse and foot began vpon the sudden to shoot,<note place="margin">Faire words turned into a storme of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilitie.</note> other to sling, and so wound the <hi>Grecians.</hi> The reare of the <hi>Grecians</hi> were faine to endure all, yet could not annoy the enemy. For the <hi>Cretan</hi> bowe carieth not so farre, as the <hi>Persian</hi>; and the <hi>Cretan</hi> archers wearing no armes of defence, were glad to hide themselues within the body of the armed; and the darters were not able to reach the slingers of the enemy. <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> thought good to aduance and follow the enemy; and thereupon fell out with the armed and targetiers of the reare; but could not lay hand vpon any of them. For the <hi>Grecians</hi> had no horsemen, and their foot in so short a race could not ouertake the foot of the enemy, (which had the start so farre before) and it was not safe to giue chase farre from the body of the <hi>Phalange.</hi> Besides, the <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian</hi> horsmen, as they fled, shot backward from their horse, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many that gaue chase. And as farre as the <hi>Grecians</hi> aduanced, so farre must they afterward retire, still maintaining the fight; so that the whole day they marched not aboue 25 furlongs, and yet by Sunne-set they came to the villages. There againe were they much discomforted, and <hi>Cherisopus</hi> and the eldest Coronels blamed <hi>Xenophon,</hi> in that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued the enemie so farre from the <hi>Phalange,</hi> and put himselfe in danger, and yet no whit endangered the enemy. <hi>Xenophon</hi> hearing it, said, that they reprehended him not without cause, and that the action it selfe testified with them.
<q> But I was forced, quoth he, to doe, as I did. For I saw, that standing still we were sore distressed, and not able reciprocally to offend the enemy. And when we fell out, it was, as you say. For gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing chase we little hurt them, and yet retired with great difficultie. The gods be thanked therefore, that I went not out with many, but with a few. So that I did no great harme, and yet haue found out that, which we stand in need of. For now we see by triall, that the enemy shoots and slingeth further, than either the <hi>Cretans,</hi> or our Darters can reach; and when wee fall out after them,<note place="margin">Necessity mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> wee may not goe farre from the <hi>Phalange.</hi> If but a little way, let the Souldiers be neuer so nimble, he shall neuer be able to come vp to a foot-man, that is distant from him as farre, as a bowe can shoot. If therefore we will debarre them from annoying vs in our iourney, we must quickly prouide slingers and horse. I heare there are <hi>Rhodians</hi> in our Campe, of whom the most part are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to haue skill in slinging, and that their slings reach twice as farre,<note place="margin">The <hi>Rhodian</hi> slings.</note> as the <hi>Persian</hi> slings.

The <hi>Persian</hi> bowes are great, so that the arrowes, that were gathered vp, serued the <hi>Cretans</hi> to good purpose; For they vsed them much, and endeuoured by raising their compasse to send them a great distance.<note place="margin">It is like they were heauier, than the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the <hi>Cretans.</hi>

               </note> When the sides of the square battell opened too wide, they filled the middest, if the space were narrow, by Companies, if a little wider by fifties, if very wide by <hi>Enomoties.</hi> So that the middest was alway shut vp and full. If a bridge or other straight were to be passed, there was no disorder, because the Captaines euery one led ouer his Company apart, and when a <hi>Phalange</hi> was needfull, sleeued vp one by another. In this manner they marched foure encampings: the fifth brought them to the sight of a Palace, and of many villages about it. The way leading to it was ouer high hills, which began from a mountaine, vnder which a village was situate. The <hi>Grecians</hi> were glad to see the hills, as was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the most part of the enemies forces being Hors-men. But when marching out of the <hi>Champeigne</hi> they had gained the first hill, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending from thence raised their battell vp against the second, the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> were forth with at hand, and cast weapons at them downe from the higher ground, being compelled with stripes to sling, and shoot; and they wounded many, and had the better of the <hi>Grecian</hi> light armed, and shut them vp within the battell of the armed: so that this whole day the Slingers, and Archers did little or rather no seruice, being glad to hide themselues amongst the vnarmed multitude. And when the <hi>Grecian</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, being hardly laid vnto, sought to fall out, they had much adoe to climbe the hill in their armour, whereas the enemy retired with ease. Againe, when they retired to the rest of the armed, their danger was as great. Whereupon the Coronels thought good not to moue the army from the third hill. Notwithstanding they led certaine Targetiers from the right flanke of the square battell toward the mountaine. After these had gotten aboue the heads of the enemy, the enemy forbore to presse vpon such, as descended, fearing to be cut off by our Souldiers, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed them on both sides. Thus marched the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the rest of the day, some by the way vpon the hills, other some right ouer against them on the side of the mountaine, till they came to the villages: where they appointed eight Physicians, because many of the Souldiers were hurt. Here they staied three daies, both to fauour the wounded, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for that much victuall was found, meale, wine, and barley, which last was laid vp for horses in abundance. All these things were stored and laid vp for the ruler of the Prouince. The fourth day they descended into the <hi>Champeigne</hi>; where when <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> had ouertaken them with his forces,<note place="margin">Experience the mistresse of alterations in matters of warre.</note> he taught them by necessitie to encampe in the first village, they reached vnto, and to march no more fighting. For many were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to fight by reason of their wounds, many by carrying the wounded, and no lesse they, that had the armes of both charged vpon their backes. After they had taken vp their lodging, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> comming to the village offered skirmish, in which the <hi>Grecians</hi> had a great deale the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19391:31"/>
For it was much easier to sally, and so represse the enemy, than to march fighting with them, as they followed at their backes. When it was night, the enemy was to depart. For the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> fearing to be assailed by night,<note place="margin">

When the <hi>Grecians</hi> perceiued, that the enemy purposed to depart, and had giuen open no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof, they proclaimed in the hearing of the enemy, that the army should make readie to march.

               </note> that he might haue Souldiers of the Front to accompanie him; for it was too long to wait for any from the Reare. <hi>Cherisophus</hi> sent with him the Targetiers of the Front, and those, that were in the middle of the hollow square battell; he willed also the chosen 300 men, which he had about him in the Front, to follow <hi>Xenophon.</hi> Then they hasted, all they could, to get vp the Mountaine.

<hi>Xenophon</hi> riding from one to another, exhorted the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: <q>Now Companions you striue for <hi>Greece,</hi> now for your wiues and children, now taking a little paines, we shall cleere the rest of our iourney from fight.</q>

When the Coronels heard this, the inuention seemed witty, but the thing it selfe not possible to be performed, by reason there were many hors-men on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of the riuer, who would hinder the formost, &amp; not suffer them to proceed in their worke. Therefore they retired the next day in the way, they came (which led to <hi>Babylon</hi>) to the vnburnt villages, setting afire the villages, where they last quartered, so that the enemie offered not to charge, but became lookers on, wondring what way the <hi>Grecians</hi> meant to take, &amp; what their purpose was. The Coronels &amp; captaines assembled again, &amp; calling together the captiues, enquired of the countries round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, what they were, &amp; of their nature &amp; qualitie.

This conclusion being had, they sacrificed to the gods, that they might haue no impeachment, when it was fit to set forward (for they feared the tops of the mountaines might be anticipated) and commanded, assoone as supper was past, that euerie man should haue his things in a readinesse, and giue himselfe to rest, and after follow in the iourney according to direction.</p>

                  <hi>Tygris.</hi>
               </note> because the <hi>Carduchan</hi> Mountaines being abruptly steepe, lay directly hanging ouer the same Riuer; It seemed good to the Coronels, to continue their march ouer those Mountaines. For they vnderstood by the Captiues, that, after they had once trauersed the <hi>Carduchan</hi> Mountaines, they might passe ouer the Fountaines of <hi>Tygris</hi> in <hi>Armenia,</hi> if they list, if not, they might fetch a compasse about them; and the Fountaines of <hi>Euphrates</hi> were said to be not farre off from the Fountaines of <hi>Tygris,</hi> and that there were some straights in the way. Therefore they marched toward the <hi>Cardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chans,</hi> partly in hope to steale away vnespied, partly to preuent the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, in case he went about to seise vpon the tops of the Mountaines, and stop their march. It was now about the last watch, and so much night left, as would giue space to passe ouer the Plaine. The <hi>Grecians</hi> euen then rising and vpon a signe beginning their march, came by breake of day to the Mountaines foot. <hi>Cherisophus</hi> led the Vaunt, taking with him his accustomed Troopes, and all the light Armed; <hi>Xenophon</hi> and the Reare-Commanders brought vp the Reare with the Armed alone,

hauing neuer a light-armed man with them.

               </note> and taking with them their wiues and children, fled to the mountaines. Great plentie of prouision was found here, and the houses garnished with many brasen vessels, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> left vntouched.

Whilest the reare of the <hi>Grecians</hi> descended from the height of the mountaines to the villages, it being now darke (for by reason of the straitnesse of the way, the whole day was spent in ascending the hill, and descending to the villages) some of the <hi>Carduchans,</hi> albeit but a few (for the <hi>Grecians</hi> fell vpon them at vnawares) gathering together charged the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and killed some of them,<note place="margin">The perill of the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
               </note> and hurt other some with stones and arrowes; and if many of them had beene assembled, they had no question cut off the most part of the army. That night therefore they lodged thus in the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages. The <hi>Carduchans</hi> on the other side lighted many fires in a circle on the mountaines, and so they looked one vpon another.

For the carriage and captiues being many, made the march very slow, and cumbersome. And many of them, that rode, were such, as fought not, and the multitude of people being great, double prouision and carriage was requisite in comparison of that, they should otherwise haue needed.<note place="margin">Execution of the order take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> These things being so decreed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was made for the execution.

The Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were very obedient, vnlesse any man being in loue with a boy, or a woman of the fearest fashion, conueied them away by stealth. And so for that day they proceeded in their march, one while fighting, and another while giuing themselues to rest. The next day fell a sharpe storme, and yet a necessitie was laid vpon vs to continue our march, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our prouision failed. <hi>Cherisophus</hi> led the Vaunt, <hi>Xenophon</hi> brought vp the Reare, and the enemy pressed vs sore; and the Countrey being full of straights, they came vp close, and plied vs wirh arrowes and stones out of slings, so that the <hi>Grecians</hi> sometimes giuing chace, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times retiring, were forced to march on slowly. It fell out often, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19391:34"/>
               <hi>Xenophon</hi> sent word to that Vaunt to stay, especially at that time, being roundly put to by the enemy. <hi>Cherisophus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Why the Front oftentimes made Alt.</note> that at other times vpon the receit of such messages made vsually Alt, made not Alt then, but led away apace, and commanded the rest to follow. So that it appeared, there was some great occasion, and yet there was no leisure to send and know the cause. The march seemed to the bringers vp to be a plaine run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and there was then slaine <hi>Cleonymus</hi> a braue, and valiant <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian,</hi> being strucken into the side with an arrow thorow his target,<note place="margin">Hee had no Curace on.</note> and Souldiers coat; and <hi>Basius</hi> an <hi>Arcadian</hi> pierced in the head. When they were come to their quarter, <hi>Xenophon</hi> attired, as he was, stepped forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to <hi>Cherisophus,</hi> and blamed him, he made not Alt, whereby he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them in the Reare to fight in their flight; and now, quoth hee, we haue lost two gallant and worthy Souldiers, and were neither able to bring them off, nor yet to bury them. <hi>Cherisophus</hi> answered; Looke vp, quoth he, to those mountaines and behold how vnpassable they are. There is no way, but that steepe one, you see, and vpon it you may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the huge multitude, which haue taken, and doe guard the passage. The cause of my speeding, and not staying for you, was to trie, if by any meanes I might preuent their seising vpon the height. For the guides affirme, there is no other way but this. But I haue two guides, quoth <hi>Xenophon</hi>; For when they ceased not to molest vs, I laid an ambush,<note place="margin">Ambushes laid in a march, and why.</note> whereby both we found way to breathe, and also killed some of them, and some other wee endeuoured to take aliue, for this cause especially, that we might vse such, as knew the Countrey, for guides: and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately bringing forth the men, they examined them apart, whether they knew any other way, than that, which was in sight. One of them, albeit he were diuersly put in feare, would not confesse. When they could get nothing out of him, that was to purpose, they slew him, the other looking on. Hee, that remained aliue, said, that his Companion would confesse nothing, because he had bestowed a daughter of his in mariage to a man dwelling thereabout. But I, said he,<note place="margin">About the passage.</note> will teach you a way, thorow which the very carriage may easily passe. Being demanded, If that way had no impediment or incumbrance, he answered, There was a top of a hill, which vnlesse it were possessed, it would be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to proceed further. Hereupon it was thought good,<note place="margin">How to giue vpon an enemy that possesseth a straight vpon a hill.</note> to call for the Captaines of the Targetiers, and of the armed Foot, and to impart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the estate of the present affaires; and to aske, if any would shew himselfe a gallant, and willingly vndertake the iourney.

When the Reare was come to a hollow bottome, thorow which they must needs passe ere they came to ascend the steepe hill, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> tumbled downe round stones, of which euery one was of weight suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to load a waggon, and many other great and little stones, which rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and beating vpon the rockes, came bouncing with such force, as if they had beene sent out of a sling, and made it impossible to come neere the way. Some of the Captaines seeing that way shut vp, sought to finde another. This continued till it was darke. The <hi>Grecians</hi> when they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that their departure could not be discerned, went hence to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For the Reare had not dined that day. The enemy ceased not the whole night to send downe stones, which might easily appeare by the continuall sound and noise of the fall. In the meane time those, that had the guide,<note place="margin">The <hi>Grecians</hi> gain the height of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> fetching a compasse, fell vpon the enemies guards, as they sat by the fire; and killing some, and giuing chace to the rest, themselues maintained the place that night, as if they had gained the top. But they were deceiued; for there remained yet a little knop aboue them, neere which the straight it selfe was, where the enemies guards did sit. There was indeed a passage from thence, that led to the enemy. That night therefore they spent there. As soone as day appeared, they aduanced silently, and in good order against the enemy. They were neere, before they could be descried, because of a mist, that fell at the same instant. When they saw one another the trumpet sounded, and the <hi>Grecians</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a shout, aduanced against the enemy; who receiued not the charge, but forsaking the way, and flying, lost some few of their people. For they were light-armed. The rest of the army with <hi>Cherisophus,</hi> hearing the sound of the trumpet, made all haste to ascend by the common way. Some of the Coronels tooke by-pathes, euery one, as it came to hand, and climbing, as they could, drew one another vp by the pikes, and so they were the first, that ioyned with them, that had won the top. <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> with halfe the Reare, followed the way, that the guide had showne to the first (for it was the easiest for the carriage-beasts) the other halfe he ordered after the carriage-beasts.<note place="margin">The carriage in the middest.</note> Marching forward, they chanced vpon a hill hanging ouer the way, which was held by the enemy; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof they were driuen to a necessitie, either by force to dislodge

the enemy from the place and cut him off, or else to be secluded from the rest of the army. The souldiers might haue followed the way, that the rest held, &amp; so haue freed themselues from danger, but the carriage could be led no other way. Exhorting therefore one another, they charged vp the hill, ordering their Companies euery one in File,<note place="margin">Raising of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against a hill. <gap reason="foreign">

The <hi>Barbarians</hi> seeing them ascend each one, as he could make shift for himselfe, did neither shoot nor sling at them, as they approched the way; but presently forsooke the Hill.

Notwithstanding <hi>Xenophon</hi> reputing in his minde, that, if he should leaue the Hill alreadie gained without a Guard, the enemie seising againe vpon it, might distresse the cariage in passing by (for the cariage by reason of the straights were extended into a great length) he left vpon the Hill the Captaines <hi>Cephisodorus</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Kephisophon</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> and <hi>Archagoras</hi> a banished <hi>Argiue</hi>;<note place="margin">Securing of that Hill.</note> himselfe with the rest continued his march against the second Hill, which also was taken after the same manner. There remained yet another Hill more steepe, than the two former, euen the same, that the night before, was by the first as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenders won from the enemies Guards, that sat by the fire; to which when the <hi>Grecians</hi> approched, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> forsooke it without fight; which made the <hi>Grecians</hi> wonder, and imagine, they feared to be round encompassed and charged on all sides; but the truth was, that descry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the top, what was done behinde, they hasted away to fall vpon the Reare. <hi>Xenophon,</hi> and the youngest sort of Souldiers had gotten vp the Hill, and he commanded the rest to follow, till the last Captaines were come vp, and then he willed them to march forward in the way, and when they came to euen ground to lay downe their Armes.<note place="margin">

The <hi>Barbarians</hi> hauing wrought this feat, conueied themselues toward the Hill opposite against the top, where <hi>Xenophon</hi> was; and he by an Interpreter treated with them about truce, and about recouering the dead bodies out of their hands.

Whilest <hi>Xenophon</hi> was at dinner, there came running vnto him two young men (for euerie man knew, they might haue free accesse vnto him both at dinner and supper, and that they might in sleepe awake him, and impart any thing, that should seeme to tend to the good of the march) and told him they chanced to be a gathering sticks for firing, and that amongst the Rocks, on the other side the Riuer, they espied an old man, and a woman, and young maids laying vp (as it were) bundles of Clothes tied together in a hollow Caue of the Rocke. Which when they saw, and conceiued withall, there was no danger in the passage, considering the enemies Horse could not by any meanes come there, they pulled off their Clothes, and taking their drawne Daggers in their hands, they entred into the Riuer in purpose to swim ouer, if they could not otherwise passe. But going on they found themselues ouer, before they had wet their priuities; so that taking with them the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were hidden they returned, and came safe to this side back againe. <hi>Xenophon</hi> hearing this, dranke a health, and commanded the Cup should be filled to the two young men, and to pray to the gods (who had reuealed the dreame and passage) to finish the remnant of all, that should appertaine to the good of the iourney. Assoone as the health was ended, he led the young men to <hi>Cherisophus,</hi> and declared vnto him the newes, which they brought. Who hearing these things, drunke also a health; after which commanding the Souldiers to trusse vp their baggage, and calling the Coronels together, they aduised about the best meanes of passage, and of repulsing them, that opposed the Front,<note place="margin">The passage of a Riuer.</note> and of

auoiding the danger of those, that were like to fall vpon the Reare. The resolution was, that <hi>Cherisophus</hi> should leade the Vant, &amp; passe ouer first with halfe the Armie; the other halfe should remaine behinde with <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> and the cariage, and vnarmed multitude, should be conueied in the middest. When these things were thus determined, they began to march. The young men led the way hauing the riuer on their left hand. The way which tended to the Foord,<note place="margin">Halfe a mile.</note> was about foure Furlongs in length. As they marched forward on one side, the enemies Hors-men embattelled mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched against them on the other.

The cariage-beasts also seemed, as though they had bin fettered with the snow and had much ado to arise;<note place="margin">Inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Snow.</note> and the Souldiers, that lay vpon the ground, vpon whom the Snow fell, and slid not off, became miserably distressed.

The Snow was in this place a fathom deepe;<note place="margin">Snow a fathom deep.</note> so that many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage beasts, and slaues were lost, and as good as 30 Souldiers. They maintained fires the whole night, by reason that there was great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of wood in the place, where they encamped; and yet they, that were benighted found no wood; neither would those that first were quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, giue the late commers accesse to the fires, vnlesse in recompence they imparted vnto them wheat, or some other victuall, such as they had.

After the Snow was melted, there appeared great pits vpon the earth, where the fire was made, by which a man might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iudge of the depth of the Snow. From thence they marched through Snow the whole next day, and many of the Souldiers were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the disease called <hi>Boulimia.

               </note> and that they would immediatly stand vp, if they had any thing to eat. Therefore going to the cariage-beasts, if he saw any drinke, or victuals, he distributed it either by himselfe, or by such as were able to runne about, to those that were pinched with hunger, and they had no sooner eaten, but they stood vp, and marched. In this march <hi>Cherisophus</hi> about twilight came to a Village, where he found women and maids drawing, and carying water before a Fort. The Interpreter told them in the <hi>Persian</hi> tongue, that they came to the Viceroy from the King.

               <hi>Cherisophus,</hi> because it was late, entred with the water-bearers into the Fort vnto the Gouernour, where he, and as many as the place was capable of, quartered that night. The rest of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that could not reach to the iournies end, lodged that night without meat or fire, so that some of them perished there.

For the feet.</note> The remedy against the Snow for the eyes was the wearing some blacke thing before them, while they marched: for the feet, continuall mouing and resting no where; and in the night time putting off their shooes from their feet. As many as slept shod, the strings of their shooes were imprinted in their feet, and their shooes fast frozen to them. For there were some, that after they had worne out their old shooes, made themselues countrey shooes of raw hides newly drawne from the Oxe. Some therefore of the Souldiers were left behind inforced by such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities; who casting their eyes vpon a peece of ground that was black, by reason the Snow was gone, they imagined it was melted there. And it was indeed melted by a Spring, that sent out vapours in a wooddy val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley not farre from thence.

At the last, when he profited no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he began to be angry; they bid him kill them, if he would; for they were able to goe no further. Hereupon it was thought best, to put a feare, if it might be, into the enemy that followed. The darknesse was now come, and the enemy approached with much tumult and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie amongst themselues about the prey they had taken. There they of

They had not gone foure furlongs, but they hapned vpon other Souldiers, that rested in the way vpon the Snow, being also couered with it, and had put out no watch or guard.

When it was toward day, <hi>Xenophon</hi> sent the youngest Souldiers about him vnto the sicke, commanding to raise them from the ground, and to compell them to march on. In the meane space were certaine men dispatched away by <hi>Cherisophus,</hi> to inquire how it was with the Reare; who saw them gladly, and deliuered the sicke men vnto them to be conueighed to the Campe.

The houses were vnder ground,<note place="margin">Houses vnder ground.</note> and the doore of them like the mouth of a Well, but broad and large beneath.

When the eight day was come, <hi>Xenophon</hi> deliuered the <hi>Comarch</hi> to <hi>Cherisophus</hi> to be their guide, but left all his houshold to him, except only one of his sonnes, who was lately come to mans estate.

               </gap>he enemy, as you see, hath taken the top of the mountaine; It is time for vs to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, how we shall most commodiously come to fight with them. Mine opinion is, therefore, that we first command the Souldiers to dine, and then in the meane space consult, whether it be best to passe ouer the mountaine to day or to morrow.
<q>And mine opinion is, said <hi>Cleanor,</hi> that after dinner we presently arme, and with all celeritie goe against them. For if we linger this day, the enemy, that beholds vs now, will wax bolder, and other animated with their boldnesse, will ioyne vnto them. After him <hi>Xenophon</hi> spake, and said: I conceiue thus; that if we must needs fight, we are to prepare our selues to fight with the greatest aduantage, we are able. But if we desire to passe the hill with least trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we ought to consider, how to receiue fewest wounds, and lose fewest men. The hill, which we see, is more than 60 furlongs in length,<note place="margin">7 miles and more.</note> and men no where appeare to hinder vs, but onely vpon the way, of our march. It is better therefore to endeuour priuily, to steale, if we can, and to lay bold of, and, as it were,<note place="margin">A double dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage.</note> to snatch away by preuention a peece of the void mountaine, than to fight both against a strong place, and against men ready, and resolued to trie their fortune. For it is much more easie to mount a steepe passage without fight, than to trauerse a Plaine beset on euery side with enemies; and a man not fighting shall by night better discerne any thing before his feet, than by day, if he be in fight; and rough places are more euen to his feet, that fighteth not, than plaine ground to him, whose head is in danger.

your childhood how to steale; &amp; that it is no shame, but a praise-worthy thing to steale such things, as the law forbiddeth not to steale, &amp; to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, you steale and conceale your theft with more cunning, the law or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth, that if you be taken with the manner, you shall be well whipped for your paines. Now therefore it is a fit time for you to shew your edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and to beware that in stealing the mountaine we be not taken with the manner, lest we be beaten with many stripes. <hi>Cherisophus</hi> replied: And I likewise heare, that you <hi>Athenians</hi> steale the riches of your State most artificially, albeit it be no small danger for him that stealeth; and that the best of you, if the best desire to beare rule in the State, are guilty of this crime. So that it is good time for you also to shew your education. I, quoth <hi>Xenophon,</hi> am ready after we haue supped, to goe with the Reare, and seize vpon the top of the mountaine; Guides I am prouided of. For our light-armed tooke some of the theeues that followed to surprise vs; and I heare, that the mountaine is not vnpassable, but is fed with Goats and Neat. So that if we take any part thereof, we shall finde also a way for our cariage-beasts; and I hope, the enemy after we haue once gained the height, and are in euen ground with them, will no longer maintaine the place, the rather because they haue no great minde to descend now vnto vs into the Plaine.</q>
Yea, but what need you goe, quoth <hi>Cherisophus,</hi> and leaue the Reare. Rather, if no man be willing to goe of himselfe, let vs make choice of some one or other. Hereupon <hi>Aristonymus</hi> the <hi>Methy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> came vp, and presented himselfe with armed foot, and <hi>Aristaeus</hi> the <hi>Chian</hi> with light-armed, and <hi>Nicomachus</hi> the <hi>Oetaean</hi> likewise with light-armed;<note place="margin">The signe.</note> and the signe was agreed vpon, namely, to make fires, after the top was taken.

Then <hi>Cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophus</hi> led the Army forward toward the enemy some 10 furlongs,<note place="margin">A mile and a quarter.</note> as though he had a purpose to continue his march that way. When they had supped, and it was night, those that were appointed proceeded on, and tooke the top of the mountaine; the rest of the Armie remained in the place, where they were. The enemy perceiuing that the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine was taken, watched and made fires all the night. By breake of day <hi>Cherisophus</hi> offered sacrifice, and led the Armie in the way, they marched before, and they, that had wonne the hill, and the height thereof, made head against the enemy, who in greatest number remained vpon the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie way that lay toward the top,<note place="margin">The <hi>Grecians</hi> beat the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> but a part of them aduanced against the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that had gained the height, who came to hands, before the whole Armie ioyned; in which conflict the <hi>Grecians</hi> had the better, and followed the chace vpon the enemy.

After this they marched toward the <hi>Taochans,</hi> 30 <hi>Parasangs</hi> in fiue encampings.

Hereupon they aduised in common; and when <hi>Xenophon</hi> asked what impediment there was, why it might not be entred, <hi>Cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophus</hi> answered:
<q>There is no other way, but this one, that you see; and when any man proffereth to ascend, they tumble downe stones from the high rocke hanging ouer, and vpon whomsoeuer the stones light, thus is hee serued; and withall shewed many Souldiers that had their legs and sides crushed, and broken a peeces. But when the stones are spent, quoth <hi>Xenophon,</hi> what other impediment shall we haue? For we see but these few oppose against vs, and of them but two or three armed men.

For there were, that followed them out of the Countrey, which they had fired, and of them some were taken, others slaine, by the Reare, which laid an ambush for them, and they got besides 20 wicker Targets couered with raw and hairie hides of Oxen. When the cry grew more and more, and those, that came after, still ran with all speed to the other, that cried in the Vant, and as more trooped together, the cry the more increased; <hi>Xenophon</hi> conceiued it was not without great cause. Therefore getting to hors-backe, and taking with him <hi>Lucius</hi> and the Horse, he speeded on to succour. They heard streight way the voices of Souldiers comforting one another, &amp; crying, The Sea, the Sea; whereupon they ran all forward, both they, that came in the Reare, and also the cariage-beasts, and Horses. When all were come to the top of the Mountaine, they fell to embracing both of one another, and also of the Coronels and Captaines, and that not without teares, and presently, it is not knowne by whose commandement, the Souldiers ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried together stones, and raised vp a great heape, and laid thereon a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Targets couered with raw Oxe hides, and of staues and of wicker targets taken from the enemy. The guide himselfe cut asunder the wicker targets, &amp; perswaded the rest to do the like. After this the <hi>Grecians</hi> sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their guide hauing giuen him a Horse, a siluer bowle, a <hi>Persian</hi> sute of apparell, &amp; 10 <hi>Daricks.</hi> Aboue all other things he desired the rings,<note place="margin">6. li. - 10. s.</note> they wore, &amp; had a great many giuen him by the Souldiers.

enemies. They answered, because you go about to inuade our countrey. The Coronels willed the interpreter to say, they came not to offer wrong, but hauing made war against the king, they returned into <hi>Greece,</hi> and would faine come to the Sea. The <hi>Macrons</hi> asked the <hi>Grecians</hi> againe, whether they would giue assurance of that,<note place="margin">Assurance of a Truce.</note> they said; Who answered, they were readie to giue, &amp; take assurance. Hereupon the <hi>Macrons</hi> gaue to the <hi>Grecians</hi> a <hi>Barbarian</hi> speare, and the <hi>Grecians</hi> a <hi>Grecian</hi> speare to them. For they said, that this was the manner of assurance amongst them. But both parties called the gods to witnesse. After assurance giuen the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crons</hi> helped the <hi>Grecians</hi> to cut down trees, &amp; leuelled the way to further our passage, &amp; came and conuersed with the <hi>Grecians</hi> furnishing out such a market, as they were able, and led them forward three daies iourney, till they had set them vpon the <hi>Colchan</hi> mountaines.<note place="margin">The <hi>Colchan</hi> Mountaines.</note> There was in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey a high Mountaine, but yet passable, vpon which the <hi>Colchans</hi> had ranged themselues in battell.

               <hi>Xenophon</hi> aduised them, that laying aside the forme of a <hi>Phalange,</hi> the best course would be to put themselues into single Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies drawne out in File. <q>For a <hi>Phalange,</hi> said he, will soone be broken by reason of the inequalitie of way, which in some part of the Mountaine will be easie enough, in other parts hard to ascend.
And it will quickly discourage the Souldiers, to see the <hi>Phalange</hi> disordered, in which they march. Furthermore if we aduance in a large Front, the enemie, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth vs in number, will ouer-front vs, and vse his multitude to most aduantage; if in a narrow Front, it will be no maruell to see our <hi>Phalange</hi> cut in peeces with the number of missiue weapons and with multitude of men, that will fall vpon it; which comming to passe in any part, the whole <hi>Phalange</hi> will be distressed. Therefore, as I said, I hold it best to order our selues in companies stretched out in file or depth, euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie hauing such distance from other,<note place="margin">

                  </note> that the out-most companies may ouer-front, and be without the points of the enemies wings. So shall we both gain the aduantage of ouer-fronting their army, &amp; marching on the companies being in file, our best men shall first giue on vpon the enemie. And let euerie companie make choise of the fittest way for ascent. Now for the spaces betwixt each companie it will not be easie for the enemie to enter them, the companies flancking euerie space, nor yet to cut off a companie aduancing in such depth. And if any companie chance to be distressed, the next companie is to succour it. And in case any one of the companies attaine the top of the Hill, assure your selues no enemie will keepe his ground.</q>
The aduice was approued by all, and they drew their companies euerie one into a File.
<hi>Xenophon</hi> going from the right wing to the left, said to the Souldiers;<q> These, ô Souldiers, whom you see, are the only hindrance of our passage thither, whither we haste with so great desire. If it be possible, we must deuoure them raw.</q> 
When euerie man was in his place, and euerie companie in File, the companies of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med amounted to about 80 in number, and euerie companie contained

The enemie perceiuing it, sought to meet them, and some of them drawing to the right, some to the left hand, they rent their <hi>Phalange</hi> asunder, and left much void space in the middest. When the <hi>Arcadian Peltasts,</hi> whose Captaine <hi>Aeschines</hi> the <hi>Acarnan</hi> was, saw them distracted, and seuered, they imagined they fled, and ran on with as much speed, as they could. They were the first, that gained the Mountaine. The armed <hi>Arcadians</hi> commanded by <hi>Cleanor</hi> the <hi>Orchomenian</hi> followed at their heeles. The enemie stood firme in no place, after they saw them come running on, but fled, some one way, some another.<note place="margin">The <hi>Grecians</hi> win the Hill.</note> So the <hi>Grecians</hi> ascending the Mountaine quartered in many Villages replenished with all things necessarie. In other things there was no cause of maruell, only there were many Bee-hiues, the Hony-combes whereof whosoeuer eat, they became euerie man mad,<note place="margin">Strange hony.</note> and scoured vpward and downeward, and none was able to stand vpon their feet. They that eat but a little were like drunken, that eat much like mad, and some like dead men; and there lay so many vpon the ground, that a man would haue thought an ouerthrow had been receiued from an enemie: which caused much discouragement amongst the Troopes. The next day there was no man found dead, and they came to their right sense about the same houre, they fel into their malady. The third &amp; fourth day after they arose, as if they had receiued some medicine. From thence they marched seuen <hi>Parasangs</hi> in two encampings, &amp; came to the sea side to <hi>Trapezond</hi> a <hi>Grecian</hi> city well inhabited, which is situate vpon the <hi>Eux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine</hi> Sea, being a Colonie of the <hi>Sinopeans</hi> planted in the <hi>Colchan</hi> Countrey.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is formerly discoursed, what the <hi>Grecians</hi> did in ascending with <hi>Cyrus</hi> vp to the higher Countries, and in their returne as farre as the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, and how they came downe to <hi>Trapezond</hi> a <hi>Grecian</hi> Citie, and sacrificed (according to their Vowes made for their safe returne) as soone as they came to a Countrey that was friend. Afterward meeting together, they consulted about the remnant of their march homeward. <hi>Antileon</hi> the <hi>Thurian</hi> was the first that stood vp, and he spake in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<q>I, my companions, haue hitherto wearied my selfe in trussing vp baggage, in going and running and bearing Armes, and keeping order in marching, in guarding, and in fighting. Now, seeing we are come to the Sea, my desire is, laying these trauels aside, to saile forth the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of my iourney, and as <hi>Vlysses</hi> did, lying downe, and stretching my lims out at full length, to sleepe till we come into <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Their resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to goe by Sea.</note>
               </q>
The Souldiers hearing his words gaue an applause, as if he had spoken well; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, and almost all, that were present, repeated the same words in generall. Then <hi>Cherisophus</hi> stood vp and said: <q>
                  <hi>Anaxibius,</hi> that hath the command of the Nauie, is my very good friend.
Wherefore,<note place="margin">The <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Admirall.</note> if you send me to him, I shall returne, as I conceiue, with Gallies and Ships sufficient for your transportation; your selues, since you are resolued to goe by Sea, stay here, till you heare of me againe. I will returne as soone as I can. The Souldiers hearing this, were exceeding ioyfull, and decreed that he should presently take his iourney. After him <hi>Xenophon</hi> stood vp, and spoke to this effect: <hi>Cherisophus</hi> is sent away, and we must
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19391:45"/>
remaine here till he returneth. I will therefore aduise with you, what will be our best course,<note place="margin">Safe forraging.</note> till he returnes. For neither is our market plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull enough, nor yet haue we wherewith to buy, excepting only a few, and the Countrey is enemy, and we in danger to lose many Souldiers, if to bring in prouision, we straggle out of our Campe carelesly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out guard. Therefore mine opinion is, that it will be expedient for vs to make incursions into the Countrey, to the end to furnish our selues with things needfull, but not to wander abroad negligently, left you come in danger; and these things I would haue left vnto our care. It was so decreed. You may, if you please, heare besides, what I am further to say: Some of you, no doubt, will goe out to bring in prey. I hold it therefore best,<note place="margin">Notice whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> that whosoeuer is disposed to issue forth, signifie so much vnto vs, and withall whither he purposeth to goe, that we may see both how many issue out, and how many remaine at home, &amp; also make our selues readie for all euents, and that if it be needfull to giue aide, we may know, whither to addresse our selues. And that if any, that haue no great experience, vndertake an enterprise, the matter be referred to our deliberation, to the end we may enquire, of what power and strength they are,<note place="margin">In what place.</note> against whom the enterprise is intended. These things also were so decreed. I pray thinke vpon this likewise, quoth he, that because we haue taken away the enemies riches, they also will do, what they can, to prey vpon vs, and vpon any fit occasion lie in wait, and seeke to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap vs;<note place="margin">Se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinels about the Campe.</note> I thinke it therefore meet to put out Sentinells round about our Campe. For if we diuide our selues into small parties, and so guard and scout, it will not be so easie for them to hunt vs. Furthermore, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration must be had of this: If we were assured, that <hi>Cherisophus</hi> would returne, bringing sufficient shipping with him, it would be needlesse to speake that, which I am about to speake; but seeing his returne is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, I am of opinion, that we ought here also to make prouision of shipping.<note place="margin">Prouision of shipping.</note> For if he returne, and there chance here to be more ships, than we need, we shall saile away with greater ease. But if he bring none, then may we vse them, which we haue prouided here. For I see ships often times passing by. If then requesting long ships of the <hi>Trapezuntines,</hi> we take these passengers, and keepe them, laying aside their Ruthers, till the number arise great enough for our purpose, it may be, we shall not faile of such a transportation, as we desire. These things were also decreed. You may be pleased also to consider, whether it be not reason vpon common cost to maintaine such, as we shall finde in the ships, so long, as they shall remaine here through our occasion, and to giue them wages, that as they profit vs, so also they may profit themselues by vs. This was in like manner decreed. I conceiue further, quoth he, if shipping sufficient faile, it will be expedient for vs, to command the Cities of the Sea-coast to make the wayes, by which we are to passe, plaine and euen, (for they are reported to be rough,<note place="margin">Reparation of Wayes.</note> and hard to march in) and I make no question, but they will easily assent, both because they are in feare, as also because they would gladly be rid of vs.</q>

When <hi>Xenophon</hi> saw this worke of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he commanded the Houses on the left hand to be likewise fired; which being made of Wood caught fire quickly, whereby the enemie forsooke the Houses on that side also, and the Armie was annoied only by those in Front, who, doubtlesse were like to fall vpon the Reare, in their retreat and departure. Here <hi>Xenophon</hi> gaue order, that all,<note place="margin">A meanes to retreat.</note> who were without the reach of missiue weapons, should bring Wood, and lay it betwixt the enemie and them, and when the store was sufficient, it was set on fire. The Houses were also fired, that stood next the Rampier of the Towne ditch, that the enemie might be busied on all sides. So by the helpe of fire betwixt the enemie, and them, they made a hard retreat. With this fire were consumed the whole Citie, the Houses, Turrets, Rampier, and all things else, except the Citadell. The next day the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> hauing gained sufficient prouision retired toward their Campe: but because they feared the way, that led toward <hi>Trapezond,</hi> as being steepe and narrow, they laid a false ambush.

Their Targets being of Brasse cast glimmering light here and there thorow the Wood, which the enemie descrying feared as much, as if it had been a true ambush. In the meane time the Armie was descended into good ground, and the <hi>Mysian,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had now gained way enough, gaue the word to his companions euerie man to shift away amaine, and immediatly he &amp; his consorts fled.

The <hi>Cretans</hi> forsaking the ordinarie way (for they said the enemie might out-run them and take them prisoners) and conueying themselues into Woods, and tumbling downe thorow steepe and rough Forrests, came safe to the Armie: but the <hi>Mysian</hi> flying in the ordinarie way, cried out for succour. He was rescued &amp; brought away wounded, and the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that rescued him, retired by little and little, casting Darts, hauing also amongst them a few <hi>Cretans,</hi> who shot at the enemie. So they came all safe to the Campe. When neither <hi>Cherisophus</hi> returned, and no more prouision was to be found for the Campe, they decreed to proceed on their iourney,<note place="margin">They continue their iourney by Land.</note> and put on ship-board the sicke, and those that were aboue fortie yeeres of age, and children, and women, and vessels vnnecessary for the iourney; and shipping likewise <hi>Philesius</hi> and <hi>Sophonetus</hi> the eldest of the Coronels, they committed the charge of all to them.

After this one of them beginning, all the rest sung and marched forward by measure, and passing through the rankes and armes of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> forthwith aduanced against the enemy toward a Fort, which seemed ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to be won. It lay before the Citie, which is called the <hi>Metropolis,</hi> or mother Citie, and is held in chiefe estimation amongst the <hi>Mosynecans,</hi> and for it they warred one against another. For they, who enioyed it, had their feet vpon the neckes of the other <hi>Mosynecans.</hi> They said, that the present possessours had no right nor lawfull possession, but being common to all, they had done wrong in entring &amp; detaining it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues alone. Some of the <hi>Grecians</hi> also followed them, not by order or appointment of the Coronels, but in greedinesse of pillage. The enemy held himselfe coy a while, but when he saw them neere the Fort, he salli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and putting them to flight killed a great number of the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and some of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> thatascended with them; and followed the chace, till he might see the army of the <hi>Grecians</hi> ready to come to reskue. Then turning about he retired; and cutting off the heads of those, that were slaine, shewed them to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and to their enemies, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all danced, singing a kinde of measure. The <hi>Grecians</hi> were much grieued, that by this action the enemy was emboldned, and that the <hi>Grecians</hi> in good number were seene to flie, which they neuer did before in all this iourney.
But <hi>Xenophon</hi> calling the Souldiers together, spake vnto them in this sort: <q>Be not dismayed, (O Souldiers) with that, which is happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The good of it is as great, as the euill. For first of all you now know certainly, that those, that shall be our guides, are enemies to them, vnto whom of necessitie we must be enemies.

This day therefore they rested. The next day after they had sacrificed, and the sacrifice portended good fortune, they dined, and ordering their companies in file,<note place="margin">

For some of the light-armed of the enemy ran forth, and cast stones; which quickly were repressed by our Archers &amp; <hi>Peltasts.</hi> The rest aduanced leisurely first toward the Fort, from which the day before the <hi>Barbarians</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> were put to flight. For there the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie stood embattelled, and made head against the <hi>Grecians.</hi> And first they fought and made good the place against the <hi>Peltasts,</hi> but when the armed approached, immediatly they turned their backs. The <hi>Peltasts</hi> followed with speed, giuing chace vpward toward the mother City or Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, the armed moued forward in order. When they were come vp to the houses of the Metropolis, the enemies ioyned and fought all together, and threw darts: and hauing thicke and long pikes, such as a man could hardly weild, with those they endeuoured to defend themselues hand to hand. When the <hi>Grecians</hi> gaue no ground, but ioyntly pushed forward, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> fled, and all of them forsooke the Fort.<note place="margin">The Fort ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> Their King that was in a woodden Tower built in the Citadell (whom in common they nourish, as long as he remaineth there, and guardeth the place) sought not to escape away, nor they that were in the Fort before taken in, but were burnt together with the woodden houses. The <hi>Grecians</hi> rifling and spoyling the place,<note place="margin">Bread a yeare old.</note> found in the houses treasures of bread heaped and hoorded vp, as the <hi>Mosynecans</hi> reported, the last yeare, according to the manner of the countrey. The new corne with the straw lay by it selfe, the most part whereof was eared. There was found also peeces of <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins</hi> salted, and laid vp in vessels, and also the fat of <hi>Dolphins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fat of <hi>Dolphins</hi> Chesnuts.</note> which the <hi>Mosynecans</hi> vse as the <hi>Grecians</hi> doe oyle, and many and great chestnuts in garrets, which haue no manner of cleft in them. They boyle these, and vse them in stead of bread. Wine was found likewise, which being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled seemed sharpe by reason of the sowrenesse, being mingled it had a good sauour, and was pleasant in taste. The <hi>Grecians</hi> hauing dined here marched forward deliuering vp the City to the <hi>Mosynecans</hi> their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates. Of other Forts belonging to the enemy, which they passed by, some of the weaker sort were forsaken, other some willingly yeelded, and gaue themselues into the <hi>Grecians</hi> hands. The most part of them are of this kinde.<note place="margin">10 English mile.</note> They stand distant one from another 80 furlongs more or lesse. When the country people cry out one to another, they heare it from City to City by reason of the height and hollownesse of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. After they were come to the borders of their confederate <hi>Mosyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> they shewed them boyes (rich mens children) that were fed and fatted with sodden Chestnuts, which boyes were exceeding tender and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19391:49"/>
white, and not much lesse in bredth than in length, hauing their backs various, and all the foreparts rased and marked with diuers formes of flowers. They sought also openly to vse the whores, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> brought with them: For that is their manner. All both men and women are white of complexion.<note place="margin">The barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnesse of the <hi>Mosynaecans.</hi>
               </note> They that were in this iourney, held the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey more barbarous, and more differing from the <hi>Grecian</hi> rites of liuing, than all the rest they passed thorow. For they doe openly and before a multitude, that which other men doe, and dare not doe but in priuate; and being alone they demeane themselues, as if they were in company. They speake to themselues, laugh to themselues, and dance, whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they become, as though they sought to please other mens eyes. Thorow this countrey both friend and enemy the <hi>Grecians</hi> marched in eight encampings, and came to the <hi>Chalybes.</hi> These are a people but few in number, and in subiection to the <hi>Mosynecans,</hi> and liue the most part of them vpon iron works.<note place="margin">The <hi>Tibarenes.</hi>
               </note> From thence they passed to the <hi>Tibarenes,</hi> whose countrey is more champaine, and hath Forts situate by the Sea side, that are not very strong. The Coronels resolued to fall vpon this countrey, to the end to gaine some riches for the Army. Therefore they tooke not the hospital gifts which the <hi>Tibarens</hi> sent, but bade them stay till they had taken counsell by the sacrifice which they offred. After they had offred many, at last all the Soothsayers told them plaine, that the gods allowed not of the warre. Therefore they accepted the gifts of hospitality, and marching as thorow a countrey, that was friend, they came to <hi>Cotyora,</hi> a <hi>Grecian</hi> Citie, a colony of the <hi>Synopaeans,</hi> situate in the <hi>Tibaren</hi> territory. Thus far the Armie marched on foot.<note place="margin">The retreat of the <hi>Grecians</hi> was 1352 mile and a halfe to <hi>Cotyora.</hi>
               </note> The length of the descent of the way from the place in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> territory, where the battell was fought, to <hi>Cotyora,</hi> was 122 encampings, 620 <hi>Parasangs,</hi> 10820 furlongs: of the time eight moneths. They staied at <hi>Cotyora</hi> 45 dayes. During this abode they first sacrificed to the gods, and then made shewes euery one according to the manner of his countrey, and proposed games of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, and tooke their prouision partly out of <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> partly out of the territory of the <hi>Cotyorites.</hi> For they neither exhibited a market, nor receiued the sicke within their gates. About this time came Ambassadors from the <hi>Sinopaeans,</hi> fearing the danger that might befall the <hi>Cotyorites,</hi> both in regard of their City (for it was theirs, and paid them tribute) and of their territory, which as they heard was spoiled; and comming into the Campe,<note place="margin">Embassage of the <hi>Sinopaeans.</hi>
               </note> they spake thus by the mouth of <hi>Hecatonymus,</hi> who was their Spokesman, and reputed a good Orator.
<q>The City of <hi>Sinopis</hi> (ô Souldiers) hath sent vs vnto you, partly commending you, that being <hi>Grecians</hi> you haue ouercome the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> partly to congratulate with you,<note place="margin">Accuseth the <hi>Grecians</hi> of wrong.</note> that you are returned safe out of so many perils and dangers, as we are informed you haue beene in: But we that are <hi>Grecians</hi> desire of you, that are also <hi>Grecians,</hi> that your comming may bee profitable and not preiudicial vnto vs, considering to this day we neuer did you any wrong. These <hi>Cotyorites</hi> are our Colonie, and we are the men that conquered their Territory from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and gaue it to them to inhabite and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19391:49"/>
manure. For which cause they pay vs a tribute imposed vpon them, as doe likewise the <hi>Cerasuntians</hi> and <hi>Trapezuntians</hi>; so that what wrong soeuer you doe them, we imagine we suffer it our selues. We heare then, that entring into the City by force some of you quarter in the houses, other take what they thinke good, out of the Country against the owners wills. If you hold on this course, we shall be forced to craue aid of <hi>Cory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> and the <hi>Paphlagonians</hi> against you, and of any else that we can make our friends.<note place="margin">The defence of <hi>Xenophon.</hi>
                  </note> Here <hi>Xenophon</hi> standing vp spake thus in the behalfe of the Souldiers: We (ô <hi>Sinopaeans</hi>) are come into these quarters ioyfull and glad, that out of so many perils we haue preserued our liues and armes. For to bring away spoile enriching our selues, and withall to fight with the enemy, was impossible. And now after we came to <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities, in <hi>Trapezund,</hi> wee bought such things, as we stood in need of (for they gaue vs a Market) and whereas they honoured vs, and sent vs gifts of hospitality, we did our best to honour them, and not only abstained from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that were their friends, but also harried and wasted to the vttermost of our power, those <hi>Barbarians,</hi> against whom they led vs. They whom the City sent in friendship with vs, as Guides, are present here, aske them, I pray, how we behaued our selues toward them. But whithersoeuer we come, and haue no Market either in the Territorie of <hi>Barbarians</hi> or <hi>Grecians,</hi> we take things necessary, not out of insolency, but forced by necessitie. We accounted the <hi>Carduchans, Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Taochans</hi> enemies (albeit no Subiects to the King, and yet men to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) because they gaue vs no Market, and we could not want needfull prouision. The <hi>Macrons,</hi> albeit <hi>Barbarians,</hi> in regard they furnished vs such a Market, as they could, we dealt friendly with, and tooke nothing from them by force. If the <hi>Cotyorites,</hi> who you say are yours, haue not the like friendship, they may thanke themselues: For they behaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues not as friends vnto vs, but shutting their gates, neither receiued vs into their City, nor yet gaue vs a Market without. The cause hereof they lay vpon your Gouernour. But where you say, that we entred, and now lodge in the City by force, the truth is, we requested them to receiue our sicke men into their houses. When they opened not the Gates, we, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no other violence, entred there, where they would haue kept vs out. The sicke men lodge indeed in their houses, but yet they liue of their owne without charging their Hosts a penny. And wee set guards vpon the Gates, left our sicke men should haply be at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of your Gouernours, and not in our power to take to vs, when we are disposed.

<q>We come not to denounce warre, but to shew, we are your friends; and we will honour you with gifts of hospitalitie, if you please to come to the <hi>Sinopaean</hi> Citie.

This was the end of that day. The next day the Coronels called the Souldiers together,<note place="margin">Consultation about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of then iourney.</note> and it was thought expedient to consult in the presence of the <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Calling therefore the Embassadors vnto them, they consulted together and praied them being <hi>Grecians</hi> to assist them being also <hi>Grecians</hi> with their best affections, and aduice.
Then <hi>Hecatonymus</hi> standing vp =excused himselfe in that, he spoke concerning the making of the <hi>Paphla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonian</hi> friend, and added it was not his meaning to make warre against the <hi>Grecians,</hi> but albeit it were in their power to enter into friendship with the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> yet would they in loue prefer, and much more esteeme the respect of the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
When he was required to deliuer his opinion, after he had made his praier to the gods, he begun in this sort: <q>If I shall aduise you that, which my minde persw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

when he weighed in his minde, their owne multitude, and the number of the inhabitants of <hi>Pontus</hi> round about. Hereupon calling to him <hi>Sila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the <hi>Ambraciote,</hi> who had beene <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Diuiner, he asked counsell of the gods by sacrifice, before he acquainted the Souldiers with the matter. <hi>Silanus</hi> fearing the sequell hereof, and that the army might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily remaine there, spread abroad in the army, that <hi>Xenophon</hi> had in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to stay them, and to build a Citie, and to purchase himselfe a name, and great power and gouernment. <hi>Silanus</hi> himselfe was desirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into <hi>Greece</hi> with all speed.

But if it please you to make choice to inhabite some part of the country, that lieth here round about in <hi>Pontus,</hi> and giue free liberty to any man, that is disposed, either to depart to his owne countrey, or to remaine here, shipping is readie now, and at your deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and you may on the sudden fall vpon what part you are resolued.

                     <hi>Xenophons</hi> speech.</note> I for my part (O Souldiers) as you see, aske counsell of the gods as often, as I can, both concerning you, and concerning my selfe, that I may speake, aduise, and doe that, which may be most for your and mine owne honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. And now I haue sacrificed about this very businesse, to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would proue better for me to speake to you, and to enter into it, or altogether to forbeare, and not meddle withall. <hi>Silanus</hi> the sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayer answered me, that the inwards, which is the matter of most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, were faire (for he knew, that by reason of my continuall vsance to be at sacrifice, I my selfe was not vnskilfull therein:) But he added, that a deceit and ambush against me, might well be discouered in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: for he knew very well his owne resolution to accuse me to you. And hee gaue out in the Campe, that I aduised with my selfe to effect these things without your consent. For my part, if I saw you in want, the scope of my thoughts should be, to bring to passe, that after you had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken one Citie or other, he that was disposed might presently saile away, he that was otherwise minded might remaine here, till he had prouided some matter of profit for his friends. But now since the <hi>Heracleots</hi> &amp; <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopaeans</hi> will both send you shipping, &amp; there are, that haue promised you pay after the new Moone, I hold it a thing of no small moment, that you haue meanes to bring you in safety to the place you desire, and withall to receiue pay for your iourney. And not onely I my selfe desist from my former opinion, but also tell them, who come to me otherwise-minded, it will be better, if they also change theirs. For being many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as now we are, you will be both honoured and esteemed of all, and besides want no furniture of things needfull; because in your strength will be included power also of possessing the riches of him, that is weaker than your selues. But if you diuide your selues, you will neither be able to make prouision of victuall, nor yet depart hence in the safety you desire. So that I am of your opinion to continue our iourney toward <hi>Greece.</hi> And in case any man remaine behinde, or forsake the Armie before it be wholly in safety, I hold him worthy to be punished as an offender. Whosoeuer is of this opinion, let him lift vp his hand.</q>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:19391:52"/>
All held vp their hands. <hi>Silanus</hi> hereupon cried out, and went about to perswade, that euery man of right ought to haue liberty to depart at his pleasure. But the Souldiers would not heare him, nay they threatned, if he were taken shifting away, he should pay for it soundly. Afterward, when the <hi>Heracleots</hi> vnderstood that the Armie was resolued to saile away, and that <hi>Xenophon</hi> had agreed thereto, they sent shipping, but the money that they promised to <hi>Timasion</hi> and <hi>Thorax</hi> for pay, they sent not. From that time forward, they who promised this money, were much perplexed, and began to stand in feare of the Armie. And taking to them the other Coronels, in the number of whom were all, but <hi>Neo</hi> the <hi>Asinite, Cherisophus</hi> his Lieutenant (for <hi>Cherisophus</hi> was absent) and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with them, what they had negotiated, they came to <hi>Xenophon,</hi> and told him they repented of their former opinion, and now they thought it best for the Armie to saile to <hi>Phasis,</hi> and to take into their hands the <hi>Phasian</hi> territorie. The sonne of <hi>Aeetas</hi> reigned ouer the <hi>Phasians</hi> at that time. <hi>Xenophon</hi> answered, he would propound no such thing to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: you, if you please, may call an assembly, and make the motion your selues. <hi>Timasion</hi> the <hi>Dardanian</hi> deliuered then his opinion, which was not to call an assembly of the Armie, but euery Coronell to deale with his Captaines, and to seeke to perswade them seuerally to be of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. So they parted, and laboured to put this resolution in practise. In the meane time it came to the Souldiers eares, and <hi>Neo</hi> gaue out, that <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi> hauing drawne the other Coronels to his party, plotted how to deceiue the Armie, and bring them backe againe to <hi>Phasis.</hi> The Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers tooke it in very ill part, &amp; gathered together, and stood in rounds, and it was to be feared, they would do as they did before to the messengers of the <hi>Cholcans,</hi> and to them that had the ouerseeing of the prouision of the Market, of whom they stoned all, that escaped not to the Sea. When <hi>Xenophon</hi> perceiued it, he thought it fit to warne a publike meeting with all speed, and not to suffer them to come together of themselues; and he commanded the Cryer to summon the assembly.
No sooner heard they the Cryer, but they came together with all speed. Here <hi>Xenophon</hi> accused not the Coronels in that they came vnto him, but spake in this manner: <q>I heare (O Souldiers) that there is a man who accuseth me, and giueth out, that I seeke to deceiue you, and bring you backe againe to <hi>Phasis.</hi> Heare me therefore for Gods sake; and if I shall seeme to wrong you, my selfe will hold my selfe vnworthy to depart hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I suffer punishment for my deserts. But if you finde them, that slander me, to be in the wrong, vse them I pray you, as you shall thinke they deserue. You know, I make no question, in what quarter of heauen the Sunne ariseth, and where he setteth, and that in case a man were to goe into <hi>Greece,</hi> he is to iourney Westward; if backe againe to the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> toward the East. Can any man then deceiue you, as though the Sunne should arise and set in a contrary quarter of heauen? Besides, we see that the North wind carieth vs out of <hi>Pontus</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> the South inward toward <hi>Phasis.</hi> And it is a common speech amongst you: The
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19391:52"/>
North wind bloweth, we haue now a faire passage into <hi>Greece.</hi> If then a man sought to deceiue you, he were to put you a boord, when the wind bloweth South. Yea but I meane to ship you, when it is calme. Well then, shall not I saile in one ship, you in a hundred at least? How can I then either compell you against your will, or lead you on by decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing you? But say you were beguiled and bewitched by me, and so brought to <hi>Phasis.</hi> We shall then land there, and you will easily perceiue, that you are not in <hi>Greece,</hi> and I shall be but one man, that deceiued you, you neere 10000 that are deceiued, and all in Armes. How then can any one man cast himselfe into more certaine danger, then by such coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell about himselfe and about you? But these are the speeches of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For which of them doe I hinder either to speake, if he can, that which is for your good, or to fight for you, if he be disposed, or to watch and be carefull for your safetie? Doe I oppose against any man in the election of Commanders? Nay, I giue way to all; on Gods name command he that will; only let him doe that which shall tend to your good. I haue spoken enough concerning these things. If any of you thinke, that either himselfe or other are deceiued by these words of mine, let him come forth, and shew wherein. Now because you haue heard enough hereof, depart not hence, I pray, till you be partakers of a matter, which I see is begun in the Armie already, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Souldiers hearing this, wondred what it might be, and bid him tell it out plainly.
Then he began againe: <q>You remember that in the <hi>Barbarian</hi> mountaines there were certaine Villages allied in friendship with the <hi>Cerasuntians,</hi> from which mountains there were that descended, and sold vs beasts for sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and such other things as they had.

The day preuented his march, and the inhabitants flocking together, and sending missiue wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, &amp; striking and wounding from the higher ground, slew <hi>Clearatus,</hi> and many other. Some of the Souldiers got to <hi>Cerasunt.</hi> These things
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19391:53"/>
fell out the same day we marched hither on foot. Some of those, that came in the ship, were yet at <hi>Cerasunt,</hi> not ioyned with their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. After this, as the <hi>Cerasuntines</hi> report, there came from the same Village three ancient men, which desired to haue accesse to vs in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. When they found vs not there, they told the <hi>Cerasuntines,</hi> they wondred much what we meant, to come in that manner against them. The <hi>Cerasuntines</hi> answered, it was not the fact of the whole Armie. They were glad thereof, and said they would come to vs by ship, and informe vs how things were caried, and giue libertie to such as would, to burie the dead. Some of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that saued themselues by flight, were yet at <hi>Cerasunt,</hi> and perceiuing whither the <hi>Barbarians</hi> intended to goe, were so bold, as not only to cast stones at them themselues, but incited other to doe the like. So the men died, being three in number, Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors stoned to death. After this fact the <hi>Cerasuntines</hi> came vnto vs, and certified vs of all that had hapned; and we the Coronels hearing it, were much grieued, and aduised with the <hi>Cerasuntines,</hi> how the dead bodies of the <hi>Grecians</hi> might be buried; and sitting without the place of Armes, we heard vpon the sudden a great vprore and cry, Strike, strike, throw, throw; and by and by we might see a great number run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together, some hauing stones in their hands, other some stooping to take vp stones. The <hi>Cerasuntines,</hi> which saw what was done in their Citie, for feare fled to their ships. There were also amongst vs, which were not without feare. I went out and asked, what the matter meant. Some knew nothing, and yet had stones in their hands. At last I hit vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one that knew, who told me that the Commissaries for victuall had infinitely abused the Armie. In this meane time one had spied <hi>Zelarchus,</hi> a Commissarie, going toward the Sea, and presently cast out a great cry. The other as soone as they heard it, ran against him, as if a wilde Boare, or Hart had presented himselfe. The <hi>Cerasuntines,</hi> when they saw them runne, imagining they were bent against them, tooke th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

None of them committed any offence, but feared that a madnesse had fallen vpon vs, as it vseth vpon dogs. If therefore these things shall be so caried, see in what case our Armie will be.

Yet, I pray tell me, vpon what occasion were you beaten? whether did I aske you any thing, and because you gaue it not, did I beat you, or required I againe any thing of mine owne, that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19391:54"/>
you had? or fought with you about loue matters? or did I abuse you, when I was in Wine? None of all these, quoth he. <hi>Xenophon</hi> asked againe whether he were one of the Armed. No, quoth he. Are you one of the <hi>Peltasts?</hi> Neither, quoth he, but being a free-man borne, I droue a Mule by the appointment of my Camerades. <hi>Xenophon</hi> here remembred him and said: Are you he, that caried the sicke man? The same, quoth he, for you forced me to doe it, and to cast away the baggage of my Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades. This casting away, quoth <hi>Xenophon,</hi> was in this manner. I gaue it to other to carie, and after to restore it to me; and receiuing it safe, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as you shewed me the sicke man, I restored it to you againe. Heare, I pray, how the matter stood, for it is worth the hearing. There was a Souldier left behind, being not able to continue his march: I knowing the man to be of our companie, compelled you to carie him, lest he should perish. For, as I remember, the enemie followed vs close; He confessed all this to be true. Therefore when I sent you before, comming vp with the Reare, did I not finde you digging of a pit, as though you meant to burie the man? and did not I commend you therefore? But when the Souldier bowed his legge in all our presences, did not all cry out, He liues? and when you spoke at your pleasure, and flatly denied to carie him, I beat you, I confesse; for it appeared, you knew, he was not dead. What then, quoth he, did he not die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after I shewed him to you? For we must all die, quoth <hi>Xenophon,</hi> must we therefore be throwne into a hole aliue? Here the whole assembly cried, that the man was not beaten enough.
Then he desired some other to stand vp and declare the cause, why he was beaten. When no man arose, <hi>Xenophon</hi> spake thus: <q>I confesse (ô Souldiers) I strooke many for forsaking their Ranks. It may suffice them, that they owe their safetie to you, who alwaies marched, and when need was, fought in order. They forsooth would be in better case than you, and leauing their place run before to harrie and spoile at their pleasure. If all had done the like, we had all been lost and cast away long ere this. I must confesse, I once beat one and forced him to march, who for slouth would not stand vp, but would needs betray himselfe to the enemie. For on a time after I my selfe had in the extremitie of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a good while set me downe on the ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> staying for some, that had not trussed vp their baggage, I found my selfe scarce able to rise, scarce able to stretch out my legs.

them. But if they had fallen into the enemies hands, what remedie could they haue had of their sufferings, were they neuer so grieuous? My speech is simple. For if I haue punished any for his owne good, I desire to vndergoe the same sentence, that Fathers should for their Children, Masters for their Schollers. Physitians also both burne, and cut, for the health of their Patients. But if you conceiue, that all these things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from me out of a wanton humour, consider, I pray, that, by the helpe of the gods, I dare doe more now than at that time, and that I drinke more Wine now, than I did then. For I see, you are now in faire weather; but when there is a storme, and the Sea goeth high, marke you not that the Master of the Ship in the Prowe, the steeres-man in the Poupe are angry with the passengers for the lest stirring in the world? For small errors at that time ouerthrow all. But your selues also deemed, that in beating these men, I swarued not from right. For you stood not with Beanes, but with weapons in your hands,<note place="margin">Beanes they vsed for voices to absolue or condemne in many Cities.</note> and it was in you to haue succoured them, if you had thought good. But you neither succoured, nor with me punished any man for forsaking his Ranke, and by suffering them to be disobedient, you gaue the greater power to their misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. For I thinke, if you shall be pleased to make a true estimate, you shall finde the same men to haue been then the most disorderly, and now the most deboshed. <hi>Boiscus</hi> the <hi>Baeotian</hi> wrestler striued then, all he could, vnder pretence of sicknesse, not to carie his Target: Now, as I vnderstand, he hath robbed many of the <hi>Cotyorites.</hi> Therefore, if you be wise, you will deale with him after another manner, than they doe with Dogges. Dogges, that are curst, men vse to tie vp in the day, and let loose in the night: Him it were not amisse to let loose in the day, and to shut vp in the night. But, that which I most wonder at, is, that you remember and passe not ouer with silence any thing be it neuer so small, wherein I seeme to haue giuen you offence. If I haue succoured any man against cold, or saued him from the enemie, or releeued him in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or in want, no man once remembreth it. And if I haue commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any man for a thing well done, or according to my abilitie honoured him for his valour, neither doe you remember that. And yet it is honest and iust, and holy, and pleasant, that remembrance be had rather of that which is good, than of the bad.</q> After this the assembly broke vp, and repeated in minde, what had passed, and all things came to a faire end.</p>

Lastly, he danced the <hi>Persian</hi> dance, clapping his Targets together one against another;<note place="margin">The <hi>Persian</hi> dance.</note> and kneeled downe, and straightwayes stood vp againe; and all this he did by measure to the sound of the Flute.<note place="margin">The <hi>Mantinaean</hi> dance.</note> Then the <hi>Mantinaeans,</hi> and some other <hi>Arcadians</hi> stood vp armed as seemingly, as they could, and moued in measure, the Flute sounding a point of warre, and sung the <hi>Paean,</hi> and danced, as the manner is in supplications to the gods.

But when he weighed in his minde, that no man fore-knew the euent of things to come, and that hereby he might hazard his former reputation, he began to be in doubt; and being not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue, it seemed best to counsell with the gods. He called therefore to him two Priests, and sacrificed to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the King of gods,<note place="margin">

               <q> I (ô Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) if I be a man, haue cause to be glad of this honour, which you offer vnto me, and to giue you thankes, and to pray to God, that any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion may be ministred, whereby I may be able to doe you seruice.
But to chuse me your Generall, a <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> being present, seemeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for your, nor yet for mine owne auaile; in as much as, if hereafter you shall happen to stand in need of them, you will be disappointed of your hopes that way. Besides, I thinke it not safe for my selfe to enter into that course; for I doe see, that they neuer gaue ouer the warre
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19391:57"/>
against my Countrey, vntill they made the whole Citie confesse, that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were also their Commanders; after which confession, they laid downe their Armes, and proceeded no further in besieging the Citie. If then these things being so, I shall seeme, as much as in me lieth, to weaken their authoritie, I cannot be ignorant, how quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I shall be brought to acknowledge mine errour. And whereas you are of opinion, that lesse sedition and disobedience will grow out of the command of one, than of many, vnderstand from me, that whomsoeuer you choose you shall not finde me discontent or disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. For I hold it for a generall maxime in warre, that whosoeuer he be, which behaueth himselfe seditiously against his Commander, behaueth himselfe seditiously against his owne safetie. But in case you chuse me, I shall not maruell, if a discontent arise in some mindes both against you, and against my selfe.</q>
After <hi>Xenophon</hi> had ended his speech, many more arose, and said, that he ought not to refuse the Generals place; And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gasias</hi> the <hi>Stymphalian</hi> replied, that it was a thing ridiculous, that the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> should not as well be angry, if at a Feast another than a <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian</hi> were by the Guests chosen for their Gouernour. For if things run in this course, quoth he, it shall be vnlawfull for vs to be Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, because we are <hi>Arcadians.</hi> Here a murmur arose thorow the whole assembly approuing the speech of <hi>Agasias.</hi>
               <hi>Xenophon</hi> perceiuing, that more was to be said, added thus much: <q>That you may (ô Souldiers) vnderstand the depth of this businesse, I sweare vnto you by all the gods and goddesses, that after I was informed of your minds and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I by sacrifice enquired, whether it would be behouefull for you to bestow vpon me, and me to accept this command, or otherwise; and the gods so answered in the sacrifice, that it might easily appeare euen to a man of small skill, that I was not to take the place vpon me.</q>
So they chose <hi>Cherisophus.</hi>
               <hi>Cherisophus</hi> being chosen proceeded into the middest and spake thus: <q>You know (ô Souldiers) that, albeit you had chosen another, you should haue found no opposition in me. But it falleth out well for <hi>Xenophon,</hi> that he is not chosen. For <hi>Dexippus</hi> accused him not long since to <hi>Anaxibius,</hi> all he could, my selfe being present and stopping his mouth. He said, he thought, that <hi>Xenophon</hi> had rather be ioined in command with <hi>Timasion,</hi> who was a <hi>Dardanian,</hi> and one of <hi>Clearchus</hi> his Souldiers, than with him, who was a <hi>Lacedemonian.</hi> But since you haue made choise of me, quoth he, I also will endeuour to doe you all the seruice I can. And you against the morning euerie man so order his affaires, that he may be readie to saile away, if the wind be faire. Our iourney shall be to <hi>Heraclea</hi>; and being there we will aduise, what is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be done.</q>
The next day they set saile with a faire wind, and ran along the Coast by the space of two daies following. In sailing they came by <hi>Iasons</hi> shore, where the Ship <hi>Argo</hi> is said to haue anchored, and by the mouthes of these Riuers;<note place="margin">

The riuer called <hi>Lycus,</hi> hauing two <hi>Plethers</hi> in bredth, conueieth his streame thorow this Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Here the Souldiers assembled together, consulting about the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their iourney, and whether it were better to proceed out of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> by land or by sea; and <hi>Lycon</hi> the <hi>Achaian</hi> stood vp and said: I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (ô Souldiers) at the Coronels, that they go not about to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of victuall for the Army.

Therefore it seemeth good to me, that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand no lesse, then 3000. <hi>Cyzicens</hi> of the <hi>Heracleans.</hi> Another said, that a monthes pay (no lesse then 10000. <hi>Cyzicens</hi>) was to be demanded,<note place="margin">A <hi>Cyzicen</hi> was in value about 18. s.</note> and that while we sate in counsell to know their answer, Ambassadours were forthwith to be dispatched to the Citie, and thereupon further aduice to be taken. Hereupon they first propounded <hi>Cherisophus</hi> for an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, because he was their Generall; some also named <hi>Xenophon.</hi> They both opposed strongly, and were of opinion, that no extortion was to be vsed to force any thing from a <hi>Grecian</hi> Citie, being also their friend. Therefore when they seemed vnwilling, the Army sent <hi>Lycon</hi> the <hi>Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Callimachus</hi> the <hi>Parrhasian,</hi> and <hi>Agasias</hi> the <hi>Stymphaliaen,</hi> who going to the Citie deliuered the decree of the Army; and <hi>Lycon</hi> is reported to haue vsed threatning words, if things were not performed according to the desire of the Army. The <hi>Heracleans</hi> hearing the propositions, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they would consider; and presently they gathered their goods out of the fields, and appointed a market within the Citie, and the gates were shut, and armes seene vpon the walles. The authors of these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles accused the Coronels, as though they were cause of the ill successe. Their words were, <q>that it was a shame, that one <hi>Athenian</hi> should haue command ouer the <hi>Peloponesians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>

This was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed; and those <hi>Arcadians</hi> and <hi>Achaeans,</hi> that were vnder the command of <hi>Cherisophus,</hi> forsaking him and <hi>Xenophon,</hi> associated themselues to the rest, and they all chose ten Coronels out of their owne bodie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that whatsoeuer the plurality of voices of these ten should resolue vpon, it should stand good and effectuall, and be put in execution. The
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19391:58"/>
Generall-ship therefore of <hi>Cherisophus</hi> was dissolued within six or seuen daies, after he was chosen. <hi>Xenophon</hi> notwithstanding would haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the iourney with them, thinking it more safe so to doe, than to trauell euery man by himselfe alone: But <hi>Neon</hi> vnderstanding by <hi>Cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophus,</hi> that <hi>Cleander,</hi> the Gouernour of <hi>Bizantium,</hi> was determined with his Gallies to make ouer to the Hauen of <hi>Calpe,</hi> perswaded him to keepe his owne forces by him, and to iourney apart; and further, counselled him to conceale it from the rest, to the end, that they and their Souldiers alone might be transported in the Gallies; and <hi>Cherisophus</hi> partly discontented with that, which had passed, and partly out of a hatred against the Army, gaue him liberty to doe, as he thought best. From that time forward <hi>Xenophon</hi> sought to saile away,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Xenophons</hi> zeale without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> and to depart from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But sacrificing to <hi>Hercules</hi> the Guide, and asking of him counsell, whether it should be better for him to follow the warre with the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Souldiers vnder his command, or to depart, the god signified by the sacrifice, that he should continue his command, and not depart. So the Army was diuided into three parts. The <hi>Arcadians</hi> and <hi>Achaeans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than 4500. all heauie armed; <hi>Cherisophus</hi> hauing 1300. armed, and 700. <hi>Peltasts,</hi> who were the <hi>Thracians,</hi> that followed <hi>Clearchus: Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi> 1700. armed, and 300. <hi>Peltasts,</hi> and he alone had horse amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the number of fortie. The <hi>Arcadians</hi> getting shipping of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racleans,</hi> sailed away first, of purpose, that falling suddenly vpon the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinians,</hi> they might preuent the rest, and make the greatest prey. They landed at the Hauen <hi>Calpe,</hi>

               </note> which lieth in a manner in the middest of <hi>Thrace.

If the village seemed any thing great, the Coronels allotted two Diuisions to it. They agreed also vpon a hill, to which they were all to retire, and because they fell vpon the Country suddenly, they tooke many prisoners, and brought in many sheepe. The <hi>Thracians,</hi> that escaped, assembled together, and many being taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners shifted out of the <hi>Grecians</hi> hands, because they were <hi>Peltasts,</hi> the <hi>Grecians</hi> armed; and being now gathered together in good number, they first charged the Diuision of <hi>Smicretes,</hi>

For my part, I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, if they perish, we can finde no safety, the enemy being so many, and so much incouraged with the happinesse of this successe. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore best to giue them aid with all speed, that if they be aliue, wee may ioyne with them in fight against the enemie, and not be left to runne the danger alone. And for the present, let vs march on till supper time, and then set downe with our Campe. And while we march let <hi>Timasion</hi> with the horse scout before, casting an eye toward vs alwaies, and giuing aduertisement of all occurrence, that we be ignorant of nothing that may concerne vs.</q>
He sent out likewise some of the best footmen of his light-armed toward the flanks of the Armie, and the tops of the hils, willing them to giue intelligence of what they saw. Hee commanded also to set fire vpon all, that was apt to take fire.
<q>For, quoth he, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not escape any way, the distance backe againe to <hi>Heraclea</hi> being great, and the march forward to <hi>Chrysopolis</hi> great, and the enemie neere at

hand. The way is shortest to the Hauen of <hi>Calpe,</hi> whither we imagine that <hi>Cherisophus</hi> is come, at least if he be in safety. And yet are we not to hope for any shipping to carry vs from thence, and resting there wee shall not finde so much as a daies prouision. Now in case those, that are besieged were lost, it would be more dangerous for vs to hazard with <hi>Cherisophus</hi> his Souldiers alone. But if they be succoured, and freed from this danger, and all of vs assembled together, we shall in common dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute our safety the better. You are therefore to march on with resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either now honourably to die, or else to performe a most noble act, and worthy of eternall memory, namely, to saue so great a number of <hi>Grecians,</hi> that are in ieopardy to be cast away. And it may be, that God hath so disposed of this businesse, to humble these high-minded men, wise in their owne conceits, and to honour vs, who in all our actions take our beginnings from the gods. You are then to follow your Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and to giue heed to that which is commanded you.</q>

So the whole countrey seemed to be on a light fire, and the Armie to be great. When it was time, they ascended vp to a hill, and quartered there. From thence they might discerne the enemies fires (for they were not distant aboue 40 furlongs) and themselues kindled as many fires as they could.<note place="margin">Fiue mile.</note> When they had supped, the word was giuen to quench and put out all the fires, and hauing placed their guards, they gaue themselues to sleepe.

As for the mountaine that ouershadoweth the Hauen, as it runneth 20 furlongs into the mid-land, it is pure earth without stones, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Sea, more than 20 furlongs,<note place="margin">Two mile and a halfe.</note> it is rough with many and all kinde of great trees. The rest of the Land is beautifull and large, and there are many Villages in it, and well inhabited. The countrey bringeth forth barley, and wheat, and pulse-corne of all sorts, and Bucke, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samum, and figs sufficiently, and many Vines pleasant in taste, and all other kinds of fruit, excepting only Oliues. This is the nature of the Soile. The Armie incamped by the Sea-side. In the Towne they would not quarter, being of opinion, they were fraudulently brought thither by some, that had an intention to plant a Colony there. For the most part of the Souldiers sailed out of <hi>Greece</hi> to follow this warre, not for want of meanes to liue by, but hearing of the bounty of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> some brought to his seruice men that had consumed their estates,<note place="margin">The quality of the <hi>Grecians</hi> that followed this warre.</note> some other runne away from their fathers and mothers, and some left behind them their children, as minding to inrich them at their returne. For they heard, that all that followed <hi>Cyrus</hi> gathered mountaines of wealth. Being peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this condition, they desired to returne into <hi>Greece</hi> in safety. When the day of assembly of the Armie for this purpose was now come, <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi> sacrificed about the issuing of it out of the Campe, because they must needs be led out to make prouision. His purpose was also to bury their dead. The sacrifice being fauourable, the <hi>Arcadians</hi> also followed, and they buried the most part of the dead, euery man where he fell; for it was now the fift day since they were slaine, so that there was no possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie to conueigh them from thence. And bringing some together
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19391:60"/>
out of the high-waies, they buried them according to their meanes, as decently, as they could; and for those, they found not, they rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a great emptie monument, and kindled a Funerall fire, and laid vpon the monument Crownes of flowers. Hauing performed these Rites, they returned to the Campe, and after Supper gaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to rest. The next day the Souldiers assembled. Captaine <hi>Agasias</hi> the <hi>Stymphalian,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Ieronymus</hi> the <hi>Elian,</hi> and other the eldest of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> were the cause of this assembly.<note place="margin">A decree not to separate their Forces hereafter.</note> They made a Decree, that if any man hereafter propounded to separate and diuide the Armie, he should be punished with death; and that the Armie should depart out of the Countrey in the manner it was wont, and that the former Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels should command.<note place="margin">The death of <hi>Cherisophus.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Cherisophus</hi> was alreadie dead by drinking a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine in his ague, and <hi>Neon</hi> the <hi>Asinite</hi> was substituted in his place.
After this <hi>Xenophon</hi> stood vp and said: <q>It seemeth (fellow Souldiers) that the rest of our iourney is to be performed by Land, in regard we haue no shipping; and hauing likewise no prouision, necessitie forceth vs to be readie to march. We therefore the Coronels will offer sacrifice; As for you, you are, if euer heretofore, to prepare your selues to fight, inasmuch as the enemie hath gathered courage.</q> So the Coronels sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced taking to them <hi>Arexion</hi> the <hi>Arcadian</hi> Southsaier.
For <hi>Silanus</hi> the <hi>Ambraciote</hi> had stollen away in a Ship of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> which he hired. They sacrificed about their departure, but the entrailes of the sacrifice were not faire. They stayed therefore that day. There were some, that durst giue out, that <hi>Xenophon</hi> intending to plant in that place, had perswaded the Southsaier to say, that the sacrifice allowed not of their departure. Hereupon <hi>Xenophon</hi> caused Proclamation to be made,<note place="margin">A meanes to still suspicion.</note> that the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning euerie one that list might be present at the sacrifice, and if there were any Southsaier amongst them, he commanded him to come and view the entrailes, and so sacrificed in the presence of many. When they had now thrice sacrificed about their departure, the entrailes assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not. The Souldiers were ill apaid herewith. For their prouision which they brought with them, failed, and there was no Market to be had. Hereupon, when they againe assembled, <hi>Xenophon</hi> spake thus:
<q>The sacrifices, as your selues are eie-witnesses, are not fauourable to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and I see you are destitute of victuall, wherefore I hold it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to aske counsell by sacrifice about this matter alone.</q>
Then one of them arising, said: It is not without cause, that the sacrifice crosseth our departure. For, as I heard of one, that by chance came by Ship hither yesterday, <hi>Cleander</hi> the Gouernour of <hi>Byzantium,</hi> is about to crosse ouer to vs with Ships and Gallies. Hereupon it seemed good to all to remaine in the place. But yet they were forced by necessitie to fall out into the Countrey for victuall and prouision for the Campe, and sacrifice was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered hereabout three times, which notwithstanding opposed their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out. They came then to the Tent of <hi>Xenophon</hi> and told him of their wants. I may not, quoth he, leade you out, vnlesse the sacrifice be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable. The next day they sacrificed againe, and because they were
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19391:60"/>
perplexed, and the businesse touched all, well-nigh the whole Armie encircled the sacrifice. And now there was no more sacrifice left. The Coronels therefore, albeit they led not out the Armie, yet did they call an assembly; and <hi>Xenophon</hi> said: It may be the enemie is gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and we shall be driuen to fight by necessitie. If therefore leauing our baggage in this place of strength, we issue out prepared for fight, and then offer sacrifice, perhaps the sacrifice will giue better allowance. The Souldiers hearing this cried out, that there was no need of leading them out, but willed them to renew the sacrifice with all speed. There were now no Sheepe to be had, and they were faine to buy Oxen out of the Waine to offer in sacrifice. And <hi>Xenophon</hi> desired <hi>Cleanor</hi> the <hi>Arcadian</hi> to gather vp his spirits and be in a readinesse, if the sacrifice portended any good: but this sacrifice was also crosse. <hi>Neon</hi> was Coronell of that part of the Armie, which <hi>Cherisophus</hi> commanded. He, when he saw the Souldiers discontented with their wants, desirous to gratifie them, finding an <hi>Heraclean,</hi> who affirmed that he knew Villages at hand, from whence prouision might be had, made proclamation, that euerie one, that would, might goe abroad for prouision,<note place="margin">

There issued therefore out of the Campe to the number of two thousand, with Darts, Bladders, Bags, and other Vessels. After they came into the Villages, and were dispersed in rifling,<note place="margin">And ill successe.</note> the Hors-men of <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> fell vpon them (for they gaue aid to the <hi>Bithynians,</hi>

It seemed not safe to pursue the enemie, or to moue the Armie by night, the Countrey being full of thickets. They watched therefore that night in Armes, putting forth Guards sufficient to fight with the enemie, if need were. So was the night spent. In the morning the Coronels led into a stronger place, and the Souldiers followed with their Armes and baggage, and before it was Dinner time they cast a Trench all along the Face of the Campe, which led into the Countrey,<note place="margin">Fortification of the Campe.</note> and strengthened all the Rampier with Palizadoes, leauing only three Gates to passe in and out the Campe. In the meane time came a Ship from <hi>Heraclea</hi> fraughted with Barley-meale, and with beasts for sacrifice, &amp; with Wine. <hi>Xenophon</hi> rising early in the morning, sacrificed about issuing out of the Campe, and the entrailes of the first beast offered were faire.

For I see, that you need no glory, that may be purchased with valour, but rather stand in need of safetie alone. The case now standeth thus, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not depart hence without fight. For if we goe not against the enemy, he will follow and charge vs in our retreat. Consider then, which of the two is the better, to goe against them with armes in our hands, or facing about, to see them fall vpon our Reare. You cannot be ignorant, that to dismarch from an enemy, was euer held dishonourable by a man of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; as contrariwise, that to pursue, giueth courage euen to a coward. For my part, I had rather follow with halfe the number, we haue, than dismarch with twice so many.

If any man conceiue it a matter of danger, to haue the Forrest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde vs in our fight, I hold it rather an aduantage to be sought for.

But I should not a little maruell, if any of you could once imagine, that this Forrest is more fearefull for vs to trauerse, than other places, which wee haue alreadie passed.

Where if we remaine, we shall finde neither shipping to transport vs, nor victuall to nourish vs. And we shall no sooner arriue there, but we must immediately issue out of our Campe to seeke prouision. Is it not therefore better to fight with the enemy now we haue dined, than to morrow fasting? The sacrifice is faire, and the presage of the euent fortunate, and the entrailes of the beasts portend good lucke. Let vs march against them, and since we are come into their sight, let vs not giue them leaue either to sup with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or to sleepe, where themselues are disposed.</q>
Hereupon the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines willed him to lead on, and no man gainsaid it.

Therefore embattelling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, they led against them. The enemy seeing them comming cast themselues downe the steepe places no otherwise, than if horsemen had followed them in chase. A Forrest receiued them that fled, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> were not acquainted with. Wherefore night drawing on, they returned, and when they came to the place where the battels first ioyned, they erected a Trophey, and so about Sunne-set retired to the Sea; for the Campe was about 60 furlongs off. Henceforward the enemies began to looke to themselues,<note place="margin">7 mile and a halfe.</note> and remoued as farre from thence as they could, as well the inhabitants, as their goods and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. The <hi>Grecians</hi> lay still expecting <hi>Cleander,</hi> and the Gallies, and Ships, which they thought would come. And going forth euery day without feare, hauing with them their cariage-beasts and slaues, they brought in wheat, barley, wine, pulse-corne, bucke, and figs. For the Territorie bare all fruit plentifully, Oliues only excepted. And as long as the Armie kept within the Campe, any man might goe forth to spoile, and deteine that he found for his priuate vse. But a decree was made, that when the whole Armie went abroad, whatsoeuer was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by any man going apart, it should be to the vse of the generalitie.

               <hi>Agasias</hi> was the man he sought, who had beene a friend to <hi>Xenophon</hi> euen to the last; which was the cause that <hi>Dexippus</hi> accused him.

               </note> if <hi>Cleander</hi> departing hence, carry that minde toward vs, which hee professeth, I take it to be a matter not to be contemned.

<q>If therefore he first shut vs out of <hi>Byzantium,</hi> and signifie to the rest of the Gouernours not to receiue vs into their Cities, as being disobedient to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and notto be gouerned, this rumor will come to the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19391:63"/>
eares of <hi>Anaxibius</hi> the Admirall, so that it will be hard for vs either to stay here, or to saile away. For at this time the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> haue the Souereigntie of <hi>Greece,</hi> both by Sea and Land. It is not fit therefore, that for one or two mens sakes, we the rest be debarred from <hi>Greece,</hi> but we are rather to obey, whatsoeuer they command. For our Cities, from whence euery one of vs is, are vnder their subiection. I therefore (for I vnderstand that <hi>Dexippus</hi> informeth <hi>Cleander,</hi> that <hi>Agasias</hi> would not haue done this, vnlesse I had bid him) I, I say, cleare both you, and <hi>Agasias</hi> of this fault, if <hi>Agasias</hi> will say, that I am the cause thereof, and I condemne my selfe, and will willingly vndergoe all extremitie of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, if it may appeare that I were the beginner either of casting of stones, or of any other violence. I say further, if any man else be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by <hi>Cleander,</hi> he ought, whosoeuer he be, to yeeld himselfe to <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> iudgement. So shall you be free from all fault. But as matters goe now, it will be hard, if thinking to receiue praise and honour in <hi>Greece,</hi> we in stead thereof shall not be in the case that other are, but be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of all <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities.</q>
After this <hi>Agasias</hi> stood vp and said: I (ô Souldiers) sweare by the gods and goddesses, that neither <hi>Xenophon,</hi> nor any other willed mee to take away the man; but when I saw an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and worthy Souldier of mine led away by <hi>Dexippus,</hi> whose trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous dealing toward you, you well know, I thought it a matter not to be suffered. And albeit, I confesse, that I rescued him, yet would I not, that you should deliuer me vp. I my selfe, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> aduiseth, will yeeld my selfe into the hands of <hi>Cleander,</hi> to vse me at his discretion. Neither would I for this cause haue you make warre with the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> nor haue any man impeached to saue himselfe, where he list. Only I desire you to make choice of some of your selues to send with me to <hi>Cleander,</hi> who in case I omit any thing, may speake and doe, what they thinke auaileable in my behalfe. The Army gaue him leaue to choose whom he thought good,<note place="margin">The Souldier rescued, and the rescuer yeelded vp to <hi>Cleander.</hi>
               </note> and he chose the Coronels. So <hi>Agasias</hi> and the Coronels, and the man that was rescued went together toward <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>; to whom the Coronels vsed this speech:
<q>The Army (O <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>) hath sent vs vnto you, and desire you, if you thinke them all guilty, to vse your owne iudgement in punishing all: if one or two, they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to put them into your hands to be iudged by you. If therefore you lay the fault vpon any of vs, we here present our selues vnto you; if vpon any man else, we desire you to name him. For no man shall be with-held from you, that will acknowledge our command. Then <hi>Agasias</hi> stepped forth and said:<note place="margin">

                  </note> And by his meanes we not only defrauded the <hi>Trapezuntians</hi> of their ship, but incurred the imputation of vniust
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19391:63"/>
men, and as much as lay in him we all perished. For he heard as well as we, how impossible it was marching on foot to passe ouer the riuers that lay in our way, and to come in safety into <hi>Gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if you, <hi>Cleander,</hi> or any about you, that was no run-away from vs, had apprehended him, you may well conceiue, I would haue forborne to doe, as I did. And I would haue you thinke, if you take away my life, you shall put an honest man to death for a cowards and a scundrels sake. <hi>Cleander</hi> hearing this said: I commend not <hi>Dexippus,</hi> if he behaued himselfe, as you haue related;<note place="margin">Violence not to be vsed.</note> notwithstanding admit <hi>Dexippus</hi> were neuer so vile, yet violence was not to be offred vnto him, but he was to be brought to iudgement, as you are at this time. Now therefore you the Coronels may depart, leauing this man behinde you, and when I giue you notice, returne to assist the Court in iudgement concerning these offences; and I haue neither cause to accuse the Army, nor any other man in priuate, in as much as himselfe confesseth, that it was he, that made the rescous.</q> Then he that was rescued, spake thus:
Lest you should thinke <hi>(Cleander)</hi> that I was apprehended as an offender, I neither strooke any man, nor threw stone; I said only that the sheepe appertained to the generalitie. For it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that when the Armie went abroad, all boot taken in priuate should be deliuered vp to the vse of the generalitie. This was all I spake, and for this <hi>Dexippus</hi> laid hands on me, and would haue caried me away, that all mens mouthes being stopped, he might haue had his part, and preserued the rest for those, that contrary to the decree went about to deceiue the Army. Hereunto <hi>Cleander</hi> answered: Seeing you are so acute and witty, stay you here also, that we may aduise what to doe with you. So went <hi>Cleander</hi> to dinner; but <hi>Xenophon</hi> assembling the Army, counselled them to send to <hi>Cleander,</hi> and to make intercession for the prisoners. Hereupon they decreed, that the Coronels, and Captaines, and <hi>Dracontius</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> and other that were fit,<note place="margin">Intercession of the Armie for the prisoners.</note> should goe to <hi>Cleander,</hi> and by all meanes intreat for their deliuerie. <hi>Xenophon</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being come to <hi>Cleander</hi> spake thus:
<q>You haue (O <hi>Cleander</hi>) in safe keeping the men, you desired, and the Army hath referred vnto you, not only to dispose of the prisoners, as you please, but also of themselues in generall. Now they desire and intreat you, to bestow the men vpon them, and not to put them to death, because in former times they haue done good seruice to the Army. Obtaining this fauour at your hands, they promise in regard thereof, if it shall please you to accept the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ouer them, to make manifest, how modest they are, and how duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to their Generall, and (the gods being propitious) how fearelesse of the enemy. Further they are humble suiters, that you would be pleased to come vnto them, and to make proofe of <hi>Dexippus,</hi> and of them, and of other, whether shall be most respectiue and dutifull to their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: <hi>Cleander</hi> hearing this, said he would streight-waies giue them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; and I release vnto you, quoth he, the men that are in durance,<note place="margin">

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19391:64"/>
permit. The reports which are spread abroad of you, are much differing from that, which I my selfe now heare, namely, that the Armie should be in minde to reuolt from the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi>
               </q>
The Coronels much extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him for his bounty,<note place="margin">Accepteth the place of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> and departed, hauing the prisoners restored vnto them. <hi>Cleander</hi> offred sacrifice about the iourney, and vsed <hi>Xenophon</hi> with all kindnesse, and contracted hospitalitie with him, and when he saw the Armie orderly doe what was commanded, he much rather desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be their Generall.<note place="margin">The sacrifice gaine say it.</note>
But when he had sacrificed three dayes, and the sacrifice assented not, he called the Coronels together, and said: <q>The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices allow not, that I should be your Generall. Yet be not you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of comfort. For, as it seemeth, you are the men that are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to leade the Armie home. Goe forward.

So he sailed away. But the Souldiers diuiding amongst themselues the corne, and other things, which they had gathered together, marched on thorow the countrey of <hi>Bithynia.</hi> And when they found nothing in their right way (for they held on as if the countrey had beene friend) it seemed good to returne backe a day and nights iourney. Doing this they tooke many slaues and sheepe; and the eighth day came to <hi>Chrysopolis</hi> a Citie in the country of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and staied there seuen dayes selling their spoile.</p>

Speaking thus much, he asked <hi>Medosades,</hi> if it were not true. <hi>Medosades</hi> said, it was so. Then came <hi>Medosades</hi> to me the second time, after I came from <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He asked <hi>Medosades,</hi> whether he spake not this also. Yes, quoth he, I spake it.

               </note> you answered, quoth he, that the Armie was to come ouer to <hi>Byzantium,</hi> and that in respect thereof there needed not any thing to be giuen to you or to any man else; and you said, you were to depart as soone as you came ouer; and it fell out as you said. But what answer made I at <hi>Selymbria?</hi> You said it was not possible to be done, because the Armie was to march to <hi>Perinthus,</hi> and there to be transported into <hi>Asia.</hi> Now am I here, said <hi>Xenophon,</hi> and this <hi>Phryniscu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When they that should, were come in, <hi>Xenophon</hi> asked <hi>Seuthes,</hi> wherin he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to vse the seruice of the Armie. <hi>Seuthes</hi> spake thus: <q>

Wherefore being at his table, I humbly besought him to afford me such forces, as he could, that I might be reuenged vpon them, that had eiected vs out of our patrimony, and not alwaies liue like a dog waiting at his table. Hereupon he gaue me those men and horse, which you shall see as soone, as it is day. And now I spend the time with these spoiling and driuing preies out of my fathers countrey. But if you

ioyne with me, I hope (the gods being friends) easily to recouer my kingdome. And this is the cause, wherefore I craue your aid. </q>
What then, quoth <hi>Xenophon,</hi> can you giue the army, the Captaines and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronels, if we come? Speake it, quoth he, before this company, that they may make report to the rest of the army. He promised to a common Souldier a <hi>Cyzicene,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The offers of <hi>Seuthes</hi> to the army.</note> two to a Captaine, foure to a Coronell, and as much land, as he desired, and yoakes of oxen, and a walled towne situa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if endeuouring this, we bring it not to passe, and some feare arise from the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> if any of vs come vnto you, will you receiue him into your countrey? He answered: yea I will hold them as my brothers, and place them in seats, and make them partakers of all I shall possesse. But to you, <hi>Xenophon,</hi> I will giue my daughter, and if you haue a daughter, I will buy her after the <hi>Thracian</hi> manner, and will giue her <hi>Bisanthe</hi> lying vpon the Sea-coast to dwell in, which is the goodliest countrey I haue. Hearing these things, and giuing and taking hands, they rode away, and before day, came to the Campe, and euery one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned answer to them, from whom he was sent. When it was day, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starchus</hi> called againe the Coronells and Captaines, who thought it not good to come at <hi>Aristarchus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aristarchus</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for the Coronels, who refuse to come.</note> but to call an assembly of the army. All came together, except the Souldiers of <hi>Neon,</hi> who were about ten Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs from the rest. Being assembled, <hi>Xenophon</hi> arose, and spake thus:
<q>We cannot (ô Souldiers) saile ouer, whether we would, by reason that <hi>Aristarchus</hi> with his Gallies hindreth vs; so that it is not safe for vs to go aboord. He also commandeth vs to make way thorow the Holy Mount by force, and so to come to <hi>Cherronesus</hi>: which if we do, he faith he will no more sell vs for slaues, as he did in <hi>Bizantium,</hi> nor yet beguile vs, but will surely giue vs our pay; nor shall we need to looke about vs, as wee doe now, being destitute of necessary prouision. <hi>Seuthes</hi> promiseth, if you will come vnto him to vse you kindly. I would haue you therefore to consider, whether you will stay here, and debate of these things, or march away to a place, where you may refresh your selues with victualls. I am of opinion, seeing we neither haue money to goe to market, nor are suffered to take victuall without money, that we were best to returne to the villages which were allotted vs, and hauing there such things, as we want,<note place="margin">The army go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to <hi>Seuthes.</hi>
                  </note> to heare the propositions of such, as desire your seruice, and to chuse that, which shall be most expedient for your selues. You, that like hereof, hold vp your hands.</q>
All held vp their hands. Goe then, quoth he, and presently trusse vp your baggage, and when you are commanded, follow your leaders. After this <hi>Xenophon</hi> led, and the army followed. And albeit <hi>Neon,</hi> and other from <hi>Aristarchus</hi> endeuoured to perswade them to returne, yet they would giue no eare. When they had now mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched about thirtie Furlongs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Seuthes</hi> meets the army.</note> 
               <hi>Seuthes</hi> met them. Whom when <hi>Xenophon</hi> saw, he desired him to draw neere, that in the hearing of the multitude they mought conferre about some things, which tended to the good of the army. Being come vp, <hi>Xenophon</hi> said: We are now marching thither, where we may finde food. There, after we haue heard, what you, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19391:68"/>
this <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> will say, wee will resolue vpon that, which shall seeme best for vs. If therefore you will lead vs to a place, where we shall haue plentie, we shall be the more beholding vnto you, and thinke you make vs your guests. I know, quoth <hi>Seuthes,</hi> where many villages stand not farre asunder, which abound in store of prouision, and are no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, than we may well reach by dinner time. Lead then, quoth <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon.</hi> They came to the villages in the afternoone, and the Souldiers assembling, <hi>Seuthes</hi> vsed this speech:
<q>I desire you (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Souldiers) to take entertainment of me. I promise euery one of you a <hi>Cyzicene</hi> for his monthly pay, and to a Captaine, and a Coronell as much,<note place="margin">18 Shillings. <hi>Seuthes</hi> to the Armie.</note> as is vsually giuen.

We of our selues shall be of force sufficient to giue chace to the enemy, that flyeth: with your helpe we shall easily ouercome those that resist. <hi>Xenophon</hi> then asked him, how farre from the Sea he desired the army should march. No further than seuen daies iourney, quoth he, and oftentimes selfe. After this it was permitted, that any man, that would, might speake.</q>
Many said, that <hi>Seuthes</hi> propounded things not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. For it was Winter, and no man, though he would neuer so faine, could get home by Sea, and wanting mony to buy things necessary,<note place="margin">Reasons why the Armie should follow <hi>Seuthes.</hi>
               </note> they were not able to remaine in a friends countrey, and in the enemies it was safer to stay and be nourished in the company of <hi>Seuthes,</hi> than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, especially so many commodities offering themselues. Besides, to haue pay was a thing found, ere it could be looked for. <hi>Xenophon</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if any man be of a contrarie minde, let him speake; if not, let a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree be made hereof. When all were silent, they gaue their consent,<note place="margin">They agree to follow him.</note> and a decree was made accordingly. <hi>Xenophon</hi> therefore presently informed <hi>Seuthes,</hi> that the Souldiers would take entertainment of him. After this the rest quartered, euery man, as the lot fell to his company,<note place="margin">Hee inuiteth the Coronels and Captaines to supper.</note> but <hi>Seuthes</hi> called the Coronels and Captaines to supper in a village hard by.

               </hi>; he insinuated himselfe to each of them, who, he thought, was able, and had to giue <hi>Seuthes</hi>; and spake first to certaine <hi>Parians,</hi> that came to make a league with <hi>Medocus</hi> the King of <hi>Odryssians,</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them gifts for him, and for the Queene. He told them,<note place="margin">Gifts to the King.</note> that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docus</hi> liued in the countrey, that was twelue daies iourney from the Sea, and that <hi>Seuthes</hi> with the helpe of that army would be master of the Sea, and being their neighbour, would bee able both to pleasure, and hurt them. If you be wise therefore turne the gifts, which you bring, to <hi>Seu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,</hi> and it will be better, than, if you presented them to <hi>Medocus,</hi> that dwelleth so farre off. Thus he perswaded them. Then he came to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masion</hi> the <hi>Dardanian</hi> (for he heard, he had cups and carpets taken from the <hi>Barbarians</hi>) and said: It was the manner, when <hi>Seuthes</hi> bid any to supper, that the guests inuited, offered presents vnto him. He, quoth <hi>Heraclydes,</hi> if he become great in this kingdome, will be able either to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19391:69"/>
restore you to your countrey, or else to make you rich here. Thus admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished he euerie one, before they entred to supper. He came likewise to <hi>Xenophon</hi> and said: You are both of the greatest Citie, and of greatest name with <hi>Seuthes</hi>; and it may be, that <hi>Seuthes</hi> will thinke you worthy to possesse cities and land in this countrey, as many of your countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue done heretofore. It is fit therefore for you to honour <hi>Seuthes</hi> with the richest presents. For I know, the royaller your presents be, the more gratuitie you shall obtaine at his hands. <hi>Xenophon</hi> hearing this was displeased in minde. For he brought no more out of <hi>Pari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>t were then present, and the Coronels and Captaines of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and the Ambassadours sent from Cities, were entred into sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, they set downe all in a ring. Then were three-footed kettles brought in for them all.<note place="margin">The manner of sitting and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice at supper.</note> They were about twentie in number, full of flesh cut in peeces, and of great loaues of leauened bread, pierced thorow and faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the flesh. The tables, as the custome is, were set neerest to the strangers. <hi>Seuthes</hi> first of all taking the loaues next him, broke them into small peeces, and the flesh likewise, and threw the peeces to whom hee thought good, reseruing to himselfe no more tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a taste. The other, that had the tables standing by them, did the like. There was amongst the rest an <hi>Arcadian, Aristos</hi> by name, a notable eater. He not regarding that which was cast vnto him, taking a loafe of the bignesse well-nigh of a pecke in one hand, and a peece of flesh on his knees, fell a eating. Hornes of wine were carried about, and euery man tooke them. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stos,</hi> when hee that filled the wine came, and offered it to him, seeing <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi> forbeare eating, goe, giue it him, quoth he, for he is at leasure, and I not. <hi>Seuthes</hi> hearing the voice, asked the filler of wine, what he said, who when he told him (for he could speake Greeke) the whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fell a laughing. The cups now walked thicke about, and a <hi>Thracian</hi> vpon a white horse came in, and taking a full horne, said: <hi>Seuthes,</hi> I drinke to you, and giue you this horse, whose backe when you are vpon, you may easily take, whomsoeuer you chace, and retiring, need not feare any enemie. Another brought in a boy, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the same sort, gaue him to the King.

                  </gap>esippus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> standing vp, said, That it was an ancient and a verie good custome, that they that had, should for honours sake giue to the King; and the King to them, that had not. So should I, quoth hee, haue wherewith to present and honour the King. <hi>Xenophon</hi> doubted with himselfe what to doe. For he was honoured, sitting in the next seat to the King, and <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clides</hi> willed the wine-filler to reach the Horne vnto him. He was now well tippled, &amp; therefore stood vp boldly taking the Horne in his hand, and said: I (ô <hi>Seuthes</hi>) giue my selfe vnto you, and all these my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, to be your faithfull friends: and I giue none of them against their wils, but all so minded, that euerie one will striue to doe you more

And now they are here wishing nothing more, than to beemploied, and to vndergoe perill for your sake; with the helpe of whom (if the gods will) you shall both recouer and also enioy your Fathers Kingdome; and not only it, but many Horse, many men and faire women, whom you shall not need to spoile, and take from them, what they haue, but of their owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After this the <hi>Cera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suntines</hi> came in, who vse Flutes and Trumpets made of the raw Hides of Oxen playing in measure, as the vse is vpon the Instrument called <hi>Magade.

Iesters also came in. When the Sun was now readie to set, the <hi>Grecians</hi> arose from their seats, signifying, it was time to dispose the watch, and to giue the word.<note place="margin">The Watch.</note> They desired <hi>Seuthes</hi> to take order that no <hi>Thracian</hi> entred the <hi>Grecian</hi> quarter by night; because, said they, there are some <hi>Thracians,</hi> that are enemies, some, that are friends, both to you, and vs. When they went out, <hi>Seuthes</hi> also stood vp nothing lesse than like a drunken man; and comming abroad, he called the Coronels to him, and said: The enemie yet knoweth not, that you are entertained by me.<note place="margin">Surprising the enemie.</note> If therefore we goe against them, before they feare to be caught, or prouide to defend themselues, we shall easily gaine both prisoners and plentie of riches. The Coronels commended his aduice, and willed him to leade on. He replied, that they should make themselues readie, and stay, where they were. When it is time, quoth he, I will come vnto you, and taking you and the <hi>Peltasts</hi> with me, by the helpe of the gods, I will be your guide. <hi>Xenophon</hi> said: Consider, I pray,<note place="margin">The order of matching in the night.</note> seeing we are to march by night, whether the <hi>Grecian</hi> manner be not best. In the day time the light-Armed, or Horse, according to the nature of the place, haue the Vant of the Armie; in the night the vse of the <hi>Grecians</hi> is to giue the leading to the slowest. For so the Armie is easiliest kept together, and it is soonest espied, if they breake. But being seuered, they often fall one vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and through ignorance doe, and suffer hostilitie. <hi>Seuthes</hi> answered, You say well, and I will follow your order, and giue you old men the most experienced in the Countrey for Guides, and my selfe bring vp the Reare with the Horse. For I can soone be first, if need be. They gaue for the Word <hi>Pallas,</hi> because of their kinred. After this was spoken,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Xenophons</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note>
               <q>What may not a man expect, when I am accused by you of that, wherein my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science witnesseth with me, that I haue beene most desirous to doe you good. I was now returning home, when hearing, that it was not well with you, nay rather, that you were brought to all extremitie, I returned to doe you seruice, and to assist you in any thing, I could. After my comming, <hi>Seuthes</hi> sending many messengers vnto me, and promising many things, in case I perswaded you to come vnto him, you know, I refused and led you thither, from whence, I thought, you might with most facilitie be transported into <hi>Asia.</hi> For I held it the best course, and knew you most desired it. But when <hi>Aristarchus</hi> with his Gallies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted our passage, I thereupon called you together, as it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to consult, what was to be done. You would not then heare <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starchus,</hi> that commanded you to march into <hi>Cherronesus,</hi> but yeelded to <hi>Seuthes,</hi> that desired to entertaine you; and it was not one, but all of you, that desired to goe with <hi>Seuthes,</hi> and all of you made the decree. Say then, wherein I haue wronged you, hauing led you to the place, whither you all desired to goe? But when <hi>Seuthes</hi> began to defraud you of your pay, if I then commended him, or allowed of his dealing, you haue good cause to accuse &amp; hate me. But if before that time I was most in his fauour, and now furthest out, is it right, that preferring you, before him, you should accuse me for that, which is the cause, that he and I are at difference? But you will say, now I haue gotten from <hi>Seuthes,</hi> that, which was yours, I may cast a faire colour before your eies. Is it not then manifest, that if <hi>Seuthes</hi> haue giuen me any thing, he hath so giuen it, that hee meant not to lose it, and yet pay you your due? I should thinke, that in bestowing on me the lesse, his purpose was to hold the greater from you. If your opinion be such, you may if you please, make the negotiation betwixt him and me void, by demanding your pay. For it is plaine, that if I haue beene bribed, he will demand the bribe againe, in case, I performe not the contract. But my conscience telleth me, that I am farre from intercepting any thing of yours. For I sweare vnto you by all the gods, and the goddesses, that <hi>Seuthes</hi> hath not performed to me, that he promised me for mine owne particular. Hee is present, and heares, and knowes whether I forsweare my selfe or no. And, that you may maruell the more, I haue not receiued so much as other Coronels, nor so much as some Captaines. And why haue I done this? Mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was, the more I suffered pouertie with him, the more he would be my friend, when his abilitie was greater. Now I both see him in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and know, what disposition he is of. Some will say: Shame you not to be so childishly deceiued? Truly I should be ashamed, if I were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached by an enemie. But it is more shame for a friend to deceiue, than to be deceiued. And if there be any caution to be vsed toward a friend, I know you all haue carefully endeuoured, not to giue occasion of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19391:73"/>
from you that, which he hath promised you. We haue neither wronged him in any thing, nor fore-slowed his affaires, nor for feare left any thing vndone, that he hath commanded. But you will say, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that he should not deceiue, though he would, was then to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Heare, I pray you, that which I would neuer say against him, were not you too vniust and vnthankfull toward me. For you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in what case you were, when I led you to <hi>Seuthes.</hi> If you were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to goe into <hi>Perinthus,</hi> did not <hi>Aristarchus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> shut the gates against you, and keepe you out of the Citie? Encamped you not in the field? Was it not the middest of Winter? The market, you had, how was it furnished? What monie had you wherewith to buy? You must remaine in <hi>Thrace</hi>; for the Gallies lay at anchor forbidding your transport. Remaining there, you must be in the enemies countrie, where there were many Horse and <hi>Peltasts.</hi> You had armed Foot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, with which approching the village wee might haue seised vpon corne, though not much; but chace we could not giue, nor take slaues, nor cattle. For I was with you, and neither saw many Horse, nor <hi>Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasts.</hi> In this necessitie if I ioined <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For after you were assisted with them, found you not more plentie of come in the villages, because the <hi>Thracians</hi> were driuen to a speedie flight? And you failed not of captiues and cattle; nor saw we an enemie, since we had Horse, whereas before he followed vs boldly with Horse and <hi>Peltasts,</hi> and suffered vs not to disperse in little troopes, or to take prouision in any quantitie. If therefore he, that wrought this securitie for you, had added no pay vnto it, this would haue beene the greatest wrong, you had suffered; and for this were he in your iudgement vnworthy to liue? But now how depart you? Spent you not the Winter in plentie of all things? And for ouer-plus, had you not that, which was giuen you by <hi>Seuthes?</hi> You haue all this while liued vpon the enemie, and neither seene any of the Armie slaine, nor miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying aliue. Besides, if you haue done any thing praise-worthy, against the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> you hold your reputation still, and haue added a new praise by ouercomming the <hi>Thracians,</hi> against whom you warred in <hi>Europe.</hi> Truly I affirme, you ought to giue thankes to the gods, as for a benefit, for that, for which you are now angrie with mee. And this is the case, you stand in. Consider further how it is with me. I when I first departed for my countrie, departed from you with your good liking and commendation, and as one, that for your sake, had reputation amongst the rest of the <hi>Grecians.</hi> Besides, I was in credit with the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians.</hi> For otherwise they would not haue sent me to you againe. But now I goe away accused by you to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and for you am in hatred with <hi>Seuthes,</hi> whom, hauing followed with you, I hoped to haue found a readie receiuer of me and my children, when need should haue beene. And yet you, for whom I am hated of them, that are much more mightie, than my selfe, for whom I cease not, no not euen now, to doe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19391:73"/>
all the good, I can, you I say, that are thus affected toward me, haue me neither running away, nor forsaking you. But if you doe that, which you threaten, know, that you shall put to death a man, that hath broken many a sleepe for you, that hath done many exploits, and beene in many perills with you, and both in part, and in the whole (by the helpe of the gods) hath erected with you many a Trophie against the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and taken care, that no <hi>Grecians</hi> should hold you for enemies; so that now you may goe without controlment, whither you lift either by Sea or Land. Howbeit because you haue the world at will, and may faile whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you of late desired, and they, that are of most might, stand in need of you, and you are offered pay, and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> the men, that now are esteemed most powerfull, are come to be your leaders, you haue found a time to take away my life. This was not your minde, when you were in distresse; O you men, that are so kinde rememberers of your well deseruers. Then you called me father, and promised al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to bee mindfull of mee, as of your Benefactor. But yet you must not imagine, that these men, which are come for you, are destitute of reason and vnderstanding. For, as I conceiue, they will not thinke the better of you, seeing in what manner you behaue your selues toward mee.</q> After he had spoken thus much, hee kept silence.

Then <hi>Eurylochus</hi> the <hi>Lusatian</hi> borne in <hi>Arcadia</hi> stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp, said: I am of opinion (ô <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>) that you may doe vs much kindnesse, if you will be pleased to effect this first worke of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to procure our pay of <hi>Seuthes,</hi> will he, or nill he, &amp; not to leade vs away before we haue it. <hi>Polycrates</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> stood vp, and spake for <hi>Xenophon</hi>: I see (ô Souldiers) <hi>Heraclides</hi> here present,<note place="margin">

<q>I would hardly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer your accusation, were it not for this young mans sake. We, before we were your friends, ranged this Countrey at our pleasure, wasting what we thought good, and burning what we thought good. And you, when you came Embassador to vs, rested in our Campe without feare of any enemie. Your selues were not in the Countrey, and when you came into it at any time, you remained in your quarters with your Horse bridled, as in a Countrey of enemies, that were too strong for you. Afterwards you became friends to vs, and by our meanes got the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Countrey: and now you seeke to chace vs out of the Land, which by our furtherance you conquered by force (for as you know the enemie was not of strength sufficient to driue vs out) and not only giue vs no gifts for our well deseruing, but as much, as in you lieth, suffer vs not to quarter here at our departure. And speaking these things you neither reuerence the gods, nor this man, who seeth you now suddenly made rich, whereas, before the time you ioined with vs in friendship (as your selfe confessed to me) you led your life in robberie. But why speake you these things to me? For I haue no longer the command: You, men forsooth worthy to be admired, haue deliuered ouer the Armie to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> not calling me to counsell, that as I offended them, in bringing it to you, so by rendring it vp to them againe, I might be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, &amp; win their fauour.</q>
When the <hi>Odrysian</hi> heard these things, he said: The rehearsall of these passages (ô <hi>Medosades</hi>) strike me vnder the earth; and had I knowne before hand, what your propositions would haue bin, I would neuer haue followed you hither.

for that little money, that is due to the Souldiers, your credit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you haue purchased this Kingdome. Then I would haue you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how highly you esteemed the compassing of that, which you haue obtained. I make no doubt if it were vndone, you would wish it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, rather than to possesse much more riches than is demanded. For my part I hold it a greater affront and shame, now not to continue the possession, than at first not to haue gained it, by how much it is harder for a rich man to endure pouertie, than not to haue beene rich, and to fall from a Kingdome to a priuate estate, than at first, not to haue reigned. Doe you not know, that they, who are now your subiects, obey you at this time not for friendship, but for necessitie? and that they would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt their freedome againe, were they not held in by feare. Whether then thinke you, they will more feare and respect you when they see these Souldiers ready to stay, if you desire them, or quickly returne, if you need them, and that other besides hearing their good report of you, will attend your seruice, when you shall please to vse them; or if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that other will refuse you, because they beleeue you not, and these now here beare a better opinion of them, than of you? Nay they were brought vnder your subiection, not because they were fewer in number than we, but for want of good Commanders. Therefore there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger also in this, lest they chuse some of them Commanders, who thinke they are wronged by you, or else the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who are of more power, to whom the Souldiers wil doubtlesse be more zealous in seruice, if they compell you to render to them the arrerages of pay, and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> will sooner consent, because they stand in need of the Armie. This also is not obscure, that the <hi>Thracians</hi> brought vnder your subiection will more cheerfully take Armes against you, than with you. For if you preuaile, they must become your slaues, as they must be free, if you be ouercome. And accounting the Countrey your owne, whether thinke you it will be better preserued from spoile if these Souldiers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing their claime depart in peaceable manner, or if they stay here, as it were in an enemies Territorie, and force you to leuie more, than they are, against them, which must also be fed vpon the Countrey? Now for Money, whether imagine you, will be the greater expence to pay them that you owe, or this debt still remaining due, to wage other Souldiers by aid of whom you may ouer-master these? But the debt seemeth a great summe to <hi>Heraclydes,</hi> as he told me himselfe. Whether then is it not much easier now to take it vp and pay it, than it was to take vp the tenth part of it before we came vnto your seruice? For it is not the quantitie, that maketh much or little, but the abilitie of him that giues, or receiues; and your yeerely reuenue is now more, than the worth of all, you possessed before. These things did I forecast in minde, as your friend, that both you might seeme worthy of that, which the gods haue bestowed vpon you, and I not leese my reputation with the Armie. For you know well, that at this present I can neither harme an enemie, nor succour you hereafter, though I would neuer so faine: Such is the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19391:75"/>
affection of the Armie toward me. And I take your selfe, and the gods, that know all things, to witnesse, that I haue neither receiued any thing of you in regard of them, nor demanded ought of theirs to my priuat vse, no nor any of those things, you promised me. And I sweare further vnto you, I would neuer haue taken gift of yours, vnlesse the Souldiers had receiued that, which is their owne. For it would be a shame for me, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing been so much honoured by them, to procure mine owne aduantage, and neglect theirs. But <hi>Heraclides</hi> esteemeth all things trifles, saue only money, howsoeuer it is gotten. I contrariwise (ô <hi>Seuthes</hi>) thinke, that a man (especially a Ruler) can haue no fairer possessions, than Vertue, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, &amp; Generositie. The possessor of these is enriched with many friends for the present, and enriched with other that hereafter will seeke for his friendship; and in good fortune he hath them, that will reioice with him; in ill, that will be readie to assist and helpe him. But if by my deeds you perceiued not, that I was your friend from my heart, nor yet knew it by my words, remember notwithstanding the words of the Souldiers. For you were present and heard, what was spoken by them, that sought to bring me into hatred; who charged me to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> that I made more account of you, than of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and for themselues like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that I more regarded your well-fare, than theirs. They said I had receiued gifts of you. And when they accused me of these gifts, do you thinke, they saw in me an ill affection toward you, or rather a desire to do you seruice? I am of this minde, that whosoeuer receiueth gifts, he ought to loue and esteeme of him, that is the giuer. Before I came to your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, you entertained me kindly in countenance, and in words, and hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall gifts, &amp; made no end of promises: now you haue compassed your desire, and are as great, as I can make you, seeing the small estimation the Souldiers haue me in, you dare contemne me. But I firmely beleeue, time will teach you, that this money is to be paid, and that you will giue no cause of complaint to those, that haue so well deserued at your hands. Only this is my desire, that when you pay it, you would haue a care to restore me to the same place with the Souldiers, wherein you found me at the first.</q>
               <hi>Seuthes</hi> hearing this, cursed him, that was the cause, why the Souldiers were not paid long before (euerie man imagined he meant <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclides</hi>) For I, quoth <hi>Seuthes,</hi> will pay the arrerages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and neuer had in minde to defraud the Souldiers of the least part of their due. Then spake <hi>Xenophon</hi> againe: Seeing it is your pleasure to make paiment, let me entreat you to doe it by my hands, and not to see me in worse case with the Souldiers for your cause, than I was, when I came to your seruice. <hi>Seuthes</hi> answered: You shall not by my meanes.<note place="margin">

I know, quoth <hi>Seuthes,</hi> it will be safer for you to remaine here, than to depart. <hi>Xenophon</hi> againe replied: I thanke you for your care of me, but I cannot stay.

But seeing I cannot depart hence without danger, is it not better to stay here, and take heed of stones? For you heard their threatnings. So he remained there. The next day <hi>Seuthes</hi> deliuered that which he promised, and sent men to driue the cattell.

                  <hi>Arma.</hi>
               </note>Armes come in the third place. Here they say, We goe by the worst. They make sport when we enter into speech of these matters; they tread downe and spurne with their feet, Slings, Darts, Arrowes, only in regard of these our Guns: and boldly giue out that no <hi>Romane</hi> army had euer beene able to endure these thunderbolts and crackes, especially if they had beene beaten with the greater and more violent kinde of Ordinance. These, and more than these are their vaunts, which a man skilfull of Antiquities would not be to seeke to answer and refute.</p>
            <p>First, where they so lightly esteeme of all these flying weapons, I scarcely beleeue they well know their might. How much doe Slings differ in effect and force (for their forme is verie different) from our smal shot? this at the first hearing seemeth a thing worthy of laughter; but examine it with me. Both the bullets be of Lead: neither is there much diuersitie betwixt their greatnesse or shape; nor yet do the Slings much giue place in power or violence. I must beleeue those, which haue seene it, and which were in the ancient warres euen then, when these Engines were managed with Art and vse. They therefore write, that which may equall, if not preferre them before Guns.</p>
            <p>Concerning violence, it is so forceable in a Sling vnladen with skill, that the verie bullet hath beene often molten with fire conceiued in fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This appeareth by the testimonie of <hi>Lueretius, Ouid, Lucan,</hi> and <hi>Statius.</hi> Doe you not happily credit Poets? Let the Philosopher come. <hi>Seneca</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>Motion doth extenuate the aire, and extenuation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame it: So doth a bullet throwne out of a Sling melt, and distilleth by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of the aire, as by fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like is found written in <hi>Aristotle</hi>: And yet it loseth not his force, but being so on fire pierceth the bodie. <hi>Virgill.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>With molten Lead his Temples twaine disparted stand,</l>
               <l>His lims extended lie vpon the yellow sand.</l>
            </q>
            <p>It killeth with one blow. And I maruell not that <hi>Dauid,</hi> being both young and a Slinger, did ouerthrow the monstrous <hi>Goliah</hi> with this wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. And that you may at once, and fully know the vertue thereof, heare what <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> saith of the inhabitants of the Iles <hi>Baleares.</hi> They
<pb facs="tcp:19391:78"/>
throw stones (for you know that these also, not only Lead are deliuered out of Slings) much greater than other Slingers, and with such stiffenesse and strength, that the blow seemeth to come from some Engine. You see he compareth it with an Engine. And he addeth further, that it pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Targets and Caskes, and all defence of Armour. I denie that there can be greater force in small shot, and perhaps there is not so great, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Muskets onely. Now the Slings are much better in one respect, that they reach and hurt a great way further. Which of our small Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces carrieth his force point blanke, aboue 200. or 300. foot? It fainteth or straieth from the marke, if you aime further off. But the bullet of a Sling hath carried his full strength 600. foot, as you may finde it cleerely expressed in <hi>Vegetius.</hi> The archers &amp; slingers set vp for a marke Besomes, that is, bundles of twigs, or grasse, so that being 600. foot distant from the marke, they hit it with arrowes and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tones throwne out of a Sling. He ioyneth it here with arrowes, and giueth the distance, I spake of, to either of them. But there are other, that preferre it before arrowes, and hold that the sling-bullet outfli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th them. You shall reade in <hi>Strabo:</hi> That a Sling carrieth further than a Bow: In <hi>Dio</hi>; The Slingers ouer-reaching the Archers did hurt all, yea the armed men. This he reporteth in the expedition of <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> against the <hi>Parthians</hi>; who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, as all agree, were well armed, and speciall good Archers: and yet Slingers were too good for them. Which <hi>Xenophon</hi> also writeth plainly in the acts of his countrey-men the <hi>Grecians.</hi> For the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Slingers, saith he, reached further than the <hi>Persian,</hi> and than many of the Archers. Therefore they reached farre.</p>
            <p>But went they neere the marke? All testifie they did, especially the Islanders of the <hi>Baleares</hi>; and that they learned this certainty in throwing euen from their Cradle.</p>
            <p>Also you may reade in the Bible, that seuen hundred or thereabouts, of the Inhabitants of <hi>Gabaa</hi> were so good marke-men with a Sling that they could hit you a haire. Enough of Slings.</p>
            <p>Some say that Gunnes doe more terrifie by reason of their sound. I grant it. But whom doe they terrifie? Birds? For I cannot thinke that true Souldiers will be moued with their sound or firie sight; vnlesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at the first. And truly I am of opinion, that if the <hi>Romans</hi> had ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned battell with vs, they would at the first haue feared the shew and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of our Peeces: But at the first only. After they had discerned the truth they would haue been the same, they were wont; especially so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they would by couering themselues with their <hi>Targets</hi> haue weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or made vaine the stroke of the Bullet.</p>
            <p>And for great Ordinance I see no reason to repute it so terrible, in as much as those, that haue had the experience, cleerely confesse, that they neuer saw battell broken by this kinde of Artillerie. A plaine Hillocke, or Rampier, or top of a Trench in the way breaketh the force of this so terrible Engine. These things are knowne to Souldiers; and excepting at the siege of Townes, this Engine serueth rather for a shew, than to
<pb facs="tcp:19391:79"/>
worke great masteries in the warres. I omit the disaduantages which follow it, and forbeare to oppose and bend against it the <hi>Roman</hi> Engines. This matter requireth a larger discourse, and is to be reserued for some other place.</p>
            <p>I come to Darts, which they likewise sport at. Yet haue they this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, that they are fit for readie &amp; speedie seruice, and at all times and places. It is not so in Guns, which haue a time both to be charged and also discharged, and hinderance from raine and other casualties. And doe not Darts outreach them? I obserue that they are matched with Arrowes by <hi>Homer,</hi> in whom <hi>Vlysses</hi> glorieth thus of himselfe:
<q>I cast a Dart as farre, as other doe an Arrow shoot.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Although this attributed to <hi>Vlysses</hi> is not commonly true, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row flieth further of both. But how much? The proportion is expressed in <hi>Statius:</hi>
               <q>As far as Arrowes fly at thrice, and foure times with a Dart you throw.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He measureth out a Theater for Plaies and describeth it: And it was so much ground, saith he, as you can reach with casting a Dart foure times, and shooting an Arrow thrice. Therfore an Arrow reached further than a Dart by a fourth part of distance. And if that flew six hundred foot, then this foure hundred and aboue. So that I haue good cause to smile at the asseueration of an <hi>Italian</hi> Writer, one yet skilfull in these things, who constantly denieth that any Arme is of force sufficient to throw a Stone or other weapon fortie Paces. Peace man, and beleeue a thing so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in all antiquitie. And had these Darts any force? You haue seene in the kinde of Dart called <hi>Pilum:</hi> whereof I haue entreated in my third Booke. Will you heare of another kinde?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tragula.</hi>
               </note>The <hi>Spaniards, Gaules</hi> and sometimes the <hi>Romans,</hi> vsed a Dart called <hi>Tragula.</hi> Of it doth, I know not what Writer report in <hi>Suidas: Cotta</hi> fought with a weapon, that is tearmed <hi>Tragula,</hi> which he threw so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, that thorow <hi>Curace,</hi> and sides, he fastened to the earth, as with a naile, whomsoeuer he hit. A Gods name what Armes were these? how growne in strength either by Nature, or by Skill gotten through exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arrowes.</hi>
               </note> I will say nothing of Arrowes. Both they were in estimation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the memorie of man, and peraduenture they are now altogether gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer not vpon the best aduice. I finde in <hi>Plutarks Crassus,</hi> that the <hi>Parthian</hi> Arrows forced all kinde of Armor: In <hi>Agathias</hi> the Historian, that Arrowes shot by the hand of one <hi>Aligernus</hi> a <hi>Gothe,</hi> passed thorow a mans body, <hi>Target, Curace,</hi> and all. And that you will maruell at, if they fell vpon a stone, or other hard thing not easie to be broken, they shiuered it to fitters with the violence of the blow. Looke your selfe, if you please, in <hi>Procopius,</hi> what he writeth euerie where of the Archers of his age. I only take this out of him: That an Arrow was put off with that force, that neither <hi>Curace,</hi> nor <hi>Target,</hi> could make resistance. This may suffice for light-weapons, which notwithstanding are the principall in our warres. They try the whole encounter, and straight either gaine or lose the Field. True and lasting fights are only now to be read of. I
<pb facs="tcp:19391:79"/>
speake not all this because I hold the ancient weapons better, than those we now vse, but only to shew that they are not to be contemned, and that some of them are to be taken vp at this day, and to be mingled with ours. This would be a gallant and profitable manner of seruice, if it were handled by men ripe in exercise, otherwise these weapons are not worth a pinne.</p>
            <p>Now for the fashion of arming the <hi>Romans,</hi> what can be alleaged, why it should not be the best of all other?<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>A man was armed from head to foot, his legges not vncouered, and had a large <hi>Target,</hi> a principall defence both for Horse and Foot.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Target.</hi>
               </note> I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that there is no Armor of more vse, than the <hi>Target.</hi> But our sloth, or rashnesse, hath cast it cleane out of doores. Some neighbours yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, as the <hi>Polish</hi> Hors-men, and <hi>Turks.</hi> We, as I said, haue slothfully laid it downe, or else carelesly; as though we were safe by contempt of things seruing for our defence. Yet I vrge it not, because I see such as haue written of warre, acknowledge this fault, and exhort to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Surely the most of our men are vnarmed, and what else, but to be compared to <hi>velitarie</hi> bands? open to hurts, and therefore fearefull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nature, carefull of her selfe, compelleth to feare. I speake not of Pike-men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pikes.</hi>
               </note> whom we arme according to the laudable custome of the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> And yet we haue few of them, I meane we <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> or <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue, I confesse, who also by a prouerbe doe tearme the Pike Queene of weapons. The <hi>Swisses</hi> most of all, who in times past were famous in this kinde of fight, and the true <hi>Phalangites.</hi> But now they begin to vse them more sparingly, and to mingle other kindes of light weapons with them.</p>
            <p>And what is mine opinion? I deliuer it not, because <hi>Polybius</hi> hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken sufficiently for me, where he compareth the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Macedonian</hi> Armes of purpose. What can I bring more wise, or more sound, than is by him alleaged? Notwithstanding this is my iudgement: That the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> good and pliable to imitate all good things vsed few Pikes, and in <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Caesars</hi> time they gaue ouer those, that the <hi>Triarij</hi> did beare. The cause was, for that it is no conuenient weapon for a battell mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalled and distinguished into Maniples. It ought to be a large and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent body, where Pikes are of force; being diuided they are vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Further, but few Pikes serue to much purpose in a great body, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first Rankes only can charge them, and the rest giue no further helpe, than by thrusting on with their bodies. Moreouer, such a battell vnmoueable for the most part, &amp; vniforme, is strong only in Front: it can hardly turne vpon the suddaine and not breake. Lastly, he that carieth that weapon, hath almost no vse of any other (yet the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had also a Hurling-staffe) and specially he cannot fitly beare or wield a great <hi>Target.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> considered these things, and perhaps more than these. And albeit they often endangered <hi>Phalanges,</hi> and sometimes with their owne danger (as <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> is said to haue quaked at the sight of a thicke <hi>Phalange</hi> comming on with their Pikes charged) yet did they
<pb facs="tcp:19391:80"/>
more esteeme their owne weapons, and iudge them better for all kinde of seruice. For they themselues were able to fight in all kindes, in Front, in Flanke, and behinde, and also were able all to serue, as occasion serued. As in a body it is best, when all parts are actiue and euerie one fit for his office; so is it in a battell: for, as <hi>Liuy</hi> saith, The <hi>Phalange</hi> is vnmouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and of one kinde, the <hi>Roman</hi> battell consisting of many parts, easie to be diuided, easie to be ioined and knit together, if vse require. Adde that the <hi>Romans</hi> could range and vnite themselues in rough and vneuen grounds, the <hi>Phalange,</hi> which consisteth of thicknesse and depth, could not to any purpose. And therefore if a ditch, hill, hedge, or other thing came in the way, it was presently disioyned, and the <hi>manipular</hi> Battalion insinuated it selfe into the void spaces, and so ouerthrew the <hi>Phalange.</hi> And yet I denie not, that Pikes are of good vse in our customes &amp; fights, especially against horsemen, whose charge they notably sustaine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse. But what need is of them in the <hi>Roman</hi> manner of arming? when the <hi>Velites</hi> for the most part gaue the first charge in the Front, and made the horses stand off; if they could not, the <hi>Legionarie</hi> souldier with his Darts did easily stay, or put them to flight. This weapon was heauy and powerfull, whereof euery Souldier carried a couple; so that they might very well put the horse to retreat with defence of their great Targets, or else with threatning the point (as I conceiue) of the other Dart, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being knit together shoulder to shoulder and close. This I am sure of, that the <hi>Roman</hi> battell was seldome broken by the impression of the horsemen only, which is commonly seene at this day. What? will you say not by the <hi>Parthians?</hi> Yes. But marke that I spake of impression. The <hi>Parthians</hi> did for the most p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rt ouerwhelme the <hi>Romans</hi> with their arrowes afarre off, and neuer came to the shock. Therefore they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw them not, but by little and little wounded and wasted them by comming on and retiring after their manner. The same would befall our Pikemen through the enemies shot, were they not answered with like weapons, and with horsemen. Wherefore I thus resolue concerning Pikes, that they were not necessarie for the <hi>Romans,</hi> and yet are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for vs, and so would be, although we should take vp the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> armour in part. I haue seene some that would haue them ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and would haue <hi>maniples</hi> armed partly with Swords and Targets, partly with Pikes. Let Commanders and men of experience consider thereof.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing is Embattailing, which if I should account perfect and sound at all hands in the <hi>Roman</hi> manner of raunging,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acies.</hi>
               </note> Reason would be on my side. In the Front were the <hi>Hastati,</hi> the weakest; next after them the <hi>Principes,</hi> more strong; then the <hi>Triarij,</hi> strongest of all, that the enemy might be weakned and spent by degrees. The horsemen were placed on the Flanks, to saue the Battell from enuironing and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing: and if the enemies horse charged the <hi>Romans</hi> front, then were the <hi>Roman</hi> horse to giue on their flanke. I need not repeat many things, I haue discoursed before. But this is of greatest marke, and a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
<pb facs="tcp:19391:80"/>
matter for victorie, that the Battalions haue their spaces and intervals, and the <hi>Velites</hi> in them or before them. So that the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie</hi> Souldier serueth the <hi>Velites</hi> for retreat, that they may without danger entertaine, or forsake the skirmish at their pleasure. Goe to, say the whole Band of the <hi>Velites</hi> is defeated and of no vse, what inconuenience is it? The Ranks stand entire, and the <hi>Velites</hi> being wisely kept vnmixt and diuided from them, the <hi>Statarie</hi> Souldier thinketh not that hee hath lost any thing by the ouerthrow of the <hi>Velites.</hi> Therefore they enter the fight fresh and whole, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impaired in body or minde, and to be short, with assurednesse and certainty of retreat into the intervals. Consider you Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, this is a great secret, that your Souldier be bold and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, fight with hope of victorie, being compelled retreats with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare of ignominie or danger. So was it amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> by reason of their triple battell of their <hi>Hastati, Principes</hi> and <hi>Tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rij,</hi> which last vndertooke the maine danger with assurance of their owne strength. There were the Commanders, there the Standard, there the old Souldier, and in summe there was Victory because Valour was there. Packe away you <hi>Turks</hi> with your <hi>Ianizars,</hi> which vsurpe a manner of resemblance, but a false resemblance of the ancient discipline. If it were a true one, we had not now beene. For I rest out of doubt of this, if the ancient were ioyned to these our new-found Armes, and withall the true marshalling of Bands and kinde of embattailing vsed, the old and new World would shortly be subiect to one man. O secret truly heauenly, which men rather ghesse at than vnderstand, and which gouernest this world with a wonderfull temper, bridlest, or aduancest the wicked, and liftest vp or throwest downe the good, euen as they depart from or come to thee. I display not my wings neerer to this Sunne, lest I melt, or be consumed; but I cry with a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ee voice, Hee that will attaine to Glory or Empire, let him turne to the ancient Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. For surely if our light Souldiers (so I call shot) were mixt betweene the <hi>Maniples</hi> and before the <hi>Maniples</hi> of the armed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals and distances for retreat, and that against the horse and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med foot; what battell durst assaile, nay what battell could resist vs? For in regard hereof our men should be alwaies fit to charge, fit to retire for a second charge. All which notwithstanding is to be done with long vse and exercise, lest they trouble vs in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I call you to witnesse, you Commanders, that I speake truth. Imitate it then in good faith, but against them that oppugne the Faith.</p>
            <p>There are many things in particular concerning ordering of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, whereof we might giue a taste, but precepts wee cannot now giue; and these depend vpon a wit truly martiall, that is, fiery and high.

For euery small inuention is not by and by to be embraced or of efficacie, but only such a one, as is squared out by circumspection and heed. He ought to be an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> that is a Commander, and to haue eyes in his backe, forhead, head, and feet. And yet all things are easie to be ordered, where this common good order hath his being.

               </note>Ministeries are either out of date amongst vs, or else volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and without law. Yet who can deny, but that such like may with comelinesse be vsed towards the Coronels and Commanders without vexation of the Souldiers, being parted amongst them by turnes?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19391:81"/>But Workes are the chiefe and most profitable,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Workes.</hi>
               </note> yea the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie part, not only for victorie, but also for safetie. And yet why is entrenching of the Campe altogether cast off? Wee set downe open and without any certaine order, and when we will seeme more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, we inclose our selues with our carriage, both an inuention and terme Barbarous. But see me the <hi>Roman</hi> Campe, so formed, so quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered out; how beautifull is it in sight, apt for vse, strong against all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion and force of the enemy? How many of our owne and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-armies haue beene cut in peeces, or put to flight by carelesnesse herein? And euen of late those gallant Christian forces at the <hi>Donaw,</hi> whom the most cruell enemy surprised on the sudden. Say I beseech you if the <hi>Roman</hi> Campe and Guards had beene there, would this haue happened?</p>
            <p>But they like not, or rather are ashamed to be Labourers. Should a Souldier put his hand to the Spade? It is an ignominy. Away, hire them that list to fall to such drudgerie. These be their words. But whose? You would thinke them of the blood Royall at the least, or else men of great riches. Yet looke vpon them, you shall perceiue them most abiect of all other, whom Need and Despaire haue compelled to seruice. My fellow, art thou ashamed to doe that, which many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men, yea Senators haue done? This pettie conceit, wherewith they couer their sloth, will packe away with one onely warning or Proclamation of a Prince. No man will hold that reproachfull, which shall be done in common, which shall be done by the better sort, and sometimes by commanders them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What profit is more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, than of these Workes? What more common in Writings and Bookes? Yet wee neglect them, and had rather cast away our selues, than our opinions.</p>
            <p>And concerning Workes, how profitable are they without the Campe, being the only meanes and remedie, neuer deceiuing against great Ordinance, and to make your approches without perill to any Citie. Workes are of wonderfull effect to blocke vp Townes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your selfe in them against the enemy; and with Workes you may performe that, which otherwise is not to bee done with great Bands of men. They haue likewise their place in the battell, either to fortifie your selfe suddenly on any side against the enemy, or to traine and draw him on, or else to make an orderly retreat. You shall reade that trenches were cast by <hi>Sylla,</hi> against the sudden circumuention of <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> huge Armie and infinite multitude of Horse. And that the like was done by <hi>Caesar</hi> vpon another reason and occasion. What need

The effect will proue the saying of <hi>Domitius Corbulo</hi> true, that <hi>An enemy is to be ouercome with the spade,</hi> that is, with <hi>Workes.</hi> Would God we had mindes to trie, and to lead the Souldier hither by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, and that one would not be faultie herein by the example of another.</p>

                  <hi>Exercise.</hi>
               </note>The second thing in Discipline is Exercise. That also is neglected of vs. Where are our Field-teachers? Where is our daily meditation of Armes? And when no man professeth an Art, which he hath not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, men thinke they perfect in warre alone, as soone as they come to it. The Drum is strucke, they runne together, their names are entred in the muster-booke, they disguise themselues in apparell, they looke grim vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter, they play the Ruffians, and bouse it out in drinke, streight way they are become Souldiers. Are these things to be laughed at, or pitied? Goe, goe, you that be wise to our forefathers, and by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fashion your Souldiers in all manner and kinds of Armes. For <hi>neither the length of age</hi> (as <hi>Vegetius</hi> saith) <hi>nor number of yeeres doe teach the Art of Warre, but continuall meditation of exercise.

               </note>The Lawes are last. Come hither my Commanders, shew me your Lawes, that I may match them with the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawes. Why are you so silent? Haue you none, or few? Those that you haue are they voide, and without effect? Truly this is our life:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lust ruleth in stead of Law, and the Sword challengeth the place of Right.</hi> Who at this day punisheth Theft? Who Rapes? Nay who Murther? For Whoredome and Adulterie are now counted braue exploites, and worthy to be rewarded with a Crowne. If I speake of abstinence and frugalitie in Diet, I shall be scorned with the tongue out; of swearing or periurie, I shall be thrust out of dores by the head and shoulders. Shamefastnesse and honour, whither are you gone? How are you bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from the most part of our Europe-seruice. I protest againe, my complaint and accusation is not against the good. I write against you, you spots and wems of noble <hi>Mars,</hi> which make the warres a refuge and sanctuarie for your villanies. I haue sufficiently declared, that the <hi>Romans</hi> held another course. There Iustice, Chastitie, and Innocencie, dwelt in Campe, and their Souldiers were in no place fierce and violent, but against the enemie. I rip not vp those things, which I a while agoe spake of. But truly they are such, as albeit many will debase in speech, yet can they not but extoll them in minde. And yet who is so haire-braind that dares controll them? They doe not so, but say that those times are gone; that this age requires other manners. O good and sweet conceites. As though men were other now, then they were wont, or another reason gouerned, and that which is iust not iust in all ages, and so that which is vniust. The matter is, they are hardly laid vnto being enioined to abstinence from outrage and vices, to turne their hands against Enemies, not Citizens, to reserue their strength for <hi>Mars,</hi> not for <hi>Venus</hi>; in summe not to consume their entertainment or pay in dicing,
<pb facs="tcp:19391:82"/>
lewdnesse, and gluttonie. Concerning which pay, it comes fitly to my minde to admonish, that the ancient warriers would be sure to take heed not to commit all to the Souldiers hands; but, as <hi>Vegesius</hi> saith; <hi>It was diuinely ordained, that halfe should be sequestred to be laid vp with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, and reserued there for the Souldiers, lest it might be consumed by their Cabin-mates in lauishnesse and idle expences.</hi> O excellent, and as he tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it, <hi>Diuine Ordinance,</hi> carying with it a double profit, and that most euident; namely, to make the Souldier more continent, and sparing, lesse giuen to wantonnesse, banquetting, and companie, and to make him fight with greater courage in defence of the Ensigne, <hi>According to mans nature</hi> (as the same Authour noteth) <hi>which euer hath more care of that wherein he seeth his Wealth lie.</hi> Which thing I also obserue to haue beene practised by a <hi>Grecian</hi> Generall, named <hi>Iphycrates. Polyenus</hi> writeth of him, that in paying his Souldiers, he with-held euerie month <hi>A fourth part, and retained it for a pledge, lest they should easily forsake the Armie. And so he had both his Companies full, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> his Souldiers rich.</hi> Who seeth not that this may or rather ought to be practised in our loose manners, seeing that otherwise our Souldiers being, as it were, gloriously prodigall, continue, though seruing neuer so long, alwaies poore and needie, and would be alwaies readie to sterue, if they had not libertie to spoile. These things, and the like, might easily be imitated by vs, if we had a little higher mindes, and as the Poet saith, our hearts seasoned with <hi>Noble honestie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it is knowne how <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishment</hi> excite and bridle, which whole kinde is omitted by vs through carelesnesse and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rewards. Punishment</hi>
               </note> If the rewards of Promotion were againe brought to their right course, it would doe much good, and that without any expence of the Treasurie. I speake of this kinde, as when a Souldier for his vertue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth by degrees, and a difference is betwixt the Captaines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. If some little aduantage were adioined to their places, how would it inflame the lower sort of Souldiers?</p>
            <p>Lastly Crownes, and Chaines, and those other things particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by me, together with publike commendation and praise would transport ingenuous mindes not only to danger, but to death it selfe. Notwithstanding I would not haue punishment omitted.
<q>Vertue cannot rise, where Vice accompanieth it with equall pace.</q>
And Souldiers are to be held-in with a sharpe and seuere kinde of chastisement.</p>
            <p>From whence are so many Rebellions and Mutinies, Threatnings and Weapons bent against their owne Commanders? From want of punishment, and from too much libertie. And albeit other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses be pretended, these are the true and inward causes. Let them be repressed with punishment, and a Souldier learne more to feare his Generall, than his Enemie.</p>
            <p>I haue enough weighed these things in the true Ballance of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, especially being so vnequall. I exhort againe that they be put in practise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19391:83"/>But whom doe I exhort? I wish he, that hath interest, and whom I marke out with these eyes of my minde, were present, and had the hearing of all, that hath beene discoursed. But that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in the <hi>Diuine Prouidence:</hi> heare he, or heare he not, right and reason will heare, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the practise, reuenge the slighting and contempt of them.</p>
