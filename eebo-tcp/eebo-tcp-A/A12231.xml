            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO MY DEARE LADY AND SISTER, THE COVNTESSE OF PEMBROKE.</head>
            <p>HEre now haue you (most deare, and most worthye to bee most deare Lady) this idle worke of mine: which I feare (like the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders webbe) will be thought fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be swept away, then worne to any other purpose. For my part, in very trueth (as the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell fathers among the Greekes, were woont to doe to the babes they would not foster) I could well finde in my heart, to cast out in some desert of forgetfulnesse this childe, which I am loath to father. But you desired me to doe it, and your desire, to my heart is an absolute commaundement. Now, it is done onely for you, only to you: if you keepe it to your selfe, or to such friends, who will weigh errors in the ballance of good will, I hope, for the fathers sake, it will be pardoned, perchaunce made much of, though in it selfe it haue deformities. For indeed, for seuerer eies it is not, being but a trifle, and that trifling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled. Your deare selfe can best witnes the manner,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:3"/>
being done in loose sheetes of paper, most of it in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the rest, by sheetes, sent vnto you, as fast as they were done. In summe, a young head, not so wel staied as I would it were, (and shall be when God will) hauing many many fancies begotten in it, if it had not beene in some way deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, woulde haue growen a monster, and more sorie might I be that they came in, then that they gat out. But his chiefe safety, shall bee the not walking abroade; and his chiefe protection, the bearing the liuery of your name; which (if much much good will doe not deceiue me) is worthie to be a sanctuarie for a greater offender. This say I, because I know the vertue so; and this say I, because it may be euer so, or to say better, because it will be euer so. Reade it then at your idle times, and the follies your good iudgement will finde in it, blame not, but laugh at. And so, looking for no better stuffe, then, as in a Haberdashers shoppe, glasses, or feathers, you will continue to loue the writer, who doth exceedingly loue you, and moste moste heartilie praies you may long liue, to be a principall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the family of the <hi>Sidneis.</hi>

            <p>THE disfigured face, gentle Reader, wherewith this worke not long since ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the common view, moued that noble Lady, to whose Honour conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, to whose protection it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to take in hand the wiping away those spottes wherewith the beauties therof were vnworthely blemished. But as often in repairing a ruinous house, the mending of some olde part occasioneth the making of some new: so here her honourable labour begonne in correcting the faults, ended in supplying the defectes; by the view of what was ill done guided to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what was not done. Which part with what aduise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into, with what successe it hath beene passed through, most by her doing, all by her directing, if they may be entreated not to define, which are vnfurnisht of meanes to discerne, the rest (it is hoped) will fauourably censure. But this they shall, for theyr better satisfaction, vnderstand, that though they finde not here what might be expected, they may finde neuerthelesse as much as was intended, the conclusion, not the perfection of <hi>Arcadia</hi>: and that no further then the Authours own writings, or knowen determinations could direct. Whereof who sees not the reason, must consider there may be reason which hee sees not. Albeit I
<pb facs="tcp:12151:4"/>
dare affirme hee either sees, or from wiser iudgements then his owne may heare, that <hi>Sir Philip Sidneies</hi> writings can no more be perfected without <hi>Sir Philip Sidney,</hi> then <hi>Apelles</hi> pictures without <hi>Apelles.</hi> There are that thinke the contrary: and no wonder. Neuer was <hi>Arcadia</hi> free from the comber of such <hi>Cattell.</hi> To vs, say they, the pastures are not pleasaunt: and as for the flowers, such as we light on we take no delight in, but the greater part growe not within our reach. Poore soules! what talke they of flowers? They are Roses, not flowers, must doe them good, which if they finde not here, they shall doe well to go feed elswhere: Any place will better like them: For without <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia</hi> nothing growes in more plenty, then <hi>Lettuce</hi> sutable to their <hi>Lippes,</hi> If it be true that likenes is a great cause of liking, and that contraries, inferre contrary consequences: then is it true, that the wortheles Reader can neuer worthely esteeme of so worthye a writing: and as true, that the noble, the wise, the vertuous, the curteous, as many as haue had any acquaintaunce with true learning and knowledge, will with all loue and deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse entertaine it, as well for affinity with themselues, as being child to such a father. Whom albeit it do not exactly and in euery lineament represent; yet considering the fathers vntimely death preuented the timely birth of the childe, it may happily seeme a thanke-woorthy labour, that the defects being so few, so small, and in no principall part, yet the greatest vnlikenes is rather in defect then in deformity. But howsoeuer it is, it is now by more then one interest <hi>The Countesse of Pembrokes Arcadia:</hi> done, as it was, for her: as it is, by her. Neither shall these pains be the last (if no vnexpected accident cut off her determination) which the euerlasting loue of her excellent brother, will make her consecrate to his memory.</p>

            <head>THE COVNTESSE OF PEMBROKES ARCADIA VVRITTEN BY SIR PHILIP SIDNEI. THE FIRST BOOKE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IT was in the time that the earth</hi> begins to put on her new aparrel against the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch of her louer, and that the Sun running a most euen course becums an indifferent arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter betweene the night and the day; when the hopelesse shepheard <hi>Strephon</hi> was come to the sandes, which lie against the Island of Cithera; where viewing the place with a heauy kinde of delight, and sometimes casting his eyes to the Ileward, he called his friendly riuall, the pastor <hi>Claius</hi> vnto him, &amp; setting first down in his darkened countenance a dolefull copie of what he would speake: O my <hi>Claius,</hi> saide hee, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> hether we are now come to pay the rent, for which we are so called vnto by ouer-bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie Remembrance, Remembrance, restlesse Remembrance, which claymes not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this dutie of vs, but for it will haue vs forget our selues. I pray you when we were amid our flocke, and that of other shepheardes some were running after their sheep strayed beyond their boundes, some delighting their eyes with seeing them nibble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> vpon the short and sweete grasse, some medicining their sicke ewes, some setting a bell for an ensigne of a sheepish squadron, some with more leasure inuenting new games of exercising their bodies and sporting their wits: did Remembrance graunt vs any holiday, eyther for pastime or deuotion, nay either for necessary foode or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall rest? but that still it forced our thoughts to worke vpon this place, where wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> last (alas that the word last should so long last) did graze our eyes vpon her euer flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing beautie: did it not still crie within vs? Ah you base minded wretches, are your thoughts so deeply bemired in the trade of ordinary worldlings, as for respect of gaine some paultry wool may yeeld you, to let so much time passe without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly her estate, especially in so troublesome a season? to leaue that shore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saluted, from whence you may see to the Island where she dwelleth? to leaue those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> steps vnkissed wherein <hi>Vrania</hi> printed the farewell of all beautie? Well then, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce commaunded, we obeyed, and here we find, that as our remembrance
<pb facs="tcp:12151:5"/>
came euer cloathed vnto vs in the forme of this place, so this place giues newe heate to the feauer of our languishing remembrance. Yonder my <hi>Claius, Vrania</hi> lighted, the verie horse (me thought) bewayled to be so disburdned: and as for thee, poore <hi>Claius,</hi> when thou wentst to helpe her downe, I saw reuerence and desire so deuide thee, that thou didst at one instant both blushe and quake, and in stead of bearing her,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> warre readie to fal down thy selfe. There she sate, vouchsafing my cloake (then most gorgeous) vnder her: at yonder rising of the ground shee turned her selfe, looking backe toward her woonted abode, and because of her parting bearing much sorrow in her eyes, the lightsomnes wherof had yet so natural a cherefulnesse, as it made euen sorrow seeme to smile; at that turning shee spake to vs all, opening the cherrie of her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> lips, and Lord how greedily mine eares did feed vpon the sweete words she vttered? And here she laide her hand ouer thine eyes, when shee saw the teares springing in them, as if she would conceale them from other, and yet her selfe feele some of thy sorrow: But woe is me, yonder, yonder, did shee put her foote into the boate, at that instant as it were diuiding her heauenly beautie, betweene the Earth and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Sea. But when she was imbarked, did you not marke how the windes whistled, and the seas daunst for ioy, how the sailes did swell with pride, and all because they had <hi>Vrania</hi>? O <hi>Vrania,</hi> blessed be thou <hi>Vrania,</hi> the sweetest fairnesse and fairest sweetnesse: with that word his voice brake so with sobbing, that he could say no further; and <hi>Claius</hi> thus answered. Alas my <hi>Strephon</hi> (said he) what needes this skore to recken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> vp onely our losses? What doubt is there, but that the light of this place doth cal our thoughtes to appeare at the court of affection, held by that racking steward, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance? Aswell may sheepe forget to feare when they spie woolues, as we can misse such fancies, when we see any place made happie by her treading. Who can choose that saw her but thinke where she stayed, where she walkt, where she turned, where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> she spoke? But what is all this? truely no more, but as this place serued vs to thinke of those thinges, so those thinges serue as places to call to memorie more excellent matters. No, no, let vs thinke with consideration, and consider with acknowledging, and acknowledge with admiration, and admire with loue, and loue with ioy in the midst of all woes: let vs in such sorte thinke, I say, that our poore eyes were so inri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> as to behold, and our lowe hearts so exalted as to loue, a maide, who is such, that as the greatest thing the world can shewe, is her beautie, so the least thing that may be praysed in her, is her beautie. Certainely as her eye-lids are more pleasant to behold, then two white kiddes climing vp a faire tree, and browsing on his tendrest braunches, and yet are nothing, compared to the day-shining starres contayned in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> them; and as her breath is more sweete then a gentle South-west wind, which coms creeping ouer flowrie fieldes and shaddowed waters in the extreeme heate of sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and yet is nothing, compared to the hony flowing speach that breath doth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: no more all that our eyes can see of her (though when they haue seene her, what else they shall euer see is but drie stuble after clouers grasse) is to be matched with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the flocke of vnspeakeable vertues laid vp delightfully in that best builded folde. But in deede as we can better consider the sunnes beautie, by marking how he guildes these waters, and mountaines then by looking vpon his owne face, too glorious for our weake eyes: so it may be our conceits (not able to beare her sun-stayning excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie) will better way it by her workes vpon some meaner subiect employed. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> alas, who can better witnesse that then we, whose experience is grounded vpon fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? hath not the onely loue of her made vs (beeing silly ignorant shepheards) raise

vp our thoughts aboue the ordinary leuell of the worlde, so as great clearkes doe not disdaine our conference? hath not the desire to seeme worthie in her eyes made vs when others were sleeping, to sit vewing the course of heauens? when others were running at base, to runne ouer learned writings? when other marke their sheepe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> we two marke our selues? hath not shee throwne reason vpon our desires, and, as it were giuen eyes vnto <hi>Cupid</hi>? hath in any, but in her, loue-fellowship maintained frindship between riuals, and beautie taught the beholders chastitie? He was going on with his praises, but <hi>Strephon</hi> bad him stay, and looke: and so they both perceaued a thinge which floted drawing nearer and nearer to the banke; but rather by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> working of the Sea, then by any selfe industrie. They doubted a while what it should bee; till it was cast vp euen hard before them: at which time they fully saw that it was a man. Wherupon running for pitie sake vnto him, they found his hands (as it should appeare, constanter frendes to his life then his memorie) fast griping vpon the edge of a square small coffer, which lay all vnder his breast: els in him selfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> no shew of life, so as the boord seemed to be but a beere to carrie him a land to his Sepulchre. So drew they vp a young man of so goodly shape, and well pleasing fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that one would thinke death had in him a louely countenance; and, that though he were naked, nakednes was to him an apparrell. That sight increased their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, and their compassion called vp their care; so that lifting his feete aboue his head, making a great deale of salt water come out of his mouth, they layd him vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> some of their garments, and fell to rub and chafe him, till they brought him to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer both breath the seruant, and warmth the companion of liuing. At length open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes, he gaue a great groane, (a dolefull note but a pleasaunt dittie) for by that, they founde not onely life, but strength of life in him. They therefore continued on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> their charitable office, vntill (his spirits being well returned,) he (without so much as thanking them for their paines) gate vp, and looking round about to the vttermost lymittes of his sight, and crying vpon the name of <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> nor seeing nor hearing cause of comfort, what (said he) and shall <hi>Musidorus</hi> liue after <hi>Pyrocles</hi> destruction? therewithall hee offered wilfully to cast himselfe againe into the sea: a strange sight to the shepheards, to whom it seemed, that beefore being in apparance dead had yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> saued his life, and now comming to his life, should be a cause to procure his death; but they ranne vnto him, and pulling him backe, (then to feeble for them) by force stickled that vnnaturall fray. I pray you (said he) honest men, what such right haue you in me, as not to suffer me to doe with my selfe what I list? and what pollicie haue you to bestowe a benefite where it is counted an iniury? They hearing him speake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> in Greeke (which was their naturall language) became the more tender hearted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; and considering by his calling and looking, that the losse of some deare friend was great cause of his sorrow; tolde him they were poore men that were bound by course of humanitie to preuent so great a mischiefe; and that they wisht him, if opinion of some bodies perishing bred such desperate anguish in him, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> he should be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted by his own proof, who had lately escaped as apparant danger as any might be. No, no (said he) it is not for me to attend so high a blissefullnes: but since you take care of me I pray you find mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that some Bark may be prouided, that will go out of the hauen, that if it be possible wee maye find the bodie farre farre too precious a food for fishes: and for the hire (said he) I haue within this casket, of value <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> sufficient to content them. <hi>Claius</hi> presently went to a Fisherman, and hauing agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, and prouided some apparrell for the naked stranger, he imbarked, and the Shepheards with him: and were no sooner gone beyond the mouth of the hauen,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:6"/>
but that some way into the sea they might discerne (as it were) a stayne of the waters colour, and by times some sparkes and smoke mounting thereout. But the young man no sooner saw it, but that beating his brest, he cried, that there was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his ruine, intreating them to bend their course as neere vnto it as they could: telling, how that smoake was but a small relique of a great fire, which had driuen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> both him and his friend rather to committe themselues to the cold mercie of the sea, than to abide the hote crueltie of the fire: and that therefore, though they both had abandoned the ship, that he was (if any where) in that course to bee met withall. They steared therefore as neere thether-ward as they cold: but when they came so neere as their eies were ful masters of the obiect, they saw a sight ful of piteous strange<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a ship, or rather the carkas of the shippe, or rather some few bones of the carkas, hulling there, part broken, part burned, part drowned: death hauing vsed more than one dart to that destruction. About it floted great store of very rich thinges, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chestes which might promise no lesse. And amidst the precious thinges were a number of dead bodies, which likewise did not only testifie both elements violence,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> but that the chiefe violence was growen of humane inhumanitie: for their bodies were full of grisly wounds, and their bloud had (as it were) filled the wrinckles of the seas visage: which it seemed the sea woulde not wash away, that it might witnes it is not alwaies his fault, when wee condemne his cruletie. In summe, a defeate, where the conquered kept both field and spoile: a shipwrack without storme or ill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> footing: and a wast of fire in the midst of the water.</p>
            <p>But a litle way off they saw the mast, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e proude height now lay along; like a widdow hauing lost her make of whom she held her honor: but vpon the mast they saw a yong man (at least if hee were a man) bearing shew of about 18. yeares of age, who sate (as on horseback) hauing nothing vpon him but his shirt, which beeing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> wrought with blew silke and golde; had a kinde of resemblance to the sea: on which the sun (then neare his Westerne home) did shote some of his beames. His haire (which the young men of Greece vsed to weare very long) was stirred vp and downe with the wind, which seemed to haue a sporte to play with it, as the sea had to kisse his feet; himselfe full of admirable beautie, set foorth by the strangenes both of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> seate and gesture: for, holding his head vp full of vnmoued maiestie, he held a sworde aloft with his faire arme, which often he waued about his crowne as though he would threaten the world in that extremitie. But the fishermen, when they came so neere him, that it was time to throwe out a rope, by which hold they might draw him, their simplicity bred such amasement, and their amasement such superstition, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> (assuredly thinking it was some God begotten betweene <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> that had made all this terrible slaughter) as they went vnder sayle by him, held vp their hands and made their prayers. Which when <hi>Musidorus</hi> saw, though he were almost as much rauished with ioy, as they with astonishment, he lept to the Mariner, and tooke the corde out of his hande and (saying, doest thou liue, and arte well? who answered,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> thou canst tell best, since most of my well beyng standes in thee,) threwe it out, but alreadie the shippe was past beyond <hi>Pyrocles</hi>: and therefore <hi>Musidorus</hi> could do no more but perswade the Mariners to cast about againe, assuring them that hee was but a man, although of most diuine excellencies, and promising great rewardes for their paine.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>
            </p>
            <p>And now they were alreadie come vpon the staies; when one of the saylers discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Galley which came with sayles and oares directlie in the chase of them; and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12151:6"/>
streight perceaued it was a wel knowne Pirate, who hunted not only for goodes but for bodies of men, which he imployed eyther to be his Galley slaues, or to sell at the best market. Which when the Maister vnderstoode, he commaunded forthwith to set on al the canuasse they could, and flie homeward, leauing in that sort poore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <hi>Pyrocles</hi> so neere to be reskewed. But what did not <hi>Musidorus</hi> saye? what did hee not offer to perswade them to venture the fight? But feare sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding at the gates of their eares, put backe all perswasions: so that he had nothing wherewith to accompanie <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> but his eyes; nor to succour him, but his wishes. Therefore praying for him, and casting a long looke that way, he saw the Galley leaue the pursuite of them, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> turne to take vp the spoiles of the other wracke: and lastly he might well see them lift vp the yong man; and alas (saide hee to himselfe) deere <hi>Pyrocles</hi> shall that bodie of thine be enchained? shal those victorious ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of thine be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to base offices? shal vertue beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e a slaue to those that be slaues to viciousnes? Alas, better had it bene thou hadst ended nobly thy noble daies: what death is so euil as vnworthy seruitude? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> But that opinion soone ceased when he sawe the gallie setting vpon an other shippe, which held long and strong fight with her: for then he began a fresh to feare the life of his friende, and to wish well to the Pirates whome before he hated, least in their ruyne he might perish. But the fishermen made such speed into the hauen, that they absented his eyes from beholding the issue: where being entred, he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> neither them nor any other as then to put themselues into the sea: so that being as ful of sorrow for beyng vnable to doe any thing, as voide of counsel how to doe anything, besides, that sicknesse grew something vpon him, the honest shepheards <hi>Strephon</hi> and <hi>Claius</hi> (who being themselues true friends, did the more perfectly iudge the iustnesse of his sorrowe) aduise him, that he should mitigate somwhat of his woe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> since he had gotten an amendment in fortune, being come from assured persuasion of his death, to haue no cause to dispaire of his life: as one that had lamented the death of his sheepe, should after know they were but strayed, would receiue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure though readily he knew not where to finde them.</p>
            <p>Now sir (saide they) thus for our selues it is. We are in profession but shepheards, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and in this countrie of Laconia little better then straungers, and therefore neither in skill, nor abilitie of power greatly to stead you.

               </gap> they made his thoughts beare away somthing els be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sid his own sorow, which wrought so in him, that at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth he grew content to marke their speeches, then to maruell at such wit in shepheardes, after to like their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and lastly to vouchsafe conference: so that the third day after, in the time that the morning did strow roses and violets in the heauenly floore against the comming of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the Sun, the nightingales (striuing one with the other which coulde in most dainty variety recount their wrong caused sorow) made them put of their sleep, and rising from vnder a tree (which that night had bine their pauilion) they went on their ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which by and by welcomed <hi>Musidorus</hi> eyes (wearied with the wasted soile of Laconia) with delightfull prospects. There were hilles which garnished their proud <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> heights with stately trees: humble valleis, whose base estate seemed comforted with refreshing of siluer riuers: medowes, enameld with all sortes of eypleasing floures: thickets, which being lined with most pleasant shade, were witnessed so too by the cheerefull disposition of many wel-tuned birds: ech pasture stored with sheep fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with sober security, while the prety lambes with bleting oratory craued the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> dams comfort: here a shepheards boy piping, as though he should neuer be olde: there a yong shepherdesse knitting, and withall singing, and it seemed that her voice comforted her hands to worke, and her hands kept time to her voices musick. As for the houses of the country (for many houses came vnder their eye) they were all scattered, no two being one by th'other, and yet not so far off as that it barred mutuall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> succour: a shew, as it were, of an accompanable solitarines, &amp; of a ciuil wildnes. I pray you (said <hi>Musidorus,</hi> then first vnsealing his long silent lips) what countreyes be these we passe through, which are so diuers in shewe, the one wanting no store, th'other hauing no store but of want.</p>
            <p>The country (answered <hi>Claius</hi>) where you were cast a shore, and now are past <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> through, is Laconia, not so poore by the barrennes of the soyle (though in it selfe not passing fertill) as by a ciuill warre, which being these two yeares within the bowels of that estate, betweene the gentlemen and the peasants (by them named <hi>Helots</hi>) hath in this sorte as it were disfigured the face of nature, and made it so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hospitall as now you haue founde it: the townes neither of the one side nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> willingly opening their gates to strangers, nor strangers willingly entring for feare of being mistaken.</p>
            <p>But this countrie (where now you set your foot) is Arcadia: &amp; euen hard by is the house of <hi>Kalander</hi> whether we lead you: this country being thus decked with peace, &amp; (the child of peace) good husbandrie. These houses you see so scattered are of men,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> as we two are, that liue vpon the commoditie of their sheepe: and therefore in the diuision of the Arcadian estate are termed shepheards; a happie people, wanting litle
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12151:7"/>
because they desire not much. What cause then saide <hi>Musidorus,</hi> made you venter to leaue this sweet life, and put your selfe in yonder vnpleasant and dangerous realme? Guarded with pouertie (answered <hi>Strephon</hi>) and guided with loue: But now (said <hi>Claius</hi>) since it hath pleased you to aske any thing of vs whose basenes is such as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> very knowledge is darkenes: geue vs leaue to know somthing of you, and of the yong man you so much lament, that at least we may be the better instructed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <hi>Kalander,</hi> and he the better know how to proportion his entertainment. <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidorus</hi> (according to the agrement betwene <hi>Pyrocles</hi> &amp; him to alter their names) ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, that he called himselfe <hi>Palladius,</hi> and his friend <hi>Daiphantus</hi>; but till I haue him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> againe (saide he) I am in deed nothing: and therefore my storie is of nothing, his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement (since so good a man he is) cannot be so lowe as I account my estate: and in summe, the summe of all his curtesie may be to helpe me by some meanes to seeke my frend.</p>
            <p>They perceiued he was not willing to open himselfe further, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> further questioning brought him to the house: about which they might see (with fitte consideration both of the ayre, the prospect, &amp; the nature of the ground) all such necessarie additions to a greate house, as might well shewe, <hi>Kalander</hi> knewe that prouision is the foundation of hospitalitie, and thrift the fewel of magnificence. The house it selfe was built of faire and strong stone, not affecting so much any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> kinde of finenes, as an honorable representing of a firme statelines. The lightes, doores and staires, rather directed to the vse of the guest, then to the eye of the Artificer: and yet as the one cheefly heeded, so the other not neglected; eache place handsome without curiositie, and homely without lothsomnes: not so dainty as not to be trode on, nor yet slubbered vp with good felowshippe: all more lasting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> than beautifull, but that the consideration of the exceeding lastingnesse made the eye beleeue it was exceeding beautifull. The seruants not so many in number, as clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in apparel, &amp; seruiceable in behauiour, testifiing euen in their countenaunces, that their maister tooke aswell care to be serued, as of them that did serue. One of them was forth-with readie to wellcome the shepheards, as men, who though they were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> poore, their maister greatly fauoured: &amp; vnderstanding by them, that the young man with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was to be much accounted of, for that they had sene tokens of more than commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greatnes, hovv so euer novv eclipsed vvith fortune: He ranne to his maister vvho came presentlie foorth, and pleasantly vvelcomming the shepheardes but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially applying him to <hi>Musidorus, Strephon</hi> priuately tolde him all vvhat he knevv of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> him, and particularly that he found this stranger vvas loath to be knovven.</p>
            <p>Noe saide <hi>Kalander</hi> (speaking alowd) I am no herald to enquire of mens pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, it sufficeth me if I know their vertues: which (if this young mans face bee not a false witnes) doe better apparrell his minde, then you haue done his body. While he was thus speaking, there came a boy in shew like a Marchants prentice, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> taking <hi>Strephon</hi> by the sleeue, deliuered him a letter, written ioyntly both to him and <hi>Claius</hi> from <hi>Vrania</hi>: which they no sooner had read, but that with short leaue-tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Kalander</hi> (who quickly guest and smiled at the matter) &amp; once againe (though hastely) recommending the yong man vnto him, they went away, leauing <hi>Musidorus</hi> euen lothe to part with them, for the good conuersation he had of them, and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> he accounted himself tied in vnto them: and therfore, they deliuering his chest vnto him, he opened it, and would haue presented them with two very rich Iewels, but they absolutelie refused the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, telling him that they were more then enough rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:12151:8"/>
in the knowing of him, and without harkening vnto a replie (like men whose hartes disdained all desires but one) gate speedely away, as if the letter had brought wings to make them flie. But by that sight <hi>Kalander</hi> soone iudged that his guest was of no meane calling; and therefore the more respectfullie entertaining him, <hi>Musido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> found his sicknes (which the fight, the sea, and late trauell had layd vpon him)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> grow greatly: so that fearing some suddaine accident, hee deliuered the chest to <hi>Kalander</hi>; which was full of most precious stones, gorgeously and cunningly set in diuerse manners, desiring him hee would keep those trifles, and if he died, he would bestow so much of it as was needfull, to finde out and redeeme a yong man, naming himselfe <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> as then in the handes of Laconia pirates.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Kalander</hi> seeing him faint more and more, with carefull speede conueyed him to the most commodious lodging in his house: where beeing possest with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treeme burning feuer, he continued some while with no great hope of life: but youth at length got the victorie of sicknesse, so that in sixe weeks the excellencie of his retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned beautie was a credible embassadour of his health; to the great ioy of <hi>Kalander</hi>:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> who, as in this time he had by certaine friendes of his, that dwelt neare the Sea in Messenia, set foorth a shippe and a galley to seeke and succour <hi>Daiphantus</hi>: so at home did he omit nothing which hee thought might eyther profite or gratifie <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>But <hi>Palladius</hi> hauing gotten his health, and onely staying there to bee in place, vvhere he might heare answere of the shippes set foorth, <hi>Kalander</hi> one after noone led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> him abroad to a well arayed ground he had behind his house, which hee thought to shew him before his going, as the place himself more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any other delighted. the backside of the house was neither field, garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor orchard; or rather it was both field garden, and orchard: for as soone as the descending of the stayres had deliuered them downe, they came into a place cunningly set with trees of the moste tast-pleasing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> fruites: but scarcelie they had taken that into their consideration, but that they were suddainely stept into a delicate greene, of each side of the greene a thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and behinde the thickets againe newe beddes of flowers, which beeing vnder the trees, the trees were to them a Pauilion, and they to the trees a mosaicall floore: so that it seemed that arte therein would needes be delightfull by counterfaiting his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> enemie error, and making order in confusion.</p>
            <p>In the middest of all the place, was afaire ponde, whose shaking christall was a perfect mirrour to all the other beauties, so that it bare shewe of two gardens: one in deede, the other in shaddowes: and in one of the thickets was a fine foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine made thus. A naked <hi>Venus</hi> of white marble, wherein the grauer had vsed such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> cunning, that the naturall blewe veines of the marble were framed in fitte places, to set foorth the beautifull veines of her bodie. At her brest shee had her babe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12151:8"/>
               <hi>AEneas,</hi> who seemed (hauing begun to sucke) to leaue that, to looke vpon her fayre eyes, which smiled at the babes follie, meane while the breast runing. Hard by was a house of pleasure built for a Sommer retiring place, whether <hi>Kalander</hi> leading him, he found a square roome full of delightfull pictures, made by the moste excellent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> workeman of Greece. There was <hi>Diana</hi> when <hi>Acteon</hi> sawe her bathing, in whose cheekes the painter had set such a colour, as was mixt betweene shame and disdaine: and one of her foolish Nymphes, who weeping, and with all lowring, one might see the workman meant to set forth teares of anger. In another table was <hi>Atalanta</hi>; the posture of whose lims was so liuelie expressed, that if the eyes were the onely iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> as they be the onely seers, one would haue sworne the very picture had runne. Besides many mo, as of <hi>Helena, Omphale, Iole</hi>: but in none of them all beautie seemed to speake so much as in a large table, which contained a comely old man, with a lady of midle age, but of excellent beautie; and more excellent would haue bene deemed, but that there stood betwene them a yong maid, whose wonderfulnesse tooke away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> all beautie from her, but that which it might seeme shee gaue her backe againe by her very shadow. And such difference (being knowne that it did in deed counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit a person liuing) was there betweene her and all the other, though Goddesses, that it seemd the skill of the painter bestowed on the other new beautie, but that the beautie of her bestowed new skill of the painter. Though he thought inquisitiuenes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> an vncomely guest, he could not choose but aske who shee was, that bearing shewe of one being in deed, could with natural gifts go beyond the reach of inuention. <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> answered, that it was made by <hi>Philoclea,</hi> the yonger daughter of his prince, who also with his wife were contained in that Table: the painter meaning to represent the present condition of the young Ladie, vvho stood vvatched by an ouer-curious eye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> of her parents: and that he vvould also haue dravvne her eldest sister, esteemed her match for beautie, in her shepheardish attire; but that the rude clovvne her gardian vvould not suffer it: nether durst he aske leaue of the Prince for feare of suspition. <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius</hi> perceaued that the matter vvas vvrapt vp in some secresie, and therfore vvould for modestie demaund no further: but yet his countenance could not but vvith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> dumme Eloquence desire it: Which <hi>Kalander</hi> perceauing, vvell said he, my deere guest, I knovv your minde, and I vvill satisfie it: neither vvill I doo it like a niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ansvverer, going no further than the boundes of the question, but I vvill discouer vnto you, asvvell that vvherein my knovvledge is common vvith others, as that vvhich by extraordinarie meanes is deliuered vnto me: knovving so much in you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>(though not long acquainted) that I shal find your eares faithfull treasurers. So then sitting downe in tvvo chaires, and sometimes casting his eye to the picture, hee thus spake.</p>
            <p>This countrie Arcadia among all the prouinces of Greece, hath euer beene had in singular reputation: partly for the svveetnesse of the ayre, and other naturall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> but principally for the vvell tempered minds of the people, vvho (finding that the shining title of glorie so much affected by other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, doth in deed helpe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the happinesse of life) are the onely people, vvhich as by their Iustice and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence geue neither cause nor hope to their neighbours to annoy them, so are they not sturred vvith false praise to trouble others quiet, thinking it a small revvard for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> vvasting of their ovvne liuès in rauening, that their posteritie should long after saie, they had done so. Euen the Muses seeme to approue their good determination, by chosing this countrie for their cheife repairing place, and by bestovving their perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:12151:9"/>
so largely here, that the very shepheards haue their fancies lifted to so high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, as the learned of other nations are content both to borrow their names, and imitate their cunning.</p>
            <p>Here dwelleth, and raigneth this Prince (whose picture you see) by name <hi>Basilius,</hi> a Prince of sufficient skill to gouerne so quiet a countrie, where the good mindes of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the former princes had set downe good lawes, and the well bringing vp of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doth serue as a most sure bond to hold them. But to be plaine with you, he excels in nothing so much, as in the zealous loue of his people, wherein he doth not onely passe all his owne fore-goers, but as I thinke all the princes liuing. Wherof the cause is, that though he exceed not in the vertues which get admiration; as depth of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> height of courage and largenesse of magnificence, yet is he notable in those which stirre affection, as trueth of word, meekenesse, courtesie, mercifulnesse, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie.</p>
            <p>He being already well striken in yeares, maried a young princes, named <hi>Gynecia,</hi> daughter to the king of Cyprus, of notable beautie, as by her picture you see: a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> of great wit, and in truth of more princely vertues, then her husband: of most vnspotted chastitie, but of so working a minde, and so vehement spirits, as a man may say, it was happie shee tooke a good course: for otherwise it would haue beene terrible.</p>
            <p>Of these two are brought to the world two daughters, so beyond measure excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> in all the gifts allotted to reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>able creatures, that we may think they were borne to shewe, that Nature is no stepmother to that sex, howe much so euer some men (sharpe witted onely in euill speaking) haue sought to disgrace them. The elder is named <hi>Pamela</hi>; by many men not deemed inferiour to her sister: for my part, when I marked them both<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> me thought there was (if at least such perfections may receiue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> the worde of more) more sweetnesse in <hi>Philoclea,</hi> but more maiestie in <hi>Pamela</hi>: mee thought loue plaide in <hi>Philocleas</hi> eyes, and threatned in <hi>Pamelas</hi>: mee thought <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleas</hi> beautie onely perswaded, but so perswaded as all harts must yeelde: <hi>Pamelas</hi> beautie vsed violence, and such violence as no hart could resist: and it semes that such proportion is betweene their mindes; <hi>Philoclea</hi> so bashfull as though her excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> had stolne into her before shee was aware: so humble, that she will put all pride out of countenance: in summe, such proceeding as will stirre hope, but teach hope good manners. <hi>Pamela</hi> of high thoughts, who auoides not pride with not knowing her excellencies, but by making that one of her excellencies to bee voide of pride; her mothers wisdome, greatnesse, nobilitie, but (if I can ghesse aright) knit with a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> more constant temper. Now then; our <hi>Basilius</hi> being so publickly happie as to bee a Prince, and so happie in that happinesse as to be a beloued Prince, and so in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate blessed as to haue so excellent a wife, and so ouer excellent children, hath of late taken a course which yet makes him more spoken of then all these blessings. For, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made a iourney to Delphos, and safely returned, within short space he brake vp <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> his court, and retired himselfe, his wife, and children into a certaine Forrest hereby, which he calleth his desert, wherein (besides a house appointed for stables and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings for certaine persons of meane calling, who do all houshold seruices,) he hath builded two fine lodges. In the one of them him selfe remaines with his younger daughter <hi>Philoclea,</hi> which was the cause they three were matched together in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="54"/> picture, without hauing any other creature liuing in that lodge with him.</p>
            <p>Which though it bee straunge, yet not so straunge, as the course hee hath taken
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12151:9"/>
with the princesse <hi>Pamela,</hi> whom he hath placed in the other lodge: but how thinke you accompanied? truly with none other, but one <hi>Dametas,</hi> the most arrant doltish clowne, that I thinke euer was without the priuiledge of a bable, with his wife <hi>Miso,</hi> and daughter of <hi>Mopsa,</hi> in whom no witt can deuise anie thing wherein they may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> pleasure her, but to exercise her patience, and to serue for a foile of her perfections. This loutish clowne is such, that you neuer saw so ill fauourd a visar; his behauiour such, that he is beyond the degree of ridiculous; and for his apparrel, euen as I would wish him: <hi>Miso</hi> his wife, so handsome a beldame, that onely her face and her splay-foote haue made her accused for a witch; only one good point she hath, that she ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>

Betweene these two personages (who neuer agreed in any humor, but in disagreeing) is issued foorth mistresse <hi>Mopsa,</hi> a fitte woman to participate of both their perfections: but because a pleasant fellow of my acquaintance set foorth her praises in verse, I wil onely repeate them, and spare mine owne tongue, since she goes for a woman.

            <p>Now truely hauing made these descriptions vnto you, me thinks you should ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that I rather faine some pleasant deuise, then recount a truth, that a Prince (not banished from his owne wits) could possibly make so vnworthie a choise. But true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>(deare guest) so it is, that Princes (whose doings haue beene often soothed with good successe) thinke nothing so absurde, which they cannot make honourable. The beginning of his credite was by the Princes straying out of the way, one time hee hunted, where meeting this fellow, and asking him the way; and so falling into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther questions, he found some of his answeres (as a dog sure if he could speake, had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> wit enough to describe his kennell) not vnsensible, and all vttered with such rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which he interpreted plainnesse (though there be great difference betweene them) that <hi>Basilius</hi> conceauing a sodaine delight, tooke him to his Court, with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant shew of his good opinion: where the flattering courtier had no sooner taken the Princes minde, but that there were straight reasons to confirme the Princes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> and shadowes of vertues found for <hi>Dametas.</hi> His silence grew wit, his bluntnesse integritie, his beastly ignorance vertuous simplicitie: and the Prince (according to the nature of great persons, in loue with that he had done himselfe) fancied, that his
<pb facs="tcp:12151:10"/>
weaknesse with his presence would much be mended. And so like a creature of his owne making, hee liked him more and more, and thus hauing first giuen him the office of principall heardman, lastly, since he tooke this strange determination, hee hath in a manner put the life of himselfe and his children into his hands. Which au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie (like too great a sayle for so small a boate) doth so ouer-sway poore <hi>Dametas,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that if before he weare a good foole in a chamber, he might bee allowed it now in a comedie: So as I doubt mee (I feare me in deede) my master will in the end (with his cost) finde, that his office is not make men, but to vse men as men are; no more then a horse will be taught to hunt, or an asse to mannage. But in sooth I am afraid I haue geuen your eares too great a surfette, with the grosse discourses of that heauie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> peece of flesh. But the zealous greefe I conceue to see so great an error in my Lord, hath made me bestowe more words, then I confesse so base a subiect deserueth.</p>
            <p>Thus much now that I haue tolde you, is nothing more then in effect any Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian knows. But what moued him to this strange solitarines hath bin imparted (as I thinke) but to one person liuing. My selfe can coniecture and in deede more then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> coniecture, by this accident that I will tell you: I haue an onely sonne, by name <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophon,</hi> who is now absent, preparing for his owne mariage, which I meane shortly shalbe here celebrated. This sonne of mine (while the Prince kept his Court) was of his bed-chamber; now since the breaking vp thereof, returned home, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me (among other things he had gathered) the coppie which hee had taken of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> letter: which when the prince had read, he had laid in a windowe, presuming no body durst looke in his writings: but my sonne not only tooke a time to read it, but to copie it. In trueth I blamed <hi>Clitophon</hi> for the curiositie, which made him breake his dutie in such a kind, whereby kings secrets are subiect to be reuealed: but since it was done, I was content to take so much profite, as to know it. Now here is the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> that I euer since for my good liking, haue caried about me: which before I read vnto you, I must tell you from whom it came. It is a noble-man of this countrie, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Philanax,</hi> appointed by the Prince, Regent in this time of his retiring, and most worthy so to be: for, there liues no man, whose excellent witte more simplye im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braseth integritie, beesides his vnfained loue to his master, wherein neuer yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> any could make question, sauing whether he loued <hi>Basilius</hi> or the Prince better: a rare temper, while most men either seruile-ly yeeld to all appetites, or with an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate austeritie looking to that they fansie good, in effect neglect the Princes person. This then being the man, whome of all other (and most worthie) the Prince cheef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loues, it should seeme (for more then the letter I haue not to ghesse by) that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Prince vpon his returne from Delphos, (<hi>Philanax</hi> then lying sick) had written vnto him his determination, rising (as euidently appeares) vpon some Oracle hee had there receaued: whereunto he wrote this answere.</p>

so principall a charge of the Princesse <hi>Pamela,</hi> (whose minde goes beyond the gouerning of many thousands such) to such a person as <hi>Dametas</hi> is (besides that the thing in it selfe is strange) it comes of a very euil ground, that ignorance should be the mother of faithfulnes, O no; he cannot be good, that knowes not why he is good, but stands so farre good, as his fortune may keepe him vnassaied: but comming once to that, his rude simplicitie is either easily changed, or easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> &amp; so growes that to be the last excuse of his fault, which seemed to haue been the first foundation of his faith. Thus farre hath your commaundement and my zeale drawen me; which I, like a man in a valley that may discern hills, or like a poore passenger that may spie a rock, so humbly submit to your gratious consideration, beseeching you againe, to stand wholy vpon your owne vertue, as the surest way to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> maintaine you in that you are, and to auoid any euill which may be imagined.</p>

            <p>By the contents of this letter you may perceiue, that the cause of all, hath beene the vanitie which possesseth many, who (making a perpetuall mansio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n of this poore baiting place of mans life) are desirous to know the certaintie of things to come; wherein there is nothing so certaine as our continuall vncertaintie. But what in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> pointes the oracle was, in faith I know not: nether (as you may see by one place of <hi>Philanax</hi> letter) he him selfe distinctly knew. But this experience shewes vs, that <hi>Basilius</hi> iudgement, corrupted with a princes fortune, hath rather hard then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the wise (as I take it) councell of <hi>Philanax.</hi> For hauing left the sterne of his gouernment, with much amazement to the people, among whom many strange <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> bruits are receiued for currant, and with some apparance of danger in respect of the valiant <hi>Amphialus</hi> his nephew, &amp; much enuy in the ambitious number of the No<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bilitie against <hi>Philanax,</hi> to see <hi>Philanax</hi> so aduanced, though (to speake simply) he deserue more then as many of vs as there be in Arcadia: the prince him selfe hath hidden his head, in such sort as I tolde you, not sticking plainly to confesse, that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> meanes not (while he breathes) that his daughters shall haue any husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus solitary with him: weher he gius no other body leaue to visit him at anytime but a certaine priest, who being excellent in poetrie, he makes him write out such thinges as he best likes, he being no les delightfull in conuersation, then needfull for deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. &amp;, about twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty specified shepheards, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some (for exercises, &amp; some for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Eglogs) he taketh greater recreation.</p>
            <p>And now you know as much as my selfe: wherin if I haue held you ouer long, lay hardly the fault vpon my olde age, which in the very disposition of it is talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: whether it be (said he smiling) that nature loues to exercise that part most, which is least decayed, and that is our tongue: or, that knowledge being the onely thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> whereof we poore olde men can brag, we cannot make it knowen but by vtterance: or, that mankinde by all meanes seeking to eternize himselfe so much the more, as he is neere his end, dooth it not onely by the children that come of him, but by speaches and writings recommended to the memorie of hearers and readers. And yet thus much I will say for my selfe, that I haue not laid these matters, either so open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> or largely to any as your selfe: so much (if I much faile not) doo I see in you, which makes me both loue and trust you. Neuer may he be olde, answered <hi>Palladius,</hi> that doth not reuerence that age, whose heauines, if it waie doune the frayl and fleshly ballance, it as much lifts vp the noble and spirituall part: and well might you haue alledged another reason, that their wisedome makes them willing to profite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> others. And that haue I receiued of you, neuer to be forgotten, but with vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12151:11"/>
But among many strange conceits you told mee, which haue shewed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes in your Prince, truly euen the last, that he should conceiue such pleasure in shepheards discourses, would not seeme the least vnto me, sauing that you told me at the first, that this countrie is notable in those wits, &amp; that in deed my selfe hauing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> beene brought not onely to this place, but to my life, by <hi>Strephon</hi> and <hi>Claius,</hi> in their conference found wits as might better become such shepheardes as <hi>Homer</hi> speakes of, that be gouernors of peoples, then such senatours who hold their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in a sheepecoate: for them two (said <hi>Kalander</hi>) especially <hi>Claius,</hi> they are bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the rest by so much, as learning commonlie doth adde to nature: for, hauing neglected their wealth in respect of their knowledge, they haue not so much empay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the meaner, as they bettered the better. Which all notwithstanding, it is a sporte to heare howe they impute to loue, which hath indewed their thoughtes (saie they) with such a strength.</p>
            <p>But certainely, all the people of this countrie from high to lowe, is giuen to those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> sportes of the vvitte, so as you would vvonder to heare hovv soone euen children vvill begin to versifie. Once ordinary it is among the meanest sorte, to make Songes and Dialogues in meeter, either loue vvhetting their braine, or longe peace hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun it, example and emulation amending it. Not so much, but the Clowne <hi>Dame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> will stumble sometimes vpon some songes that might become a better braine: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> but no sorte of people so excellent in that kind as the pastors; for their liuing standing but vppon the looking to their beastes, they haue ease, the Nurse of Poetrie. Neither are our shepheards such, as (I heare) they be in other countries; but they are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie owners of the sheepe, to which either them selues looke, or their children giue dayly attendance. And then truly, it would delight you vnder some tree, or by some riuers side (when two or three of them meet together) to heare their rurall muse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> how pretily it will deliuer out, sometimes ioyes, sometimes lamentations, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times chalenginges one of the other, sometimes vnder hidden formes vttering such matters, as otherwise they durst not deale with. Then haue they most commonly one, who iudgeth the Price to the best doer, of which they are no lesse glad, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> great Princes are of triumphes: and his parte is to sette downe in writing all that is saide, saue that it may be, his pen with more leasure doth polish the rudnesse of an vnthought-on songe. Nowe the choise of all (as you may well thinke) either for goodnes of voice, or plesantnes of wit, the Prince hath: among whome also there are two or three strangers, whom inwarde melancholies hauing made weery of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> worldes eyes, haue come to spend their liues among the countrie people of <hi>Arcadia</hi>; &amp; their conuersation being wel approued, the Prince vouchsafeth them his presence, and not onely by looking on, but by great curtesie and liberalitie, animates the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes the more exquisitely to labour for his good liking. So that there is no cause to blame the Prince for sometimes hearing them; the blame-worthinesse is, that to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> heare them, he rather goes to solitarinesse, then makes them come to companie. Nether doe I accuse my maister for aduancing a countriman, as <hi>Dametas</hi> is, since God forbid, but where worthynesse is (as truely it is among diuers of that fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship) any outward lownesse should hinder the hiest raysing, but that he would needs make election of one, the basenesse of whose minde is such, that it sinckes a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> degrees lower, then the basest bodie coulde carrie the most base fortune: which although it might be answered for the prince, that it is rather a trust he hath in his simple plainnesse, then any great aduancement, being but chiefe heardman:
<pb facs="tcp:12151:12"/>
yet all honest hartes feele, that the trust of their Lord goes beyond al aduancement. But I am euer too long vppon him, when he crosseth the waye of my speache, and by the shadovve of yonder tovver, I see it is a fitter time, vvith our supper to pay the duties we owe to our stomacks, then to break the aire with my idle discourses: And more witte I might haue learned of <hi>Homer</hi> (whom euen now you mentioned) who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> neuer entertayned eyther guestes or hostes with long speaches, till the mouth of hunger be throughly stopped. So withall he rose, leading <hi>Palladius</hi> through the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deine againe to the parler, where they vsed to suppe; <hi>Palladius</hi> assuring him, that he had already been more fed to his liking, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he could be by the skillfullest trencher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Media.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>But being come to the supping place, one of <hi>Kala<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders</hi> seruants rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in his eare; at which (his colour chaunging) he retired himselfe into his chamber; commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his men diligently to waite vpon <hi>Palladius,</hi> and to excuse his absence with some necessary busines he had presently to dispatch. Which they accordingly did, for some fewe daies forcing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to let no change appeare, but though they framed their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> countenaunces neuer so cunningly, <hi>Palladius</hi> perceaued there was some ill-pleasing accident fallen out. Wherupon, being againe set alone at supper, he called to the Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and desired him to tell him the matter of his suddaine alteration: who after some trifling excuses, in the ende confessed vnto him, that his maister had receiued newes, that his sonne before the daie of his neere marriage, chaunst to bee at a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> battaile, which was to bee fought betweene the Gentlemenne of Lacedaemon and the <hi>Helots</hi>: who winning the victorie, he was there made prisoner, going to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a friend of his taken prisoner by the <hi>Helots</hi>; that the poore young Gentleman had offered great raunsome for his life: but that the hate those paysaunts conceaued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst all Gentlemen was such, that euerye houre hee was to looke for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> but some cruell death: which hether-vnto had onelye beene delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Captaines vehement dealing for him, who seemed to haue a hart of more manlie pittie then the rest. Which losse had stricken the old Gentleman with such sorrowe, as if abundance of teares did not seeme sufficiently to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it, hee was alone retyred, tearing his bearde and hayre, and cursing his olde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> age, that had not made his graue to stoppe his eares from such aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: but that his faithfull seruantes had written in his name to all his friendes followers, and tennants (<hi>Philanax</hi> the gonernour refusing to deale in it as a priuate cause, but yet geuing leaue to seeke their best redresse, so as they, wronged not the state of Lacedaemon) of whom there were nowe gathered vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> the frontiers good forces, that he was sure would spende their liues by any way, to redeeme or reuenge <hi>Clitophon.</hi> Now sir (saide hee) this is my maysters nature, though his grief be such, as to liue is a griefe vnto him, &amp; that euen his reason is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with sorrow; yet the lawes of hospitalitie (long and holily obserued by him) giue still such a sway to his proceeding, that he will no waie suffer the straunger lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> vnder his roofe, to receyue (as it were) any infection of his anguish, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally you, toward whom I know not whether his loue, or admiration bee greater. But <hi>Palladius</hi> could scarce heare out his tale with patience: so was his heart torne in peeces with compassion of the case, liking of <hi>Kalanders</hi> noble behauiour, kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for his respect to him-warde, and desire to finde some remedie, beesides the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> image of his deerest friend <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> whom he iudged to suffer eyther alike or a worse fortune. Therefore rising from the boorde, hee desired the stewarde to tell

him particularly, the ground and euent of this accident, because by knowledge of many circumstances, there might perhaps some waie of helpe be opened. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Steward easilie in this sorte condiscended.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> as hardly the nicest eye can finde a spot in, if the ouer-vehement constancie of yet spotles affection, may not in hard wrested constructions be counted a spot: which in this manner began that worke in him, which hath made both him, and it selfe in him, ouer all this countrie famous.

About two years since, it so fell out, that hee brought him to a great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies house, sister to my maister, who had with her, her onely daughter, the faire <hi>Parthenia</hi>; faire in deede (fame I thinke it selfe daring not to call any fairer, if it be not <hi>Helena</hi> queene of <hi>Corinth</hi> and the two incomparable sisters of <hi>Arcadia</hi>) and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> which made her fairenesse much the fairer, was, that it was but a faire embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour of a most faire minde, full of wit, and a wit which deliteth more to iudge it selfe, then to shew it selfe: herspeech being as rare as pretious; her silence without fullennesle; her modestie without affectation; her shamefastnes without igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: in summe, one, that to praise well, one must first set downe with himselfe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> what it is to be excellent: for so shee is.</p>
            <p>I thinke you thinke, that these perfections meeting, could not choose but find one another, and delight in that they found; for likenes of manners is likely in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

I meane not to mooue passions with telling you the greefe of both, when hee knew her, for at first he did not, nor at first knowledge could possibly haue vertues aide so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ready, as not euen weakly to lament the losse of such a iewell, so much the more, as that skilfull men in that arte assured it was vnrecouerable: but within a while, trueth of loue (which still held the first face in his memorie) a vertuous constancie, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a delight to be constant, faith giuen, and inward worthines shining through the foulest mistes, tooke so full holde of the noble <hi>Argalus,</hi> that not onely in such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> which witty arguments may bestow vpon aduersitie, but euen with the most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant kindnesse that an eye rauished louer can expresse, hee lauboured but to driue the extremitie of sorow from her, &amp; to hasten the celebration of their mariage: wherunto he vnfainedly shewed himselfe no lesse cherefully earnest, then if she had neuer beene disinherited of that goodly portion, which nature had so liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> vnto her: and for that cause deferred his intended reuenge vpon <hi>Demago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> because he might continually be in her presence; shewing moe humble seruice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenes, and ioy to content her, then euer before.</p>

            <p>Truely Sir, a very good Orator might haue a fayre fielde to vse eloquence in, if he did but onely repeate the lamentable, &amp; truely affectionated speeches, while he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> coniured her by remembrance of her affection, &amp; true oathes of his owne affection, not to make him so vnhappie, as to thinke hee had not onely lost her face, but her hart; that her face, when it was fayrest, had beene but as a marshal, to lodge the loue of her in his minde; which now was so well placed, as it needed no further help of any outward harbinger: beseeching her, euen with teares, to knowe, that his loue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> was not so superficial, as to go no further then the skin; which yet now to him was most faire, since it was hers: how could hee bee so vngratefull, as to loue her the lesse for that which she had onely receiued for his sake? that he neuer beheld it, but therein he saw the louelines of her loue towarde him: protesting vnto her, that hee would neuer take ioy of his life, if he might not enioy her, for whom principally he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> was glad he had life. But (as I heard by one that ouerheard them) shee (wringing him by the hand) made no other answere but this: my Lord (said she) God knowes I loue you: if I were Princesse of the whole world, and had withal, all the blessings that euer the world brought forth, I should not make delay, to lay my selfe, and them vnder your feete: or if I had continued but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But first let me bee much more miserable then I am, ere I match <hi>Argalus</hi> to such a <hi>Parthenia</hi>: Liue happy, deare <hi>Argalus,</hi> I geue you ful liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and I beseech you take it; and I assure you I shall reioyce (whatsoeuer become of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> me) to see you so coupled, as may be fitte, both for your honor, &amp; satisfaction.

And with those wordes, comfort seemed to lighten in his eyes, and that in his face and gesture was painted victorie.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> And he was answered by a man well acquainted with the affaires of Laconia, that they were a kinde of people, who hauing beene of olde, freemen and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:15"/>
the Lacedaemonians had conquered them, and layd, not onely tribute, but bondage vpon them: which they had long borne: till of late the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> through greedinesse growing more heauie then they could beare, and through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt lesse carefull howe to make them beare, they had with a generall consent (rather springing by the generalnes of the cause, then of any artificiall practise) set <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> themselues in armes, and whetting their courage with reuenge, and grounding their resolution vpon despaire, they had proceeded with vnlooked-for succes: hauing alredy taken diuers Towns &amp; Castels, with the slaughter of many of the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; for whom no sex nor age could be accepted for an excuse. And that although at the first they had fought rather with beastly furie, then any souldierly discipline,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> practise had now made them comparable to the best of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> and more of late then euer; by reason, first of <hi>Demagoras</hi> a great Lorde, who had made him selfe of their partie, and since his death, of an other Captaine they had gotten, who had brought vp their ignorance, and brought downe their furie, to such a meane of good gouernment, and withall led them so valourouslie, that (besides the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> time wherein <hi>Clitophon</hi> was taken) they had the better in some other great conflicts: in such wise, that the estate of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> had sent vnto them, offering peace with most reasonable and honorable conditions. <hi>Palladius</hi> hauing gotten this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge of the partie against whom, as he had already of the partie for whom hee was to fight, he went to <hi>Kalander,</hi> and tolde him plainlie, that by playne force <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> there was small apparaunce of helping <hi>Clitophon</hi>: but some deuice was to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hande, wherein no lesse discretion then valour was to bee vsed.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, the counsel of the cheefe men was called, and at last, this way <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius</hi> (who by some experience, but especiallie by reading Histories, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with stratagemes) inuented, and was by all the rest approoued: that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> all the men there shoulde dresse themselues like the poorest sorte of the people in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> hauing no banners, but bloudie shirtes hanged vpon long staues, with some bad bagge pipes in stead of drumme and fife, their armour they shoulde aswell as might bee, couer, or at least make them looke so rustilie, and ill-fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly as might wel become such wearers; and this the whole number shoulde doo,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> sauing two hundred of the best chosen Gentlemen, for courage and strength, whereof <hi>Palladius</hi> him selfe would be one, who should haue their armes chayned, and be put in cartes like prisoners. This being performed according to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they marched on towardes the towne of <hi>Cardamila</hi> where <hi>Clitophon</hi> was cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue; and beeing come two houres beefore Sunne-set within viewe of the walles,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> the <hi>Helots</hi> alreadie descrying their number, and beginning to sound the Alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, they sent a cunning fellow, (so much the cunninger as that hee could maske it vnder rudenes) who with such a kinde of Rhetorike, as weeded out all flowers of Rhetorike, deliuered vnto the <hi>Helots</hi> assembled together, that they were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie people of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> no lesse oppressed by their Lords, and no lesse desirous of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> then they, and therfore had put themselues in the field, &amp; had alreadie (besides a great number slain) taken nine or ten skore Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prisoners who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had there well and fast chained.

So opened they the gates, and receiued in the carts; which being done, and <hi>Palladius</hi> seeing fit time, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> hee gaue the signe, and shaking of their chaynes, (which were made with such arte, that though they seemed most stronge and fast, hee that ware them might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loose them) drew their swordes hidden in the cartes, and so setting vpon the warde, made them to flie eyther from the place, or from their bodies, and so gaue entrie to all the force of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> before the <hi>Helots</hi> could make any head to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> them.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Helots</hi> being men hardened against daungers, gathered (as well as they coulde) together in the market place, and thence woulde haue giuen a shrewd welcome to the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> but that <hi>Palladius</hi> (blaming those that were slowe, hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them that were forward, but especially with his owne ensample leading them) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> made such an impression into the squadron of the <hi>Helots,</hi> that at first the great bodie of them beginning to shake, and stagger; at length, euerie particular bodie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended the protection of his life to his feete, Then <hi>Kalander</hi> cried to goe to the prison, where he thought his sonne was, but <hi>Palladius</hi> wisht him (first scouring the streates) to house all the <hi>Helots,</hi> and make themselues maisters of the gates,</p>

               <hi>Arcadians,</hi> he made them turne face, and with banners displayed, his Trumpet gaue the lowdest testimonie he could of his returne, which once heard the rest of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi> which were otherwise scattered, bent thetherwarde, with a newe life of resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as if their Captaine had beene a roote, out of which (as into braunches) their courage had sprong.

fighting for their liuings, wiues &amp; children. There was victorie and courage against reuenge and dispaire: safety of both sides being no otherwise to bee gotten, but by destruction.</p>
            <p>At length, the left winge of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> began to loose ground; which <hi>Palladius</hi> seeing, he streight thrust himselfe with his choise bande against the throng that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> them, with such an ouerflowing of valour, that the Captaine of the <hi>Helots</hi> (whose eies soone iudged of that wherewith themselues were gouerned) sawe that he alone was worth al the rest of the <hi>Arcadians.</hi> Which he so wondred at, that it was hard to say, whether he more liked his doings, or misliked the effects of his doings: but determining that vpon that cast the game lay, and disdaining to fight with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> sought onely to ioine with him: which minde was no lesse in <hi>Palladius,</hi> hauing easily marked, that he was as the first mouer of all the other handes. And so their thoughts meeting in one point, they consented (though not agreed) to trie each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fortune: and so drawing themselues to be the vttermost of the one side, they began a combat, which was so much inferior to the battaile in noise and number, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> it was surpassing it in brauery of fighting, and (as it were) delightfull terriblenes. Their courage was guided with skill, and their skill was armed with courage; neither did their hardinesse darken their witte, nor their witte coole their hardines: both va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, as men despising death; both confident, as vnwonted to bee ouercome; yet doubtefull by their present feeling, and respectfull by what they had already seene.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Their feete stedy, their hands diligent, their eyes watchfull, and their harts resolute. The partes either not armed, or weakly armed, were well knowen, and according to the knowledge should haue bene sharpely visited, but that the aunswere was as quicke as the obiection.

            <p>But little needed it, for his chiefe enemie in steed of pursuing that aduauntage, kneeled downe, offering to deliuer the pommell of his sworde, in token of yeelding, with all speaking aloud vnto him, that he thought it more libertie to be his prisoner, then any others generall. <hi>Palladius</hi> standing vpon himselfe, and misdoubting some craft, and the <hi>Helots</hi> (that were next their captaine) wauering betweene looking for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> some stratageme, or fearing treason, What, saide the captaine, hath <hi>Palladius</hi> forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the voice of <hi>Daiphantus</hi>?</p>
            <p>By that watche worde <hi>Palladius</hi> knew that it was his onely friende <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> whom he had lost vpon the Sea, and therefore both most full of wonder, so to bee mett, if they had not bene fuller of ioye then wonder, caused the retraite to bee sounded,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 
               <hi>Daiphantus</hi> by authoritie and <hi>Palladius</hi> by persuasion; to which helped well the little aduantage that was of eyther side: and that of the <hi>Helots</hi> partie their Captaines beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour had made as many amazed as sawe or heard of it: and of the <hi>Arcadian</hi> side the good olde <hi>Kalander</hi> striuing more then his old age could atchiue, was newly taken prisoner. But in deede the chiefe parter of the fraye was the night, which with her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="54"/> blacke armes pulled their malicious sightes one from the other. But he that tooke <hi>Kalander,</hi> meant nothing lesse then to saue him, but onelie so long, as the Captaine
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:12151:16"/>
might learne the enemies secrets: towardes whom he led the old Gentleman, when hee caused the retreit to bee sounded: looking for no other deliuerie from that captiuitie, but by the painefull taking away of all paine: when whome should hee see nexte to the Captaine (with good tokens how valiantly hee had fought that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> daie against the <hi>Arcadians</hi>) but his sonne <hi>Clitophon</hi>? But now the Captaine had caused all the principall <hi>Helots</hi> to bee assembled, as well to deliberate what they had to do, as to receiue a message from the <hi>Arcadians</hi>; Among whom <hi>Palladius</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue (besides the loue <hi>Kalander</hi> bare him) hauing gotten principall authoritie, hee had persuaded them to seeke rather by parley to recouer the Father and the Sonne, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> by the sworde: since the goodnes of the Captaine assured him that way to speede, and his value (wherewith hee was of old acquainted) made him thinke any other way dangerous. This therefore was donne in orderly manner, giuing them to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that as they came but to deliuer <hi>Clitophon,</hi> so offering to leaue the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they already had in the towne, to goe away without any further hurte, so as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> they might haue the father, and the sonne without raunsome deliuered. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions beyng heard and conceaued by the <hi>Helots, Daiphantus</hi> perswaded them without delay to accept them. For first (sayd he) since the strife is within our owne home, if you loose, you loose all that in this life can bee deare vnto you: if you winne, it will be a blouddy victorie with no profite, but the flattering in our selues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> that same badde humour of reuenge. Besides, it is like to stirre <hi>Arcadia</hi> vppon vs, which nowe, by vsing these persons wel, maie bee brought to some amitie. Lastly but especially, least the king and nobility of <hi>Laconia</hi> (with whom now wee haue made a perfect peace) should hope by occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this quarrell to ioyne the <hi>Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> with them, and so breake of the profitable agreement alreadie concluded. In <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> summe, as in all deliberations (waying the profit of the good successe with the harme of the euill successe) you shall finde this way most safe and honorable.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Helots</hi> asmuch moued by his authoritie, as perswaded by his reasons, were content therewith. Whereupon, <hi>Palladius</hi> tooke order that the <hi>Arcadians</hi> shoulde presently march out of the towne, taking with them their prisoners, while the night <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> with mutuall diffidence might keepe them quiet, and ere day came they might be well on of their way, and so auoid those accidents which in late enemies, a looke, a word, or a particular mans quarell might engender. This being on both sides concluded on, <hi>Kalander</hi> and <hi>Clitophon,</hi> who now (with infinite ioy did knowe each other) came to kisse the hands and feete of <hi>Daiphantus: Clitophon</hi> telling his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> how <hi>Daiphantus</hi> (not without danger to himselfe) had preserued him from the furious malice of the <hi>Helots</hi>: and euen that day going to conclude the peace (least in his absence he might receiue some hurt) he had taken him in his companie, and geuen him armour, vpon promise he should take the parte of the <hi>Helots</hi>; which he had in his fight perfourmed, little knowing that it was against his father: but (saide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
               <hi>Clitophon</hi>) here is he, who (as a father) hath new-begotten me, and (as a God) hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me from many deathes, which already laid hold on me: which <hi>Kalander</hi> with teares of ioy acknowledged (besides his owne deliuerance) onely his benefite. But <hi>Daiphanius,</hi> who loued doing well for it selfe, and not for thanks, brake of those ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, desiring to know how <hi>Palladius</hi> (for so he called <hi>Musidorus</hi>) was come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> that companie, and what his present estate was whereof receiuing a brief decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Kalander,</hi> he sent him word by <hi>Clitophon,</hi> that he should not as now come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, because he held himselfe not so sure a master of the <hi>Helots</hi> mindes, that hee
<pb facs="tcp:12151:17"/>
would aduenture him in their power, who was so welknowen with an vnfriendly acquaintce, but that he desired him to returne with <hi>Kalander,</hi> whether also he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fewe dayes (hauing dispatched himselfe of the <hi>Helots</hi>) would repaire. <hi>Kalander</hi> would needes kisse his hand againe for that promise, protesting he would esteeme his house more blessed then a temple of the gods, if it had once receiued him. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> then desiring pardon for <hi>Argalus. Daiphantus</hi> assured them that hee would dye but hee would bring him, (though till then kept in close prison, indeede for his safetie, the <hi>Helots</hi> being so animated against him as els he could not haue liued) and so taking their leaue of him, <hi>Kalander, Clitophon, Palladius</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> swearing that they would no further in any sorte molest the <hi>Helots,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> they straight way marched out of the towne, carying both their dead and wounded bodies with them; and by morning were already within the limits of <hi>Arcadia.</hi>

We are first (said he) to thank the Gods, that (fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then wee had either cause to hope; or reason to imagine) haue deliuered vs out of this gulfe of daunger, wherein we were alredie swallowed. For all being lost, (had they not directed, my return so iust as they did) it had beene too late to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that, which being had, we could not keepe. And had I not happened to know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> one of the principal men among them, by which meanes the truce beganne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs, you may easily conceiue, what little reason we haue to think, but that either by some supplie out of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> or from the Nobilitie of this Country (who would haue made fruits of wisdom grow out of this occasion) we should haue had our power turned to ruine, our pride to repentance and sorrow. But now the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> storme, as it fell, so it ceased: and the error committed, in retaining <hi>Clitophon</hi> more hardly then his age or quarrell deserued, becomes a sharply learned experience, to vse in other times more moderation.</p>
            <p>Now haue I to deliuer vnto you the conclusion between the kings with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> and you; which is in all points as your selues desired: aswell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> for that you would haue graunted, as for the assurance of what is graunted. The Townes and Fortes you presently haue, are still left vnto you, to be kept either with or without garrison, so as you alter not the lawes of the Countrie, and pay such dueties as the rest of the <hi>Laconians</hi> doo: Your selues are made by publique decree, freemen, and so capable both to giue and receiue voice in election of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Magistrates.

            </p>
            <p>Which conditions you see, cary in themselues no more contentation then assu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rance. For this is not a peace which is made with them, but this is a peace by which you are made of them.

               </gap> so that you are to take mindes of peace, since the cause of war is finished; and as you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> them before like oppressours, so now to loue them as brothers; to take care of their estate because it is yours, and to labour by vertuous doing, that the posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

may not repent your ioyning. But now one Article onely they stoode vpon, which in the end I with your commissioners haue agreed vnto, that I shoulde no more tarry heere, mistaking perchance my humor, and thinking me as seditious as I am young, or els it is the king <hi>Amiclas</hi> procuring, in respect that it was my ill hap <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to kill his nephew <hi>Eurileon</hi>; but how so euer it be; I haue condiscended. But so will not we cried almost the whole assemblie, councelling one an other, rather to try the vttermost euent, then to loose him by whom they had beene victorious. But he as well with generall orations, as particular dealing with the men of most credit, made them throughly see how necessary it was to preferre such an opportunity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> before a vaine affection; but yet could not preuaile, till openly he sware, that he would (if at any time the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> brake this treatie) come back againe, and be their captaine.</p>
            <p>So then after a few daies, setting them in perfect order, he tooke his leaue of them, whose eyes bad him farwell with teares, and mouthes with kissing the places <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> where he stept, and after making temples vnto him as to a demi-God: thinking it beyond the degree of humanitie to haue a witt so farre ouergoing his age, and such dreadfull terror proceed from so excellent beautie. But he for his sake obtained free pardon for <hi>Argalus,</hi> whom also (vpon oath neuer to beare armes against the <hi>Helots</hi>) he deliuered: and taking onely with him certaine principall Iewells of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> his owne, he would haue parted alone with <hi>Argalus,</hi> (whose countenance well shewed, while <hi>Parthenia</hi> was lost he counted not himselfe deliuered) but that the whole multitude would needs gard him into <hi>Arcadia.</hi> Where again leauing them all to lament his departure, he by enquirie gotte to the well-knowne house of <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>: There was he receiued with louing ioye of <hi>Kalander,</hi> with ioyefull loue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> of <hi>Palladius,</hi> with humble (though dolefull) demeanor of <hi>Argalus</hi> (whom specially both he and <hi>Palladius</hi> regarded) with gratefull seruisablenes of <hi>Clitophon,</hi> and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable admiration of all.

But assoon as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> she was brought into the house, before she would rest her, she desired to speak with <hi>Argalus</hi> publickly, who she heard was in the house. <hi>Argalus</hi> came hastilie, and as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilie thought as <hi>Kalander</hi> had done, with sodaine chaunges of ioye into sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. But she when she had staide their thoughts with telling them her name, and qualitie in this sorte spake vnto him. My Lord <hi>Argalus,</hi> sayd she, being of late left <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in the Court of Queene <hi>Helen</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as chiefe in her absence (she being vpon some occasion gone thence) there came vnto me the Lady <hi>Parthenia.</hi> so disfigured, as I think Greece hath nothing so ougly to behold.

But no outwarde cherishing could salue the inwarde sore of her minde, but a few dayes since she died: before her death earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and perswading me, to thinke of no husbande but of you; as of the onely man in the worlde worthie to be loued, with-al she gaue me this Ring to deliuer you; desiring you, &amp; by the authoritie of loue commanding you, that the affection you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> bare her you should turne to me: assuring you, that nothing can please her soule more, then to see you and me matched together. Nowe my L. though this office be not (perchance) sutable to my estate nor sex, who should rather looke to be desired; yet, an extraordinarie desert requires an extraordinarie proceeding: and therefore I am come (with faithfull loue built vppon your worthines) to offer my selfe and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> beseech you to accept the offer: &amp; if these noble gentlemen present will say it is great folly, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> withall, say it is great loue.

            <p>Madame (said he) infinitly am I bound vnto you, for this, no more rare then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> noble courtesie; but most bound for the goodnes I perceiue you shewed to the lady <hi>Parthenia,</hi> (with that the teares ranne downe his eyes; but he followed on) and as much as so vnfortunate a man, fitte to be the spectacle of miserie, can doo you seruice; determine you haue made a purchase of a slaue (while I liue) neuer to faile you. But this great matter you propose vnto me, wherin I am not so blinde as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> not to se what happines it should be vnto me; Excellent Ladie, know, that if my hart were mine to giue, you before all other, should haue it; but <hi>Parthenias</hi> it is though dead: there I began, there I end all matter of affection: I hope I shall not longe tarry after her, with whose beautie if I had onely beene in loue, I should be so with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> you, who haue the same beautie: but it was <hi>Parthenias</hi> selfe Lloued, and loue; which no likenes can make one; no commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t dissolue, no foulnes defile, nor no death finish.

            <p>He had scarce spoken those words, when shee ranne to him, and imbracing him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Why then <hi>Argalus</hi> (said she) take thy <hi>Parthenia</hi>; and <hi>Parthenia</hi> it was in deede. But because sorow forbad him too soon to beleeue, she told him the trueth, with all circumstances; how being parted alone, meaning to die in some solitarie place, as she hapned to make her complaint, the Queene <hi>Helen</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> (who likewise felt her part of miseries) being then walking also alone in that lonely place, hearde her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and neuer lefte, till she had knowen the whole discourse. Which the noble Queene greatly pitying, she sent her to a Phisition of hers the most excellent man in the world, in hope he could helpe her: which in such sort as they saw he had perfourmed, and shee taking with her of the Queenes seruants, thought yet to make this triall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> whether he would quickly forget his true <hi>Parthenia,</hi> or no. Her speach was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Gentlemen, who before had kept her councell, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galus</hi> easily perswaded to what more then ten thousand yeares of life he desired: and <hi>Kalander</hi> would needes haue the mariage celebrated in his house, principallie the longer to holde his deare guestes, towardes whom he was now (besides his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> owne habite of hospitallitie) carried with loue and dutie: &amp; therefore omitted no seruice that his wit could inuent, and his power minister.</p>
            <p>But no way he sawe he could so much pleasure them as by leauing the two friends alone, who being shruncke aside to the banqueting house where the pictures were; there <hi>Palladius</hi> recounted vnto him, that after they had btahba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ed the burni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ship (&amp; either of them taken some thing vnder him the better to support him to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> shore) he knew not how, but either with ouer-labouring in the fight and soddaine colde, or the to much receiuing of salt water, he was past him selfe: but yet holding fast (as the nature of dying men is to do) the chest that was vnder him, he was cast on the sandes, where he was taken vp by a couple of shepeheards, and by them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> brought to life againe, and kept from drowning himselfe, when he despaired of his safetie. How after hauing failed to take him into the fisher boate, he had by the shepherds perswasion come to this Gentlemans house; where being daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouslie sicke, he had yeelded to seeke the recouerie of health, onely for that he might the sooner goe seeke the deliuerie of <hi>Pyrocles</hi>: to which purpose <hi>Kalander</hi> by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> some friends of his in <hi>Messena,</hi> had alreadie set a ship or two abroad, when this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident of <hi>Clitophons</hi> taking had so blessedly procured their meeting. Then did he setfoorth vnto him the noble intertainment and carefull cherishing of <hi>Kalander</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, &amp; so vpon occasion of the pictures present deliuered with the franknes of a friendes tongue, as neere as he could, word by word what <hi>Kalander</hi> had told him touching the strange storie (with all the particularities belonging) of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> which did in many sortes so delight <hi>Pyrocles</hi> to heare; that he would needes haue much of it againe repeated, and was not contented till <hi>Kalander</hi> himselfe had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him diuers questions.</p>
            <p>But first at <hi>Musidorus</hi> request, though in briefe manner, his mind much runn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> vpon the strange storie of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> he did declare by what course of aduentures he was com to make vp their mutuall happines in meeting. When (cosin said he) we had stript our selues, and were both leapt into the Sea, and swom a litle toward the

There I found my sworde among some of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> shrowds, wishing (I must confesse) if I died to bee found with that in my hande, and withall wauing it about my head, that saylers by might haue the better glimpse of me. There you missing mee, I was taken vp by Pyrates, who putting me vnder boorde prisoner, presentlie sett vppon another shippe, and maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a long fight, in the ende, put them all to the sworde. Amongst whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> I might heare them greatlie prayse one younge man, who fought most valiantlie, whom (as loue is carefull, and misfortune subiect to doubtfulnes) I thought certainely to bee you. And so holding you as dead, from that time till the time I sawe you, it trueth I sought nothing more then a noble ende, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce made me more hardie then otherwise I would haue beene. Tryall whereof <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> came within two dayes after: for the Kinges of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> hauing sett out some Galleys, vnder the charge of one of their Nephewes to skowre the Sea of the Pyrates, they met with vs, where our Captaine wanting men, was driuen to arme some of his prisoners, with promise of libertie for well fighting: among whom I was one, and beeing boorded by the Admirall, it was my fortune to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> kill <hi>Euryleon</hi> the Kinges nephew: but in the end they preuailed, &amp; we were all taken prisoners: I not caring much what became of me (onely keeping the name of <hi>Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantus,</hi> according to the resolution you know is betweene vs,) but beyng laide in the iayle of <hi>Tenarïa,</hi> with speciall hate to me for the death of <hi>Euryleon,</hi> the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sorte of that towne conspired with the <hi>Helots,</hi> and so by night opened them the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> gates; where entring and killing all of the gentle and riche faction, for honestie sake brake open all prisons, and so deliuered me; and I mooued with gratefulnesse, and encouraged with carelesnesse of life so behaued my selfe in some conflictes they had with in few dayes, that they barbarouslie thinking vnsensible wonders of mee, and with all so much the better trusting mee, as they heard I was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> hated of the Kinge of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> their chiefe Captayne beyng slaine as you knowe by the noble <hi>Argalus,</hi> who helped thereunto by his perswasion) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing borne a great affection vnto mee, and to auoyde the daungerous emulation whiche grewe among the chiefe, who shoulde haue the place, and also affected, as rather to haue a straunger then a competitour, they elected mee, (God worte <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> little prowde of that dignitie;) restoring vnto mee such thinges of mine as beeing taken first by the Pyrates, and they by the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> they had gotten in the sacke of the towne. Now being in it, so good was my successe with manie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, that I made a peace for them to their owne liking? the verie daye that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> you deliuered <hi>Clitophon,</hi> whom I with much a doo had preserued. And in my peace the Kinge <hi>Amiclas</hi> of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> would needes haue mee bannished, and depriued of the dignitie whereunto I was exalted: which (and you may see howe much you are bounde to mee) for your sake I was content to suffer, a newe hope rising in mee, that you were not dead: and so meaning to trauaile <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> ouer the worlde to seeke you; and now heere (my deere <hi>Musidorus</hi>) you haue mee. And with that (embracing and kissinge eche other) they called <hi>Kalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>

            <p>But such a chaunge was growen in <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> that (as if cheerefulnesse had bene tediousnesse, &amp; good entertainement were turnd to discourtesie) he would euer get himself alone, though almost whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was in company, he was alone, so little attentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he gaue to any that spake vnto him: euen the colour &amp; figure of his face began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> some alteration; which hee shewed little to heede: but euerie morning earlie going abroad, either to the garden, or to some woods towards the desert, it seemed his onely comfort was to be without a comforter.

            <p>A minde well trained and long exercised in vertue (my sweete and worthy cosin) doth not easily chaunge any course it once vndertakes, but vpon well grounded and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> well wayed causes. For being witnes to it selfe of his owne inward good, it findes nothing without it of so high a price, for which it should bee altered. Euen the very countenaunce and behauiour of such a man doth shewe foorth Images of the same constancie, by maintaining a right harmonie betwixt it and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good, in yeelding it selfe sutable to the vertuous resolution of the minde. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> This speech I direct to you (noble friende <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) the excellencie of whose minde and well chosen course in vertue, if I doo not sufficiently know, hauing
<pb facs="tcp:12151:20"/>
seene such rare demonstrations of it, it is my weakenes, and not your vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynes, But as in deede I know it, and knowing it most dearely loue both it, and him that hath it; so must I needes saye, that since our late comming into this countrie, I haue marked in you, I will not saye an alteration, but a relenting true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a slacking of the maine career, you had so notablye begon and almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and that in such sorte, as I cannot finde sufficient reason in my great loue toward you howe to allowe it; for (to leaue of other secreter argumentes which my acquaintaunce with you makes mee easilie finde) this in effect to any man may bee manifest, that whereas you weere wont in all places you came,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> to giue your selfe vehemently to the knowledge of those thinges which might better your minde; to seeke the familiaritye of excellent men in learning and souldiery: and lastly, to put all these thinges in practise both by continuall wise proceedinge, and worthie enterprises, as occasion fell for them; you now leaue all these thinges vndone: you let your minde fall a sleepe: beside your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> countenaunce troubled (which surely comes not of vertue; for vertue like the cleare heauen is without cloudes) and lastly you subiect your selfe to solitarines, the slye enimie, that doth most separate a man from well doinge. <hi>Pyrocles</hi> minde was all this while so fixed vpon another deuotion, that hee no more attentiuely marked his friendes discourse, then the childe that hath leaue to playe, markes the last parte <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> of his lesson; or the diligent Pilot in a daungerous tempest doth attende the vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wordes of a passinger: yet the very sound hauing imprinted the generall pointe of his speech in his hart, pierced with any mislike of so deerelie an esteemed friende, and desirous by degrees to bring him to a gentler consideration of him, with a shamefast looke (witnessing he rather could not helpe, then did not know his fault)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> answered him to this purpose. Excellent <hi>Musidorus,</hi> in the praise you gaue mee in the beginning of your speech, I easily acknowledge the force of your good will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, for neither coulde you haue thought so well of me, if extremitie of loue had not made your iudgement partiall, nor you could haue loued me so intirelie, if you had not beene apt to make so great (though vndeserued) iudgementes of me; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and euen so must I say to those imperfections, to which though I haue euer through weaknes beene subiect, yet you by the daily mending of your mind haue of late bin able to looke into them, which before you could not discerne; so that the chaunge you speake of, falles not out by my impairing, but by your bettering. And yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the leaue of your better iudgement, I must needes say thus much, my deere co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> that I finde not my selfe wholie to bee condemned, because I do not with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall vehemency follow those knowledges, which you call the bettering of my minde; for both the minde it selfe must (like other thinges) sometimes be vnbent, or else it will be either weakned, or broken: And these knowledges, as they are of good vse, so are they not all the minde may stretch it selfe vnto: who knowes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> I feede not my minde with higher thoughts? Truelie as I know not all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities, so yet I see the boundes of all these knowledges: but the workinges of the minde I finde much more infinite, then can bee led vnto by the eye, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined by any, that distract their thoughts without themselues.</p>
            <p>And in such contemplation, or as I thinke more excellent, I enioye my soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarines; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> and my solitarines perchaunce is the nurse of these contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Eagles wee see flye alone; and they are but sheepe, which alwayes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:12151:20"/>
waies heard together; condemne not therefore my minde sometime to enioy it selfe; nor blame not the taking of such times as serue most fitte for it. And alas, deere <hi>Musidorus,</hi> if I be sadde, who knowes better then you the iust causes I haue of sadnes? And here <hi>Pyrocles</hi> sodainly stopped, like a man vnsatisfied in himselfe, though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> his witte might well haue serued to haue satisfied another. And so looking with a countenaunce, as though hee desired hee shoulde know his minde without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him speake, and yet desirous to speake, to breath out some part of his inwarde euil, sending againe new blood to his face, hee continued his speach in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And Lord (dear cousin: said he) doth not the pleasauntnes of this place carry in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> it selfe sufficient reward for any time lost in it? Do you not see how all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire together to make this country a heauenly dwelling? Do you not see the grasse how in colour they excell the Emeralds, euerie one striuing to passe his fellow, and yet they are all kept of an equall height? And see you not the rest of these beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull flowers, each of which would require a mans wit to know, and his life to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Do not these stately trees seeme to maintaine their florishing olde age with the onely happines of their seat, being clothed with a continuall spring, because no beautie here should euer fade? Doth not the aire breath health, which the Birds (delightfull both to eare and eye) do dayly solemnize with the sweete consent of their voyces? Is not euery <hi>Eccho</hi> thereof a perfect Musicke? &amp; these fresh and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full brookes how slowly they slide away, as loth to leaue the company of so many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> thinges vnited in perfection? and with how sweete a murmur they lament their forced departure? Certainely, certainely, cosin, it must needs be that som Goddesse enhabiteth this Region, who is the soule of this soyle: for neither is any lesse then a Goddesse, worthie to bee shrined in such a heape of pleasures: nor any lesse then a Goddesse coulde haue made it so perfect a plotte of the celestiall dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> And so ended with a deep sigh, rufully casting his eye vpon <hi>Musidorus</hi> as more desirous of pittie then pleading. But <hi>Musidorus</hi> had all this while helde his looke fixed vpon <hi>Pyrocles</hi> countenance; and with no lesse louing attention marked howe his wordes proceeded from him: but in both these he perceiued such strange diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, that they rather increased new doubtes, then gaue him ground to settle anie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> iudgement: for, besides his eyes sometimes euen great with teares, the oft changing of his colour, with a kinde of shaking vnstayednes ouer all his bodie, he might see in his countenance some great determination mixed with feare; and might perceiue in him store of thoughts, rather stirred then digested; his wordes interrupted continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with sighes (which serued as a burthen to each sentence) and the tenor of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> speech (though of his wonted phrase) not knit together to one constant end, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dissolued in it selfe, as the vehemencie of the inwarde passion preuayled: which made <hi>Musidorus</hi> frame his aunswere neerest to that humor, which should soonest put out the secret. For hauing in the beginning of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> speech which defended his solitarines, framed in his minde a replie against it, in the praise of honourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> in shewing that such a kind of contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is but a glorious title to idlenes; that in action a man did not onely better himselfe but benefit others; that the gods would not haue deliuered a soule into the bodie, which hath armes and legges, onely instrumentes of doeing, but that it were intended the minde shoulde imploy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> them, and that the minde should best knowe his owne good or euill, by practise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which knowledge was the onely way to increase the one, and correct the other: besides many other argumentes, which the plentifulnesse of the matter yeelded to the sharpnes of his wit. When hee found <hi>Pyrocles</hi> leaue that, and fall into such an affected praising of the place, he left it likewise, and ioyned with him therein: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee found him in that humor vtter more store of passion; and euen thus kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> embrasing him, he said: Your words are such (noble cousin) so sweetly and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled in the praise of solitarinesse, as they would make mee likewise yeeld my selfe vp into it, but that the same words make me know, it is more pleasant to enioy the companie of him that can speake such wordes, then by such wordes to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to follow solitarines. And euen so doo I geue you leaue (sweete <hi>Pyrocles</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> euer to defende solitarines, so long as to defende it, you euer keep companie. But I maruell at the excessiue praises you giue to this countrie; in truth it is not vnple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant: but yet if you would returne into <hi>Macedon</hi> you should either se many heauens or find this no more then earthlie. And euen <hi>Tempe</hi> in my <hi>Thessalia</hi> (where you and I to my great happynesse were brought vp together) is nothing inferiour vnto it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> But I thinke you will make me see, that the vigor of your witte can shew it selfe in any subiect: or els you feede sometimes your solitarines with the conceites of the Poets, whose liberall pennes can as easilie trauaile ouer mountaines, as molehils: and so like well disposed men, set vp euery thing to the highest note; especially, when they put such wordes in the mouths of one of these fantasticall mind-infected peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> that children &amp; Musitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s cal Louers.

And alas, saide he, deare cosin, what if I bee not so much the Poet (the freedome of whose penne canne exercise it selfe in any thing) as euen that mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable subiect of his conning, whereof you speake?

But as he was speaking more, <hi>Kalander</hi> came, and brake of their discourse, with inuiting them to the hunting of a goodly stagge, which being harbored in a wood thereby, he hoped vvould make them good sporte, and driue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> avvay some parte of <hi>Daiphantus</hi> melancholy.

Then spared he not to remember how much <hi>Arcadia</hi> was chaunged since his youth: actiuitie and good fellowship being nothing in the price, it was then held in, but according to the nature of the old growing world, stil worse and worse. Then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> would he tell them stories of such gallaunts as he had knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and so with pleasant company beguiled the times hast, and shortned the wayes length, till they came to the side of the wood, where the hounds were in couples staying their comming, but with a whining Accent crauing libertie: many of them in colour and markes so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling, that it showed they were of one kinde. The huntsmen handsomely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in their greene liueries, as though they were children of Sommer, with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> staues in their handes to beat the guiltlesse earth, when the houndes were at a fault, and with hornes about their neckes to sounde an alarum vpon a sillie fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. The houndes were straight vncoupled, and erelong the Stagge thought it better to trust to the nimblenes of his feete, then to the slender fortification of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> lodging: but euen his feete, betrayed him; for howsoeuer they went, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vttered themselues to the sent of their enimies; who one taking it of an other, and sometimes beleeuing the windes aduertisements, sometimes the viewe of (their faithfull councellors) the huntsmen, with open mouthes then denounced warre, when the warre was alreadie begun. Their crie beeing composed of so well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> sorted mouthes, that any man would perceiue therein some kinde of proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the skilfull woodmen did finde a musicke. Then delight and varietie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion drew the horsmen sundrie wayes; yet cheering their houndes with voyce &amp; horne, kept still (as it were) together. The wood seemed to conspire with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his own citizens, dispersing their noise through all his quarters, and euen the Nimph <hi>Echo</hi> left to bewayle the losse of <hi>Narcissus,</hi> and became a hunter. But the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Stagge was in the end so hotly pursued, that (leauing his flight) hee was driuen to make courage of dispaire; and so turning his head, made the hounds (with change of speech) to testifie that he was at a bay: as if from hotte pursuite of their enemie, they were sodainly come to a parley.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> But <hi>Kalander</hi> (by his skill of coasting the Countrey) was among the first that came in to the besieged Deere; whom when some of the younger sorte would haue kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with their swordes, he woulde not suffer: but with a Crossebowe sent a death to the poore beast, who with teares shewed the vnkindnes he tooke of mans crueltie.</p>

            <p>My onely friend, violence of loue leades me into such a course, whereof your knowledge may much more vexe you, then helpe me. Therefore pardon my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing it from you, since: if I wrong you, it is in the respect I beare you. Return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Thessalia,</hi> I pray you, as full of good fortune, as I am of desire: and if I liue, I will in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> short time follow you; if I die, loue my memorie.</p>
            <p>This was all, and this <hi>Palladius</hi> read twise or thrise ouer. Ah (said hee) <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> what meanes this alteration? what haue I deserued of thee, to bee thus banished of thy counsels? Heretofore I haue accused the sea, condemned the Pyrats, and hated my euil fortune, that depriued me of thee; But now thy self is the sea, which drounes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> my comfort, thy selfe is the Pirat that robbes thy selfe of me: Thy owne wil becomes my euill fortune. Then turned he his thoughts to all formes of ghesses that might light vpon the purpose and course of <hi>Pyrocles</hi>: for hee was not so sure by his wordes, that it was loue, as hee was doubtfull where the loue was. One time he thought, some beautie in <hi>Laconia</hi> had layed hold of his eyes; an other time hee feared, that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> might be <hi>Parthenias</hi> excellencie, which had broken the bands of al former resolution But the more he thought, the more he knew not what to thinke, armies of obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons rising against any accepted opinion.</p>
            <p>Then as carefull he was what to doo himselfe: at length determined, neuer to leaue seeking him, till his search should bee either by meeting accomplished, or by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> death ended. Therfore (for all the vnkindnesse bearing tender respect, that his friends secrete determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should be kept from any suspition in others) he went to <hi>Kalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and told him, that he had receaued a message from his friend, by which he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood he was gone backe againe into <hi>Laconia,</hi> about some matters greatly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the poore men, whose protection he had vndertaken, and that it was in any sort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> fit for him, to follow him, but in such priuate wise, as not to bee knowne, and that therefore he would as then bid him farewell: arming himselfe in a blacke armour, as either a badge, or prognostication of his minde: and taking onely with him good store of monie, and a fewe choise iewels, leauing the greatest number of them, and most of his apparell with <hi>Kalander</hi>: which he did partly to giue the more cause to <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> to expect their returne, and so to be the lesse curiously inquisitiue after them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and partly to leaue those honorable thankes vnto him, for his charge and kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which hee knewe hee woulde no other way receaue. The good old man hauing neither reason to dissuade, nor hope to persuade, receaued the things, with minde of a keeper, not of an owner; but before he went, desired he might haue the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> happines, fully to know what they were: which he saide, he had euer till then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid, fearing to be any way importune: but now he could not be so much an enemy to his desires as any longer to imprison them in silence, <hi>Palladius</hi> tolde him that the matter was not so secrete, but that so worthie a friend deserued the knowledge, and should haue it as soone as he might speake with his friend: without whose consent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> (because their promise bound him otherwise) he could not reueale it: but bad him hold for most assured, that if they liued but a while, he should finde that they which bare the names of <hi>Daiphantus</hi> and <hi>Palladius,</hi> would giue him and his cause to thinke his noble courtesie well imploied. <hi>Kalander</hi> would presse him no further: but desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that he might haue leaue to goe, or at least to sende his sonne and seruauntes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> with him, <hi>Palladius</hi> brake of all ceremonies, by telling him; his case stood so, that his greatest fauour should be in making lest adoo of his parting.

            <p>Onely <hi>Clitophon</hi> by vehement importunitie obteyned to go with him, to come againe to <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> whom he named and accounted his Lord. And in such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> priuate guise departed <hi>Palladius,</hi> though hauing a companion to talke withall, yet talking much more with vnkindnes. And first they went to <hi>Mantinaea</hi>; wherof because <hi>Parthenia</hi> was, he suspected there might be some cause of his abode. But finding there no newes of him he went to <hi>Tegaea, Ripa, Enispae, Stimpahlus,</hi> and <hi>Pheneus,</hi> famous for the poisonous <hi>Stygian</hi> water, and through all the rest of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> making their eyes, their eares, and their tongue serue almost for nothing, but that enquirie. But they could know nothing but that in none of those places he was knowne. And so went they, making one place succeed to an other, in like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie to their search, many times encountring strange aduentures, worthy to be registred in the roulles of fame; but this may not be omitted. As they past in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> valley, (of either side of which heigh hills lifted vp their beetle-browes, as if they would ouer looke the pleasantnes of their vnder-prospect) they were by the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines of the place, &amp; the wearienes of themselues, inuited to light from their horses; &amp; pulling of their bits, that they might somthing refresh their mouthes vppon the grasse (which plentifully grewe, brought vp vnder the care of those well shading <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> trees,) they them selues laid them downe hard by the murmuring musicke of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain waters, which spouted out of the side of the hills, &amp; in the bottome of the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie made of many springs a pretie brooke, like a common-wealth of many famylies: but when they had a while harkened to the perswasion of sleepe, they rose, and walkt onward in that shadie place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet with a soddaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipt, hauing long borne great honour to the name of <hi>Amphialus, Palladius</hi> thought best to take that armour, thinking thereby to learne by them that should know that armour, some newes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> &amp; yet not hinder him in the search of <hi>Daiphantus</hi> too. So he by the helpe of <hi>Clitophon</hi> quickly put on that armour, whereof there was no one piece wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, though hacked in some places, bewraying some fight not long since passed. It was some-thing to great, but yet serued well enough. And so getting on their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, they trauailed but a litle way, when in opening of the mouth of the valley <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> into a faire field, they met with a coach drawen with foure milke white-horses, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished al in blacke, with a blacke a more boye vpon euerie horse, they all apparelled in white, the coach it selfe very richly furnished in blacke and white. But before they coulde come so neere as to discerne what was within, there came running vppon them aboue a dosen horsmen, who cried to them to yeelde them selues prisoners, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> or els they should die. But <hi>Palladius</hi> not accustomed to graunt ouer the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of him selfe vppon so vniust titles, with sworde drawne gaue them so rude an answer, that diuers of them neuer had breath to reply again: for being well

backt by <hi>Clitophon,</hi> &amp; hauing an excellent horse vnder him, when he was ouerprest by some, he auoided them, and ere th'other thought of it, punished in him his fellows faults: and so either with cunning or with force, or rather with a cunning force, left none of them either liuing, or able to make his life serue to others hurt. Which being done, he approched the coach, assuring the blacke boies they should haue no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> hurt, who were els readie to haue run away, and looking into the coach, he found in the one end a Lady of great beautie, &amp; such a beautie, as shewed forth the beames both of wisdome &amp; good nature, but all as much darkned, as might be, with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. In the other, two Ladies, (who by their demeanure shewed well, they were but her seruants) holding before them a picture; in which was a goodly Gentleman <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> (whom he knew not) painted, hauing in their faces a certaine waiting sorrow, their eies being infected with their mistres weeping. But, the cheife Ladie hauing not so much as once heard the noise of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flict (so had sorrow closed vp all the entries of her mind, &amp; loue tied her se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces to that beloued picture (now the shadow of him fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon the picture made her cast vp her eie, and seing the armour which too well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> knew, thinking him to be <hi>Amphialus</hi> the Lord of her desires, (bloud comming more freely into her cheekes, as though it would be bolde, &amp; yet there growing new again pale for feare) with a pitiful looke (like on vniustly condemned) My Lord <hi>Amphialus</hi> saide she you haue enough punished me: it is time for crueltie to leaue you, and euill fortune me; if not I praie you, (&amp; to graunt, my praier fitter time nor place you can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> haue) accomplish the one euen now, &amp; finish the other. With that, sorrow impatient to be slowly vttered in her ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> staying speeches, poured it self so fast in teares, that <hi>Palladius</hi> could not hold her longer in errour, but pulling of his helmet, Madam (said he) I perceaue you mistake me: I am a stranger in these parts, set vpon (without any cause giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by me) by some of your seruants, whom because I haue in my iust defence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> euill entreated, I came to make my excuse to you, whom seing such as I doo, I finde greater cause, why I should craue pardon of you. When she saw his face, &amp; heard his speech, she looked out of the coach, &amp; seing her men, some slaine, some lying vnder their dead horses, &amp; striuing to get from vnder them, without making more account of the matter, Truly (said she) they are wel serued that durst lift vp their armes against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> that armour. But Sir Knight (said she) I pray you tell me, how come you by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? for if it be by the death of him that owed it, then haue I more to say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. <hi>Palladius</hi> assured her it was not so; telling her the true manner howe hee found it. It is like enough (said shee) for that agrees with the manner he hath lately vsed. But I beseech you Sir (said she) since your prowes hath bereft me of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> let it yet so farre heale the woundes it selfe hath giuen, as to garde me to the next towne.

But when he found that his presence did far more perswade for himselfe, then his speeche could doo for his frend, hee left my court: hoping, that forgetfulnesse (which commonly waits vpon absence) woulde make roome for his friende: to whome hee woulde not vtter thus much (I thinke) for a kinde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> feare not to grieue him, or perchance (though he cares litle for me) of a certain hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable gratefulnes, nor yet to discouer so much of my secrets: but as it should seeme, meant to trauell into farre countryes, vntill his friends affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either ceased, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed.

I straight found ielousie and disdaine tooke holde of him: and yet the froward paine of mine owne harte made mee so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to punish him, whom I esteemed the chiefest let in my way; that when he with humble gesture, and vehement speeches, sued for my fauor; I told him, that I would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> heare him more willingly, if hee woulde speake for <hi>Amphialus,</hi> as well as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus</hi> had done for him: he neuer answered me, but pale &amp; quaking, went straight away; and straight my heart misgaue me some euill successe: and yet though I had authoritie inough to haue stayed him (as in these fatall thinges it falles out, that the hie-working powers make second causes vnwittingly accessarie to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> I did no further but sent a foot-man of mine (whose faithfulnes to me I will knew) from place to place to follow him, and bring me word of his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: which (alas) haue brought foorth that which I feare I must euer rewe.</p>
            <p>For hee had trauailed scarsea dayes iorney out of my Countrey, but that (not farre from this place) he ouer-tooke <hi>Amphialus,</hi> who (by succouring a distressed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) had bene here stayed: and by and by called him to fight with him, protesting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> that one of them two should die: you may easily iudge how straunge it was to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus,</hi> whose hart could accuse it selfe of no fault, but too much affection towarde him, which he (refusing to fight with him) woulde faine haue made <hi>Philoxenus</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, but (as my seruant since tolde me) the more <hi>Amphialus</hi> went back, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> more he followed, calling him Traytor, and coward, yet neuer telling the cause of this strange alteration. Ah <hi>Philoxenus</hi> (saide <hi>Amphialus</hi>) I know I am no Traytor, and thou well knowest I am no coward: but I pray thee content thy selfe with this much, and let this satisfie thee, that I loue thee, since I beare thus much of thee, but hee leauing wordes drew his sworde and gaue <hi>Amphialus</hi> a great blow or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> two, which but for the goodnes of his armour would haue slaine him: and yet so farre did <hi>Amphialus</hi> containe himselfe, stepping aside, and saying to him, Well <hi>Philoxenus,</hi> and thus much villany am I content to put vp, not any longer for thy sake (whom I haue no cause to loue, since thou dost iniury mee, and wilt not tell me the cause) but for thy vertuous fathers sake, to whom I am so much bound. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> I pray thee goe awaye, and conquer thy owne passions, and thou shalt make mee soone yeeld to be thy seruant. But he would not attend his wordes, but still strake so fiercely at <hi>Amphialus,</hi> that in the end (nature preuailing aboue determination) he was faine to defend him selfe, and with-all to offend him, that by an vnluckye blow the poore <hi>Philoxenus</hi> fell dead at his feete; hauing had time onely to speake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> some wordes, whereby <hi>Amphialus</hi> knew it was for my sake: which when <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus</hi> sawe, he forthwith gaue such tokens of true felt sorrow; that as my seruant said no imagination could conceiue greater woe.

Though my heart bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> but a stage for Tragedies; yet I must confesse, it is euen vnable to beare the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable representation thereof: knowing <hi>Amphialus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus</hi> as I haue done. Alas what sorrowe, what amasement, what shame was in <hi>Amphialus,</hi> when hee sawe his deere foster father, finde him the killer of his onely sonne? In my heart I knowe, hee wished mountaines had laine vpon him, to keepe him from that meeting.

But (because this serues to make you know my fortune) he threw away his armour, euen this which you haue now vppon you, which at the first sight I vainely hoped, hee had put on againe; and then (as ashamed of the light) hee ranne into thickest of the woods, lamenting, and euen crying out so pitifully, that my seruant, (though of a fortune not vsed to much tendernes) could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> not refraine weeping when he told it me. He once ouertooke him, but <hi>Amphialus</hi> drawing his sword, which was the onely part of his armes (God knowes to what purpose) he carried about him, threatned to kil him if he followed him, and withal, bad him deliuer this bitter message, that he wel inough found, I was the cause of all this mischiefe: and that if I were a man, he would go ouer the world to kill me: but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> bad me assure myselfe, that of all creatures in the world, he most hated mee. Ah sir Knight (whose eares I think by this time are tired with the rugged waies of these mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes) now weigh my case, if at least you know what loue is.

And now sir (saide she) you haue your request, I pray you take paines to guide me to the next towne, that there I may gather such of my company againe, as your valor hath left me. <hi>Palladius</hi> willingly condiscended: but ere they began to go, there came <hi>Clitophon,</hi> who hauing bene something hurt by one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> of them, had pursued him a good way: at length ouertaking him, and ready to kill him, vnderstoode they were seruants to the faire Queene <hi>Helen,</hi> and that the cause of this enterprise was for nothing, but to make <hi>Amphialus</hi> prisoner, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they knew their mistresse sought; for she concealed her sorrow, nor cause of her sorrow fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no body.</p>

It was the appearing of a Ladie, who because she walked with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> her side toward him, he coulde not perfectly see her face; but so much he might see of her, that was a suretie for the rest, that all was excellent.</p>
            <p>Well might he perceiue the hanging of her haire in fairest quantitie, in locks, some curled, and some as it were forgotten, with such a carelesse care, &amp; an arte so hiding arte, that shee seemed she would lay them for a paterne, whether nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> simply, or nature helped by cunning, be the more excellent: the rest whereof was drawne into a coronet of golde richly set with pearle, and so ioyned all ouer with golde wiers, &amp; couered with feathers of diuers coulours, that it was not vnlike to an helmet, such, a glittering shew, it bare, &amp; so brauely it was held vp from the head. Vpon her bodie she ware a doublet of Skie colour sattin, couerd with plates of golde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> &amp; as it were nailed with pretious stones, that in it she might seeme armed; the nether part of her garment was so full of stuffe, &amp; cut after such a fashion, that though the length of it reached to the ankles, yet in her going one might sometimes discerne the small of her leg, which with the foot was dressed in a shorte paire of crimson vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet buskins, in some places open (as the ancient manner was) to shew the fairenes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> of the skin. Ouer all this she ware a certaine mantell, made in such manner, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnder her right arme, and couering most of that side, it had no fastning of the left side, but onley vpon the top of the shoulder: where the two endes met, and were closed together with a very riche iewell: the deuise whereof as he after saw was this: a <hi>Hercules</hi> made in litle fourme, but set with a distaffe in his hand as he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> once was by <hi>Omphales</hi> commaundement with a worde in Greeke, but thus to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, <hi>Neuer more valiant.</hi> On the same side, on her thigh she ware a sword, which as it witnessed her to be an <hi>Amazon,</hi> or one following that profession, so it seemed but a needlesse weapon, since her other forces were without with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.

But this bastarde Loue (for indeede the name of Loue is most vnworthylie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to so hatefull a humour) as it is engendered betwixt lust and idlenes; as the matter it workes vpon is nothing but a certaine base weakenes, which some gentle fooles call a gentle hart; as his adioyned companions bee vnquietnes, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> fond comforts, faint discomforts, hopes, ielousies, vngrounded rages, caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse yeeldings; so is the highest end it aspires vnto, a litle pleasure with much paine before, and great repentaunce after. But that ende how endlesse it runes to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite euils, were fit inough for the matter we speake of, but not for your eares, in whome indeede there is so much true disposition to vertue: yet thus much of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> worthie effects in your selfe is to bee seene, that (besides your breaking lawes of hospitallitie with <hi>Kalander</hi> and of friendship with me) it vtterly subuerts the course of nature, in making reason giue place to sense, and man to woman. And truely I thinke heere-vpon it first gatte the name of Loue: for indeede the true loue hath that excellent nature in it, that it doth transforme the verie essence of the louer into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> thing loued, vniting, and as it were incorporating it with a secret and inwarde wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. And herein do these kinde of loues imitate the excellent; for as the loue of heauen makes one heauenly, the loue of vertue, vertuous; so doth the loue of the world make one become worldly, and this effeminate loue of a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man, doth so womanize a man, that (if hee yeeld to it) it will not onely make him an <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> but a launder, a distaff-spinner; or what so euer other vile occupation their idle heads can imagin and their weake hands performe. Therefore (to trouble you no longer with my tedious but louiug wordes) if either you remember what you are, what you haue bene, or what you must be: if you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider what it is, that moued you, or by what kinde of creature you are moued, you shall finde the cause so small,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> the effect so daungerous, your selfe so vnworthie to runne into the one, or to bee driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the other, that I doubt not I shal quicklie haue occasion rather to praise you
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12151:27"/>
for hauing conquered it, then to giue you further counsell, howe to doo it. But in <hi>Pyrocles</hi> this speech wrought no more, but that hee, who before hee was espied, was afraide; after, being perceiued, was ashamed, now being hardly rubd vpon, left both feare and shame, and was moued to anger. But the exceeding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> good will he bare to <hi>Musidorus</hi> striuing with it, hee thus, partly to satisfie him, but principally to loofe the reines to his owne motions, made him answere. Cosin, whatsoeuer good disposition nature hath bestowed vpon me, or howsoeuer that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position hath bene by bringing vp confirmed, this must I confesse, that I am not yet come to that degree of wisedome, to thinke light of the sexe, of whom I haue my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> life; since if I be any thing (which your friendship rather finds, then I acknowledge) I was to come to it, born of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; nursed of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly (for this point of your speach doth neerest touch me) it is stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to see the vnman-like cruelty of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; who not content with their tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nous a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bition, to haue brought the others ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous patience vnder them (like childish maisters) thinke their masterhood no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> without doing iniury to them, who (if wee will argue by reason) are framed of nature with the same partes of the minde for the exercise of vertue, as we are. And for example, euen this estate of <hi>Amazons,</hi> (which I know for my greatest honor do seek to counterfait) doth well witnes, that if generally the sweetnes of their disposition did not make them see the vainnesse of these thinges, which wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> glorious, they nether want valor of mind, nor yet doth their fairnes take away their force. And truely we men, and praisers of men, should remember, that if wee haue such excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies, it is reason to thinke them excellent creatures, of whom wee are: since a Kite neuer brought foorth a good flying Hauke. But to tell you true, as I thinke it superfluous to vse any wordes of such a subiect, which is so praysed in it selfe, as it needes no praises; so withall I feare lest my conceate (not able to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> reach vnto them) bring forth wordes, which for their vnworthines may be a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to them I so inwardly honor. Let this suffice, that they are capable of vertue and vertue (ye your selues say) is to be loued, &amp; I too truly: but this I willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that it likes me much better, when I finde vertue in a faire lodging, then when I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> am bound to seeke it in an ill fauoured creature, like a pearle in a dounghill. As for my fault of being an vnciuill guest to <hi>Kalander,</hi> if you coulde feele what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward guest my selfe am host vnto: ye would thinke it very excuseable, in that I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther performe the dueties of an host, then the ceremonies of a guest. And for my breaking the lawes of friendshippe with you, (which I would rather dye, then effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> doo) truely, I could finde in my hart to aske you pardon for it, but that your now handling of me giues me reason to my former dealing. And here <hi>Pyrocles</hi> stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to breath himselfe, hauing beene transported with a litle vehemency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it seemed him <hi>Musidorus</hi> had ouer-bitterly glaunsed against the reputation of woman-kinde: but then quieting his countenance (aswell as out of an vnquiet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> minde it might be) he thus proceeded on: And poore Loue (said he) deare cosin, is little beholding vnto you, since you are not contented to spoile it of the honor of the highest power of the mind, which notable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue attributed vnto it; but ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect it below all other passions, in trueth somewhat strangely; since, if loue receiue any disgrace, it is by the company of these passions you preferre before it. For those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> kinds of bitter obiections (as, that lust, idlenes, and a weake harte, shoulde bee, as it were, the matter and forme of loue) rather touch me, deare <hi>Musidorus,</hi> then loue: But I am good witnesse of mine owne imperfections, and therefore will not defende
<pb facs="tcp:12151:28"/>
myselfe: but herein I must say, you deale contrary to your selfe: for if I be so weak, then can you not with reason stir me vp as ye did, by remembrance of my owne ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: or if indeed I be vertuous, then must ye confesse, that loue hath his working in a vertuous hart: and so no dout hath it, whatsoeuer I be: for if we loue vertue, in whom shall wee loue it but in a vertuous creature? without your meaning bee, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> should loue this word <hi>vertue,</hi> where I see it written in a booke. Those troblesome ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes you say it breedes, be not the faults of loue, but of him that loues; as an vnable vessell to beare such a licour: like euill eyes, not able to looke on the Sun; or like a weake braine, soonest ouerthrowen with the best wine. Euen that heauenly loue you speake of, is accompanied in some harts with hopes, griefes, longinges, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paires.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> And in that heauenly loue, since there are two parts, the one the loue itselfe, th'other the excellencie of the thing loued; I, not able at the first leap to frame both in me, do now (like a diligent workman) make ready the chiefe instrument, and first part of that great worke, which is loue it selfe; which when I haue a while practised in this sorte, then you shall see me turne it to greater matters. And thus gentlie you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> may (if it please you) thinke of me. Neither doubt ye, because I weare a womans apparell, I will be the more womannish, since, I assure you (for all my apparrel) there is nothing I desire more, then fully to proue my selfe a man in this enterprise. Much might be saide in my defence, much more for loue, and most of all for that diuine creature, which hath ioyned me and loue together. But these disputations are fitter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> for quiet schooles, then my troubled braines, which art bent rather in deeds to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, then in wordes to defende the noble desire that possesseth me. O Lord (saide <hi>Musidorus</hi>) how sharp-witted you are to hurt your selfe? No (answered he) but it is the hurt you speake of, which makes me so sharp-witted. Euen so (saide <hi>Musido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>) as euery base occupation makes one sharp in that practise, and foolish in all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> rest. Nay rather (answered <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) as each excellent thing once well learned, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues for a measure of all other knowledges. And is that become (saide <hi>Musidorus</hi>) a measure for other things, which neuer receiued measure in it selfe? It is counted without measure (answered <hi>Pyrocles,</hi>) because the workings of it are without measure but otherwise, in nature it hath measure, since it hath an end allotted vnto it. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> beginning being so excellent, I would gladly know the ende. Enioying, answered <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> with a deepe sigh. O (saide <hi>Musidorus</hi>) now set ye foorth the basenes of it: since if it ende in enioying, it shewes all the rest was nothing. Ye mistake me (aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) I spake of the ende to which it is directed; which end ends not, no sooner then the life. Alas, let your owne braine disenchaunt you (saide <hi>Musidorus.</hi>)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> My hart is too farre possessed (saide <hi>Pyrocles.</hi>) But the head giues you direction. And the hart giues me life; aunswered <hi>Pyrocles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Musidorus</hi> was so greeued to see his welbeloued friend obstinat (as he thought) to his owne destruction, that it forced him with more then accustomed vehemency to speake these words; Well, well, (saide he) you lift to abuse your selfe; it was a very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> white and red vertue, which you could pick out of a painterly glosse of a visage: Confesse the truth; and ye shall finde, the vtmost was but beautie; a thing, which though it be in as great excellencye in your selfe as may be in any, yet I am sure you make no further reckning of it, then of an outward fading benefite Nature bestowed vpon you. And yet such is your want of a true grounded vertue, which must be like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> it selfe in all points, that what you wisely account a trifle in your selfe, you fondly become a slaue vnto in another. For my part I now protest, I haue left nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12151:28"/>
which my wit could make me know, or my most entier friendship to you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of me; I doo now beseech you euen for the loue betwixt vs (if this other loue haue left any in you tovvards me) and for the remembrance of your olde careful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (if you can reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber him that forget your selfe) lastly for <hi>Pyrocles</hi> ovvn sake (who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> is novv vpon the point of falling or rising) to purge your selfe of this vile infection; other vvise giue me leaue, to leaue of this name of freindship, as an idle title of a thing vvhich cannot be, vvhere vertue is abolished. The length of these speaches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had not so much cloied <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> though he vvere very impatient of long deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations, as this last farevvell of him he loued as his ovvne life, did vvound his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> soule for thinking him selfe afflicted, he vvas the apter to conceiue vnkindnesse deepely: insomuch, that shaking his head, and deliuering some shevve of teares, he thus vttered his greifes. Alas (said he) prince <hi>Musidorus,</hi> hovv cruelly you deale with me; if you seeke the victorie, take it and if ye list, the triumph; haue you all the reason of the world, and with me remaine all the imperfections; yet such as I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> can no more lay from me, then the Crow can be perswaded by the Swanne to cast of all his blacke fethers. But truely you deale with me like a Phisition, that seeing his patient in a pestile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t feuer, should chide him, in steed of ministring helpe, and bid him be sick no more; or rather like such a frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that visiting his friend condemned to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall prison; and loaden with greeuous fetters, should will him to shake of his fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> or he would leaue him. I am sick, and sick to the death; I am prisoner, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any redresse, but by her to whom I am slaue. Now if you list, leaue him that loues you in the hiest degree: But remember euer to cary this with you, that you abandon your friend in his greatest extremitie.</p>
            <p>And herewith the deepe wound of his loue being rubbed a fresh with this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> new vnkindnes, began (as it were to bleed againe, in such sort that he was vnable to beare it any longer, but gushing out aboundance of teares, and crossing his armes ouer his woefull hart, he suncke downe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the ground which sodaine trance went so to the hart of <hi>Musidorus,</hi> that falling downe by him and kissing the weping eyes of his friend, he besought him not to make account of his speach; which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> if it had beene ouer vehement, yet was it to be borne withall, because it came out of a loue much more vehement; that he had not thought fancie could haue receiued so deep a wound: but now finding in him the force of it, hee woulde no further contrary it; but imploy all his seruice to medicine it, in such sorte, as the nature of it required. But euen this kindnes made <hi>Pyrocles</hi> the more melte <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> in the former vnkindenes, which his manlike teares well shewed, with a silent look vpon <hi>Musidorus,</hi> as who should say, And is it possible that <hi>Musidorus</hi> should threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to leaue me? And this strooke <hi>Musidorus</hi> minde and senses so dumbe too, that for greefe being notable to say any thing, they rested with their eyes placed one vpon another, in such sort, as might well paint out the true passion of vnkindenes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to be neuer aright, but betwixt them that most dearely loue.</p>
            <p>And thus remained they a time; till at length, <hi>Musidorus</hi> embrasing him, said and will you thus shake of your friend? It is you that shake me of (sayde <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) being for my vnperfectnes vnworthie of your friendshippe. But this (said <hi>Musido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>) shewes you more vnperfect, to be cruell to him, that submits himselfe vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> you; but since you are vnperfect (said he smiling) it is reason you be gouerned by vs wise and perfect man. And that authoritie will I begin to take vpon me, with three absolute co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: The first, that you increase not your euill with fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:12151:29"/>
griefes: the second, that you loue her with all the powers of your mind: and the last commandement shalbe, ye command me to do what seruice I can, towardes the attaining of your desires. <hi>Pyrocles</hi> hart was not so oppressed with the two mighty pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of loue and vnkindnes, but that it yeelded to some mirth at his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Musidorus</hi>; that he should loue: so that some thing cleering his face from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> his former shewes of griefe; Well (said he) deare cousin, I see by the well choosing of your commandementes, that you are farre fitter to be a Prince, then a Counseller: &amp; therfore I am resolued to imploy all my endeuour to obey you; with this condition that the commandementes ye commaund me to lay vpon you, shall onely bee, that you continue to loue me, and looke vpon my imperfections, with more affection <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> then iudgement. Loue you? (said hee) alas, how can my hart be seperated from the true imbrasing of it, without it burst, by being too full of it? But (said he) let vs leaue of these flowers of newe begun frendship: and now I pray you againe tel me; but tell it me fully, omitting no circumstance, the storie of your affections both begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and proceeding: assuring your selfe, that there is nothing so great, which I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> will feare to doo for you: nor nothing so small, which I will disdaine to doo for you. Let me therefore receiue a cleere vnderstanding, which many times we misse, while those things we account small, as a speech, or a looke are omitted, like as a whole sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence may faile of his congruitie, by wanting one particle. Therefore betweene frends, all must be layd open, nothing being superfluous, nor tedious. You shalbe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> obeyed (said <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) and here are we in as fitte a place for it as may be; for this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor no body offers to come into but my selfe; I vsing it as my melancholy retiring place, and therefore that respect is born vnto it; yet if by chance any should come, say that you are a seruant sent from the Queene of the <hi>Amazons</hi> to seeke mee and then let mee, alone for the rest. So sate they downe, and <hi>Pyrocles</hi> thus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> said.</p>
            <p>Cousin (said he) then began the fatall ouerthrow of all my libertie when walking among the pictures in <hi>Kala<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders</hi> house, you your selfe deliuerd vnto me what you had vnderstood of <hi>Philoclea,</hi> who much resembling (though I must say much surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing) the Ladie <hi>Zelmane,</hi> whom so well I loued: there were mine eyes infected, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> at your mouth did I drinke my poison. Yet alas so sweete was it vnto me, that I could not be contented, till <hi>Kalander</hi> had made it more and more strong with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration. Which the more I questioned, the more pittie I conceaued of her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie fortune: and when with pittie once my harte was made tender, according to the aptnesse of the humour, it receaued quickly a cruell impression of that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> passion which to be definde is impossible, because no wordes reach to the strange nature of it: they onely know it, which inwardly feele it, it is called loue. Yet did I not (poore wretch) at first know my disease, thinking it onely such a woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted kinde of desire, to see rare sights; and my pitie to be no other, but the fruits of a gentle nature. But euen this arguing with my selfe came of further thoughts; and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> more I argued, the more my thoughts encreased. Desirous I was to see the place where she remained, as though the <hi>Architecture</hi> of the lodges would haue beene much for my learning; but more desirous to see her selfe, to be iudge, for sooth, of the painters cunning. For thus at the first did I flatter my self, as though my wound had bene no deeper: but when within short time I came to the degree of vncertaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> wishes, and that those wishes grew to vnquiet longinges, when I could fix my thoughts vpon nothing, but that within little varying, they should end with <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi>:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:12151:29"/>
when each thing I saw, seemed to figure out some parte of my passions; when euen <hi>Parthenias</hi> faire face became a lecture to me of <hi>Philocleas</hi> imagined beautie; when I heard no word spoken, but that me thought it caried the sounde of <hi>Philocleas</hi> name: then indeed, then I did yeeld to the burthen, finding my selfe prisoner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> I had leasure to arme my selfe; and that I might well, like the spaniell, gnaw vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the chaine that ties him, but I should sooner marre my teeth, then procure liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Yet I take to witnesse the eternall spring of vertue, that I had neuer read, heard, nor seene any thing; I had neuer any tast of Philosophy, nor inward feeling in my selfe, which for a while I did not call to my succour. But (alas) what resistance was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> there, when ere long my very reason was (you will say corrupted) I must confesse, conquered; and that me thought euen reason did assure me, that all eyes did degenerate from their creation, which did not honour such beautie? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in trueth coulde holde any plea with it, but the reuerent friendship I beare vnto you. For as it went against my harte to breake any way from you, so did I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> feare more then any assault to breake it to you: finding (as it is indeed) that to a hart fully resolute, counsaile is tedious, but reprehension is lothsome: and that there is nothing more terrible to a guilty hart, then the eie of a respected friend. This made me determine with my selfe, (thinking it a lesse fault in frendship to do a thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your knowledge, then against your will) to take this secret course: Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> was most builded vp in me, the last day of my parting and speaking with you; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your speach with me, &amp; my but naming loue, (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> els perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I would haue gone further) I saw your voice and countenance so chaunge, as it assured me, my reuealing it should but purchase your griefe with my cumber: &amp; therfore (deere <hi>Musidorus</hi>) euen ran away from thy wel knowne chiding: for hauing writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a letter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> which I know not whether you found or no, and taken my chiefe iewels with mee, while you were in the middest of your sport, I got a time (as I thinke) vnmarked by any, to steale away, I cared not whether so I might scape you &amp; so came I to <hi>Ithonia</hi> in the prouince of <hi>Messenia</hi>; wher lying secret I put this in practise which before I had deuised. For reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring by <hi>Philanax</hi> his letter, &amp; <hi>Kala<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders</hi> speech, how obstinately <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> was determined not to mary his daughters, &amp; therefore fearing, lest any publike dealing should rather increase her captiuitie, then further my loue; Loue (the refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) had put in my head thus to disguise my selfe, that vnder that maske I might (if it were possible,) get accesse, and what accesse could bring foorth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to fortune &amp; industry: determining to beare the countenance of an <hi>Amazon.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Therefore in the closest maner I could, naming my selfe <hi>Zelmane,</hi> for that deere La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies sake, to whose memorie I am so much bound, I caused this apparell to be made, and bringing it neere the lodges, which are heard at hand, by night, thus dressed my selfe, resting till occasion might make me to be found by them, whom I sought: which the next morning hapned as well, as my owne plot could haue laide it. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> after I had runne ouer the whole petigree of my thoughts, I gaue my selfe to sing a little, which as you knowe I euer delighted in, so now especially, whether it be the nature of this clime to stir vp Poeticall fancies, or rather as I thinke, of loue; whose cope being plesure, wil not so much as vtter his griefes, but in some form of pleasure.</p>
            <p>But I had song very little, when (as I thinke displeased with my bad musicke) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> comes master <hi>Dametas</hi> with a hedging bill in his hand, chasing, and swearing by the pantable of <hi>Pallas,</hi> &amp; such other othes as his rusticall brauery could imagine; &amp; when he saw me, I assure you my beauty was no more beholding to him then my harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
<pb facs="tcp:12151:30"/>
for leaning his hands vpon his bil, and his chin vpon his hands, with the voice of one that plaieth <hi>Hercules</hi> in a play, but neuer had his fancie in his head, the first word he spake to me, was, am not I <hi>Dametas?</hi> why? am not I <hi>Dametas?</hi> hee needed not name himselfe: for <hi>Kalanders</hi> description had set such a note vpon him, as made him very notable vpon me, and therefore the height of my thoughts would not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> so much as to make him any answer, but continued on my inward discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: which (he perchaunce witnes of his owne vnworthines, and therefore the apter to thinke himselfe contemned) tooke in so hainous manner, that standing vpon his tip-toes, and staring as if he would haue had a mote pulled out of his eie, Why (said he) thou woman, or boy, or both, whatsoeuer thou bee, I tell thee here is no place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> for thee, get thee gone, I tell thee it is the Princes pleasure, I tell thee it is <hi>Dametas</hi> pleasure. I could not choose, but smile at him, seeing him looke so like an Ape that had newly taken a purgation; yet taking my selfe with the manner, spake these wordes to my selfe: O spirite (saide I) of mine, how canst thou receaue anie mirth in the midst of thine agonies, and thou mirth howe darest thou enter into a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> minde so growne of late thy professed enemie? Thy spirite (saide <hi>Dametas</hi>) doost thou thinke me a spirite, I tell thee I am <hi>Basilius</hi> officer, and haue charge of him, and his daughters.

By the combe-case of <hi>Diana</hi> sware <hi>Dametas</hi>) this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is mad: oysters, and pearles? doost thou thinke I will buie oysters? I tell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> thee once againe get thee packing, and with that lifted vp his bill to hit me with the blunt ende of it: but indeede that put me quite out of my lesson, so that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat <hi>Zelmanes-ship,</hi> and drawing out my sworde, the basenesse of the villaine yet made me stay my hande, and he (who, as <hi>Kalander</hi> tolde mee, from his childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood euer feared the blade of a sworde) ran backe, backward (with his handes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> his head) at lest twentie paces, gaping and staring, with the verie grace (I thinke) of the clownes, that by <hi>Latonas</hi> prayers were turned into Frogs. At length staying, findinge himselfe without the compasse of blowes, hee fell to a fresh scolding, in such mannerlie manner, as might well shewe hee had passed through the discipline of a Tauerne. But seeing mee walke vp and downe, without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> marking what he saide, he went his way (as I perceiued after) to <hi>Basilius</hi>: for within a while he came vnto mee, bearing in deede shewes in his countenaunce of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and well-minded gentleman, and with as much courtesie as <hi>Dametas</hi> with rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse saluting mee, Faire Lady (saide hee) it is nothing strange, that such a solitary place as this should receiue solitary persons; but much doe I maruaile howe such a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> beauty as yours is, should be suffered to be thus alone. I (that now knew it was my part to play) looking with a graue maiestie vpon him, as if I found in my selfe cause to be reuerenced. They are neuer alone (saide I) that are accompanied with noble thoughts. But those thoughts (replied <hi>Basilius</hi>) cannot in this your lonelines neither warrant you from suspition in others, nor defende you from melancholy in your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> selfe. I then shewing a mislike that he pressed me so farre, I seeke no better warrant (saide I) then my owne conscience, nor no greater pleasure, then mine owne contentation. Yet vertue seekes to satisfie others, (saide <hi>Basilius.</hi>) Those that bee good (saide I,) and they will bee satisfied as long as they see no euill. Yet will the best in this country, (saide <hi>Basilius</hi>) suspect so excellent beauty being so weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> garded.

Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ladie (said he) you praise so greatly, (and yet so wisely) your country, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> I must needes desire to knowe what the nest is, out of which such Byrds doo flye. You must first deserue it (said I) before you may obtaine it. And by what meanes (saide <hi>Basilius</hi>) shall I deserue to know your estate? By letting me first knowe yours (aunswered I.) To obey you (said he) I will doe it, although it were so much more reason, yours should be knowen first, as you doo deserue in all points to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> preferd. Know you (faire Lady) that my name is <hi>Basilius,</hi> vnworthily Lord of this country: the rest, either fame hath alreadie brought to your eares, or (if it please you to make this place happie by your presence) at more leasure you shall vnderstand of me. I that from the beginning assured my selfe it was he, but would not seeme I did so, to keepe my grauitie the better, making a peece of reuerence vnto him, Mightye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Prince (said I) let my not knowing you serue for the excuse of my boldenes, and the little reuerence I doe you, impute it to the manner of my country, which is the inuincible Land of the <hi>Amazons</hi>; My selfe neece to <hi>Senicia,</hi> Queene thereof, line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally descended of the famous <hi>Penthesilea,</hi> slaine by the bloudie hand of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>: I hauing in this my youth determined to make the worlde see the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> excellencies, aswell in priuate, as in publicke vertue, haue passed some daungerous aduentures in diuers countries, till the vnmercifull Sea depriued me of my company: so that shipwrack casting me not farre hence, vncertaine wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring brought me to this place. But <hi>Basilius</hi> (who now began to tast of that, which since he hath swallowed vp, as I will tell you) fell to more cunning intreating <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> my aboad, then any greedy host would vse to well paying passengers. I thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could shoot righter at the mark of my desires; yet had I learned alredye so much, that it was against my womanhood to be forward in my owne wishes. And therefore he (to prooue whether intercessions in fitter mouths might better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile) commaunded <hi>Dametas</hi> to bring forth with his wife and daughters thether; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> three Ladies, although of diuers, yet all of excellent beauty.</p>
            <p>His wife in graue Matronlike attire, with countenaunce and gesture sutable, and of such fairenes (being in the strength of her age) as if her daughters had not bene by, might with iust price haue purchased admiration; but they being there, it was enough that the most dainty eye would thinke her a worthye mother of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> such children. The faire <hi>Pamela,</hi> whose noble hart I finde doth greatly disdaine, that the trust of her vertue is reposed in such a louts hands as <hi>Dametas,</hi> had yet to shewe an obedience, taken on shepeardish apparell, which was but of Russet cloth cut after their fashion, with a straight body, open brested, the nether parte full of pleights, with long and wide sleeues: but beleeue me she did apparell her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> apparell, and with the pretiousnes of her body made it most sumptuous. Her haire at the full length, wound about with gold lace, onely by the comparison to shew how farre her haire doth excell in colour: betwixt her breasts (which sweetlye rase vp like two faire Mountainettes in the pleasaunt vale of <hi>Tempe</hi>) there honge a verie riche Diamond set but in a blacke horne, the worde I haue since read is this; <hi>yet still <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> my selfe.</hi> And thus particularlie haue I described them, because you may know that mine eyes are not so partiall, but that I marked them too. But when the ornament of the Earth, the modell of heauen, the Triumph of Nature, the life of

               </gap>ctions; and yet so apparelled, as did shew she kept best store of her beauty to her selfe: her haire (alas too poore a word, why should I not rather call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her beames) drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp into a net, able to haue caught <hi>Iupiter</hi> when he was in the forme of an Egle; her body (O sweet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> body) couered with a light Taffeta garment, so cut, as the wrought smocke came through it in many places, inough to haue made your restraind imagination haue thought what was vnder it: with the cast of her blacke eyes; blacke indeed, whether nature so made them, that we might be the more able to behold &amp; bear their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull shining, or that she, (goddesse like) would work this miracle with her selse, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> giuing blacknes the price aboue all beauty. Then (I say) indeede me thought the Lillies grew pale for enuie, the roses me thought blushed to see sweeter roses in her cheekes, and the apples me thought, fell downe from the trees, to do homage to the apples of her breast; Then the cloudes gaue place, that the heauens might more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly smile vpon her; at the lest the cloudes of my thoughts quite vanished: and my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> sight (then more cleere and forcible then euer) was so fixed there, that (I imagine) I stood like a well wrought image, with some life in shew, but none in practise. And so had I beene like inough to haue stayed long time, but that <hi>Gynecia</hi> stepping betweene my sight and the onely <hi>Philoclea,</hi> the chaunge of obi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ct made meere-couer my sences: so that I coulde with reasonable good manner receiue the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> of her, and of the princesse <hi>Pamela,</hi> doing them yet no further reuerence then one Princesse vseth to another. But when I came to the neuer-inough praised <hi>Philoclea,</hi> I could not but fall downe on my knees, and taking by force her hand, and kissing it (I must confesse) with more then womanly ardency, Diuine Lady, (said I) let not the world, nor these great princesses maruaile, to se me (contrary to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> my manner) do this especiall honor vnto you, since all both men and women, do owe this to the perfection of your beauty. But she blushing (like a faire morning in May) at this my singularity, and causing me to rise, Noble Lady, (saide she) it is no maruaile to see your iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t much mistaken in my beauty, since you beginne with so great an errour, as to do more honour vnto me then to them, to whom I my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> selfe owe all seruice. Rather (answered I with a bowed downe countenaunce) that shewes the power of your beauty, which forced me to do such an errour, if it were an errour. You are so well acquainted (saide shee sweetely, most sweetely smiling, with your owne beautie, that it makes you easilie fall into the discourse of beauty. Beauty in me? (said I truely sighing) alas if there be any, it is in my eyes, which your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> blessed presence hath imparted vnto them.</p>
            <p>But then (as I thinke) <hi>Basilius</hi> willing her so to do, Well (said she) I must needes confesse I haue heard that it is a great happines to bee praised of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Amazon,</hi> since you will ouercome, though in a wrong matter. But if my beauty bee any thing, then let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> it obtaine thus much of you, that you will remaine some while in this companie, to ease your owne trauail, and our solitarines. First let me dye (said I) before any word spoken by such a mouth, should come in vaine. And thus with some other wordes of entertaining, was my staying concluded, and I led among them to the lodge; truely a place for pleasantnes, not vnfitte to flatter solitarines<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> set vpon such an vnsensible rising of the ground, as you are come to a prety height before almost you perceiue that you ascend, it giues the eye Lordship ouer a

good large circuit, which according to the nature of the countrey, being diuersified betwene hills and dales, woods and playnes, one place more cleere, an other more darksome, it seemes a pleasant picture of nature, with louely lightsomnes and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall shadowes. The Lodge is of a yellow stone, built in the forme of a starre; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> round about a garden framed into like points: and beyond the gardein, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings cut out, each aunswering the Angles of the Lodge: at the end of one of them is the other smaller Lodge, but of like fashion; where the gratious <hi>Pamela</hi> liueth: so that the Lodge seemeth not vnlike a faire <hi>Comete,</hi> whose taile stretcheth it selfe to a starre of lesse greatnes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> So <hi>Gynecia</hi> her selfe bringing me to my Lodging, anone after I was inuited and brought downe to sup with them in the gardein, a place not fairer in naturall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then artificiall inuentions: where, in a banquetting house among certaine pleasant trees, whose heads seemed curled with the wrappings about of Vine-bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches The table was set neere to an excellent water-worke; for by the casting of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the water in most cunning maner, it makes (with the shining of the Sunne vpon it) a perfect rainbow, not more pleasant to the eye then to the mind, so sensibly to see the proofe of the heauenly <hi>Iris.</hi> There were birds also made so finely, that they did not onely deceiue the sight with their figure, but the hearing with their songs; which the watrie instruments did make their gorge deliuer. The table at which we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> sate, was round, which being fast to the floore whereon we sate, and that deuided from the rest of the buildings (with turning a vice, which <hi>Basilius</hi> at first did to make me sport) the table, and we about the table, did all turne round, by meanes of water which ranne vnder, and carried it about as a Mille. But alas, what pleasure did it to mee, to make diuers times the full circle round about, since <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
               <hi>Philoclea</hi> (being also set) was carried still in equall distance from mee, and that onely my eyes did ouertake her? which when the table was stayed, and wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to feede, dranke much more eagerlie of her beautie, then my mouth did of any other licour. And so was my common sense deceiued (being chiefly bent to her) that as I dranke the wine, and withall stale a looke on her, me seemed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> I tasted her deliciousnesse. But alas, the one thirste was much more inflamed, then the other quenched. Sometimes my eyes would lay themselues open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue all the dartes she did throwe, sometimes cloze vp with admiration, as if with a contrary fancie, they would preserue the riches of that fight they had gotten, or cast my liddes as curtaines ouer the image of beautie, her pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ence had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> painted in them. True it is, that my Reason (now growen a seruant to passion) did yet often tell his master, that he should more moderatly vse his delight. But he, that of a rebell was become a Prince, disdayned almost to allow him the place of a Counseller: so that my senses delights being too strong for any other resolution, I did euen loose the raines vnto them: hoping, that (going for a woman) my lookes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> would passe, either vnmarked, or vnsuspected.</p>
            <p>Now thus I had (as me thought) well playd my first acte, assuring my selfe, that vnder that disguisment, I should find opportunitie to reueale my selfe to the owner of my harte. But who would thinke it possible (though I feele it true) that in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most eight weekes space, I haue liued here (hauing no more companie but her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> and I being familiar, as being a woman, and watchfull, as being a louer) yet could neuer finde opportunitie to haue one minutes leasure of priuate conference: the cause whereof is as strange, as the effects are to me miserable. And (alas) this it is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12151:32"/>At the first sight that <hi>Basilius</hi> had of me (I thinke <hi>Cupid</hi> hauing headed his arrows with my misfortune) he was striken (taking me to be such as I professe) with great affection towards me, which since is growen to such a doting loue, that (till I was faine to get this place, sometimes to retire vnto freely) I was euen choaked with his tediousnes. You neuer saw fourscore yeares daunce vp and downe more liuely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in a young Louer: now, as fine in his apparell, as if he would make me in loue with a cloake; and verse for verse with the sharpest-witted Louer in <hi>Arcadia.</hi> Doo you not thinke that this is a sallet of woormwood, while mine eyes feede vpon the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosia</hi> of <hi>Philocleas</hi> beauty. But this is not all; no this is not the worst; for he (good man) were easy enough to be dealt with: but (as I thinke) Loue and mischeefe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> made a wager, which should haue most power in me, haue set <hi>Gynecia</hi> also on such a fire towardes me, as will neuer (I feare) be quenched but with my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. For she (being a woman of excellent witte, and of strong working thoughts) whether she suspected me by my ouer-vehement showers of affection to <hi>Philoclea</hi> (which loue forced me vnwisely to vtter, while hope of my maske foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> incouraged me) or that she hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some other marke of me, that I am not a woman: or what deuill it is hath reuealed it vnto her, I know not; but so it is, that all her countenances, words and gestures, are euen miserable portraitures of a desperate affection. Whereby a man may learne, that these auoydings of companie, doo but make the passions more violent, when they meete with fitte subiects. Truely it were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> a notable dumb shew of <hi>Cupids</hi> kingdome, to see my eyes (languishing with ouer-vehement longing) direct themselues to <hi>Philoclea:</hi> and <hi>Basilius</hi> as busie about me as a Bee, and indeed as cumbersome; making such vehement suits to me, who neither could if I would; nor would if I could, helpe him: while the terrible witte of <hi>Gyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> carried with the beere of violent loue, runnes thorow vs all. And so ielious is she <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> of my loue to her daughter, that I could neuer yet beginne to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my mouth to the vneuitable <hi>Philoclea,</hi> but that her vnwished presence gaue my tale a conclusion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had a beginning. And surely if I be not deceiued, I see such shewes of liking, and (if I bee acquainted with passions) of almost a passionate liking in the heauenly <hi>Philoclea,</hi> towardes me, that I may hope her eares would not abhorre my discourse.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> And for good <hi>Basilius,</hi> hee thought it best to haue lodged vs together, but that the eternall hatefulnes of my destinie, made <hi>Gynecias</hi> ielousie stoppe that, and all other my blessings. Yet must I confesse, that one way her loue doth me pleasure: for since it was my foolish fortune, or vnfortunate follie, to bee knowen by her, that keepes her from bewraying mee to <hi>Basilius.</hi> And thus (my <hi>Musidorus</hi>) you haue my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> played vnto you by my selfe, which I pray the gods may not in deede prooue a Tragedie. And there with he ended, making a full point of a hartie sigh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Musidorus</hi> recommended to his best discourse, all which <hi>Pyrocles</hi> had told him. But therein he found such intricatenesse, that he could see no way to lead him out of the maze; yet perceauing his affection so grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, that striuing against it, did rather an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> then heale the wound, and rather call his friendshippe in question, then giue place to any friendly counsell. Well (said he) deare cosin, since it hath pleased the gods to mingle your other excellencies with this humor of loue, yet happie it is, that your loue is imployed vpon so rare a woman: for certainly, a noble cause dooth ease much a grieuous case. But as it stands now, nothing vexeth me, as that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> see wherein I can be seruisable vnto you. I desire no greater seruice of you (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that you remayn secretly in this country, &amp; some-times come to

this place; either late in the night, or early in the morning, where you shall haue my key to enter, bicause as my fortune, eyther amends or empaires. I may declare it vnto you, and haue your counsell and furtheraunce: and hereby I will of purpose leade her, that is the prayse, and yet the staine of all womankinde, that you may haue so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> good a view, as to allowe my iudgement: and as I can get the most conuenient time, I will come vnto you; for though by reason of yonder wood you cannot see the Lodge; it is harde at hande. But now, (sayd she) it is time for me to leaue you, and towardes euening we will walke out of purpose hetherward, therefore keepe your selfe close in that time. But <hi>Musidorus</hi> bethinking him selfe that his horse might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> happen to bewray them, thought it best to returne for that day, to a village not farre of, and dispatching his horse in some sort, the next day early to come a foote thither, and so to keepe that course afterward, which <hi>Pyrocles</hi> very well liked of. Now fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well deere cousin (said he) from me, no more <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> nor <hi>Daiphantus</hi> now, but <hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane: Zelmane</hi> is my name, <hi>Zelmane</hi> is my title, <hi>Zelmane</hi> is the onely hope of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> And with that word going out, and seeing that the coast was cleare, <hi>Zelmane</hi> dismissed <hi>Musidorus,</hi> who departed as full of care to helpe his friend, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was to disswade him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zelmane</hi> returned to the Lodge, where (inflamed by <hi>Philoclea,</hi> watched by <hi>Gynecia,</hi> and tired by <hi>Basilius</hi>) she was like a horse, desirous to runne, and miserablie spurred, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> but so short raind, as he cannot stirre forward: <hi>Zelmane</hi> sought occasion to speake with <hi>Philoclea; Basilius</hi> with <hi>Zelmane</hi>; and <hi>Gynecia</hi> hindered them all. If <hi>Philoclea</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to sigh (and sigh she did often) as if that sigh were to be wayted on, <hi>Zelmane</hi> sighed also; whereto <hi>Basilius</hi> and <hi>Gynecia</hi> soone made vp foure parts of sorrow. Their affection increased their conuersation; and their conuersation increased their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> The respect borne bred due ceremonies; but the affection shined so through them, that the ceremonies seemed not ceremonious. <hi>Zelmanes</hi> eyes were (like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before sweet meate) eager, but fearefull of their ill-pleasing gouernors. Time in one instant, seeming both short, and long vnto them: short, in the pleasingnes of such presence: long, in the stay of their desires.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> But <hi>Zelmane</hi> fayled not to intice them all many times abroad, because she was desirous her friend <hi>Musidorus</hi> (neere whom of purpose she led them) might haue full sight of them. Sometimes angling to a little Riuer neere hand, which for the moisture it bestowed vpon rootes of some flourishing Trees, was rewarded with their shadowe. There would they sit downe, and pretie wagers be made betweene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>
               <hi>Pamela</hi> and <hi>Philoclea,</hi> which could soonest beguile silly fishes; while <hi>Zelmane</hi> prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, that the fit pray for them was hartes of Princes. She also had an angle in her hand; but the taker was so taken, that she had forgotten taking. <hi>Basilius</hi> in the meane time would be the cooke himselfe of what was so caught, and <hi>Gynecia</hi> sit still, but with no still pensifnesse. Now she brought them to see a seeled Doue, who the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> blinder she was, the higher she straue. Another time a Kite, which hauing a gut cunningly pulled out of her, and so let flie, caused all the Kites in that quarter, who (as oftentimes the world is deceaued) thinking her prosperous, when indeede she was wounded, made the poore Kite find, that opinion of riches may well be dangerous.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> But these recreations were interrupted by a delight of more gallant shew; for one euening as <hi>Basilius</hi> returned from hauing forced his thoughts to please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in such small conquests, there came a shepheard, who brought him word that
<pb facs="tcp:12151:33"/>
a Gentleman desired leaue to do a message from his Lord vnto him. <hi>Basilius</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; whereupon the Gentleman came, and after the dutifull ceremonies obserued, in his maisters name tolde him, that he was sent from <hi>Phalantus</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to craue licence, that as he had done in many other courts, so he might in his presence defie all <hi>Arcadian</hi> Knights in the behalfe of his mistres beautie, who would besides, her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> selfe in person be present, to giue euident proofe what his launce should affirme. The conditions of his chalenge were, that the defendant should bring his mistresse picture, which being set by the image of <hi>Artesia</hi> (so was the mistresse of <hi>Phalantus</hi> named) who in sixe courses should haue better of the other, in the iudgement of <hi>Basilius,</hi> with him both the honors and the pictures should remaine. <hi>Basilius</hi> (though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> he had retired himselfe into that solitarie dwelling, with intention to auoid, rather then to accept any matters of drawing company; yet because he would enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Zelmane,</hi> (that she might not thinke the time so gainefull to him, losse to her) graunted him to pitch his tent for three dayes, not farre from the lodge, and to proclayme his chalenge, that what <hi>Arcadian</hi> Knight (for none els but vpon his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> perill was licensed to come) would defende what he honored against <hi>Phalantus,</hi> should haue the like freedome of accesse and returne.</p>
            <p>This obteyned and published, <hi>Zelmane</hi> being desirous to learne what this <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantus</hi> was, hauing neuer knowne him further then by report of his good iusting, in somuch as he was commonly called, The faire man of armes, <hi>Basilius</hi> told her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> that he had had occasion by one very inward with him, to knowe in part the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of his life, which was, that he was bastard-brother to the faire <hi>Helen</hi> Queene of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and deerly esteemed of her for his exceeding good parts, being hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie courteous, and wronglesly valiaunt, considerately pleasant in conuersation, and an excellent courtier without vnfaithfulnes; who (finding his sisters vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> melancholy, thorow the loue of <hi>Amphialus</hi>) had for a time left her court, and gone into <hi>Laconia:</hi> where in the warre against the <hi>Helots,</hi> he had gotten the reputation of one, that both durst and knew. But as it was rather choise then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that led him to matters of armes, so as soone as the spur of honor ceased, he willingly rested in peaceable delightes, being beloued in all companies for his loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> qualities, and (as a man may terme it) winning cherefulnes, whereby to the Prince and Court of <hi>Laconia,</hi> none was more agreable then <hi>Phalantus:</hi> and he not giuen greatly to struggle with his owne disposition, followed the gentle currant of it, hauing a fortune sufficient to content, and he content with a sufficient fortune. But in that court he sawe, and was acquainted with this <hi>Artesia,</hi> whose beautie he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> now defends, became her seruant, sayd himselfe, and perchaunce thought himselfe her louer. But certainly, said <hi>Basilius</hi>) many times it falles out, that these young companions make themselues beleeue they loue at the first liking of a likely beautie; louing, because they will loue for want of other businesse, not because they feele indeed that diuine power, which makes the heart finde a reason in passion: and so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> (God knowes) as inconstantly leaue vpon the next chaunce that beautie castes before them. So therefore taking loue vppon him like a fashion, he courted this Ladie <hi>Artesia,</hi> who was as fit to paie him in his owne monie as might be. For she thinking she did wrong to her beautie if she were not prowde of it, called her disdaine of him chastitie, and placed her honour in little setting by his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> her: determining neuer to marrie, but him, whome she thought worthie of her: and that was one, in whome all worthinesse were harboured. And to this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12151:33"/>
conceipt not only nature had bent her, but the bringing vp she receaued at my sister in lawe <hi>Cecropia,</hi> had confirmed her: who hauing in her widowhood taken this young <hi>Artesia</hi> into her charge; because her Father had bene a deare friend of her dead husbandes, had taught her to thinke that there is no wisdome but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in including both heauen and earth in ones selfe: and that loue, courtesie, grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, friendship, and all other vertues are rather to be taken on, then taken in ones selfe: And so good a disciple she found of her, that liking the fruits of her owne planting, she was content (if so her sonne could haue liked of it) to haue wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed her in mariage to my Nephew <hi>Amphialus.</hi> But I thinke that desire hath lost <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> some of his heate, since she hath knowne, that such a Queene as <hi>Helen</hi> is, doth offer so great a price as a Kingdome, to buie his fauour; for if I be not deceaued in my good sister <hi>Cecr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pia,</hi> she thinks no face so beautifull, as that which lookes vnder a Crowne. But <hi>Artesia</hi> indeede liked well of my Nephew <hi>Amphialus</hi>; for I can neuer deeme that loue, which in hauty harts proceeds of a desire onely to please, and as it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> were, peacock themselues; but yet she hath shewed vehemencie of desire that way, I thinke, because all her desires be vehement, in so much that she hath both placed her only brother (a fine youth called <hi>Ismenus</hi>) to be his squire, and her selfe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to waite vpon my sister, till she may see the vttermost what she may worke in <hi>Amphialus:</hi> who being of a melancholie (though I must say truly courteous and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> noble) mind, seemes to loue nothing lesse then Loue: and of late hauing through some aduenture, or inward miscontentment, withdrawne himselfe from any bodies knowledge, where he is: <hi>Artesia</hi> the easier condiscended to goe to the court of <hi>Laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> whether she was sent for by the Kings wife, to whome she is somewhat allied.</p>
            <p>And there after the war of the <hi>Helots,</hi> this Knight <hi>Phalantus,</hi> (at least for tongue-delight) made him selfe her seruaunt, and she so little caring, as not to showe mislike <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> thereof, was content onely to be noted to haue a notable seruaunt. For truely one in my court neerely acquainted with him, within these few dayes made me a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt description of their loue, while he with cheerefull lookes would speake so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull words, vsing the phrase of his affection in so high a stile, that <hi>Mercurie</hi> would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> not haue wooed <hi>Venus</hi> with more magnificent Eloquence: but els neyther in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, nor action, accusing in himselfe anie great trouble in minde, whether he sped or no. And she of the other side, well finding how little it was, and not caring for more, yet taught him, that often it falleth out but a foolish wittinesse, to speake more then one thinkes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> For she made earnest benefite of his iest, forcing him in respect of his profession, to doo her such seruice, as were both cumbersome and costly vnto him, while he still thought he went beyond her, because his harte did not commit the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. So that lastlie, she (I thinke) hauing in minde to make the fame of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie an oratour for her to <hi>Amphialus,</hi> (perswading her selfe perhaps, that it might fall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> out in him, as it doth in some that haue delightfull meate before them, and haue no stomacke to it, before other folkes prayse it) shee tooke the aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage one daye vppon <hi>Phalantus</hi> vnconscionable praysinges of her, and certaine cast-awaie vowes, howe much hee would doo for her sake, to arrest his woord assoone as it was out of his mouth, and by the vertue thereof to charge him to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> goe with her thorow all the courts of <hi>Greece,</hi> and with the chalenge now made, to giue her beauty the principality ouer all other. <hi>Phalantus</hi> was entrapped, and saw round about him, but could not get out. Exceedingly perplexed he was (as he
<pb facs="tcp:12151:34"/>
confest to him that tolde mee the tale) not for doubt hee had of him selfe (for indeede he had little cause, being accounted, with his Launce especially (whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the challenge is to be tryed) as perfect as any that <hi>Greece</hi> knoweth; but because he feared to offend his sister <hi>Helen,</hi> and withall (as he said) he could not so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue his loue, but that he must thinke in his hart (whatsoeuer his mouth affirmed)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that both she, my daughters, &amp; the faire <hi>Parthenia</hi> (wife to a most noble Gentleman, my wiues neere kinsman) might far better put in their clayme for that prerogatiue. But his promise had bound him prentice, and therefore it was now better with willingnes to purchase thankes, then with a discontented doing to haue the paine, and not the reward: and therefore went on, as his faith, rather then loue, did lead <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> him. And now hath he already passed the courts of <hi>Laconia, Elis, Argos</hi> &amp; <hi>Corinth</hi>: and (as many times it happens) that a good pleader maks a bad cause to preuaile; so hath his Lawnce brought captiues to the triumph of <hi>Artesias</hi> beautie, such, as though <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> be amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the fairest, yet in that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany were to haue the prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: for in those courts many knights (that had bene in other far countries) defended such as they had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> sene, &amp; liked in their trauaile: but their defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce had ben such; as they had forfaited the pictures of their Ladies, to giue a forced false testimonie to <hi>Artesias</hi> excellencie. And now lastly is he come hether where he hath leaue to trye his fortune. But I assure you, if I thought it not in dew and true consideration an iniurious seruice and chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish curtesie, to put the danger of so noble a title in the deciding of such a dangerles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> combat, I would make yong master <hi>Phalantus</hi> know, that your eyes can sharpen a blunt Launce, and that age, which my gray haires (onely gotten by the louing care of others) make seeme more then it is, hath not diminished in me the power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect an vndeniable verity. With that hee bustled vp himselfe, as though his heart would faine haue walked abroad. <hi>Zelmane</hi> with an inwarde smiling gaue him out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> thanks, desiring him to reserue his force for worthier causes. So passing their time according to their woont, they wayted for the comming of <hi>Phalantus,</hi> who the next morning hauing alredy caused his tents to be pitched, neere to a faire tree hard by the Lodge, had vppon the tree made a shield to be hanged vp, which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant should strike, that woulde call him to the mainteyning his challendge. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> 
               <hi>Impresa</hi> in the shield; was a heauen full of starres, with a speech signifiyng, that it was <hi>the beauty which gaue it the praise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Himselfe came in next after a triumphant chariot, made of Carnation veluet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with purle and pearle, wherein <hi>Artesia</hi> sat, drawne by foure winged horses with artificiall flaming mouths, and fiery winges, as if she had newly borrowed them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> of <hi>Phoebus.</hi> Before her marched, two after two, certaine footemen pleasantly attired, who betweene them held one picture after another of them, that by <hi>Phalantus</hi> well running had lost the prize in the race of beauty, and at euery pace they stayed, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the pictures to each side, so leasurely, that with perfect iudgement they might be discerned. The first that came in (following the order of the time wherein they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> had bene wonne) was the picture of <hi>Andromana,</hi> Queene of <hi>Iberia</hi>; whom a <hi>Laconian</hi> Knight hauing sometime (and with speciall fauour) serued, (though some yeares since retourned home) with more gratefulnes then good fortune defended. But therein <hi>Fortune</hi> had borrowed witte; for indeede she was not comparable to <hi>Artesia</hi>; not because she was a good deale elder (for time had not yet beene able to impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> her store thereof) but an exceeding red haire with small eyes, did (like ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions) disgrace the other assembly of most commendable beauties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:12151:34"/>Next after her was borne the counterfaite of the princesse of <hi>Elis,</hi> a Lady that taught the beholders no other point of beauty, but this, that as lyking is, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the child of beauty, so whatsoeuer liketh; is beautyfull; for in that visage there was neither Maiestie, grace, fauour, nor fairenesse; yet she wanted not a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that woulde haue made her fairer then the faire <hi>Artesia.</hi> But he wrote her praises with his helmet in the dust, and left her picture to be as true a witnes of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow, as his running was of her beauty.</p>
            <p>After her was the goodly <hi>Artaxia,</hi> great Q. of <hi>Armenia,</hi> a Lady vpon whom na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bestowed, and well placed her most delightfull coulours; and withall, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> her without any fault, quickly to be discouered by the senses, yet altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seemed not to make vp that harmony, that <hi>Cupid</hi> delights in, the reason whereof might seeme a mannish countenance, which ouerthrew that louely sweetenes, the noblest power of womankinde, farre fitter to preuaile by parley, then by battell.</p>
            <p>Of a farre contrary consideration was the representation of her that next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> which was <hi>Erona</hi> Queene of <hi>Licia,</hi> who though of so browne a haire, as no man should haue iniuried it to haue called it blacke, and that in the mixture of her cheeks the white did so much ouercome the redde (though what was, was very pure) that it came neare to palenes, and that her face was a thought longer then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acte <hi>Symmetrians</hi> perhaps would allow; yet loue plaid his part so well, in euerie part, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> that it caught holde of the iudgement, before it could iudge, making it first loue, and after acknowledge it faire, for there was a certaine delicacie, which in yeelding, conquered; and with a pitifull looke made one finde cause to craue helpe himselfe.</p>
            <p>After her came two Ladies, of noble, but not of royall birth: the former was named <hi>Baccha,</hi> who though very faire, and of a fatnes rather to allure, then to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> yet her brests ouer-familiarly laide open, with a made countenaunce about her mouth, betweene simpring and smyling, her head bowed somewhat downe see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to languish with ouer-much idlenes, and with an inuiting look cast vpwarde; disswaded with too much perswading, while hope might seem to ouerrunne desire.</p>
            <p>The other (whose name was written <hi>Leucippe</hi>) was of a fine daintines of beauty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> her face carying in it a sober simplicitie; like one that could do much good, and ment no hurt, her eyes hauing in them such a cheerefulnes, as nature seemed to smile in them: though her mouth and cheekes obeyed to that prety demurenes which the more one markte, the more one woulde iudge the poore soule apte to beleue; and therefore the more pitie to deceiue her.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Next came the Queene of <hi>Laconia,</hi> one that semed borne in the confines of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties kingdome: for all her lineaments were neither perfect possessioners thereof, nor absolute strangers thereto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but she was a Queene, and therefore beautifull.</p>
            <p>But she that followed, conquered indeed with being conquered; and might wel haue made all the beholders waite vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her triumph, while her selfe were led captiue. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> It was the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly-faire Queene <hi>Helen,</hi> whose Iacinth haire courled by nature, but intercurled by arte (like a fine brooke through golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des) had a rope of faire pearle which now hiding, now hidden by the haire, did as it were play at fast and loose, each with other, mutually giuing &amp; receiuing richnes. In her face so much beauty &amp; fauour expressed, as if <hi>Helen</hi> had not bene knowen, some would rather haue iudged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> it the painters exercise, to shew what he could do, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the conterfaiting of any liuing patterne: for no fault the most fault finding wit could haue found, if it were not, that
<pb facs="tcp:12151:35"/>
to the rest of the body the face was somewhat too little: but that little was such a sparke of beauty, as was able to enflame a world of loue. for euery thing was full of a choyce finenes, that if it wanted any thing in maiestie, it supplied it, with increase, in pleasure; and if at the first it strake not admiration, it rauished with delight. And no indifferent soule there was, which if it could resist fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> subiecting it selfe to make it his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> princesse, that would not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to haue such a playfellow. As for her attire, it was cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and curious, though the look (sixt with more sadnes then it semed nature had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed to any that knew her fortune) bewraied, that as she vsed those ornaments, not for herselfe, but to preuaile with another so she feared, that all would not serue. Of a farre differing (though esteemed equall) beautie, was the faire <hi>Parthenia,</hi> who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> next wayted on <hi>Artesias</hi> triumph, though farre better she might haue sitte in the throne. For in her euery thing was goodly, and stately; yet so, that it might seeme that great-mindednes was but the auncient-bearer to the humblenes. For her great graie eye, which might seeme full of her own beautie:, a large, and exceedingly faire forhead, with all the rest of her face and body, cast in the mould of Noblenes; was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> yet so attired, as might shew, the mistres thought it either not to deserue, or not to neede any exquisite decking, hauing no adorning but cleanlines; and so farre from all arte, that it was full of carelesnesse: vnlesse that carelesnesse it selfe (in spite of it selfe) grewe artificiall. But <hi>Basilius</hi> coulde not abstaine from praising <hi>Parthenia,</hi> as the perfect picture of a womanly vertue, and wiuely faithfulnes: telling withall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> 
               <hi>Zelmane,</hi> how he had vnderstoode, that when in the court of <hi>Laconia,</hi> her picture (maintained by a certaine <hi>Sycionian</hi> Knight) was lost, thorow want, rather of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, then iustice: her husband (the famous <hi>Argalus</hi>) would in a chafe haue gone and redeemed it with a new triall. But shee (more sporting then sorrowing for her vndeserued champion) tolde her husbande, shee desired to bee beautifull in no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> bodies eye but his; and that shee would rather marre her face as euill as euer it was, then that it should be a cause to make <hi>Argalus</hi> put on armour. Then woulde <hi>Basilius</hi> haue tolde <hi>Zelmane</hi> that which she already knew, of the rare triall of that coupled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: but the next picture made their mouthes giue place to their eyes.</p>
            <p>It was of a young mayd, which sate pulling out a thorne out of a Lambes foote,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> with her looke so attentiue vppon it, as if that little foote coulde haue bene the circle of her thoughts, her apparell so poore, as it had nothing but the inside to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne it; a shephooke lying by her with a bottle vpon it. But with all that pouertie, beauty plaid the prince, and commanded as many harts as the greatest Queene there did. Her beautie and her estate made her quicklie to be knowne to be the faire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> shepheardesse, <hi>Vrania,</hi> whom a rich knight called <hi>Lacemon,</hi> farre in loue with her, had vnluckely defended.</p>
            <p>The last of all in place, because last in the time of her being captiue, was <hi>Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> daughter to the King <hi>Plexirtus</hi>: who at the first sight seemed to haue some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling of <hi>Philoclea,</hi> but with more marking (comparing it to the present <hi>Philoclea,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> who indeed had no paragon but her sister) they might see, it was but such a likenesse as an vnperfect glasse doth giue; aunswerable enough in some feitures and colors, but erring in others. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> sighing, turning to <hi>Basilius,</hi> Alas sir (said she) here be some pictures which might better become the tombes of their Mistresses, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the triumphe of <hi>Artesia.</hi> It is true sweetest Lady (saide <hi>Basilius</hi>) some of them bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> dead, and some other captiue: But that hath happened so late, as it may bee the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12151:35"/>
Knightes that defended their beauty, knew not so much: without we will say (as in some harts I know it would fall out) that death it selfe could not blot out the image which loue hath engrauen in them. But diuers besides these (said <hi>Basilius</hi>) hath <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantus</hi> woon, but he leaues the rest, carying onely such, who either for greatnes of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> estate, or of beauty, may iustly glorifie the glory of <hi>Artesias</hi> triumph.</p>
            <p>Thus talked <hi>Basilius</hi> with <hi>Zelmane,</hi> glad to make any matter subiect to speake of, with his mistresse, while <hi>Phalantus</hi> in this pompous maner, brought <hi>Artesia</hi> with her gentlewomen, into one Tent, by which he had another: where they both wayted who would first strike vpon the shielde, while <hi>Basilius</hi> the Iudge appointed sticklers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and troumpets, to whom the other should obey. But non that day appeared, nor the next, till all ready it had consumed halfe his allowance of light; but then there came in a knight, protesting himselfe as contrarie to him in minde, as he was in apparrell. For <hi>Phalantus</hi> was all in white, hauing in his bases, and caparison imbroidered a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing water: at each side whereof hee had nettings cast ouer, in which were diuers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> fishes naturally made, and so pretily, that as the horse stirred, the fishes seemed to striue, and leape in the nette.</p>
            <p>But the other knight by name <hi>Nestor,</hi> by birth an <hi>Arcadian,</hi> &amp; in affection vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the faire Shepherdesse, was all in black, with fire burning both vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his armour and horse. His <hi>impresa</hi> in his shield, was a fire made of Iuniper, with this word, <hi>More <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> easie, and more sweete.</hi> But this hote knight was cooled with a fall, which at the third course he receiued of <hi>Phalantus,</hi> leauing his picture to keepe companie with the other of the same stampe; hee going away remedilesly chafing at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke. The next was <hi>Polycetes,</hi> greatly esteemed in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> for deedes he had done in armes: and much spoken of for the honourable loue he had long borne to <hi>Gyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> which <hi>Basilius</hi> himselfe was content, not onely to suffer, but to be delighted with; he carried it in so honorable and open plainnes, setting to his loue no other marke, then to do her faithfull seruice. But neither her faire picture, nor his faire running, could warrant him from ouerthrow, and her from becomming as then the last of <hi>Artesias</hi> victories: a thing <hi>Gynecias</hi> vertues would little haue recked at another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> time, nor then, if <hi>Zelmane</hi> had not seene it. But her champion went away asmuch discomforted, as discomfited. Then <hi>Telamon</hi> for <hi>Polexena</hi> and <hi>Eurileon</hi> for <hi>Elpine,</hi> and <hi>Leon</hi> for <hi>Zoana</hi>; all braue Knights, all faire Ladies, with their going downe, lifted vp the ballance of his praise for actiuitie, and hers for fairenes.</p>
            <p>Vpon whose losse as the beholders were talking, there comes into the place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> where they ranne, a shepheard stripling (for his height made him more then a boy, and his face would not allow him a man) brown of complexion (whether by nature or by the Suns familiaritie) but very louely with all; for the rest so perfectly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that Nature shewed, shee dooth not like men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> who slubber vp matters of meane account. And well might his proportion be iudged; for he had nothing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> vpon him but a paire of sloppes, and vpon his bodie a Gote-skinne, which hee cast ouer his shoulder doing all things with so pretie a grace, that it seemed ignorance could not make him do a misse, because he had a hart to do well, holding in his right hand a long staffe, &amp; so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming with a looke ful of amiable fiercenes as in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> choller could not take away the sweetnes, hee came towards the king, and making <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> a reuerence (which in him was comely because it was kindly) My liege Lord (said he) I pray you heare a few words; for my heart wil break if I say not my mind to you

I see here the picture of <hi>Vrania,</hi> which (I cannot tell how, nor why) these men when they fall downe, they say is not so faire as yonder gay woman.

            </p>
            <p>And therefore I pray you let me be drest as they be, and my hart giues me, I shall tumble him on the earth: for indeede hee might aswell say, that a Couslip is as white as a Lillie: or els I care not let him come with his great staffe, and I with this in my hand, and you shall see what I can doo to him. <hi>Basilius</hi> sawe it was the fine shepheard <hi>Lalus,</hi> whom once he had afore him in Pastorall sportes, and had greatly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> delighted in his wit full of prety simplicitie, and therefore laughing at his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse, he bad him be content, since hee sawe the pictures of so great Queenes, were faine to follow their champions fortune. But <hi>Lalus</hi> (euen weeping ripe) went among the rest, longing to see some bodie that would reuenge <hi>Vranias</hi> wronge; and praying hartely for euery bodie that ran against <hi>Phalantus,</hi> then beginning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> to feele pouerty, that he could not set him selfe to that triall. But by and by, euen when the Sunne (like a noble harte) began to shew his greatest countenaunce in his lowest estate, there came in a Knight, called <hi>Phebilus,</hi> a Gentleman of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for whom hatefull fortune had borrowed the dart of Loue, to make him mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable by the sight of <hi>Philoclea.</hi> For he had euen from her in fancie loued her, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> was striken by her, before shee was able to knowe what quiuer of arrowes her eyes caried; but he loued and dispaired; and the more hee dispaired, the more hee loued. He sawe his owne vnworthines, and thereby made her excellencie haue more terrible aspect vpon him: he was so secrete therein, as not daring to be open, that to no creature he euer spake of it, but his hart made such silent complaintes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> within it selfe, that while all his senses were attentiue thereto, cunning iudges might perceaue his minde: so that hee was knowne to loue though hee denied, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the better knowne, because hee denied it. His armour and his attire was of a Sea couler, his <hi>Impresa,</hi> the fish called <hi>Sepia,</hi> which being in the nette castes a blacke inke about it selfe, that in the darkenesse thereof it may escape:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> his worde was, <hi>Not so. Philocleas</hi> picture with almost an idolatrous magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence was borne in by him. But straight ielousie was a harbinger for disdaine in <hi>Zelmanes</hi> harte, when shee sawe any (but her selfe) shoulde bee auowed a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for <hi>Philoclea</hi>: in somuch that she wisht his shame, till shee sawe him shamed: for at the second course he was striken quite from out of the saddle, so full of griefe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> and rage withall, that he would faine with the sworde haue reuenged it: but that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the order set downe, <hi>Basilius</hi> would not suffer; so that wishing him selfe in the bottome of the earth, hee went his way, leauing <hi>Zelmane</hi> no lesse angry with his losse, then shee would haue bene with his victory. For if she thought before a riuals prayse would haue angred her, her Ladies disgrace did make her much more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> forget what she then thought, while that passion raigned so much the more, as shee sawe a pretie blush in <hi>Philocleas</hi> cheekes bewray a modest discontentment. But the night commaunded truce for those sportes, and <hi>Phalantus</hi> (though intreated) would not leaue <hi>Artesia,</hi> who in no case would come into the house, hauing (as it were) suckte of <hi>Cecropias</hi> breath a mortall mislike against <hi>Basilius.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But the night measured by the short ell of sleepe, was soone past ouer, and the next morning had giuen the watchfull stars leaue to take their rest, when a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet

summoned <hi>Basilius</hi> to play his iudges parte: which he did, taking his wife and daughters with him; <hi>Zelmane</hi> hauing lockt her doore, so as they would not trouble her for that time: for already there was a Knight in the fielde, readie to proue <hi>Helen</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> had receaued great iniury, both by the erring iudgement of the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenger, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and the vnlucky weakenesse of her former defender. The newe Knight was quickly knowne to be <hi>Clitophon</hi> (<hi>Kalanders</hi> sonne of <hi>Basilius</hi> his sister) by his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which all guilt, was so well handled, that it shewed like a glittering sande and grauell, enterlaced with siluer riuers: his deuice hee had put in the picture of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> which hee defended. It was the <hi>Ermion</hi> with a speach that signified, <hi>Rather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> dead then spotted.</hi> But in that armour since hee had parted from <hi>Helen</hi> (who woulde no longer his companie, finding him to enter into termes of affection,) hee had performed so honourable actions, (still seeking for his two friends by the names of <hi>Palladius</hi> and <hi>Daiphantus,</hi>) that though his face were couered, his being was discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which yet <hi>Basilius</hi> (which had brought him vp in his court) woulde not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> seeme to do; but glad to see triall of him, of whom he had heard very well, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the trumpets to sound; to which the two braue Knights obeying, they performed their courses, breaking their six staues, with so good, both skill in the hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and grace in the maner, that it bred some difficulty in the iudgement. But <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> in the ende gaue sentence against <hi>Clitophon,</hi> because <hi>Phalantus</hi> had broken more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> staues vpon the head and that once <hi>Clitophon</hi> had receiued such a blowe, that hee had lost the raines of his horse, with his head well nie touching the croper of the horse. But <hi>Clitophon</hi> was so angry with the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, (where in he thought he had receiued wrong) that he omitted his duty to his Prince, and vncle; and sodainly went his way still in the quest of them, whom as then he had left by seeking: and so yeelded the field to the next commer.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> who comming in about two houres after, was no lesse marked then all the rest before, because he had nothing worth the marking. For he had neither picture, nor deuice, his armour of as old a fashion (besides the rustie poorenesse,) that it might better seeme a monument of his graundfathers courage: about his middle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> he had in steede of bases, a long cloak of silke, which as vnhandsomely, as it needes must, became the wearer: so that all that lookt on, measured his length on the earth alreadie, since hee had to meete one who had beene victorious of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gallants. But hee went on towardes the shielde, and with a sober grace strake it; but as he let his sworde fall vpon it, another Knight, all in blacke came rustling in, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> who strake the shielde almost assoone as hee, and so strongly, that hee brake the shielde in two: the ill appointed Knight (for so the beholders called him) angrie with that, (as hee accounted,) insolent iniurie to himselfe, hit him such a sound blowe, that they that looked on saide, it well became a rude arme. The other aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him againe in the same case, so that Launces were put to silence, the swords were so busie.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> But <hi>Phalantus</hi> angry of this defacing his shield, came vpon the blacke Knight, and with the pommell of his sworde set fire to his eyes, which presently was reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, not onely by the Blacke, but the ill apparelled Knight, who disdained ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should enter into his quarrell, so as, who euer sawe a matachin daunce to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> fighting, this was a fight that did imitate the matachin: for they being but three that fought, euerie one had two aduersaries, striking him, who strooke the third, and reuenging perhaps that of him, which he had receaued of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12151:37"/>But <hi>Basilius</hi> rising himselfe came to parte them, the sticklers authoritie scarslie able to perswade cholerike hearers; and parte them he did.</p>
            <p>But before he could determine, comes in a fourth, halting on foote, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to <hi>Basilius,</hi> demaunding iustice on the blacke Knight, for hauing by force taken away the picture of <hi>Pamela</hi> from him, whiche in little forme hee ware in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Tablet, and couered with silke had fastened it to his Helmet, purposing for want of a bigger, to paragon the little one with <hi>Artesias</hi> length, not doubting but euen in that little quantitie, the excellencie of that would shine thorowe the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the other: as the smallest starre doth thorow the whole Element of fire. And by the way he had met with this blacke Knight, who had (as hee saide) rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> him of it. The iniurie seemed grieuous, but when it came fully to be examined, it was found, that the halting Knight meeting the other, asking the cause of his going thetherward, and finding it was to defende <hi>Pamelas</hi> diuine beautie against <hi>Artesias,</hi> with a prowde iollitie commaunded him to leaue that quarrell onely for him, who was onely worthy to enter into it. But the blacke Knight obeying no such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> commandements, they fell to such a bickering, that hee gat a halting, and lost his picture. This vnderstoode by <hi>Basilius,</hi> he told him hee was now fitter to looke to his owne bodie, then an others picture: and so (vncomforted therein) sent him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to learne of <hi>AEsculapius</hi> that he was not fit for <hi>Venus.</hi> But then the question ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing who should be the former against <hi>Phalantus,</hi> of the blacke, or the ill apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Knight (who now had gotten the reputation of some sturdy loute, hee had so well defended himselfe) of the one side, was, alleged the hauing a picture which the other wanted: of the other side, the first striking the shield; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion was, that the ill apparelled Knight should haue the precedence, if he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the figure of his mistresse to <hi>Phalantus</hi>; who asking him for it, Certainely (said <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> he) her liueliest picture, (if you could see it) is in my hart, and the best comparison I could make of her, is of the Sunne and of all the other heauenly beauties. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause perhappes all eyes cannot taste the Diuinitie of her beautie, and would rather be dazeled, then taught by the light, if it bee not clowded by some meaner thing; know you then, that I defend that same Ladie, whose image <hi>Phebilus</hi> so feebly lost <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> yesternight, and in steede of an other (if you ouercome mee) you shall haue mee your slaue to carrie that image in your mistresse triumphe. <hi>Phalantus</hi> easilie agreed to the bargaine, which alreadie he made his owne.</p>
            <p>But when it came to the triall, the ill apparelled Knight choosing out the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test staues in all the store, at the first course gaue his head such a remembraunce,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> that he lost almost his remembraunce, he himselfe receyuing the incounter of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantus</hi> without any extraordinarie motion. And at the seconde gaue him such a counterbuffe, that because <hi>Phalantus</hi> was so perfite a horseman, as not to bee driuen from the saddle, the saddle with broken girthes was driuen from the horse: <hi>Phalantus</hi> remaining angrie and amazed, because now being come almost <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to the last of his promised enterprise, that disgrace befell him, which he had neuer before knowne.</p>
            <p>But the victorie being by the iudges giuen, and the trumpets witnessed to the ill by apparelled Knight; <hi>Phalantus</hi> disgrace was ingrieued in lieu of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of <hi>Artesia</hi> who telling him she neuer lookt for other, bad him seeke some other mistresse.

Alas, (said <hi>Musidorus</hi>) what shall I say, who am loth to say, and yet faine would haue said? I find indeed, that all is but lip-wisdome, which wants ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> I now (woe is me) do try what loue can doo. O <hi>Zelmane,</hi> who will resist it, must either haue no wit, or put out his eyes? can any man resist his creation? certainely by loue we are made, and to loue we are made. Beasts only cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne beauty, and let them be in the role of Beasts that doo not honor it. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect friendship <hi>Zelmane</hi> bare him, and the great pitie she (by good triall) had of such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> cases, could not keepe her from smiling at him, remembring how vehemently he had cryed out against the folly of louers. And therefore a litle to punish him, Why how now deere cousin (said she) you that were last day so hie in the Pulpit against louers, are you now become so meane an auditor? Remember that loue is a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and that a worthie mans reason must euer haue the masterhood. I recant, I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> recant (cryed <hi>Musidorus,</hi>) and withall falling downe prostrate, O thou celestiall, or infernall spirit of Loue, or what other heauenly or hellish title thou list to haue (for effects of both I finde in my selfe) haue compassion of me, and let thy glory be as great in pardoning them that be submitted to thee, as in conquering those that were rebellious. No, no saide <hi>Zelmane,</hi> I see you well enough: you make but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> an enterlude of my mishaps, and doo but counterfaite thus, to make me see the deformitie of my passions: but take heede, that this iest do not one day turne to earnest. Now I beseech thee (said <hi>Musidorus</hi> taking her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ast by the hand) euen for the truth of our friendship, of which (if I be not altogether an vnhappy man) thou hast some rememberance, and by those secret flames which (I know) haue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> neerely touched thee; make no iest of that, which hath so ernestly pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me thorow, nor let that be light to thee, which is to me so burdenous, that I am not able to beare it. <hi>Musidorus</hi> both in words and behauiour, did so liuely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer out his inward griefe, that <hi>Zelmane</hi> found indeede, he was thorowly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but there rose a new ielousy in her minde, lest it might be with <hi>Philoclea,</hi> by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> whome, as <hi>Zelmane</hi> thought, in right all hartes and eyes should be inherited. And therefore desirous to be cleered of that doubt, <hi>Musidorus</hi> shortly (as in hast and full of passionate perplexednes,) thus recounted his case vnto her.</p>
            <p>The day (said he) I parted from you, I being in mind to returne to a towne, from whence I came hether, my horse being before tired, would scarce beare me a mile <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> hence: where being benighted, the light of a candle (I saw a good way off) guided me to a young shepheards house, by name <hi>Menalcas,</hi> who seing me to be a straying
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12151:38"/>
stranger, with the right honest hospitalitie which seemes to be harboured in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadian</hi> brests, and though not with curious costlines, yet with cleanly sufficiencie, entertained me: and hauing by talke with him, found the manner of the countrie, something more in particular, then I had by <hi>Kalanders</hi> report, I agreed to soiourne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> with him in secret, which he faithfully promised to obserue. And so hether to your arbour diuers times repaired: and here by your meanes had the sight (O that it had neuer bene so, nay, O that it might euer be so) of the Goddesse, who in a definite compasse can set forth infinite beauty. All this while <hi>Zelmane</hi> was racked with iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie. But he went on, For (saide he) I lying close, and in truth thinking of you, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and saying thus to my selfe, O sweet <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> how art thou bewitched? where is thy vertue? where is the vse of thy reason? how much am I inferior to thee in the state of the mind? And yet know I, that all the heauens cannot bring me to such thraldome. Scarcely, thinke I, had I spoken this word, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ladies came foorth; at which sight, I thinke the very words returned backe againe to strike my soule; at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> least, an vnmeasurable sting I felt in my selfe, that I had spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such words. At which sight? said <hi>Zelmane,</hi> not able to beare him any longer. O (said <hi>Musidorus</hi>) I know your suspition; No, no, banish all such feare, it was, it is, and must be <hi>Pamela:</hi> Then all is safe (sayd <hi>Zelmane</hi>) proceede, deare <hi>Musidorus.</hi> I will not (said he) impute it to my late solitarie life (which yet is prone to affections) nor, to the much thinking of you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>(though that cald the consideration of loue into my mind, which before I euer neglected) nor to the exaltation of <hi>Venus</hi>; nor reuenge of <hi>Cupid</hi>; but euen to her, who is the Planet, nay, the Goddesse, against which, the onely shield must be my Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre. When I first saw her, I was presently striken, and I (like a foolish child, that when any thing hits him, will strike himselfe againe vpon it) would needs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> looke againe; as though I would perswade mine eyes, that they were deceiued. But alas, well haue I found, that Loue to a yeelding hart is a king; but to a resisting, is a tyrant. The more with arguments I shaked the stake, which he had planted in the ground of my harte, the deeper still it sanke into it. But what meane I to speake of the causes of my loue, which is as impossible to describe, as to measure the back-side <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of heauen? Let this word suffice, I loue.</p>
            <p>And that you may know I doo so, it was I that came in black armour to defende her picture, where I was both preuented, and beaten by you. And so, I that waited here to do you seruice, haue now my selfe most need of succor. But whereupon got you your selfe this aparrell? said <hi>Zelmane.</hi> I had forgotten to tell you (said <hi>Musidorus</hi>) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> though that were one principall matter of my speech; so much am I now master of my owne minde. But thus it happened: being returned to <hi>Menalcas</hi> house, full of tormenting desire, after a while faynting vnder the weight, my courage stird vp my wit to seeke for some releefe, before I yeelded to perish. At last this came into my head, that very euening, that I had to no purpose last vsed my horse and armour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> I tolde <hi>Menalcas,</hi> that I was a <hi>Thessalian</hi> Gentle-man, who by mischaunce hauing killed a great fauorit of the Prince of that country, was pursued so cruelly, that in no place, but either by fauour, or corruption, they would obtaine my destruction; and that therefore I was determined (till the fury of my persecutors might be asswaged) to disguise my selfe among the shephards of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and (if it were possible) to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> one of them that were allowed the Princes presence; Because if the woorst should fall, that I were discouered, yet hauing gotten the acquaintance of the Prince, it might happen to moue his hart to protect me. <hi>Menalcas</hi> (being of an honest dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition)
<pb facs="tcp:12151:39"/>
pittied my case, which my face through my inward torment made cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; and so (I giuing him largely for it) let me haue this rayment, instructing me in all the particularities, touching himselfe, or my selfe, which I desired to know: yet not trusting so much to his constancie, as that I would lay my life, and life of my life, vpon it, I hired him to goe into <hi>Thessalia</hi> to a friend of mine, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> deliuer him a letter from me; coniuring him to bring me as speedy an answere as he could, because it imported me greatly to know, whether certaine of my friends did yet possesse any fauour, whose intercessions I might vse for my restitution. He willingly tooke my letter, which being well sealed, indeed conteyned other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For I wrote to my trustie seruant <hi>Calodoulus</hi> (whome you know) that assoone <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> as he had deliuered the letter, he should keepe him prisoner in his house, not suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to haue conference with any body, till he knew my further pleasure: in all other respects that he should vse him as my brother. And thus is <hi>Menalcas</hi> gone, and I here a poore shepheard; more proud of this estate, then of any kingdome: so manifest it is, that the highest point outward things can bring one vnto, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> of the mind: with which, no estate; without which, all estates be mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Now haue I chosen this day, because (as <hi>Menalcas</hi> told me) the other shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards are called to make their sports, and hope that you will with your credite, finde meanes to get me allowed among them. You need not doubt (answered <hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>) but that I will be your good mistresse: marrie the best way of dealing must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> be by <hi>Dametas,</hi> who since his blunt braine hath perceiued some fauour the Prince dooth beare vnto me (as without doubt the most seruile flatterie is lodged most easilie in the grossest capacitie; for their ordinarie conceite draweth a yeelding to their greaters, and then haue they not wit to discerne the right degrees of duetie) is much more seruiceable vnto me, then I can finde any cause to wish him. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> therefore dispaire not to winne him: for euery present occasion will catch his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and his senses are masters of his sillie mind; onely reuerence him, and reward him, and with that bridle and saddle you shall well ride him. O heauen and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But ô Loue, it is thou that doost it: thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> changest name vpon name; thou disguisest our bodies, and disfigurest our mindes. But in deed thou hast reason, for though the wayes be foule, the iourneys end is most faire and honourable.</p>
            <p>No more sweete <hi>Musidorus</hi> (said <hi>Zelmane</hi>) of these philosophies; for here comes the very person of <hi>Dametas.</hi> And so he did in deed, with a sword by his side, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest-bill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> on his neck, and a chopping-knife vnder his girdle: in which well prouided sort he had euer gone, since the feare <hi>Zelmane</hi> had put him in. But he no sooner sawe her, but with head and armes he laid his reuerence afore her; inough to haue made any man forsweare all courtesie. And then in <hi>Basilius</hi> name, he did inuite her to walke downe to the place, where that day they were to haue the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Pastoralles.</p>
            <p>But when he spied <hi>Musidorus</hi> to be none of the shepheards allowed in that place, he would faine haue perswaded himselfe to vtter some anger, but that he durst not; yet muttering, and champing, as though his cudde troubled him; he gaue occasion to <hi>Musidorus</hi> to come neare him, and feine this tale of his owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> life: That he was a younger brother of the shepheard <hi>Menalcas,</hi> by name <hi>Dorus,</hi> sent by his father in his tender age to <hi>Athens,</hi> there to learne some cunning more then

                  </gap>nalcas</hi> (latelie gone thether to fetch him home) was also decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: where (vpon his death) he had charged him to seeke the seruice of <hi>Dametas,</hi> and to be wholy, and euer guyded by him; as one in whose iudgement and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the Prince had singular confidence. For token whereof, he gaue to <hi>Dametas</hi> a good summe of golde in redy coine, which <hi>Menalcas</hi> had bequeathed vnto him, vpon condition he should receiue this poore <hi>Dorus</hi> into his seruice, that his mind and manners might grow the better by his dayly example. <hi>Dametas,</hi> that of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of stile could best conceiue of golden eloquence, being withall tickled by <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidorus</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> prayses, had his brayne so turned, that he became flaue to that, which he, that sued to be his seruant, offered to giue him: yet for countenance sake, he seemed very squeimish, in respect of the charge he had of the Princesse <hi>Pamela.</hi> But such was the secrete operation of the golde, helped with the perswasion of the Amazon <hi>Zelmane,</hi> (who sayde it was pittie so handsome a young man should be any where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> els, then with so good a master) that in the ende he agreed (if that day he behaued himselfe so to the lyking of <hi>Basilius,</hi> as he might be contented) that then he would receiue him into his seruice.</p>
            <p>And thus went they to the Lodge, where they found <hi>Gynecia</hi> and her daughters ready to go to the field, to delight themselues there a while, vntill the shepheards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> comming: whether also taking <hi>Zelmane</hi> with them, as they went, <hi>Dametas</hi> told them of <hi>Dorus,</hi> and desired he might be accepted there that day, in steed of his brother <hi>Menalcas.</hi> As for <hi>Basilius,</hi> he staied behind to bring the shepherds, with whome he meant to confer, to breed the better <hi>Zelmanes</hi> liking (which he onely regarded) while the other beautifull band came to the faire field, appointed for the shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> pastimes. It was indeed a place of delight; for thorow the middest of it, there ran a sweete brooke, which did both hold the eye open with her azure streames, and yet feeke to close the eie with the purling noise it made vpon the pibble stones it ran ouer: the field it selfe being set in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ome places with roses, and in all the rest constantly preseruing a florishing greene; the Roses added such a ruddy shew vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> it, as though the field were bashfull at his owne beautie: about it (as if it had bene to inclose a <hi>Theater</hi>) grew such sort of trees, as eyther excellency of fruit, statelines of grouth, continuall greennes, or poeticall fancies haue made at any time famous. In most part of which there had bene framed by art such pleasant arbors, that (one answering another) they became a gallery aloft from tree to tree almost round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> which below gaue a perfect shadow, a pleasant refuge then from the chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke looke of <hi>Phoebus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this place while <hi>Gynecia</hi> walked hard by them, carying many vnquiet conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about her, the Ladies sate them downe, inquiring diuerse questions of the shepheard <hi>Dorus</hi>; who (keeping his eie still vpon <hi>Pamela</hi>) answered with such a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> trembling voice, and abashed countenance, and oftentimes so far from the matter, that it was some sport to the young Ladies, thinking it want of education, which made him so discountenaunced with vnwoonted presence. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> that saw in him the glasse of her owne miserie, taking the hand of <hi>Philoclea,</hi> and with burning kisses setting it close to her lips (as if it should stand there like a hand in the margine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> of a Booke, to note some saying worthy to be marked) began to speake these words. O Loue, since thou art so changeable in mens estates, how art thou so constant in their torments? when sodainly there came out of a wood a monstrous Lion,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:40"/>
with a she Beare not far from him, of litle lesse fiercenes, which (as they ghest) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene hunted in Forests far off, were by chaunce come thether, where before such beastes had neuer bene seene. Then care, not feare; or feare, not for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, altered some thing the countenances of the two Louers, but so, as any man might perceiue, was rather an assembling of powers, then dismaiednes of courage.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
               <hi>Philoclea</hi> no sooner espied the Lion, but that obeying the commandement of feare, she lept vp, and ran to the lodge-ward, as fast as her delicate legs could carrie her, while <hi>Dorus</hi> drew <hi>Pamela</hi> behind a tree, where she stood quaking like the Partridge, on which the Hawke is euen ready to seaze. But the Lion (seing <hi>Philoclea</hi> run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way) bent his race to her-ward, and was ready to seaze him selfe on the pray, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
               <hi>Zelmane</hi> (to whome daunger then was a cause of dreadlesnes, all the composition of her elements being nothing but fierie) with swiftnesse of desire crost him, and with force of affection strake him such a blow vpon his chine, that she opened all his body: wherewith the valiant beast turning vpon her with open iawes, she gaue him such a thrust thorow his brest, that all the Lion could do, was with his paw to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> teare of the mantle and sleeue of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> with a little scratch, rather then a wound; his death-blow hauing taken away the effect of his force. But there withall he fell downe, and gaue <hi>Zelmane</hi> leasure to take of his head, to carrie it for a present to her Ladie <hi>Philoclea:</hi> who all this while (not knowing what was done behind her) kept on her course, like <hi>Arethusa</hi> when she ran from <hi>Alpheus</hi>; her light apparell being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> carried vp with the winde, that much of those beauties she would at another time haue willingly hidden, was presented to the sight of the twise wounded <hi>Zelmane.</hi> Which made <hi>Zelmane</hi> not folow her ouer hastily, lest she should too soone depriue her selfe of that pleasure: But carying the Lions head in her hand, did not fully ouertake her, till they came to the presence of <hi>Basilius.</hi> Neither were they long <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> there, but that <hi>Gynecia</hi> came thether also: who had bene in such a traunce of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, that <hi>Zelmane</hi> was fighting with the Lion, before she knew of any Lions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: but then affection resisting, and the soone ending of the fight preuenting all extremitie of feare, she marked <hi>Zelmanes</hi> fighting. And when the Lions head was of, as <hi>Zelmane</hi> ran after <hi>Philoclea,</hi> so she could not find in her hart but run after <hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane:</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> so that it was a new sight, Fortune had prepared to those woods, to see these great personages thus runne one after the other: each carried forward with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward violence: <hi>Philoclea</hi> with such feare, that she thought she was still in the Lions mouth: <hi>Zelmane</hi> with an eager and impatient delight; <hi>Gynecia</hi> with wings of Loue, flying she neither knew, nor cared to know whether. But now, being all come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> 
               <hi>Basilius</hi> amazed with this sight, and feare hauing such possession in the faire <hi>Philoclea,</hi> that her bloud durst not yet to come to her face, to take away the name of palenesse from her most pure whitenes, <hi>Zelmane</hi> kneeled downe, and presenting the Lions head vnto her. Only Ladie (said she) here see you the punishment of that vnnaturall beast, which contrary to his owne kind would haue wronged Princes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> bloud, guided with such traiterous eies, as durst rebell against your beauty. Happy am I, and my beautie both (answered the sweete <hi>Philoclea</hi> then blushing, for feare had bequeathed his roome to his kinsman bashfulnes) that you excellent <hi>Amazon,</hi> were there to teach him good manners. And euen thankes to that beautie (answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Zelmane</hi>) which can giue an edge to the bluntest swords.

grace of pitty, she shewed it to her Father and mother: who, as the nurse sometimes with ouer-much kissing may forget to giue the babe sucke, so had they with too much delighting, in beholding and praysing <hi>Zelmane,</hi> left of to marke whether she needed succour. But then they ran both vnto her, like a father &amp; mother to an one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> childe, and (though <hi>Zelmane</hi> assured them it was nothing) would needes see it; <hi>Gynecia</hi> hauing skill in surgery, an arte in those daies much esteemed, because it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to vertuous courage, which euen Ladies would (euer with the contempt of cowardes) seeme to cherish.

            <p>Being all now come together, and all desirous to know each others adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tures, <hi>Pamelas</hi> noble hart would needs gratefully make known the valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mean of her safety which (directing her speach to her mother) she did in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner. As soone (said she) as ye were all runne away, and that I hoped to bee in safetie, there came out of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> same woods a foule horrible Beare, which (fearing belike to deale while the Lion was present, as soone as he was gone) came furiously towardes the place where I was, and this young shepheard left alone by me; I truly (not guilty of any wisedom which since they lay to my charge, because they say, it is the best refuge against that beast, but euen pure feare bringing forth that effect of wisedome) fell downe flat <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> of my face, needing not counterfait being dead for indeed I was litle better. But this yong shepheard with a wonderfull courage hauing no other weapon, but that knife you see standing before the place where I lay, so behaued himselfe that the first
<pb facs="tcp:12151:41"/>
sight I had (when I thought my selfe already neare <hi>Charons</hi> ferry,) was the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard shewing me his bloudy knife in token of victory. I pray you (said <hi>Zelmane,</hi> speaking to <hi>Dorus,</hi> whose valour she was carefull to haue manifested) in what sorte, so ill weaponed, could you atchiue this enterprise? Noble Ladie (saide <hi>Dorus</hi>) the manner of these beastes fighting with any man, is to stande vp vpon their hinder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> feete: and so this did, and being ready to giue me a shrewd imbracement, I thinke, the God <hi>Pan,</hi> (euer carefull of the chiefe blessings of <hi>Arcadia</hi>) guided my hand so iust to the hart of the beast, that neither she could once touch me, nor (which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matter in this worthy remembrance) breed any danger to the Princesse. For my part, I am rather (withall subiected humblenes) to thanke her excellencies, since the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> duety thereunto gaue me harte to saue my selfe, then to receiue thankes for a deede which was her onely inspiring. And this <hi>Dorus</hi> spake, keeping affection as much as he could, backe from comming into his eyes and gestures. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> (that had the same Character in her heart) could easily discipher it, and therefore to keepe him the longer in speach, desired to vnderstand the conclusion of the matter; and how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the honest <hi>Dametas</hi> was escaped. Nay (sayd <hi>Pamela</hi>) none shall take that office from my selfe, being so much bound to him as I am, for my education. And with that word (scorne borrowing the countenance of myrth) somewhat shee smiled, and thus spake on? When (said she) <hi>Dorus</hi> made me assuredly perceiue, that all cause of feare was passed (the truth is) I was ashamed to finde my selfe alone with this shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and therefore looking about me, if I could see any bodie; at length wee both perceiued the gentle <hi>Dametas,</hi> lying with his head and breast as farre as hee could thrust himselfe into a bush, drawing vp his legges as close vnto him as hee coulde: for, like a man of a very kinde nature, soone to take pittie of himselfe, hee was full resolued not to see his owne death. And when this sheephearde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> pushed him, bidding him to be of good cheere; it was a great while, ere we coulde perswade him, that <hi>Dorus</hi> was not the beare: so that he was faine to pull him out by the heeles, and shew him the beast, as deade as he could wish it: which you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me, was a very ioyfull sight vnto him. But then he forgate all courtesie, for he fell vpon the beast, giuing it many a manfull wound: swearing by much, it was not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> well such beasts should be suffered in a common welth. And then my gouernour, as full of ioy, as before of feare came dauncing and singing before as euen now you saw him. Well wel (said <hi>Basilius</hi>) I haue not chosen <hi>Dametas</hi> for his fighting, nor for his discoursing, but for his plainnesse &amp; honestie, &amp; therin I know he wil not deceaue me. But then he told <hi>Pamela</hi> (not so much because she should know it, as because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> he would tell it) the wonderfull act <hi>Zelmane</hi> had perfourmed, which <hi>Gynecia</hi> likewise spake off, both in such extremitie of praising, as was easie to be se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> But before all of them were assembled to begin their sports, there came a fellow, who being out of breath (or seeming so to be for haste) with humble hastines tolde <hi>Basilius,</hi> that his Mistres, the Lady <hi>Cecropia,</hi> had sent him to excuse the mischance of her beastes ranging in that dangerous sort, being happened by the folly of the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; who thinking himselfe able to rule them, had caried them abroad, and so was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> whom yet (if <hi>Basilius</hi> would punish for it) she was readie to deliuer. <hi>Basilius</hi> made no other answere, but that his Mistres if she had any more such beastes, should cause them to be killed: and then hee told his wife and <hi>Zelmane</hi> of it, because they should not feare those woods; as though they harbored such beasts, where the like had neuer bene seene. But <hi>Gynecia</hi> tooke a further conceit of it mistrusting greatly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>
               <hi>Cecropia,</hi> because she had heard much of the diuellish wickednesse of her heart, and that particularly she did her best to bring vp her sonne <hi>Amphialus</hi> (being brothers sonne to <hi>Basilius</hi>) to aspire to the crowne, as next heire male after <hi>Basilius</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saw no reason, but that she might coniecture, it proceeded rather of some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuous practise, than of misfortune.

               <hi>IN these pastorall pastimes a great</hi> number of daies were sent to follow their flying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours, while the cup of poison (which was deepely tasted of this noble companie) had left no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> sinewe of theirs without mortally searching into it; yet neuer manifesting his venomous work, til once, that the night (parting away angry, that she could di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>still no more sleepe into the eies of louers) had no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> sooner giuen place to the breaking out of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning light, and the Sunne bestowed his beames vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tops of the mountaines, but that the woefull <hi>Gynecia</hi> (to whom rest was no ease) had left her loathed lodging, and gotten her selfe into the solitary places those deserts were full of, going vp and downe with such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> vnquiet motions, as a grieued and hopeles minde is wont to bring forth. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered vnto the eies of her iudgement the euils she was like to run into, with ougly infamie waiting vpon them: shee felt the terrors of her owne conscience: shee was guilty of a long exercised vertue, which made this vice the fuller of deformitie. The vttermost of the good she could aspire vnto, was a mortal wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to her vexed spirits: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> and lastly no small part of her euils was, that she was wise to see her euils. In so much, that hauing a great while throwne her countenaunce ghastly about her (as if shee had called all the powers of the world to be witnesse of her wretched estate) at length casting vp her watrie eyes to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, O Sunne (said she) whose vnspotted light directs the steps of mortall mankind, art thou not ashamed to impart the clearnesse of thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> presence to such a dust-creeping worme as I am? O you heauens (which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally keepe the course allotted vnto you) can none of your influences preuaile so much vpon the miserable <hi>Gynecia,</hi> as to make her preserue a course so long imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by her? O deserts, deserts, how fita guest am I for you, since my hart can peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple you with wild rauenous beastes, which in you are wanting? O Vertue, where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> doost thou hide thy selfe? What hideous thinge is this which doeth Eclips thee? Or is it true that thou weart neuer but a vaine name, and no essentiall thing, which hast thus left thy professed seruant, when she had most need of thy louely presence?
<pb facs="tcp:12151:54"/>
O imperfect proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of reason, which can too much foresee, &amp; too little preuent. Alas, alas (said she) if there were but one hope for all my paines, or but one excuse for all my faultinesse. But wretch that I am, my torment is beyond all succour, and my euill deseruing doth exceed my euill fortune. For nothing els did my husband take this straunge resolution to liue so solitarily: for nothing els haue the windes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> deliuered this straunge guest to my country: for nothing els haue the destinies reserued my life to this time, but that onely I (most wretched I) should become a plague to my selfe, and a shame to womankind. Yet if my desire (how vniust so euer it be) might take effect, though a thousand deaths folowed it, and euery death were followed with a thousand shames; yet should not my sepulcher receiue mee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> without some contentment. But alas, though sure I am, that <hi>Zelmane</hi> is such as can answer my loue; yet as sure I am, that this disguising must needs come for some fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipt. And then, wretched <hi>Gynecia,</hi> where canst thou find any small ground plot for hope to dwel vpon? No, no, it is <hi>Philoclea</hi> his hart is sett vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: it is my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I haue borne to supplant me. But if it bee so, the life I haue giuen thee (vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> 
               <hi>Philoclea</hi>) I will sooner with these handes bereaue thee of, then my birth shall glory, she hath bereaued me of my desires. In shame there is no comfort, but to bee beyond all bounds of shame.</p>
            <p>Hauing spoken thus, she began to make a piteous war with hir faire haire, when she might heare (not far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her) an extremely dolefull voice, but so suppressed with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> a kind of whispering note, that she could not conceaue the wordes distinctly. But (as a lamentable tune is the sweetest musicke to a wofull mind) shee drewe thether heere-away, in hope to find some companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her misery. And as she paced on, she was stopped with a number of trees, so thickly placed together, that she was afraide shee should (with rushing thorow) stop the speach of the lamentable partie, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> shee was so desirous to vnderstand. And therefore setting her downe as softlie as she could (for she was now in distaunce to heare) she might first perceaue a Lute excellentlie well played vppon, and then the same dolefull voyce accompanyinge it with these verses.</p>

But as she came into the little Arbour of this sorrowful musicke, her eyes met with the eyes of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> which was the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that thus had indited her selfe of miserie: so that either of them remained co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fused <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> with a sodaine astonishment. <hi>Zelmane</hi> fearing, least she had heard some part of those complaints, which she had risen vp that morning early of purpose, to breath out in secret to her selfe.

Nowe was <hi>Zelmane</hi> brought to an exigent, when the king, turning his eyes that waye thorow the trees, perceiued his wife and mistres togither: so that framing the most louely countenance hee could, hee came straightway towardes them; and at the first word (thanking his wife for hauing entertained <hi>Zelmane,</hi>) desired her shee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> woulde now returne into the lodge, because hee had certaine matters of estate to impart to the Ladie <hi>Zelmane.</hi> The Queene (being nothing troubled with ielousie in that point) obeyed the kinges commaundement; full of raging agonies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately bent, that as she would seeke all louing meanes to winne <hi>Zelmane,</hi> so she woulde stirre vp terrible tragedies, rather then faile of her intent.

               </gap> an ouerthrow giuen to her best resolutions, that euen her bodie (where the fielde was fought) was oppressed withall: making a languishing sickenesse waite vpon the triumph of passion; which the more it preuailed in her, the more it made her ielou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie watchfull, both ouer her daughter, and <hi>Zelmane</hi>; hauing euer one of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> to her owne eyes.</p>
            <p>But as soone as <hi>Basilius</hi> was ridde of his wiues presence, falling downe on his

knees, O Lady (saide hee) which hast onely had the power to stirre vp againe those flames which had so long layne deade in mee; see in mee the power of your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which can make olde age come to aske counsaile of youth; and a Prince <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> vnconquered, to become a slaue to a stranger. And when you see that power of yours, loue that at lest in me, since it is yours, although of me you see nothing to be loued. Worthy Prince (answered <hi>Zelmane,</hi> taking him vp from his kneeling) both your manner, and your speech are so straunge vnto me, as I know not how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere it better then with silence. If silence please you (said the king) it shall neuer displease me, since my heart is wholly pledged to obey you: otherwise if you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> would vouchsafe mine eares such happinesse, as to heare you, they shall conuay your words to such a mind, which is with the humblest degree of reuerence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them. I disdaine not to speake to you (mightie Prince said <hi>Zelmane,</hi>) but I disdaine to speake to any matter which may bring my honor into question. And therewith, with a braue counterfeited scorne she departed from the king; leauing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> him not so sorie for his short answere, as proud in himselfe that he had broken the matter. And thus did the king (feeding his minde with those thoughts) passe great time in writing verses, and making more of himselfe, then he was wont to doo: that with a little helpe, he would haue growne into a prettie kind of dotage.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Zelmane</hi> being ridde of this louing, but little-loued company, Alas (said <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> she) poore <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> was there euer one, but I, that had receiued wrong, and could blame no body? that hauing more then I desire, am still in want of that I woulde? Truly Loue, I must needes say thus much on thy behalfe; thou hast imployed my loue there, where all loue is deserued; and for recompence hast sent me more loue then euer I desired. But what wilt thou doo <hi>Pyrocles?</hi> which way canst thou finde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> to ridde thee of thy intricate troubles? To her whom I would be knowne to, I liue in darkenesse: and to her am reuealed, from whom I would be most secret. What shift shall I finde against the diligent loue of <hi>Basilius?</hi> what shield against the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent passions of <hi>Gynecia?</hi> And if that be done, yet how am I the neerer to quench the fire that consumes me?

            <p>But as sicke folkes, when they are alone, thinke companie would relieue them, and yet hauing company do find it noysome; changing willingly outward obiects, when indeed the euill is inward: So poore <hi>Zelmane</hi> was no more weery of <hi>Basilius,</hi>

Tyred wherewith, she longed to meete her friende <hi>Dorus</hi>; that vpon the shoulders of friendship she might lay the burthen of sorrow: and therefore went toward the other lodge: where among certaine Beeches she found <hi>Dorus,</hi> apparelled in flanen, with a Goats skin cast vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> him, and a garland of Laurell mixt with Cypres leaues on his head, wayting on his master <hi>Dametas,</hi> who at that time was teaching him how with his sheephooke to catch a wanton Lambe, and how with the same to cast a litle clod at any one that strayed out of companie. And while <hi>Dorus</hi> was practising, one might see <hi>Dametas</hi> holding his hand vnder his girdle behind him, nodding from the wast vpwards, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> swearing he neuer knew man go more aukewardly to worke: and that they might talke of booke-learning what they would; but for his part, he neuer saw more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>featie fellowes, then great clearks were.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12151:56"/>But <hi>Zelmanes</hi> comming saued <hi>Dorus</hi> from further chiding. And so she begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to speake with him of the number of his masters sheepe, and which Prouince of <hi>Arcadia</hi> bare the finest wooll, drewe him on to follow her in such countrie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, till (being out of <hi>Dametas</hi> hearing) with such vehemencie of passion, as though her hart would clime into her mouth, to take her tongues office, she decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> vnto him, vpon what briers the roses of her affections grew: how time still see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to forget her, bestowing no one houre of comfort vpon her; she remaining stil in one plight of ill fortune, sauing so much worse, as continuance of euill doth in it selfe increase euill. Alas my <hi>Dorus</hi> (said she) thou seest how long and languishingly the weekes are past ouer vs since our last talking. And yet am I the same, miserable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> I, that I was: onely stronger in longing, and weaker in hoping. Then fell she to so pitifull a declaration of the insupportablenes of her desires, that <hi>Dorus</hi> eares (not able to shew what woundes that discourse gaue vnto them) procured his eyes with teares to giue testimonie, how much they suffered for her suffering: till passion (a most cumbersome guest to it selfe) made <hi>Zelmane</hi> (the sooner to shake it off) ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> intreate <hi>Dorus,</hi> that he also (with like freedome of discourse) would bestow a Mappe of his little world, vpon her; that she might see, whether it were troubled with such vnhabitable climes of colde despaires, and hot rages, as hers was. And so walking vnder a few Palme trees, (which being louing in their own nature, seemed to giue their shadow the willinglier, because they held discourse of loue) <hi>Dorus</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> thus entred to the description of his fortune. Alas (said he) deare Cosin, that it hath pleased the high powers to throw vs to such an estate, as the onely entercourse of our true friendship, must be a bartring of miseries. For my part, I must confesse indeede, that from a huge darkenes of sorrowes, I am crept (I cannot say to a light-somnes, but) to a certaine dawning, or rather, peeping out of some possibilitie of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> comfort: But woe is me, so farre from the marke of my desires, that I rather thinke it such a light, as comes through a small hole to a dungeon, that the miserable cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife may the better remember the light, of which he is depriued: or like a scholler, who is onely come to that degree of knowledge, to finde himselfe vtterly ignorant. But thus stands it with me: After that by your meanes I was exalted to serue in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> yonder blessed lodge, for a while I had, in the furnace of my agonies, this refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing; that (because of the seruice I had done in killing of the Beare) it pleased the Princesse (in whome indeede statelines shines through courtesie) to let fall some gratious looke vpon me. Sometimes to see my exercises, sometimes to heare my songs. For my part, my hart would not suffer me to omit any occasion, whereby I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> might make the incomparable <hi>Pamela,</hi> see how much extraordinarie deuotion I bare to her seruice: and withall, straue to appeare more worthy in her sight; that small desert, ioyned to so great affection, might preuaile something in the wisest Ladie. But too well (alas) I found, that a shepheards seruice was but considered of as from a shepheard, and the acceptation limitted to no further proportion, then of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> a good seruant. And when my countenance had once giuen notice, that there lay affection vnder it, I sawe straight, Maiesty (sitting in the throne of Beautie) drawe foorth such a sword of iust disdaine, that I remayned as a man thunder-striken; not daring, no not able, to behold that power. Now, to make my estate knowen, seemed againe impossible, by reason of the suspitiousnes of <hi>Dametas, Miso,</hi> and my young <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> Mistresse, <hi>Mopsa.</hi> For, <hi>Dametas</hi> (according to the constitution of a dull head) thinkes no better way to shew himselfe wise, then by suspecting euery thing in his way.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:12151:56"/>
Which suspition <hi>Miso</hi> (for the hoggish shrewdnesse of her braine) and <hi>Mopsa</hi> (for a very vnlikely enuie she hath stumbled vpon, against the Princesses vnspeakeable beautie) were very glad to execute. So that I (finding my seruice by this meanes lightlie regarded, my affection despised, and my selfe vnknowen) remayned no ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of desire, then voyd of counsell how to come to my desire. Which (alas) if these trees could speake, they might well witnesse. For, many times haue I stoode here, bewailing my selfe vnto them: many times haue I, leaning to yonder Palme, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the blessednes of it, that it could beare Loue without sence of paine. Many times, when my masters cattle came hether to chewe their cudde, in this fresh place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> I might see the young Bull testifie his loue. But how? with proud lookes, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes. O wretched mankind (said I then to my selfe) in whom wit (which should be the gouerner of his welfare) becomes the traitor to his blessednes. These beasts, like children to nature, inherit her blessings quietly; we, like bastards, are layd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, euen as foundlings to be trayned vp by griefe and sorrow. Their mindes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> grudge not at their bodies comfort, nor their sences are letted from enioying their obiects: we haue the impediments of honor, and the torments of conscience. Truely in such cogi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ations haue I somtimes so long stood, that me thought my feet began to grow into the ground, with such a darkenes and heauines of minde, that I might easilie haue bene perswaded to haue resigned ouer my very essence. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Loue, (which one time layeth burthens, another time giueth wings) when I was at the lowest of my downward thoughts, pulled vp my hart to remember, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is atchieued before it be throughlie attempted; and that lying still doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer goe forward: and that therefore it was time, now or neuer, to sharpen my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, to pearce thorow the hardnes of this enterprise; neuer ceasing to assemble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> all my conceites, one after the other, how to manifest both my mind and estate. Till at last, I lighted and resolued on this way, which yet perchaunce you will thinke was a way rather to hide it. I began to counterfeite the extremest loue towards <hi>Mopsa,</hi> that might be: and as for the loue, so liuely it was indeed within me, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to another subiect) that litle I needed to counterfait any notable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of it: and so making a contrariety the place of my memory, in her fowlnes I beheld <hi>Pamelas</hi> fayrenesse, still looking on <hi>Mopsa,</hi> but thinking on <hi>Pamela</hi>; as if I sawe my Sunne shine in a puddled water: I cryed out of nothing but <hi>Mopsa:</hi> to <hi>Mopsa</hi> my attendance was directed: to <hi>Mopsa</hi> the best fruites I could gather were brought: to <hi>Mopsa</hi> it seemed still that mine eye conueyed my tongue. So that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>
               <hi>Mopsa</hi> was my saying; <hi>Mopsa</hi> was my singing; <hi>Mopsa,</hi> (that is onely suteable in laying a foule complexion vpon a filthy fauour, setting foorth both in sluttishnes) she was the load-starre of my life, she the blessing of mine eyes, she the ouerthrowe of my desires, and yet the recompence of my ouerthrowe; she the sweetnesse of my hart, euen sweetning the death, which her sweetnesse drew vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me. In summe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> what soeuer I thought of <hi>Pamela,</hi> that I saide of <hi>Mopsa</hi>; whereby as I gatte my maisters good-will, who before spited me, fearing lest I should winne the Princesse fauour from him, so did the same make the Princesse the better content to allow me her presence: whether indeede it were, that a certaine sparke of noble indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation did rise in her, not to suffer such a baggage to winne away any thing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> hers, how meanely soeuer she reputed of it; or rather (as I thinke) my words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so passionate; and shooting so quite contrarie from the markes of <hi>Mopsaes</hi> worthinesse, she perceiued well enough, whither they were directed: and therfore
<pb facs="tcp:12151:57"/>
being so masked, she was contented, as a sporte of witte to attend them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one day determining to finde some means to tell (as of a third person) the tale of mine owne loue, and estate, finding <hi>Mopsa</hi> (like a Cuckoo by a Nightingale) alone with <hi>Pamela,</hi> I came in vnto them, and with a face (I am sure) full of clowdy fancies, tooke a harpe, and soong this song.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

            <p>The song being ended, which I had often broken of in the middest with grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous sighes, which ouertooke euery verse I sang, I let fall my harpe from me; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> casting my eye sometime vpon <hi>Mopsa,</hi> but setling my sight principally vpon <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mela,</hi> And is it the onely fortune most bewtifull <hi>Mopsa</hi> (said I) of wretched <hi>Dorus,</hi> that fortune must be the measure of his mind? Am I onely he that because I am in miserie, more miserie must be laid vpon me? must that which should be cause of compassion, become an argument of cruelty against me? Alas excellent <hi>Mopsa,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> consider, that a vertuous Prince requires the life of his meanest subiect, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Sunne disdaines not to giue light to the smallest worme. O <hi>Mopsa, Mopsa,</hi> if my hart could be as manifest to you, as it is vncomfortable to me, I doubt not the height of my thoughts should well counteruaile the lownesse of my qualitie. Who hath not heard of the greatnes of your estate? who seeth not, that your estate is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> much excelled with that sweet vniting of all beauties, which remaineth and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with you? who knowes not, that all these are but ornaments of that diuine sparke within you, which being descended from heauen, could not els-where picke out so sweete a mansion? But if you will knowe what is the bande that ought to knit all these excellencies together, it is a kinde mercyfulnesse to such a one, as is in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> his soule deuoted to those perfections. <hi>Mopsa</hi> (who already had had a certaine smackring towards me) stood all this while with her hand sometimes before her face, but most commonly with a certaine speciall grace of her owne, wagging her lips, and grinning in steede of smiling: but all the words I could get of her, was, wrieng her waste, and thrusting out her chinne, In faith you iest with me: you are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> a merry man indeede. But the euer-pleasing <hi>Pamela</hi> (that well found the Comedie would be marred, if she did not helpe <hi>Mopsa</hi> to her part) was content to vrge a little further of me. Maister <hi>Dorus</hi> (said the faire <hi>Pamela</hi>) me thinks you blame your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune very wrongfully, since the fault is not in Fortune, but in you that cannot frame your selfe to your fortune: and as wrongfully do require <hi>Mopsa</hi> to so great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> a disparagement as to her Fathers seruaunt; since she is not worthy to be loued, that hath not some feeling of her owne worthines. I staied a good while after her
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:12151:57"/>
words, in hope she would haue continued her speech (so great a delight I receaued in hearing her) but seeing her say no further, (with a quaking all ouer my body) I thus answered her. Ladie, most worthie of all dutie, how falles it out that you in whom all vertue shines, will take the patronage of fortune, the onely rebellious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> handmaide against vertue? Especially, since before your eyes, you haue a pittifull spectacle of her wickednesse, a forlorne creature, which must remaine not such as I am, but such as she makes me, since she must be the ballance of worthinesse or disparagement. Yet alas, if the condemned man (euen at his death) haue leaue to speake, let my mortall wound purchase thus much confideration; since the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> perfections are such in the partie I loue, as the feeling of them cannot come into any vnnoble hart; shall that hart, which doth not onely feele them, but hath all the working of his life placed in them, shall that hart I saie, lifted vp to such a height, be counted base? O let not an excellent spirit doo it selfe such wrong, as to thinke, where it is placed, imbraced, and loued; there can be any vnworthinesse, since <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the weakest mist is not easilier driuen away by the Sunne, then that is chased away with so high thoughts. I will not denie (answered the gratious <hi>Pamela</hi>) but that the loue you beare to <hi>Mopsa,</hi> hath brought you to the consideration of her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and that consideration may haue made you the more vertuous, and so the more worthie: But euen that then (you must confesse) you haue receiued of her, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and so are rather gratefully to thanke her, then to presse any further, till you bring something of your owne whereby to claime it. And truely <hi>Dorus,</hi> I must in <hi>Mopsaes</hi> behalfe say thus much to you, that if her beauties haue so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken you, it becomes a true Loue to haue your harte more set vpon her good then your owne, &amp; to beare a tenderer respect to her honour, then your satisfaction. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Now by my hallidame, Madame (said <hi>Mopsa,</hi> throwing a great number of sheeps eyes vpon me) you haue euen touched mine owne minde to the quicke, forsooth. I (finding that the pollicie that I had vsed, had at lest wise procured thus much happinesse vnto me, as that I might euen in my Ladies presence, discouer the sore which had deepely festered within me, and that she could better conceaue my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> reasons applied to <hi>Mopsa,</hi> then she would haue vouchsafed them, whilest her selfe was a partie) thought good to pursue on my good beginning, vsing this fit occasion of <hi>Pamelaes</hi> wit, and <hi>Mopsaes</hi> ignorance. Therefore with an humble pearcing eye, looking vpon <hi>Pamela,</hi> as if I had rather bene condemned by her mouth, then highly exalted by the other, turning my selfe to <hi>Mopsa,</hi> but kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> mine eye where it was, faire <hi>Mopsa</hi> (said I) well doo I finde by the wise knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together of your answere, that any disputation I can vse is asmuch too weake, as I vnworthy. I find my loue shalbe proued no loue, without I leue to loue, being too vnfit a vessell in whom so high thoughts should be engraued. Yet since the Loue I beare you, hath so ioyned it selfe to the best part of my life, as the one can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> not depart, but that th'other will follow, before I seeke to obey you in making my last passage, let me know which is my vnworthines, either of mind, estate, or both? <hi>Mopsa</hi> was about to say, in neither; for her hart I thinke tumbled with ouermuch kindnesse, when <hi>Pamela</hi> with a more fauourable countenance then before (finding how apt I was to fall into despaire) told me, I might therein haue answered my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> selfe; for besides that it was graunted me, that the inward feeling of <hi>Mopsaes</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections had greatly beautified my minde, there was none could denie, but that my minde and bodie deserued great allowance. But <hi>Dorus</hi> (sayd she) you must be
<pb facs="tcp:12151:58"/>
so farre maister of your loue, as to consider, that since the iudgement of the world stands vpon matter of fortune, and that the sexe of womankind of all other is most bound to haue regardfull eie to mens iudgements, it is not for vs to play the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, in seeking out your hidden vertues: since that, which in a wise prince would be counted wisdome, in vs will be taken for a light-grounded affection: so is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> one thing, one, done by diuers persons. There is no man in a burning feuer feeles so great contentment in cold water greedily receiued (which assoone as the drinke ceaseth, the rage reneweth) as poore I found my soule refreshed with her sweetly pronounced words; and newly, and more violently againe enflamed, assoone as she had closed vp her delightfull speech, with no lesse well graced silence. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in my selfe that aswell the Souldier dieth which standeth still, as he that giues the brauest onset: and seeing that to the making vp of my fortune, there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing so much as the making knowne of mine estate, with a face well witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing how deeply my soule was possessed, and with the most submissiue behauior, that a thralled hart could expresse, euen as my words had bene too thicke for my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> mouth, at length spake to this purpose. Alas, most worthy Princesse (said I) and do not then your owne sweet words sufficiently testifie, that there was neuer man could haue a iuster action against filthy fortune, then I, since all other things being granted me, her blindnesse is my onely let? O heauenly God, I would either she had such eyes as were able to discerne my deserts, or I were blind not to see the daily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> cause of my misfortune. But yet (said I) most honoured Lady, if my miserable spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches haue not already cloied you, and that the verie presence of such a wretch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not hatefull in your eyes: let me reply thus much further against my mortall "sentence, by telling you a storie, which happened in this same country long since (for woes make the shortest time seeme long) whereby you shall see that my estate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> is not so contemptible, but that a Prince hath bene content to take the like vpon him, and by that onely hath aspired to enioy a mightie Princesse. <hi>Pamela</hi> gratiously harkened, and I told my tale in this sort.</p>
            <p>In the countrie of <hi>Thessalia,</hi> (alas why name I that accursed country, which brings forth nothing, but matters for tragedies? but name it I must) in <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salia</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> (I say) there was (well may I say, there was) a Prince (no, no Prince, whome bondage wholly possessed; but yet accounted a Prince, and) named <hi>Musidorus.</hi> O <hi>Musidorus, Musidorus</hi>; but to what serue exclamations, where there are no eares to receiue the sound? This <hi>Musidorus,</hi> being yet in the tendrest age, his worthy father paied to nature (with a violent death) her last duties, leauing his childe to the faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> of his friends, and the proofe of time: death gaue him not such pangs as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight-full care he had of his silly successour. And yet if in his foresight he could haue seene so much, happie was that good Prince in his timely departure, which barred him from the knowledge of his sonnes miseries, which his knowledge could neither haue preuented, nor relieued. The young <hi>Musidorus</hi> (being thus,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> as for the first pledge of the destenies good will, depriued of his principall stay) was yet for some yeares after (as if the starres would breath themselues for a greater mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe) lulled vp in as much good luck, as the heedfull loue of his dolefull mother, and the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orishing estate of his country could breed vnto him.</p>
            <p>But when the time now came, that miserie seemed to be ripe for him, because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> he had age to knowe misery, I thinke there was a conspiracy in all heauenly and earthly things, to frame fit occasions to leade him vnto it. His people (to whom all
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12151:58"/>
matters in foretime were odious) beganne to wish in their beloued Prince, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience by trauaile: his deare mother (whose eyes were held open, onely with the ioy of looking vpon him) did now dispense with the comfort of her wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhead life, desiring the same her subiectes did, for the increase of her sonnes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> worthinesse. And hereto did <hi>Musidorus</hi> owne vertue (see how vertue can bee a minister to mischiefe) sufficiently prouoke him: for indeed thus much I must say for him, although the likenesse of our mishaps makes me presume to patterne my selfe vnto him) that well-doing was at that time his scope, from which no faint pleasure could with-hold him. But the present occasion which did knit al this toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> was his vncle the king of <hi>Macedon</hi>; who hauing lately before gotten such victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as were beyond expectation, did at this time send both for the Prince his sonne (brought vp together, to auoid the warres, with <hi>Musidorus</hi>) and for <hi>Musidorus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that his ioy might be the more full, hauing such partakers of it. But alas, to what a sea of miseries my plaintfull toong doth lead me; &amp; thus out of breath, rather with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> that I thought, then that I said, I stayed my speech, til <hi>Pamela</hi> shewing by countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that such was her pleasure, I thus continued it. These two young Princes to satisfie the king, tooke their way by sea, towards <hi>Thrace,</hi> whether they would needs go with a Nauie to succour him: he being at that time before <hi>Bizantium</hi> with a mighty Army beseeging it; wher at that time his court was. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spired heauens had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> this Subiect of their wrath vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so fit a place as the sea was, they streight began to breath out in boystrous winds some part of their malice against him; so that with the losse of al his Nauie, he only with the Prince his cosin, were cast a land, farre off from the place whether their desires would haue guided them. O cruell winds in your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate rages, why either began you this furie, or why did you not end it in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> end? But your cruelty was such, as you would spare his life for many deathfull tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. To tell you what pittiful mishaps fel to the young Prince of <hi>Macedon</hi> his cose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I should too much fill your eares with strange horrors; neither will I stay vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those laborsome aduentures, nor loathsome misaduentures to which, and through which his fortune &amp; courage co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducted him; My speach hastneth it selfe to come to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of <hi>Musidorus</hi> infortunes. For as wee find the most pestilent diseases do gather into themselues all the infirmities with which the body before was annoyed; so did his last misery embrace in the extremitie of it selfe all his former mischiefes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arcadia, Arcadia</hi> was the place prepared to be the stage of his endlesse ouer-throw. <hi>Arcadia</hi> was, (alas wel might I say it is) the charmed circle, wher all his spirits for euer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> should be enchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. For here (&amp; no where els) did his infected eyes make his mind know, what power heauenly beauty hath to throw it down to hellish agonies. Here, here did he see the <hi>Arcadian</hi> Kings eldest daughter in whom he forthwith placed so all his hopes of ioy, and ioyfull parts of his heart, that he left in himselfe nothing, but a maze of longing, and a dungeon of sorrow. But alas what can saying make them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> beleue, whom seeing cannot perswade? Those paines must be felt before they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be vnderstood; no outward vtterance can command a conceipt. Such vvas as then the state of the King, as it vvas no time by direct meanes to seeke her. And such vvas the state of his captiued vvill, as he could delay no time of seeking her.</p>
            <p>In this intangled case, he cloathed himselfe in a shepheards vveede, that vnder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> the basenesse of that forme, he might at lest haue free accesse to feed his eyes vvith that, vvhich should at length eate vp his hart. In vvhich doing, thus much vvithout doubt he hath manifested, that this estate is not alvvayes to be reiected, since vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that vaile there may be hidden things to be esteemed. And if he might vvith
<pb facs="tcp:12151:59"/>
taking on a shepherds looke cast vp his eyes to the fairest Princesse Nature in that time created; the like, nay the same desire of mine neede no more to be disdained, or held for disgracefull. But now alas mine eyes waxe dimme, my toong beginnes to falter, and my hart to want force to helpe, either with the feeling remembrance I haue, in what heape of miseries the caitife Prince lay at this time buried. Pardon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> therefore most excellent Princesse, if I cut off the course of my dolorous tale, since if I be vnderstood, I haue saide enough, for the defence of my basenesse; and for that which after might befal to that patterne of ill fortune, (the matters are too mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous for my capacitie) his hatefull destinies must best declare their owne worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>Thus hauing deliuered my tale in this perplexed manner, to the end the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse might iudge that hee ment himselfe, who spake so feelingly; her aunswere was both strange, and in some respect comfortable. For would you thinke it? shee hath heard heretofore of vs both, by meanes of the valiant Prince <hi>Plangus,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of our casting away: which she (following my owne stile) thus delicately <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> brought foorth. You haue told (said she) <hi>Dorus,</hi> a prettie tale; but you are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the latter end of it. For the prince <hi>Musidorus</hi> with his cosen <hi>Pyrocles</hi> did both perish vpon the coast of <hi>Laconia</hi>; as a noble gentleman, called <hi>Plangus</hi> (who was well acquainted with the historie) did assure my father. O how that speach of hers did poure ioyes in my hart? ô blessed name (thought I) of mine, since thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> hast bene in that toong, and passed through those lips, though I can neuer hope to approch them. As for <hi>Pyrocles</hi> (said I) I will not denie it, but that he is perished: (which I said, least sooner suspition might arise of your being here, then your selfe would haue it) and yet affirmed no lye vnto her, since I onely said, I would not deny it. But for <hi>Musidorus</hi> (said I) I perceiue indeed you haue either heard or read the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> of that vnhappy Prince; for this was the verie obiection, which that peerelesse Princesse did make vnto him, when he sought to appeare such as he was before her wisdome: and thus as I haue read it faire written in the certaintie of my knowledge he might answere her, that indeed the ship wherein he came, by a treason was peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and therefore that <hi>Plangus</hi> might easily be deceaued: but that he himselfe was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> cast vpon the coast of <hi>Laconia,</hi> where hee was taken vp by a couple of shepheardes, who liued in those dayes famous; for that both louing one faire maide, they yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained constant frinds; one of whose songs not long since was song before you by the shepheard <hi>Lamon,</hi> and brought by them to a noble-mans house, neere <hi>Manti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> whose sonne had a little before his mariage, bene taken prisoner, and by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> helpe of this Prince, <hi>Musidorus</hi> (though naming himselfe by an other name) was deliuered. Now these circumlocutions I did vse, because of the one side I knewe the Princesse would knowe well the parties I ment; and of the other, if I should haue named <hi>Strephon, Claius, Kalander,</hi> and <hi>Clitophon,</hi> perhappes it would haue rubd some coniecture into the heauie heade of Mistresse <hi>Mopsa.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore (said I) most diuine Lady, he iustly was thus to argue against such suspitions; that the Prince might easily by those parties be satisfied, that vpon that wrack such a one was taken vp: and therefore that <hi>Plangus</hi> might well erre, who knew not of anies taking vp againe that hee that was so preserued, brought good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens to be one of the two, chiefe of that wracked companie: which two since <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> knew to be <hi>Musidorus</hi> and <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> hee must needes bee one of them, although (as I saide) vpon a foretaken vowe, he was otherwise at that time called. Besides, the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:12151:59"/>
Princesse must needes iudge, that no lesse then a Prince durst vndertake such an enterprise, which (though he might gette the fauour of the Princesse) he conld ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer defend with lesse then a Princes power, against the force of <hi>Arcadia.</hi> Lastly, (saide he) for a certaine demonstration, he presumed to shew vnto the Princesse a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> marke he had on his face, as I might (said I) shew this of my neck to the rare <hi>Mopsa:</hi> and withall, shewed my necke to them both, where (as you know) there is a redde spotte, bearing figure (as they tell me) of a Lyons pawe, that shee may ascertaine her selfe, that I am <hi>Menalcas</hi> brother. And so did he, beseeching her to send some one she might trust, into <hi>Thssalia,</hi> secretly to bee aduertised, whether the age, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the complexion, and particularly that notable signe, did not fully agree with their Prince <hi>Musidorus.</hi> Doo you not know further (saide she, with a setled counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, not accusing any kind of inward motion) of that storie. Alas no, (said I) for euen here the Historiographer stopped, saying, The rest belonged to Astrologie. And therewith, thinking her silent imaginations began to worke vpon somewhat, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> to mollifie them (as the nature of Musick is to do) and withall, to shew what kinde of shepheard I was, I took vp my Harpe, and sang these few verses.</p>
            <q>
               <l>MY sheepe are thoughts, which I both guide and serue:</l>
               <l>Their pasture is faire hilles of fruitlesse Loue:</l>
               <l>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> On barren sweetes they feede, and feeding sterue:</l>
               <l>I waile their lotte, but will not other proue.</l>
               <l>My sheepehooke is wanne hope, which all vpholdes:</l>
               <l>My weedes, Desire, cut out in endlesse foldes.</l>
               <l>What wooll my sheepe shall beare, whiles thus they liue,</l>
               <l>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> In you it is, you must the iudgement giue.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And then, partly to bring <hi>Mopsa</hi> againe to the matter (lest she should too much take heed to our discourses) but principally, if it were possible, to gather some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort out of her answeares, I kneeled downe to the Princesse, and humblie besought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> her to moue <hi>Mopsa</hi> in my behalfe, that she would vnarme her noble hart of that stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resistance against the sweet blowes of Loue: that since all her parts were decked with some particular ornament; her face with beautie, her head with wisdome, her eyes with maiestie, her countenance with gracefulnes, her lippes with louelines, her tongue with victorie; that shee woulde make her hart the throne of pitie, being the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> most excellent rayment of the most excellent part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pamela,</hi> without shew either of fauour or disdaine, either of heeding or neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what I had said, turned her speech to <hi>Mopsa,</hi> and with such a voice and action, as might shewe shee spake of a matter which little did concerne her, Take heede to your selfe (saide shee) <hi>Mopsa,</hi> for your shepheard can speake well: but truely, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> if he doo fully proue himselfe such as he saith, I mean, the honest shepheard <hi>Menal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas</hi> his brother<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and heire I knowe no reason why you shoulde thinke scorne of him. <hi>Mopsa</hi> though (in my conscience) shee were euen then farre spent towards me, yet she answered her, that for all my queint speeches, shee woulde keepe her honestie close inough: And that as for the way of matrimony, shee woulde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> steppe neuer a foote further, till my Maister her father had spoken the whole word him selfe, no shee woulde not. But euer and anon turning her muzzell toward me, shee threwe such a prospect vpon mee, as might well haue giuen a surfet to any

weake louers stomacke. But Lord what a foole am I, to mingle that driuels speeches among my noble thoughts? but because shee was an Actor in this Tragedie, to geue you a full knowledge, and to leaue nothing (that I can remember) vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
            <p>Now the Princesse being about to withdrawe her selfe from vs, I tooke a Iewell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> made in the figure of a Crab-fish, which, because it lookes one way and goes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I thought it did fitly patterne out my looking to <hi>Mopsa,</hi> but bending to <hi>Pamela</hi>: The word about it was, <hi>By force, not choice</hi>; and still kneeling, besought the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse that she would vouchsafe to giue it <hi>Mopsa,</hi> and with the blessednes of her hande to make acceptable vnto her that toye which I had founde, followinge of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> late an acquaintaunce of mine at the plowe. For (said I) as the earth was turned vp, the plowe-share lighted vpon a great stone: we puld that vp, and so found both that, and some other prety thinges which we had deuided betwixt vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mopsa</hi> was benummed with ioy when the Princesse gaue it her: but in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse I could finde no apprehension of what I either said or did, but with a calme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> carelesnesse letting each thing slide, iustly as we doo by their speeches, (who neither in matter nor person doo any way belong vnto vs) which kinde of colde temper, mixt with that lightning of her naturall maiestie, is of all others most terrible vnto me: for yet if I found she contemned mee, I would desperatly labour both in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and vertue to ouercome it; if she onely misdoubted me, I were in heauen; for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> quickly I woulde bring sufficient assurance: lastly, if shee hated me, yet I shoulde know what passion to deale with; and either with infinitenes of desert I woulde take away the fewell from that fire; or if nothing would serue, then I vvould giue her my hart-bloud to quench it. But this cruell quietnes, neither retiring to mislike nor proceeding to fauour; gratious, but gratious still after one manner; all her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> courtesies hauing this engrauen in them, that what is done, is for vertues sake, not for the parties (euer keeping her course like the Sun, who neither for our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, nor curses, will spurre or stoppe his horses). This (I say) heauenlynes of hers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> (for how so euer my miserie is I cannot but so entitle it) is so impossible to reach vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that I almost begin to submitte my selfe to the tyrannie of despaire, not knowing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> any way of perswasion, where wisdome seemes to be vnsensible. I haue appeared to her eyes, like my selfe, by a deuice I vsed with my master, perswading him, that we two might put on certaine rich apparrel I had prouided, and so practise some thing on horsback before <hi>Pamela,</hi> telling him, it was apparel I had gotten for playing well the part of a King in a Tragedie at <hi>Athens</hi>: my horse indeed was it I had left at <hi>Menal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> house, and <hi>Dametas</hi> got one by friendship out of the Princes stable. But how so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer I showe, I am no base bodie, all I doo is but to beate a rocke and get fome.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Dorus</hi> was about to tell further, <hi>Dametas</hi> (who came whistling, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his fingers, how many loade of hay his seuenteen fat oxen eat vp in a yeare)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> desired <hi>Zelmane</hi> from the King that she would come into the lodge, where they stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her. Alas (saide <hi>Dorus,</hi> taking his leaue) the sum is this, that you may well finde you haue beaten your sorrow against such a wall, which with the force of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound may well make your sorrow stronger. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> turning her speach to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metas,</hi> I shall grow (saide shee) skilfull in country matters, if I haue often conference <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> with your seruaunt. In sooth (answered <hi>Dametas</hi> with a gracelesse skorne) the Lad may proue well enough, if hee ouersoon thinke not too well of himselfe, and will
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:12151:60"/>
beare away that hee heareth of his elders. And therewith as they walked to the other lodge, to make <hi>Zelmane</hi> find shee might haue spent her time better with him, he began with a wilde Methode to runne ouer all the art of husbandrie: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally imploying his tongue about well dunging of a fielde: while poore <hi>Zelmane</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> yeelded her eares to those tedious strokes, not warding them so much as with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one answere, till they came to <hi>Basilius,</hi> and <hi>Gynecia,</hi> who attended for her in a coach to carrie her abroad to see some sportes prepared for her. <hi>Basilius,</hi> and <hi>Gyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> sitting in the one ende, placed her at the other, with her left side to <hi>Philoclea. Zelmane</hi> was moued in her minde, to haue kissed their feete for the fauour of so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> blessed a seate: for the narrownesse of the coach made them ioine from the foote to the shoulders very close together; the truer touch whereof though it were bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their enuious apparell, yet as a perfect Magnes, though but in an iuorie boxe will thorow the boxe sende foorth his imbracing vertue to a beloued needle; so this imparadised neighbourhood made <hi>Zelmanes</hi> soule cleaue vnto her, both tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the iuory case of her body, and the apparell which did ouer-clowd it. All the bloud of <hi>Zelmanes</hi> body stirring in her, as wine will do when suger is hastely put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, seeking to sucke the sweetnes of the beloued guest; her hart, like a lion new imprisoned, seeing him that restraines his libertie, before the grate; not panting, but striuing violently (if it had bene possible) to haue leapt into the lappe of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> But <hi>Dametas,</hi> euen then proceeding from being maister of a carte, to bee doctor of a coach, not a little prowd in himselfe, that his whippe at that time gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the rule of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> draue the coach (the couer whereof was made with such ioints, that as they might (to auoid the weather) pull it vp close when they listed, so when they would they might put each ende downe, and remaine as discouered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> and open sighted as on horsebacke) till vpon the side of the forrest they had both greyhounds, spaniels, and hounds: whereof the first might seeme the Lordes, the second the Gentlemen, and the last the Yeomen of dogges; a cast of Merlins there was besides, which flying of a gallant height ouer certaine bushes, woulde beate the birdes (that rose) downe vnto the bushes, as Falcons will doo wilde-foule <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ouer a riuer. But the sporte which for that daie <hi>Basilius</hi> would principallie shewe to <hi>Zelmane,</hi> was the mountie at a Hearne, which getting vp on his wagling winges vvith paine, till he vvas come to some height, (as though the aire next to the earth vvere not fit for his great bodie to flie thorow) vvas now growen to diminish the sight of himselfe, and to giue example to great persons, that the higher they be, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> lesse they should shovv: vvhen a Ierfaulcon vvas cast of after her, vvho streight spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vvhere the pray vvas, fixing her eie vvith desire, and guiding her vving by her eie, vsed no more strength then industry.

            <p>The sweete minded <hi>Philoclea</hi> was in their degree of wel doing, to whom the not knowing of euill serueth for a ground of vertue, and hold their inward powers in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> better forme with an vnspotted simplicitie, then many, who rather cunningly seeke to know what goodnes is, then willingly take into themselues the following of it. But as that sweet and simple breath of heauenly goodnesse, is the easier to bee alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, because it hath not passed through the worldlie wickednesse, nor feelingly found the euill, that euill caries with it; so now the Ladie <hi>Philoclea</hi> (whose eyes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> senses had receaued nothing, but according as the naturall course of each thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; whose tender youth had obediently liued vnder her parents behests, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out framing out of her owne will the fore-chosing of any thing) when now shee came to appoint, wherein her iudgement was to be practized, in knowing faultines by his first tokens, she was like a yong faune, who comming in the wind of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> doth not know whether it be a thing or no to bee eschewed; whereof at this time she began to get a costly experience. For after that <hi>Zelmane</hi> had a while liued in the lodge with her, and that her onely being a noble straunger had bred a kind of heedfull attention; her comming to that lonely place (where she had no body but her parents) a willingnes of conuersation; her wit &amp; behauiour, a liking and silent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> admiration; at length the excellency of her naturall gifts, ioined with the extreme shewes she made of most deuout honouring <hi>Philoclea,</hi> (carying thus in one person
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12151:61"/>
the only two bands of good will, louelines and louingnes) brought forth in her hart a yeelding to a most friendly affection; which when it had gotten so full pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the keies of her mind, that it would receaue no message from her senses, without that affection were the interpreter; then streight grew an exceeding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> still to be with her, with an vnmeasurable liking of all that <hi>Zelmane</hi> did: matters being so turned in her, that where at first, liking her manners did breed good-will, now good-will became the chiefe cause of liking her manners: so that within a while <hi>Zelmane</hi> was not prized for her demeanure, but the demeanure was prized because it was <hi>Zelmanes.</hi> Then followed that most naturall effect of conforming <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ones selfe to that, which she did like, and not onely wishing to be her selfe such an other in all things, but to ground an imitation vpon so much an esteemed authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: so that the next degree was to marke all <hi>Zelmanes</hi> dooings, speeches, and fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to take them into her selfe, as a patterne of worthie proceeding. Which when once it was enacted, not onely by the comminaltie of Passions, but agreed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> vnto by her most noble Thoughts, and that by Reason it selfe (not yet experienced in the issues of such matters) had granted his royall assent; then Friendship (a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent officer) tooke care to see the statute thorowly obserued. Then grew on that not onely she did imitate the sobernes of her countenance, the gracefulnesse of her speech, but euen their particular gestures: so that as <hi>Zelmane</hi> did often eye her, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> she would often eye <hi>Zelmane</hi>; and as <hi>Zelmanes</hi> eyes would deliuer a submissiue, but vehement desire in their looke, she, though as yet she had not the desire in her, yet should her eyes answere in like pearcing kindnesse of a looke. <hi>Zelmane</hi> as much as <hi>Gynecias</hi> iealousie would suffer, desired to be neere <hi>Philoclea; Philoclea,</hi> as much as <hi>Gynecias</hi> iealousie would suffer, desired to be neere <hi>Zelmane.</hi> If <hi>Zelmane</hi> tooke her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> hand, and softly strained it, she also (thinking the knots of friendship ought to be mutuall) would (with a sweete fastnes) shew she was loth to part from it. And if <hi>Zelmane</hi> sighed, she would sigh also; when <hi>Zelmane</hi> was sad, she deemed it wisdome, and therefore she would be sad too. <hi>Zelmanes</hi> languishing countenance with crost armes, and sometimes cast-vp eyes, she thought to haue an excellent grace: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> therefore she also willingly put on the same countenance: till at the last (poore soule, ere she were aware) she accepted not onely the badge, but the seruice; not only the signe, but the passion signified. For whether it were, that her wit in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance did finde, that <hi>Zelmanes</hi> friendship was full of impatient desire, hauing more then ordinarie limits, and therfore she was content to second <hi>Zelmane,</hi> though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> her selfe knew not the limits; or that in truth, true-loue (well considered) haue an infectiue power. At last she fell in acquaintance with loues harbinger, wishing. First she would wish, that they two might liue all their liues together, like two of <hi>Dianas</hi> Nimphes. But that wish, she thought not sufficient, because she knew, there would be more Nimphes besides them, who also would haue their part in <hi>Zelmane.</hi> Then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> would she wish, that she were her sister, that such a naturall band might make her more speciall to her. But against that, she considered, that though being her sister, if she happened to be married, she should be robbed of her. Then growne bolder, she would wish either her selfe, or <hi>Zelmane</hi> a man, that there might succeed a blessed marriage betwixt them. But when that wish had once displaied his ensigne in her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> minde, then followed whole squadrons of longings, that so it might be, with a maine battaile of mislikings, and repynings against their creation, that so it was not. Then dreames by night began to bring more vnto her, then she durst wish by day,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:62"/>
where-out making did make her know her selfe the better by the image of those fancies. But as some diseases when they are easie to be cured, they are hard to be knowne, but when they grow easie to be knowne, they are almost impossible to be cured: so the sweete <hi>Philoclea,</hi> while she might preuent it, she did not feele it, now she felt it, when it was past preuenting; like a riuer, no rampiers being built against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> it, till alreadie it haue ouerflowed. For now indeed, Loue puld off his maske, and shewed his face vnto her, and told her plainly, that shee was his prisoner. Then nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded she no more paint her face with passions; for passions shone thorow her face; Then her rosie coulor was often encreased with extraordinarie blushing: and so another time, perfect whitnesse descended to a degree of palenesse; now hot, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> cold, desiring she knewe not what, nor how, if she knew what. Then her minde (though too late) by the smart was brought to thinke of the disease, and her owne proofe taught her to know her mothers minde; which (as no error giues so strong assault, as that which comes armed in the authoritie of a parent) so greatly forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her desires, to see, that her mother had the like desires. And the more iealous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> her mother was, the more she thought the Iewell precious, which was with so many lookes garded. But that preuailing so farre, as to keepe the two louers from priuate conference, then began she to feele the sweetnesse of a louers solitarinesse, when freely with words and gestures, as if <hi>Zelmane</hi> were present, shee might giue passage to her thoughts, and so as it were vtter out some smoke of those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> flames, wherewith else she was not only burned, but smothered. As this night, that going from the one lodge to the other by her mothers commandement, with dolefull gestures and vncertaine paces, shee did willingly accept the times offer, to be a while alone: so that going a little aside into the wood; where manie times before she had delighted to walke, her eyes were saluted with a tuft of trees, so close <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> set together, as with the shade the moone gaue thorow it, it might breede a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full kinde of deuotion to looke vpon it. But true thoughts of loue banished all vaine fancie of superstition. Full well she did both remember and like the place; for there had she often with their shade beguiled <hi>Phoebus</hi> of looking vpon her: There had she enioyed her selfe often, while she was mistresse of her selfe, and had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> no other thoughts, but such as might arise out of quiet senses.</p>
            <p>But the principall cause that inuited her remembrance, was a goodly white marble stone, that should seeme had bene dedicated in ancient time to the <hi>Siluan</hi> gods: which she finding there a fewe dayes before <hi>Zelmanes</hi> comming, had written these words vpon it, as a testimonie of her mind, against the suspition her captiuitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> made her thinke she liued in. The writing was this.</p>

At length with a whispring note to her selfe; O me vnfortunate wretch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>(said she) what poysonous heates be these, which thus torment me?

her sight and the moone, O <hi>Diana</hi> (said she) I would either the cloud that now hides the light of my vertue would as easily passe away, as you will quickly ouercome this let; or els that you were for euer thus darkned, to serue for an excuse of my outragious folly. Then looking to the starres, which had perfitly as then beautified the cleere skie: My parents (said she) haue told me, that in these faire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> heauenly bodies, there are great hidden deities, which haue their working in the ebbing and flowing of our estates. If it be so, then (O you Stars) iudge rightly of me, and if I haue with wicked intent made my selfe a pray to fancie, or if by any idle lustes I framed my hart fit for such an impression, then let this plague dayly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in me, till my name be made odious to womankind. But if extreame and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> violence haue oppressed me, who will euer do any of you sacrifice (ô you Starres) if you do not succour me. No, no, you will not help me. No, no, you can not help me: Sinne must be the mother, and shame the daughter of my affection. And yet are these but childish obiections (simple <hi>Philoclea</hi>) it is the impossibilitie that dooth torment me: for, vnlawfull desires are punished after the effect of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> but vnpossible desires are punished in the desire it selfe. O then, ô tenne times vnhappie that I am, since where in all other hope kindleth loue; in me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire should be the bellowes of my affection: and of all despaires the most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which is drawen from impossibilitie. The most couetous man longs not to get riches out of a ground which neuer can beare any thing; Why? because it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> impossible. The most ambitious wight vexeth not his wits to clime into heauen; Why? because it is impossible. Alas then, ô Loue, why doost thou in thy beautifull sampler set such a worke for my Desire to take out, which is as much impossible? And yet alas, why doo I thus condemne my Fortune, before I heare what she can say for her selfe? What doo I, sillie wench, knowe what Loue hath prepared for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> mee? Doo I not see my mother, as well, at lest as furiouslie as my selfe, loue <hi>Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne?</hi> And should I be wiser then my mother? Either she sees a possibilitie in that which I thinke impossible, or els impossible loues neede not misbecome me. And doo I not see <hi>Zelmane</hi> (who doth not thinke a thought which is not first wayed by wisdome and vertue) doth not she vouchsafe to loue me with like ardour? I see it,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> her eyes depose it to be true; what then? and if she can loue poore me, shall I thinke scorne to loue such a woman as <hi>Zelmane?</hi> Away then all vaine examinations of why and how. Thou louest me, excellent <hi>Zelmane,</hi> and I loue thee: and with that, embrasing the very ground whereon she lay, she said to her selfe (for euen to her selfe she was ashamed to speake it out in words) O my <hi>Zelmane,</hi> gouerne and direct <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> me: for I am wholy giuen ouer vnto thee.</p>
            <p>In this depth of muzes, and diuers sorts of discourses, would she rauingly haue remained, but that <hi>Dametas</hi> and <hi>Miso</hi> (who were round about to seeke her, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing she was to come to their lodge that night) came hard by her; <hi>Dametas</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That he would not deale in other bodies matters; but for his part, he did not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> like that maides should once stirre out of their fathers houses, but if it were to milke a cow, or saue a chicken from a kites foot, or some such other matter of importance.

as her sister, to serue her selfe) she went alone vp to <hi>Pamelas</hi> chamber: where mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to delight her eies, and ioy her thoughts with the sweet conuersation of her beloued sister, she found her (though it were in the time that the wings of night doth blow sleep most willingly into mortall creatures) sitting in a chaire, lying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> backward, with her head almost ouer the back of it, and looking vpon a wax-candle which burnt before her; in one hand holding a letter, in the other her hand-ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, which had lately dronke vp the teares of her eyes, leauing in steed of them, crimsen circles, like redde flakes in the element, when the weather is hottest.

Do you loue your sorrowe so well, as to grudge me part of it? Or doo you thinke I shall not loue a sad <hi>Pamela,</hi> so well as a ioyfull? Or be my eares vnworthie, or my tongue suspected? What is it (my sister) that you should conceale from your sister, yea and seruant <hi>Philoclea?</hi> These words wanne no further of <hi>Pamela,</hi> but that telling her they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> might talke better as they lay together, they impouerished their cloathes to inrich their bed, which for that night might well scorne the shrine of <hi>Venus:</hi> and there cherishing one another with deare, though chaste embracements; with sweet, though cold kisses; it might seeme that Loue was come to play him there without darte; or that weerie of his owne fires, he was there to refresh himselfe betweene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> their sweete-breathing lippes. But <hi>Philoclea</hi> earnestly againe intreated <hi>Pamela</hi> to open her griefe; who (drawing the curtaine, that the candle might not complaine of her blushing) was ready to speake: but the breath almost formed into words, was againe stopt by her, and turned into sighes. But at last, I pray you (said she) sweete <hi>Philoclea,</hi> let vs talke of some other thing: and tell me whether you did euer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> see any thing so amended as our Pastorall sports be, since that <hi>Dorus</hi> came hether? O Loue, how farre thou seest with blind eyes? <hi>Philoclea</hi> had straight found her, and therefore to draw out more, In deed (said she) I haue often wondred to my selfe how such excellencies could be in so meane a person; but belike Fortune was afraide to lay her treasures, where they should be staind with so many perfections: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> onely I maruaile how he can frame himselfe to hide so rare giftes vnder such a block as <hi>Dametas.</hi> Ah (said <hi>Pamela</hi>) if you knew the cause: but no more doo I neither; and to say the trueth: but Lord, how are we falne to talke of this fellow? and yet indeed if you were sometimes with me to marke him, while <hi>Dametas</hi> reades his rusticke lecture vnto him (how to feede his beastes before noone, where to shade <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> them in the extreame heate, how to make the manger hansome for his oxen, when to vse the goade, and when the voice: giuing him rules of a heardman, though he pretend to make him a shepheard) to see all the while with what a grace (which seemes to set a crowne vpon his base estate) he can descend to those poore matters, certainly you would: but to what serues this? no doubt we were better sleepe then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> talke of these idle matters. Ah my <hi>Pamela</hi> (said <hi>Philoclea</hi>) I haue caught you, the constancy of your wit was not wont to bring forth such disiointed speeches: you loue, dissemble no further.

adoo should, if my hart could haue thought those words suteable for my mouth. But indeed (my <hi>Philoclea</hi>) take heed: for I thinke Vertue it selfe is no armour of proofe against affection.

But then <hi>Pamela</hi> being once set in the streame of her loue, went away amaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> withall, telling her how his noble qualities had drawne her liking towardes him; but yet euer waying his meanenes, and so held continually in due limits; till see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many meanes to speake with her, and euer kept from it (as well because she shund it, seing and disdaining his mind, as because of her iealous iaylours) he had at length vsed the finest pollicie that might be in counterfaiting loue to <hi>Mopsa,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> saying to <hi>Mopsa</hi> what soeuer he would haue her know: and in how passionate manner he had told his owne tale in a third person, making poore <hi>Mopsa</hi> beleeue, that it was a matter fallen out many ages before. And in the end, because you shall know my teares come not, neither of repentance nor misery, who thinke you, is my <hi>Dorus</hi> fallen out to be? euen the Prince <hi>Musidorus,</hi> famous ouer all <hi>Asia,</hi> for his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> heroicall enterprises, of whom you remember how much good the straunger <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> told my father; he not being drowned (as <hi>Plangus</hi> thought) though his cousin <hi>Pyrocles</hi> indeed perished. Ah my sister, if you had heard his words, or seene his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, when he made me know what, and to whom his loue was, you would haue matched in your selfe (those two rarely matched together) pittie and delight. Tell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> me dear sister (for the Gods are my witnesses I desire to do vertuously) can I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the detestable staine of vngratefulnesse abstaine from louing him, who (far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the beautifulnesse of his shape with the beautifulnesse of his minde, and the greatnesse of his estate with the greatnesse of his actes) is content so to abase him selfe, as to become <hi>Dametas</hi> seruaunt for my sake? you will say, but how know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> I him to be <hi>Musidorus,</hi> since the handmaid of wisdome is slow beliefe? That consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration did not want in me: for the nature of desire it selfe is no easier to receiue beliefe, then it is hard to ground beliefe. For as desire is glad to embrace the first shew of comfort, so is desire desirous of perfect assurance: and that haue I had of him, not onely by necessary arguments to any of common sense, but by sufficient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> demonstrations. Lastly he would haue me send to <hi>Thessalia:</hi> but truly I am not as now in mind to do my honorable Loue so much wrong, as so far to suspect him: yet poore soule knowes he no other, but that I doo both suspect, neglect, yea and detest him. For euery day he finds one way or other to set forth himselfe vnto me, but all are rewarded with like coldnesse of acceptation.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>
            </p>
            <p>A few daies since, he and <hi>Dametas</hi> had furnished themselues very richly to run at the ring before me. O how mad a sight it was to see <hi>Dametas,</hi> like rich Tissew furd with lambe-skins? But ô how well it did with <hi>Dorus,</hi> to see with what a grace hee presented himselfe before me on horseback, making maiestie wait vpon humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? how at the first, standing still with his eies bent vpon me, as though his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> were chained to my looke, he so staid till I caused <hi>Mopsa</hi> bid him do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his horse: which no sooner said, but (with a kinde rather of quick gesture, then shew of violence) you might see him come towards me, beating the ground in so due time, as no dancer can obserue better measure. If you remember the ship we saw once, when the Sea went hie vpon the coast of <hi>Argos</hi>; so went the beast: But he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> (as if Centaurlike he had bene one peece with the horse) was no more moued, then one is with the going of his owne legs: and in effect so did he command him, as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:12151:64"/>
his owne limmes: for though he had both spurres and wand, they seemed rather markes of soueraintie, then instruments of punishment; his hande and legge (with most pleasing grace) commanding without threatning, and rather remembring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chastising, at lest if sometimes he did, it was so stollen, as neither our eies could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> it, nor the horse with any change did complaine of it: he euer going so iust with the horse, either foorth right, or turning, that it seemed as he borrowed the horses body, so he lent the horse his minde: in the turning one might perceiue the bridle-hande something gently stirre, but indeede so gently, as it did rather distill vertue, then vse violence. Him selfe (which mee thinkes is straunge) shewing at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> one instant both steadines and nimblenes; sometimes making him turne close to the grounde, like a cat, when scratchingly she wheeles about after a mouse: somtimes with a little more rising before, now like a Rauen leaping from ridge to ridge, then like one of <hi>Dametas</hi> kiddes bounde ouer the hillockes: and all so done, as neither the lusty kinde shewed any roughnesse, nor the easier any idlenesse: but still like a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> well obeyed maister, whose becke is enough for a discipline, euer concluding each thing hee did with his face to me-wardes, as if thence came not onely the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but ending of his motions. The sport was to se <hi>Dametas,</hi> how he was tost from the saddle to the mane of the horse, and thence to the grounde, giuing his gay apparell almost as foule an outside, as it had an inside. But as before hee had euer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> saide, he wanted but horse and apparell to be as braue a courtier as the best, so now brused with proofe, he proclaimed it a folly for a man of wisedome, to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnder the tuition of a beast; so as <hi>Dorus</hi> was faine alone to take the Ringe. Wherein truely at lest my womanishe eies could not discerne, but that taking his staffe from his thigh, the descending it a little downe, the getting of it vp into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> the rest, the letting of the pointe fall, and taking the Ring was but all one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at lest (if they were diuers motions) they did so stealinglie slippe one into another, as the latter parte was euer in hande, before the eie coulde discerne the former was ended. Indeede <hi>Dametas</hi> found fault that he shewed no more strength in shaking of his staffe: but to my conceite the fine cleenes of bearing it was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> delightfull.</p>
            <p>But how delightfull soeuer it was, my delight might well be in my soule, but it neuer went to looke out of the window to doo him any comfort. But how much more I founde reason to like him, the more I set all the strength of minde to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it, or at lest to conceale it. Indeed I must confesse, that as some Phisitions haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> tolde me, that when one is colde outwardly, he is not inwardly; so truely the colde ashes laid vpon my fire, did not take the nature of fire fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. Ful often hath my brest swollen with keeping my sighes imprisoned; full often haue the teares, I draue backe from mine eies, turned backe to drown my hart. But alas what did that helpe poore <hi>Dorus?</hi> whose eies (being his diligent intelligencers) could carrie vnto him no other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> newes, but disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable. I thinke no day past, but by some one inuention he would appeare vnto me to testifie his loue. One time he daunced the Matachine daunce in armour (O with what a gracefull dexterity?) I thinke to make me see, that he had bin brought vp in such exercises: an other time he perswaded his maister (to make my time seeme shorter) in manner of a Dialogue, to play <hi>Priamus</hi> while he plaide <hi>Paris.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> Think (swet <hi>Philoclea</hi>) what a <hi>Priamus</hi> we had: but truly, my <hi>Paris</hi> was a <hi>Paris,</hi> &amp; more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a <hi>Paris</hi>: who while in a sauage apparell, with naked necke, armes, &amp; legs, he made loue to <hi>Oenone,</hi> you might wel see by his chaunged countenaunce, and true teares,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:65"/>
that he felte the parte he playde. Tell mee (sweete <hi>Philoclea,</hi>) did you euer see such a shephearde? tell mee, did you euer heare of such a Prince? And then tell me, if a small or vnworthy assaulte haue conquered mee. Truely I woulde hate my life, if I thought vanity led me. But since my parentes deale so cruelly with mee, it is time for me to trust something to my owne iudgement. Yet hetherto haue my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> lookes beene as I told you, which continuing after many of these his fruiteles trials, haue wrought such change in him, as I tel you true (with that word she laid her ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon her quaking side) I do not a little feare him. See what a letter this is (then drew she the curtaine and tooke the letter from vnder the pillowe) which to day (with an afflicted humblenes) he deliuered me, pretending before <hi>Mopsa,</hi> that I should read <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> it vnto her, to mollifie (forsooth) her iron stomacke; with that she read the letter containing thus much.</p>
            <p>MOst blessed paper, which shalt kisse that ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, where to all blessednes is in nature a seruant, do not yet disdaine to cary with thee the woful words of a miser now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> despairing: neither be afraide to appeare before her, bearing the base title of the sender. For no sooner shall that diuine hande touch thee, but that thy basenesse shall be turned to moste hie preferment. Therefore mourne boldly my Inke; for while she lookes vppon you, your blackenes will shine: cry out boldly my Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for while she reads you, your cries will be musicke. Say then (O happie mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> of a most vnhappy message) that the too soone borne, and too late dying cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, which dares not speake, no not looke, no not scarcely thinke (as from his miserable selfe, vnto her heauenly highnesse) onely presumes to desire thee (in the time that her eies and voice doe exalt thee) to say, and in this manner to say, not from him, O no, that were not fitte, but of him. Thus much vnto her sacred iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> O you, the onely honour to women, to men the onelie admiration, you that being armed by Loue, defie him that armed you, in this high estate wherein you haue placed mee, yet let me remember him to whom I am bound for bringing me to your presence; and let me remember him, who (since he is yours, how mean so euer he be) it is reason you haue an accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of him.

But he dieth: it is most true, he dieth; and he in whom you liue, to obey you, dieth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of though he plaine, he doth not complaine: for it is a harme, but no wrong, which he hath receiued. He dies, because in wofull language all his senses tell him, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> such is your pleasure: for since you will not that he liue, alas, alas, what followeth, what followeth of the most ruined <hi>Dorus,</hi> but his ende?

            <p>O my <hi>Philoclea,</hi> is hee a person to write these wordes? and are these words <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> lightly to bee regarded? But if you had seene, when with trembling hande hee had deliuered it, how hee went away, as if he had beene but the coffin that carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe to his sepulcher. Two times I must confesse I was about to take curtesie into mine eies; but both times the former resolution stopte the entrie of it: so that hee departed without obtaining any further kindenesse. But he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> was no sooner out of the doore, but that I looked to the doore kindely; and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:12151:65"/>
truely the feare of him euer since hath put me into such perplexitie, as now you found me. Ah my <hi>Pamela</hi> (saide <hi>Philoclea</hi>) leaue sorrow. The riuer of your teares will soone loose his fountaine; it is in your hand as well to stich vp his life againe, as it was before to rent it. And so (though with selfe-grieued mind) she comforted her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> sister, till sleepe came to bath himselfe in <hi>Pamelaes</hi> faire weeping eyes.</p>
            <p>Which when <hi>Philoclea</hi> found, wringing her hands, O me (said she) indeede the onely subiect of the destinies displeasure, whose greatest fortunatenes is more vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, then my sisters greatest vnfortunatenesse. Alas shee weepes because shee would be no sooner happy; I weepe because I can neuer be happie; her teares flow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> form pittie; mine from being too farre lower then the reach of pittie. Yet doo I not enuie thee, deare <hi>Pamela,</hi> I do not enuy thee: only I could wish that being thy sister in nature, I were not so farre off a kin in fortune.</p>
            <p>But the darkenesse of sorrow ouershadowing her mind, as the night did her eyes, they were both content to hide themselues vnder the wings of sleepe, till the next <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> morning had almost lost his name, before the two sweet sleeping sisters awaked fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dreames which flattered them with more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, then their waking could, or would consent vnto. For then they were called vp by <hi>Miso</hi>; who hauing bene with <hi>Gynecia,</hi> had receiued commaundement to be continually with her daughters, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly not to let <hi>Zelmane</hi> and <hi>Philoclea</hi> haue any priuate confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but that she should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> be present to heare what passed. <hi>Miso</hi> hauing now her authoritie encreased, But ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e with skowling eyes to deliuer a slauering good morrow to the two Ladies, telling them, it was a shame for them to marre their complexions, yea and conditions to, with long lying a bedde: and that, when shee was of their age, shee trowed, shee would haue made a handkerchiefe by that time a day. The two sweete Princes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> with a smilinge silence answered her entertainement, and obeiyng her directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, couered their daintie beauties with the glad clothes. But as soone as <hi>Pame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> was readie (and sooner she was then her sister) the agony of <hi>Dorus</hi> giuing a fit to her selfe, which the words of his letter (liuely imprinted in her minde) still remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred her of, she called to <hi>Mopsa,</hi> and willed her to fetch <hi>Dorus</hi> to speake with her: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> because (she said) shee woulde take further iudgement of him, before shee woulde moue <hi>Dametas</hi> to graunt her in mariage vnto him. <hi>Mopsa</hi> (as glad as of sweet-meate to goe of such an arrant) quickly returned with <hi>Dorus</hi> to <hi>Pamela,</hi> who entended both by speaking with him to giue some comfort to his passionate harte, and withall to heare some parte of his life past; which although fame had alreadie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> vnto her, yet she desired in more particular certainties to haue it from so beloued an historian. Yet the sweetnesse of vertues disposition iealous, euen ouer it selfe, suffred her not to enter abruptlie into questions of <hi>Musidorus</hi> (whom shee was halfe ashamed she did loue so well, and more then halfe sorie she could loue no better) but thought best first to make her talke arise of <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> &amp; his vertuous father: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> which thus she did.</p>

Most excellent Ladie (said <hi>Dorus</hi>) no expectation in others, nor hope in himselfe could aspire to a higher mark, then to bee thought worthy to be praised by

your iudgement, and made worthy to be praised by your mouth. But most sure it is, that as his fame could by no means get so sweet &amp; noble an aire to flie in, as in your breath, so coulde not you (leauing your selfe aside) finde in the worlde a fitter subiect of commendation; as noble, as a long succession of roiall ancestors, famous, and famous for victories could make him: of shape most louely, and yet of minde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> more louely; valiaunt, curteous, wise, what should I say more? sweete <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> what can my words but wrong thy perfections, which I would to God in some small measure thou hadst bequeathed to him that euer must haue thy vertues in admiration; that masked at least in them, I might haue founde some more gratious acceptation? with that hee imprisoned his looke for a while vppon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>

            <p>In this, and a much worse plight then it is fitte to trouble your excellent eares withall, did the King <hi>Euarchus</hi> finde his estate, when he tooke vppon him the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> which by reason of the long streame of abuse, he was forced to establish by some euen extreme seuerity, not so much for the very faultes themselues, (which hee rather sought to preuent then to punishe) as for the faultie ones; who strong, euen in their faultes, scorned his youth, and coulde not learne to disgest, that the man which they so long had vsed to maske their owne appetites, shoulde now be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the reducer of them into order. But so soone as some fewe (but in deede notable) examples, had thundered a duety into the subiectes hearts, hee soone shewed, no basenes of suspition, nor the basest basenes of enuy, coulde any whit rule such a Ruler. But then shined foorth indeede all loue among them, when an awfull feare, ingendred by iustice, did make that loue most louely: his first and principal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> care being to appear vnto his people, such as he would haue them be, &amp; to be such as he appeared; making his life the example of his lawes, and his lawes as it were, his axioms arising out of his deedes. So that within small time, he wanne a singular
<pb facs="tcp:12151:67"/>
loue in his people, and engraffed singular confidence. For how could they chuse but loue him, whom they found so truely to loue them? He euen in reason disday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that they that haue charge of beastes, shoulde loue their charge, and care for them; and that he that was to gouerne the most excellent creature, should not loue so noble a charge. And therefore, where most Princes (seduced by flatterie to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> builde vpon false grounds of gouernment) make themselues (as it were) an other thing from the people; and so count it gaine what they get from them: and (as if it were two counter-ballances, that their estate goes hiest when the people goes lowest) by a fallacie of argument thinking themselues most Kinges, when the subiect is most basely subiected: He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwise, vertuouslie and wisely acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that he with his people made all but one politike bodie, whereof himselfe was the head; euen so cared for them, as he woulde for his owne limmes: neuer restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their libertie, without it stretched to licenciousnes, nor pulling from them their goods, which they found were not imployed to the purchase of a greater good: but in all his actions shewing a delight in their wellfare, brought that to passe, that while <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> by force he tooke nothing, by their loue he had all. In summe (peerelesse Princesse) I might as easily sette downe the whole Arte of gouernement, as to lay before your eyes the picture of his proceedings. But in such sorte hee flourished in the sweete comforte of dooing much good, when by an accasion of leauing his Countrie, he was forced to bring foorth his vertue of magnanimitie, as before hee had done of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> iustice.</p>
            <p>He had onely one sister, a Ladie (lest I should too easilie fall to partiall prayses of her) of whom it may be iustly saide, that she was no vnfit branch to the noble stock whereof she was come. Her he had giuen in mariage to <hi>Dorilaus,</hi> Prince of <hi>Thessalia,</hi> not so much to make a frendship, as to confirm the frendship betweene their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> which betweene them, by the likenes of vertue, had beene long before made: for certainly, <hi>Dorilaus,</hi> could neede no amplifiers mouth for the highest point of praise. Who hath not heard (said <hi>Pamela</hi>) of the valiant, wise, and iust <hi>Dorilaus,</hi> whose vnripe death doth yet (so many yeares since) draw teares from vertuous eyes? And indeede, my father is wont to speake of nothing with greater admiration, then of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the notable fri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ndship (a rare thing in Princes, more rare betweene Princes) that so holily was obserued to the last, of those two excellent men. But (said she) go on I pray you. <hi>Dorilaus</hi> (said he) hauing married his sister, had his marriage in short time blest (for so are folke woont to say, how vnhappie soeuer the children after grow) with a sonne, whom they named <hi>Musidorus</hi>: of whom I must needes first speake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> before I come to <hi>Pyrocles</hi>; because as he was borne first, so vpon his occasion grew (as I may say accidentally) the others birth. For scarcely was <hi>Musidorus</hi> made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of this oft-blinding light, when there were found numbers of Southsayers, who affirmed strange and incredible thinges should be performed by that childe; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the heauens at that time listed to play with ignorant mankinde, or that flatterie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> be so presumptuous, as euen at times to borrow the face of Diuinitie. But certainly, so did the boldnesse of their affirmation accompanie the greatnesse of what they did affirm (euen descending to particularities, what kingdoms he should ouercome) that the king of <hi>Phrygia</hi> (who ouer-superstitiously thought himselfe touched in the matter) sought by force to destroy the infant, to preuent his after-expectations: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> a skilfull man (hauing compared his natiuity with the child) so told him. Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish man, either vainly fearing what was not to be feared, or not considering that if it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:12151:67"/>
were a worke of the superiour powers, the heauens at length are neuer children. But so he did, and by the aid of the Kings of <hi>Lydia</hi> and <hi>Crete</hi> (ioining together their armies) inuaded <hi>Thessalia,</hi> and brought <hi>Dorilaus</hi> to some behind-hand of fortune, when his faithfull friend and brother <hi>Euarchus</hi> came so mightily to his succour, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> with some enterchanging changes of fortune, they begat of a iust war, the best child, peace. In which time <hi>Euarchus</hi> made a crosse mariage also with <hi>Dorilaus</hi> his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and shortly left her with child of the famous <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> driuen to returne to the defence of his owne countrie, which in his absence (helped with some of the ill contented nobilitie) the mighty King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and his brother, King of <hi>Pannonia,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> had inuaded. The successe of those warres was too notable to be vnknowne to your eares, to which it seemes all worthy fame hath glory to come vnto. But there was <hi>Dorilaus</hi> (valiantly requiting his friends helpe) in a great battaile depriued of life, his obsequies being no more solemnised by the teares of his partakers, then the bloud of his enimies; with so pearcing a sorrow to the constant hart of <hi>Euarchus,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> that the newes of his sons birth could lighten his countenance with no shew of comfort, although all the comfort that might be in a child, truth it selfe in him forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with deliuered. For what fortune onely southsayers foretold of <hi>Musidorus,</hi> that all men might see prognosticated in <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> both Heauens and Earth giuing tokens of the comming forth of an Heroicall vertue. The senate house of the planets was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> at no time so set, for the decreeing of perfection in a man, as at that time all folkes skilfull therein did acknowledge: onely loue was threatned, and promised to him, and so to his cousin, as both the tempest and hauen of their best yeares. But as death may haue preuented <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> so vnworthinesse must be the death of <hi>Musidorus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the mother of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> (shortly after her childe-birth) dying, was cause that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
               <hi>Euarchus</hi> recommended the care of his only sonne to his sister; doing it the rather because the warre continued in cruell heat, betwixt him and those euill neighbours of his. In which meane time those young Princes (the only comforters of that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous widow) grewe on so, that <hi>Pyrocles</hi> taught admiration to the hardest conceats: <hi>Musidorus</hi> (perchaunce because among his subiects) exceedingly beloued: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> by the good order of <hi>Euarchus</hi> (well perfourmed by his sister) they were so brought vp, that all the sparkes of vertue, which nature had kindled in them, were so blowne to giue forth their vttermost heate that iustly it may be affirmed, they enflamed the affections of all that knew them. For almost before they could perfectly speake, they began to receaue conceits not vnworthy of the best speakers: excellent deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> being vsed, to make euen their sports profitable; images of battailes, and fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations being then deliuered to their memory, which after, their stronger iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might dispense, the delight of tales being conuerted to the knowledge of all the stories of worthy Princes, both to moue them to do nobly, and teach them how to do nobly; the beautie of vertue still being set before their eyes, and that taught <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> them with far more diligent care, then Grammaticall rules, their bodies exercised in all abilities, both of doing and suffring, and their mindes acquainted by degrees with daungers; and in sum, all bent to the making vp of princely mindes: no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile feare vsed towards them, nor any other violent restraint, but still as to Princes: so that a habite of commaunding was naturalized in them, and therefore the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> from Tyrannie: Nature hauing done so much for them in nothing, as that it made them Lords of truth, whereon all the other goods were builded.</p>
            <p>Among which nothing I so much delight to recount, as the memorable friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb facs="tcp:12151:68"/>
that grew betwixt the two Princes, such as made them more like then the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all other vertues, and made them more neere one to the other, then the neerenes of their bloud could aspire vnto; which I think grew the faster, and the faster was tied betweene them, by reason that <hi>Musidorus</hi> being elder by three or foure yeares, it was neither so great a difference in age as did take away the delight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in societie, and yet by the difference there was taken away the occasion of childish contentions; till they had both past ouer the humour of such contentions. For <hi>Pyrocles</hi> bare reuerence full of loue to <hi>Musidorus,</hi> and <hi>Musidorus</hi> had a delight full of loue in <hi>Pyrocles. Musidorus,</hi> what he had learned either for body or minde, would teach it to <hi>Pyrocles</hi>; and <hi>Pyrocles</hi> was so glad to learne of none, as of <hi>Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus:</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> till <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> being come to sixtene yeares of age, he seemed so to ouerrun his age in growth, strength, and all things following it, that not <hi>Musidorus,</hi> no nor any man liuing (I thinke) could performe any action, either on horse, or foote, more strongly, or deliuer that strength more nimbly, or become the deliuery more gracefully, or employ all more vertuously. Which may well seeme wonderfull: but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> wonders are no wonders in a wonderfull subiect.</p>
            <p>At which time vnderstanding that the King <hi>Euarchus,</hi> after so many yeares warre, and the conquest of all <hi>Pannonia,</hi> and almost <hi>Thrace,</hi> had now brought the conclusion of all to the siege of <hi>Bizantium</hi> (to the raising of which siege great forces were made) they would needs fall to the practise of those vertues, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> learned. And therefore the mother of <hi>Musidorus</hi> nobly yeelding ouer her owne affects to her childrens good (for a mother she was in effect to them both) the rather that they might helpe her beloued brother, they brake off all delayes; which <hi>Musidorus</hi> for his part thought already had deuoured too much of his good time, but that he had once graunted a boone (before he knew what it was) to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> deere friend <hi>Pyrocles</hi>; that he would neuer seeke the aduentures of armes, vntill he might go with him: which hauing fast bound his hart (a true slaue to faith) he had bid a tedious delay of following his owne humour for his friends sake, till now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both sent for by <hi>Euarchus,</hi> &amp; finding <hi>Pyrocles</hi> able euery way to go thorow with that kinde of life, he was as desirous for his sake, as for his owne, to enter into it. So <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> therefore preparing a nauie, that they might go like themselues, and not only bring the comfort of their presence, but of their power to their deere parent <hi>Euarchus,</hi> they recommended themselues to the Sea, leauing the shore of <hi>Thessalia</hi> full of teares and vowes; and were receiued thereon with so smooth and smiling a face, as if <hi>Neptune</hi> had as then learned falsely to fawne on Princes. The winde was like a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> wayting behind them so iust, that they might fill the sailes as they listed; and the best saylers shewing themselues lesse couetous of his liberalitie, so tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, that they all kept together like a beautifull flocke, which so well could obey their maisters pipe: without sometimes, to delight the Princes eies, some two or three of them would striue, who could (either by the cunning of well spending the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> windes breath, or by the aduantageous building of their moouing houses) leaue their fellowes behind them in the honour of speed: while the two Princes had lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to see the practise of that, which before they had learned by bookes: to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the arte of catching the winde prisoner, to no other ende, but to runne away with it; to see how beautie, and vse can so well agree together, that of all the trinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> wherewith they are attired, there is not one but serues to some necessary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And (ô Lord) to see the admirable power and noble effects of Loue, whereby
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:12151:68"/>
the seeming insensible Loadstone, with a secret beauty (holding the spirit of iron in it) can draw that hard-harted thing vnto it, and (like a vertuous mistresse) not onely make it bow it selfe, but with it make it aspire to so high a Loue, as of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Poles; and thereby to bring foorth the noblest deeds, that the children of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the Earth can boast of. And so the Princes delighting their conceats with confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their knowledge, seing wherein the Sea-discipline differed from Land-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, they had for a day and almost a whole night, as pleasing entertainement, as the falsest hart could giue to him he meanes worst to.</p>
            <p>But by that the next morning began a little to make a guilden shewe of a good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> meaning, there arose euen with the Sun, a vaile of darke cloudes before his face, which shortly (like inck powred into water) had blacked ouer all the face of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; preparing (as it were) a mournefull stage for a Tragedie to be plaied on-For forthwith the windes began to speake lowder, and as in a tumultuous king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to thinke themselues fittest instruments of commaundement; and blowing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> whole stormes of hayle and raine vpon them, they were sooner in daunger, then they could almost bethinke themselues of chaunge. For then the traiterous Sea began to swell in pride against the afflicted Nauie, vnder which (while the heauen fauoured them) it had layne so calmely, making mountaines of it selfe, our which the tossed and tottring ship should clime, to be streight carried downe againe to a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> pit of hellish darkenesse; with such cruell blowes against the sides of the shippe (that which way soeuer it went, was still in his malice) that there was left nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power to stay, nor way to escape. And shortly had it so disseuered the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing companie, which the daie before had tarried together, that most of them neuer met againe, but were swallowed vp in his neuer-satisfied mouth. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>(as since was knowne) after long wandring returned into <hi>Thessalia</hi>; other recouered <hi>Bizantium,</hi> and serued <hi>Euarchus</hi> in his warre. But in the ship wherein the Princes were (now left as much alone as proud Lords be when fortune failes them) though they employed all industrie to saue themselues, yet what they did was rather for dutie to nature, then hope to escape. So ougly a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rkenesse, as if it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> would preuent the nights comming, vsurped the dayes right: which (accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied sometimes with thunders, alwayes with horrible noyses of the chafing winds) made the masters and pilots so astonished, that they knew not how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and if they knew they could scarcely (when they directed) heare their owne whistle. For the sea straue with the winds which should be lowder, and the shrouds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> of the ship with a ghastfull noise to them that were in it, witnessed, that their ruine was the wager of the others contention, and the heauen roaring out thunders the more amazed them, as hauing those powers for enimies. Certainely there is no daunger carries with it more horror, then that which growes in those floting kingdomes. For that dwelling place is vnnaturall to mankind, and then the terrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> of the continuall motion, the desolation of the far-being from comfort, the eye and the eare hauing ougly images euer before it, doth still vex the minde, euen when it is best armed against it. But thus the day past (if that might be called a day) while the cunningest mariners were so conquered by the storme, as they thought it best with striken sailes to yeeld to be gouerned by it: the valiantest feeling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> dismayednesse, and yet the fearefullest ashamed fully to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hewe it, seeing that the Princes (who were to parte from the greatest fortunes) did in theyr countenances accuse no point of feare, but encouraging them to doo what
<pb facs="tcp:12151:69"/>
might be done (putting their hands to euerie most painefull office) taught them at one instant to promise themselues the best, and yet to despise the worst. But so were they carryed by the tyrannie of the winde, and the treason of the sea, all that night, which the elder it was, the more wayward it shewed it selfe towards them: till the next morning (knowne to be a morning better by the houre-glasse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> then by the day cleerenesse) hauing runne fortune as blindly, as it selfe euer was painted, lest the conclusion should not aunswere to the rest of the play, they were driuen vpon a rocke: which hidden with those outragious waues, did, as it were, closely dissemble his cruell mind, till with an vnbeleeued violence (but to them that haue tried it) the shippe ranne vpon it; and seeming willinger to perish then to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> haue her course stayed, redoubled her blowes, till she had broken her selfe in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and as it were tearing out her owne bowels to feede the seas greedinesse, left nothing within it but despaire of safetie, and expectation of a loathsome end. There was to be seene the diuerse manner of minds in distresse: some sate vpon the top of the poupe weeping and wailing, till the sea swallowed them; some one more able <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> to abide death, then feare of death, cut his owne throate to preuent drowning; some prayed, and there wanted not of them which cursed, as if the heauens could not be more angrie then they were. But a monstrous crie begotten of manie roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring voices, was able to infect with feare a minde that had not preuented it with the power of reason.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>But the Princes vsing the passions of fearing euill, and desiring to escape, only to serue the rule of vertue, not to abandon ones selfe, lept to a ribbe of the ship, which broken from his fellowes, floted with more likelyhood to doo seruice, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther limme of that ruinous bodie; vpon which there had gotten alreadie two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, well knowne seruants of theirs; and streight they foure were carryed out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> sight, in that huge rising of the sea, from the rest of the ship. But the peece they were on sinking by little and little vnder them, not able to support the weight of so manie, the brethren (the elder whereof was <hi>Leucippus,</hi> the younger <hi>Nelsus</hi>) shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselues right faithfull and gratefull seruants vnto them; gratefull (I say) for this cause: Those two gentlemen had bene taken prisoners in the great warre the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> king of <hi>Phrygia</hi> made vpon <hi>Thessalia,</hi> in the time of <hi>Musidorus</hi> his infancie; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene solde into another countrie (though peace fell after betweene these Realmes) could not be deliuered, because of their valor knowne, but for a farre greater summe, then either all their friends were able, or the Dowager willing to make, in respect of the great expences her selfe and people had bene put to in those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> warres; and so had they remained in prison about thirteene yeares, when the two young Princes (hearing speaches of their good deserts) found meanes both by sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all the Iewels they had of great price, and by giuing vnder their hands great estates when they should come to be Kings (which promises their vertue promised for them should be kept) to get so much treasure as redeemed them from captiuitie.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> This remembred, and kindly remembred by these two brothers, perchance helped by a naturall duetie to their Princes blood, they willingly left holde of the boord, committing themselues to the seas rage, and euen when they mente to dye, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues praying for the Princes liues. It is true, that neither the paine nor daunger, so moued the Princes hartes as the tendernesse of that louing part, farre from glorie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> hauing so few lookers on; farre from hope of reward, since themselues were sure to perish.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:12151:69"/>But now of all the royall Nauie they lately had, they had left but one little peece of one ship, whereon they kept themselues in all trueth, hauing enterchanged their cares, while either cared for other, ech comforting and councelling how to labour for the better, and to abide the worse. But so fell it out, that as they were carryed by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the tide (which there seconded by the storme ran exceeding swiftly) <hi>Musidorus</hi> seeing (as he thought) <hi>Pyrocles</hi> not well vpon the boord, as he would with his right hand haue helped him on better, he had no sooner vnfastned his hold, but that a waue forcibly spoiled his weaker hand of hold; and so for a time parted those friends, each crying to the other, but the noise of the sea drowned their farewell. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> But <hi>Pyrocles</hi> (then carelesse of death, if it had come by any meanes, but his owne) was shortly brought out of the seas furie to the lands comfort; when (in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science I know) that comfort was but bitter vnto him. And bitter indeed it fell out euen in it selfe to be vnto him.</p>
            <p>For being cast on land much brused and beaten both with the Seas hard fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> and the shores rude welcome; and euen almost deadly tired with the length of his vncomfortable labour, as he was walking vp to discouer some bodie, to whom he might goe for reliefe, there came streight running vnto him certaine, who (as it was after knowne) by appointment watched (with manie others) in diuerse places along the coast: who laide handes of him, and without either que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> with him, or shewing will to heare him, (like men fearefull to appeare cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious) or which was worse hauing no regard to the hard plight he was in (being so wet and weake) they carried him some miles thence, to a house of a principall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of that countrie. Who with no more ciuilitie (though with much more busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes then those vnder-fellowes had shewed) began in captious manner to put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> vnto him. To which he (vnused to such entertainment) did shortlie and plainely aunswere, what he was, and how he came thither. But that no sooner knowne, with numbers of armed men to garde him (for mischiefe, not from mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe) he was sent to the Kings court, which as then was not aboue a dayes iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney off, with letters from that officer, containing his owne seruiceable diligence in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> discouering so great a personage; adding withall more then was true of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures, because he would endeare his owne seruice.</p>
            <p>This country whereon he fell was <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and it was to the King thereof to whome he was sent, a Prince of a melancholy constitution both of bodie &amp; mind; wickedly sad, euer musing of horrible matters; suspecting, or rather condemning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> all men of euill, because his minde had no eye to espie goodnesse: and therefore accusing <hi>Sycophantes,</hi> of all men did best sort to his nature; but therefore not see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Sycophantes,</hi> because of no euill they said, they could bring any new or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing vnto him, but such as alreadie he had bene apt to determine; so as they came but as proofes of his wisedome: fearefull and neuer secure; while the feare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> he had figured in his minde had any possibilitie of euent. A tode-like retyrednesse, and closenesse of minde; nature teaching the odiousnesse of poyson, and the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of odiousnesse. Yet while youth lasted in him, the exercises of that age, and his humour (not yet fullie discouered) made him something the more frequentable, and lesse daungerous. But after that yeares began to come on with some, though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> more seldome shewes of a bloudie nature, and that the prophecie of <hi>Musidorus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenie came to his eares (deliuered vnto him, and receiued of him with the hardest interpretation, as though his subiects did delight in the hearing thereof.) Then
<pb facs="tcp:12151:70"/>
gaue he himselfe indeede to the full currant of his disposition, especially after the warre of <hi>Thessalia,</hi> wherein (though in trueth wrongly) he deemed, his vnsuccesse proceeded of their vnwillingnes to haue him prosper: and then thinking himselfe contemned, (knowing no countermine against contempt, but terror) began to let nothing passe which might beare the colour of a fault, without sharp punishment:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and when he wanted faults, excellencie grew a fault; and it was sufficient to make one guiltie, that he had power to be guiltie. And as there is no humour, to which impudent pouertie cannot make itselfe seruiceable, so were there enow of those of desperate ambition, who would build their houses vpon others ruines, which after should fall by like practises. So as seruitude came mainly vpon that poore people,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> whose deedes were not onely punished, but words corrected, and euen thoughts by some meane or other puld out of them: while suspition bred the mind of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the effects of crueltie stirred a new cause of suspition. And in this plight (full of watchfull fearefulnes) did the storme deliuer sweete <hi>Pyrocles</hi> to the stormie minde of that Tyrant, all men that did such wrong to so rare a stranger (whose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> countenaunce deserued both pitie and admiration) condemning themselues as much in their hearts, as they did brag in their forces.</p>
            <p>But when this bloudy King knew what he was, and in what order he and his cosin <hi>Musidorus</hi> (so much of him feared) were come out of <hi>Thessalia,</hi> assuredly thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (because euer thinking the worst) that those forces were prouided against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> him; glad of the perishing (as he thought) of <hi>Musidorus,</hi> determined in publique sort to put <hi>Pyrocles</hi> to death. For hauing quite lost the way of noblenes, he straue to clime to the height of terriblenes; and thinking to make all men adread, to make such one an enemie, who would not spare, nor feare to kill so great a Prince; and lastly, hauing nothing in him why to make him his friend, he thought, he woulde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> take him away, from being his enemie. The day was appointed, and all things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that cruell blow, in so solemne an order, as if they would set foorth ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in most gorgeous decking. The Princely youth of inuincible valour, yet so vniustly subiected to such outragious wrong, carrying himself in all his demeanure so constantly, abiding extremitie, that one might see it was the cutting away of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> greatest hope of the world, and destroying vertue in his sweetest grouth.</p>
            <p>But so it fell out that his death was preuented by a rare example of friendship in <hi>Musidorus:</hi> who being almost drowned, had bene taken vp by a Fisherman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the kingdome of <hi>Pontus</hi>; and being there, and vnderstanding the full discourse (as Fame was very prodigall of so notable an accident) in what case <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> was; learning withall, that his hate was farre more to him then to <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> hee found meanes to acquaint him selfe with a noble-man of that Countrie, to whome largely discouering what he was, he found him a most fit instrument to effectuate his desire. For this noble-man had bene one, who in many warres had serued <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and had bene so mind-striken by the beautie of vertue in that noble King,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> that (though not borne his Subiect) he euer profest himselfe his seruaunt. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire therefore to him was, to keepe <hi>Musidorus</hi> in a strong Castle of his, and then to make the King of <hi>Phrygia</hi> vnderstand, that if he would deliuer <hi>Pyrocles, Musidorus</hi> would willingly put him selfe into his hands: knowing well, that how thirstie so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he was of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> bloud, he would rather drinke that of <hi>Musidorus.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>
            </p>
            <p>The Nobleman was loath to preserue one by the losse of another, but time vrging resolution: the importunitie of <hi>Musidorus</hi> (who shewed a minde not to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12151:70"/>
ouer-liue <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) with the affection he bare to <hi>Euarchus,</hi> so preuayled, that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried this strange offer of <hi>Musidorus,</hi> which by that Tyrant was greedelie accepted.</p>
            <p>And so vpon securitie of both sides, they were enterchanged. Where I may not omitte the worke of friendshippe in <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> who both in speache and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to <hi>Musidorus,</hi> well shewed, that he thought himselfe iniured, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued by him: asking him, what he had euer seene in him, why he could not beare the extremities of mortall accidentes as well as any man? and why he should enuie him the glorie of suffering death for his friendes cause, and (as it were) robbe him of his owne possession? But in this notable contention, (where the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> conquest must be the conquerers destruction, and safetie the punishment of the conquered) <hi>Musidorus</hi> preuayled: because he was a more welcome praie to the vniust King, and as chearefully going towardes, as <hi>Pyrocles</hi> went frowardly from<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his death, he was deliuered to the King, who could not be inough sure of him, without he fed his owne eies vpon one, whom he had begon to feare, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> soone as the other began to be.</p>
            <p>Yet because he would in one acte, both make ostentation of his owne felicitie (into whose hands his most feared enemie was fallen) and withall cut of such hopes from his suspected subiects (when they should knowe certainly he was dead) with much more skilfull crueltie, and horrible solemnitie he caused each thing to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> prepared for his triumph of tyrannie. And so the day being come, he was led foorth by many armed men (who often had beene the fortifiers of wickednes) to the place of execution: where comming with a minde comforted in that he had done such seruice to <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> this strange encounter he had.</p>
            <p>The excelling <hi>Pyrocles</hi> was no sooner deliuered by the kings seruants to a place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> of liberty, then he bent his witte and courage, (and what would not they bring to passe?) how ether to deliuer <hi>Musidorus,</hi> or to perish with him. And (finding he could get in that countrie no forces sufficient by force to rescue him) to bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to die with him, (little hoping of better euent) he put himselfe in poore ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by the helpe of some few crownes he tooke of that noble-man, (who full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of sorrow, though not knowing the secrete of his intent, suffered him to goe in such order from him) he (euen he, borne to the greatest expectation, and of the greatest bloud that any Prince might be) submitted himselfe to be seruant to the executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that should put to death <hi>Musidorus:</hi> a farre notabler proofe of his friendship, considering the height of his minde, then any death could be. That bad officer not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> suspecting him, being araied fit for such an estate, and hauing his beautie hidden by many foule spots he artificially put vpon his face, gaue him leaue not onely to weare a sworde himselfe, but to beare his sworde prepared for the iustified mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And so <hi>Pyrocles</hi> taking his time, when <hi>Musidorus</hi> was vpon the scaffold (sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed somewhat from the rest, as allowed to say something) he stept vnto him, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> putting the sworde into his hande not bound (a point of ciuility the officers vsed towards him, because they doubted no such enterprise) <hi>Musidorus</hi> (said he) die nobly. In truth, neuer man betweene ioy before knowledge what to be glad of, and feare after considering his case, had such a confusion of thoughts, as I had, when I saw <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> so neare me. But with that <hi>Dorus</hi> blushed, and <hi>Pamela</hi> smiled: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>
               <hi>Dorus</hi> the more blushed at her smiling, and she the more smiled at his blushing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had (with the remembraunce of that plight he was in) forgotten in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him selfe to vse the third person. But <hi>Musidorus</hi> turned againe her thoughts
<pb facs="tcp:12151:71"/>
from his cheekes to his tongue in this sort: But (said he) when they were with swordes in handes, not turning backs one to the other (for there they knew was no place of defence) but making it a preseruation in not hoping to be preserued, and now acknowledging themselues subiect to death, meaning onely to do honour to their princely birth, they flew amongst them all (for all were enimies) and had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> quickly either with flight or death, left none vpon the scaffold to annoy them. Wherein <hi>Pyrocles</hi> (the excellent <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) did such wonders beyond beliefe, as was hable to leade <hi>Musidorus</hi> to courage, though he had bene borne a coward. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, iust rage and desperate vertue did such effects, that the popular sort of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders began to be almost superstitiously amazed, as at effects beyond mortall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> But the King with angry threatnings from-out a window (where he was not ashamed, the world should behold him a beholder) commaunded his gard, and the rest of his souldiers to hasten their death. But many of them lost their bodies to loose their soules, when the Princes grew almost so weary, as they were ready to be conquered with conquering.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/>
            </p>
            <p>But as they were still fighting with weake armes, and strong harts, it happened, that one of the souldiers (commaunded to go vp after his fellowes against the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) hauing receiued a light hurt, more wounded in his hart, went backe with as much diligence, as he came vp with modestie: which another of his fellowes see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to pike a thanke of the King, strake him vpon the face, reuiling him, that so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> he would runne away from so fewe. But he (as many times it falls out) onely valiant, when he was angrie, in reuenge thrust him through: which with his death was streight reuenged by a brother of his: and that againe requited by a fellow of the others. There began to be a great tumult amongst the souldiers; which seene, and not vnderstood by the people (vsed to feares but not vsed to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> bolde in them) some began to crie treason; and that voice streight multiplying it selfe, the King (O the cowardise of a guiltie conscience) before any man set vpon him, fled away. Where-with a bruit (either by arte of some well meaning men, or by such chaunce as such things often fall out by) ran from one to the other, that the King was slaine; wherewith certaine yong men of the brauest mindes, cried <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> with lowde voice, Libertie; and encouraging the other Citizens to follow them, set vpon the garde, and souldiers as chiefe instruments of Tyrannie: and quickly, aided by the Princes, they had left none of them aliue, nor any other in the cittie, who they thought had in any sort set his hand to the worke of their seruitude, and (God knowes) by the blindnesse of rage, killing many guiltles persons, either for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> affinity to the Tyrant, or enmitie to the tyrant-killers. But some of the wiser (seeing that a popular licence is indeede the many-headed tyranny) preuailed with the rest to make <hi>Musidorus</hi> their chiefe: choosing one of them (because Princes) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, and him because elder and most hated of the Tyrant, and by him to be ruled: whom foorthwith they lifted vp, Fortune (I thinke) smiling at her worke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> therein, that a scaffold of execution should grow a scaffold of coronation.</p>
            <p>But by and by there came newes of more certaine truth, that the King was not dead, but fled to a strong castle of his, neere hand, where he was gathering forces in all speed possible to suppresse this mutinie. But now they had run themselues too farre out of breath, to go backe againe the same career; and too well they knew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> the sharpnesse of his memorie to forget such an iniury; therefore learning vertue of necessitie, they continued resolute to obey <hi>Musidorus.</hi> Who seing what forces
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:12151:71"/>
were in the citie, with them issued against the Tyrant, while they were in this heat; before practises might be vsed to disseuer them: and with them met the King, who likewise hoping little to preuaile by time, (knowing and finding his peoples hate) met him with little delay in the field: where him selfe was slaine by <hi>Musidorus,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> after he had seene his onely sonne (a Prince of great courage &amp; beautie, but fostred in bloud by his naughty Father) slaine by the hand of <hi>Pyrocles.</hi> This victory obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with great, and truly not vndeserued honour to the two Princes, the whole estates of the country with one consent, gaue the crowne and all other markes of soueraigntie to <hi>Musidorus</hi>; desiring nothing more, then to liue vnder such a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> as they promised themselues of him.</p>
            <p>But he thinking it a greater greatnes to giue a kingdome, then get a kingdome; vnderstanding that there was left of the bloud Roiall, and next to the succession, an aged Gentleman of approued goodnes (who had gotten nothing by his cousins power, but danger from him, and odiousnes for him) hauing past his time in modest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> secrecy, and asmuch from entermedling in matters of gouernment, as the greatnesse of his bloud would suffer him, did (after hauing receiued the full power to his owne hands) resigne all to the noble-man: but with such conditions, and cautions of the conditions, as might assure the people (with asmuch assurance as worldly matters beare) that not onely that gouernour, of whom indeed they looked for all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> good, but the nature of the gouernment, should be no way apt to decline to Tyranny.</p>
            <p>This dooing set foorth no lesse his magnificence, then the other act did his magnanimitie: so that greatly praysed of all, and iustly beloued of the new King, who in all both wordes and behauiour protested him selfe their Tenaunt, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Liegeman, they were drawne thence to reuenge those who seruants of theirs, of whose memorable faith, I told you (most excellent Princesse) in willingly giuing themselues to be drowned for their sakes: but drowned indeed they were not, but gat with painefull swimming vpon a rocke: from whence (after being come as neere famishing, as before drowning) the weather breaking vp, they were brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> to the maine land of <hi>Pontus</hi>; the same country vpon which <hi>Musidorus</hi> also was fallen, but not in so luckie a place.</p>
            <p>For they were brought to the King of that country, a Tyrant also, not thorow suspition, greedines, or reuengefulnes, as he of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> but (as I may terme it) of a wanton crueltie: inconstant in his choise of friends, or rather neuer hauing a friend, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> but a playfellow; of whom when he was wearie, he could not otherwise rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, then by killing them: giuing somtimes prodigally, not because he loued them to whom he gaue, but because he lusted to giue: punishing, not so much for hate or anger, as because he felt not the smart of punishment: delighted to be flattered, at first for those vertues which were not in him, at length making his vices vertues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> worthy the flattering: with like iudgement glorying, when he had happened to do a thing well, as when he had performed some notable mischiefe.</p>
            <p>He chanced at that time (for indeed long time none lasted with him) to haue next in vse about him, a man of the most enuious disposition, that (I think) euer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the aire with his breath: whose eies could not looke right vpon any happie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> man, nor eares beare the burthen of any bodies praise: contrary to the natures of all other plagues, plagued with others well being; making happines the ground of his vnhappinesse, &amp; good news the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his sorrow: in sum, a man whose fauour
<pb facs="tcp:12151:72"/>
no man could winne, but by being miserable. And so, because these two faithfull seruants of theirs came in miserable sorte to that Courte, he was apte inough at first to fauour them; and the King vnderstanding of their aduenture, (wherein they had shewed so constant a faith vnto their Lordes) suddainly falles to take a pride in making much of them, extolling them with infinite prayses, and praysing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> him selfe in his harte, in that he praysed them. And by and by were they made great courtiers, and in the way of minions, when aduauncement (the most mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall offence to enuy) stirred vp their former friend, to ouerthrow his owne worke in them; taking occasion vpon the knowledge (newly come to the court) of the late death of the King of <hi>Phrygia</hi> destroied by their two Lordes, who hauing bene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a neere kinsman to this Prince of <hi>Pontus,</hi> by this enuious Councellour, partly with suspition of practise, partly with glory of in-part reuenging his cousins death, the King was suddainly turned, (and euery turne with him was a downe-fall) to locke them vp in prison, as seruaunts to his enimies, whom before he had neuer knowne, nor (till that time one of his owne subiects had entertained and dealt for them) did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> euer take heed of. But now earnest in euery present humour, and making himselfe braue in his liking, he was content to giue them iust cause of offence, when they had power to make iust reuenge. Yet did the Princes send vnto him before they entred into warre, desiring their seruants liberty. But he swelling in their humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, (like a bubble blowne vp with a small breath, broken with a great) forgetting,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> or neuer knowing humanitie, caused their heads to be striken off, by the aduice of his enuious Councellor (who now hated them so much the more, as he foresaw their happines in hauing such, and so fortunate masters) and sent them with vnroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reproches to <hi>Musidorus</hi> and <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> as if they had done traiterously, and not heroically in killing his tyrannicall Cosen.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
            </p>
            <p>But that iniurie went beyond all degree of reconcilement; so that they making forces in <hi>Phrygia</hi> (a kingdome wholy at their commandement, by the loue of the people, and gratefulnesse of the King) they entred his country; and wholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering it (with such deeds as at lest Fame said were excellent) tooke the King; and by <hi>Musidorus</hi> commaundement (<hi>Pyrocles</hi> hart more enclining to pitie) he was slaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> vpon the tombe of their two true Seruants; which they caused to be made for them with royall expences, and notable workmanship to preserue their dead liues. For his wicked Seruant he should haue felt the like, or worse, but that his harte brake euen to death with the beholding the honour done to their dead carcasses. There might <hi>Pyrocles</hi> quietly haue enioyed that crowne, by all the desire of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> people, most of whom had reuolted vnto him: but he, finding a sister of the late Kings (a faire and well esteemed Ladie) looking for nothing more, then to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with her brothers ruines, gaue her in marriage to the noble man his fathers old friend, and endowed them with the crowne of that kingdome. And not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with those publike actions, of princely, and (as it were) gouerning vertue,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> they did (in that kingdome and some other neere about) diuers acts of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar trials, more famous, because more perilous. For in that time those regions were full both of cruell monsters, and monstrous men: all which in short time by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate combats they deliuered the countries of.</p>
            <p>Among the rest, two brothers of huge both greatnesse and force, therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> called Giants, who kept themselues in a castle seated vpon the top of a rocke, impregnable, because there was no comming vnto it, but by one narrow path,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12151:72"/>
where one mans force was able to keepe downe an armie. These brothers had a while serued the King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and in all his affaires (especially of war, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they were onely apt) they had shewed, as vnconquered courage, so a rude faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes: being men indeed by nature apter to the faults of rage, then of deceipt; not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> greatly ambitious, more then to be well and vprightly dealt with; rather impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of iniury, then delighted with more then ordinary curtesies; and in iniuries more sensible of smart or losse, then of reproch or disgrace. These men being of this nature (and certainely Iewels to a wise man, considering what indeed wonders they were able to performe) yet were discarded by that vnworthy Prince, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> notable deserts, as not worthy the holding. Which was the more euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; because it sodainly fell from an excesse of fauor, which (many examples hauing taught them) neuer stopt his race till it came to an headlong ouerthrow: they ful of rage, retyred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues vnto this castle. Where thinking nothing iuster the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reuenge, nor more noble then the effects of anger, that (according to the nature) full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> brauery and fiercenes, scarcely in the glasse of Reason, thinking it selfe faire, but when it is terrible, they immediately gaue themselues to make all the countrie about them (subiect to that King) to smart for their Lords folly: not caring how innocent they were, but rather thinking the more innocent they were, the more it testified their spite, which they desired to manifest. And with vse of euill, gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> more and more euill, they tooke delight in slaughter, and pleased themselues in making others wracke the effect of their power: so that where in the time that they obeyed a master, their anger was a seruiceable power of the minde to doo publike good; so now vnbridled, and blinde iudge of it selfe, it made wickednesse violent, and praised it selfe in excellencie of mischiefe; almost to the ruine of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> countrie, not greatly regarded by their carelesse and louelesse king. Till now these Princes finding them so fleshed in crueltie, as not to be reclaimed, secretly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke the matter alone: for accompanied they would not haue suffered them to haue mounted; and so those great fellowes scornefully receiuing them, as foolish birds falne into their net, it pleased the eternall iustice to make them suffer death by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> their hands: and so they were manifoldly acknowledged the sauers of that countrie.</p>
            <p>It were the part of a verie idle Orator to set forth the numbers of wel-deuised honors done vnto them: But as high honor is not onely gotten and borne by paine, and daunger, but must be nurst by the like, or els vanisheth as soone as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to the world: so the naturall hunger thereof (which was in <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) suffered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> him not to account a resting seate of that, which euer either riseth, or falleth, but still to make one occasion beget another; wherby his doings might send his praise to others mouthes to rebound againe true contentment to his spirit. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing well established those kingdomes, vnder good gouernours, and rid them by their valure of such giants and monsters, as before time armies were not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> able to subdue, they determined in vnknowne order to see more of the world, and to imploy those gifts esteemed rare in them, to the good of mankinde; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would themselues (vnderstanding that the King <hi>Euarchus</hi> was passed all the cumber of his warres) goe priuately to seeke exercises of their vertue; thinking it not so worthy, to be brought to Heroycall effects by fortune, or necessitie, (like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>
               <hi>Vlysses</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi>) as by ones owne choice, and working. And so went they away from verie vnwilling people to leaue them, making time haste it selfe to be a circumstance of their honour, and one place witnesse to another of the truth
<pb facs="tcp:12151:73"/>
of their doings. For scarcely were they out of the confines of <hi>Pontus,</hi> but that as they ridde alone armed, (for alone they went, one seruing the other) they mette an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture; which though not so notable for any great effect they perfourmed, yet worthy to be remembred for the vn-vsed examples therein, as well of true naturall goodnes, as of wretched vngratefulnesse.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
            </p>
            <p>It was in the kingdome of <hi>Galacia,</hi> the season being (as in the depth of winter) very cold, and as then sodainely growne to so extreame and foule a storme, that neuer any winter (I thinke) brought foorth a fowler child: so that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were euen compelled by the haile, that the pride of the winde blew into their faces, to seeke some shrowding place which a certaine hollow rocke offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> vnto them, they made it their shield against the tempests furie. And so staying there, till the violence thereof was passed, they heard the speach of a couple, who not perceiuing them (being hidde within that rude canapy) helde a straunge and pitifull disputation which made them steppe out; yet in such sort, as they might see vnseene. There they perceaued an aged man, and a young, scarcely come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> to the age of a man, both poorely arayed, extreamely weather-beaten; the olde man blinde, the young man leading him: and yet through all those miseries, in both there seemed to appeare a kinde of noblenesse, not sutable to that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. But the first words they heard, were these of the old man. Well <hi>Leonatus</hi> (said he) since I cannot perswade thee to leade mee to that which should end <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> my griefe, and thy trouble, let me now entreat thee to leaue me: feare not, my miserie cannot be greater then it is, and nothing doth become me but miserie; feare not the danger of my blind steps, I cannot fall worse then I am. And doo not I pray thee, doo not obstinately continue to infect thee with my wretchednes. But flie, flie from this region, onely worthy of me. Deare father (answered he)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> doo not take away from me the onely remnant of my happinesse: while I haue power to doo you seruice, I am not wholly miserable. Ah my sonne (said he, and with that he groned, as if sorrow straue to breake his harte,) how euill fits it me to haue such a sonne, and how much doth thy kindnesse vpbraide my wickednesse? These dolefull speeches, and some others to like purpose (well shewing they had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> not bene borne to the fortune they were in,) moued the Princes to goe out vnto them, and aske the younger what they were? Sirs (answered he, with a good grace, and made the more agreable by a certaine noble kinde of pitiousnes) I see well you are straungers, that know not our miserie so well here knowne, that no man dare know, but that we must be miserable. In deede our state is such, as though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> nothing is so needfull vnto vs as pittie, yet nothing is more daungerous vnto vs, then to make our selues so knowne as may stirre pittie. But your presence promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that cruelty shall not ouer-runne hate. And if it did, in truth our state is soncke below the degree of feare.</p>
            <p>This old man (whom I leade) was lately rightfull Prince of this countrie of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 
               <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> by the hard-harted vngratefulnes of a sonne of his, depriued, not onely of his kingdome (whereof no forraine forces were euer able to spoyle him) but of his sight, the riches which Nature graunts to the poorest creatures. Whereby, and by other his vnnaturall dealings, he hath bin driuen to such griefe, as euen now he would haue had me to haue led him to the toppe of this rocke, thence to cast <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> himselfe headlong to death: and so would haue made me (who receiued my life of him) to be the worker of his destruction. But noble Gentlemen (said he) if either
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12151:73"/>
of you haue a father, and feele what duetifull affection is engraffed in a sonnes hart, let me entreate you to conuay this afflicted Prince to some place of rest and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Amongst your worthie actes it shall be none of the least, that a King, of such might and fame, and so vniustlie oppressed, is in any sort by you relieued.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But before they coulde make him aunswere, his father began to speake. Ah my sonne (said he) how euill an Historian are you, that leaue out the chiefe knot of all the discourse? my wickednes, my wickednes. And if thou doest it to spare my ears, (the onely sense now left mee proper for knowledge) assure thy selfe thou doest mistake me. And I take witnesse of that Sunne which you see (with that he cast vp <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> his blinde eies, as if he would hunt for light,) and wish my selfe in worse case then I doe wish my selfe, which is as euill as may bee, if I speake vntruely; that nothing is so welcome to my thoughts, as the publishing of my shame. Therefore know you Gentlemen (to whome from my heart I wish that it may not proue some ominous foretoken of misfortune to haue met with such a miser as I am) that whatsoeuer my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> sonne (ô God, that truth bindes me to reproch him with the name of my son) hath saide, is true. But besides those truthes, this also is true, that hauing had in lawfull mariage, of a mother fitte to beare roiall children, this sonne (such a one as partly you see, and better shall knowe by my short declaration) and so enioyed the expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the world of him, till he was growen to iustifie their expectations (so as I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> needed enuie no father for the chiefe comfort of mortalitie, to leaue an other ones-selfe after me) I was caried by a bastard sonne of mine (if at least I bee bounde to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the words of that base woman my concubine, his mother) first to mislike, then to hate, lastly to destroy, or to doo my best to destroy, this sonne (I thinke you thinke) vndeseruing destruction. What waies be vsed to bring me to it, if I shoulde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> tell you, I shoulde tediouslie trouble you with as much poisonous hypocrisie, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate fraude, smooth malice, hidden ambition, and smiling enuie, as in any liuing person could be harbored. But I list it not; no remembraunce, of naughtinesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes me, but mine owne; and me thinkes, the accusing his trappes might in some manner excuse my fault, which certainelie I loth to doo. But the conclusion is, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> I gaue order to some seruauntes of mine, whome I thought as apte for such charities as my selfe, to lead him out into a forrest, and there to kill him.</p>
            <p>But those theeues (better natured to my sonne then my selfe) spared his life, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him goe, to learne to liue poorelie: which he did, giuing himselfe to be a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate souldier, in a countrey here by. But as hee was ready to be greatlie aduaunced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> for some noble peeces of seruice which he did, he heard newes of me: who (dronke in my affection to that vnlawfull and vnnaturall sonne of mine) suffered my selfe so to be gouerned by him, that all fauours and punishments passed by him, all offices, and places of importance, distributed to his fauorites; so that ere I was aware, I had left my selfe nothing but the name of a King: which he shortly wearie of too, with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> manie indignities (if any thing may be called an indignitie, which was laide vppon me) threw me out of my seate, and put out my eies; and then (proud in his tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie) let me goe, neither imprisoning, nor killing me: but rather delighting to make me feele my miserie; miserie in deede, if euer there were any; full of wretchednesse, fuller of disgrace, and fullest of guiltines. And as he came to the crowne by so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> meanes, as vniustlie he kept it, by force of straunger souldiers in <hi>Cittadels,</hi> the nestes of tirannie, and murderers of libertie; disarming all his own countrimen, that no man durst shew himselfe a well-willer of mine; to say the truth (I thinke) few of
<pb facs="tcp:12151:74"/>
them being so (considering my cruell folly to my good sonne, and foolish kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to my vnkinde bastard:) but if there were any who felt a pitty of so great a fall, and had yet any sparkes of vnslaine duety lefte in them towardes me; yet durst they not shewe it, scarcely with giuing mee almes at their doores; which yet was the onely sustenaunce of my distressed life, no body daring to shewe so much cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> as to lende mee a hande to guide my darke steppes: Till this sonne of mine (God knowes, woorthy of a more vertuous, and more fortunate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) forgetting my abhominable wronges, not recking daunger, and neglecting the present good way hee was in of doing himselfe good, came hether to doo this kinde office you see him performe towardes me, to my vnspeakeable griefe; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> because his kindnes is a glasse euen to my blind eies, of my naughtines, but that aboue all griefes, it greeues me he should desperatlie aduenture the losse of his well deseruing life for mine, that yet owe more to fortune for my deserts, as if hee would cary mudde in a chest of christall. For well I know, he that now raigneth, howe much so euer (and with good reason) he despiseth me, of all men despised; yet hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> will not let slippe any aduantage to make away him, whose iust title (ennobled by courage and goodnes) may one day shake the seate of a neuer secure tyrannie. And for this cause I craued of him to leade mee to the toppe of this rocke, indeede I must confesse, with meaning to free him from so Serpentine a companion as I am. But he finding what I purposed, onely therein since hee was borne, shewed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> himselfe disobedient vnto mee. And now gentlemen, you haue the true storie, which I pray you publish to the world, that my mischieuous proceedinges may bee the glorie of his filiall pietie, the onely reward now left for so great a merite. And if it may be, let me obtaine that of you, which my sonne denies me: for neuer was there more pity in sauing any, then in ending me; both because therein my agonies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> shall ende, and so shall you preserue this excellent young man, who els wilfully fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes his owne ruine.</p>
            <p>The matter in it selfe lamentable, lamentably expressed by the old Prince (which needed not take to himselfe the gestures of pitie, since his face coulde not put of the markes thereof) greatly moued the two Princes to compassion, which coulde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> not stay in such harts as theirs without seeking remedie. But by and by the occasion was presented: for <hi>Plexirtus</hi> (so was the bastard called) came thether with fortie horse, onely of purpose to murder this brother; of whose comming he had soone aduertisement, and thought no eyes of sufficient credite in such a matter, but his owne; and therefore came himselfe to be actor, and spectator. And as soone as hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> came, not regarding the weake (as hee thought) garde of but two men, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded some of his followers to set their handes to his, in the killing of <hi>Leonatus.</hi> But the young Prince (though not otherwise armed but with a sworde) howe falsely soeuer he was dealt with by others, would not betray him selfe: but braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawing it out, made the death of the first that assayled him, warne his fellowes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to come more warily after him. But then <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Musidorus</hi> were quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come parties (so iust a defence deseruing as much as old friendship) and so did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue them among that companie (more iniurious, then valiant) that many of them lost their liues for their wicked maister.</p>
            <p>Yet perhaps had the number of them at last preuailed, if the King of <hi>Pontus</hi> (late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> by them made so) had not come vnlooked for to their succour. Who (hauing had a dreame which had fixt his imagination vehemently vpon some great daunger
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12151:74"/>
presently to follow those two Princes whom hee most dearely loued) was come in al hast, following as wel as he could their track with a hundreth horses in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, which he thought (considering who then raigned) a fitte place inough to make the stage of any Tragedie.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But then the match had beene so ill made for <hi>Plexirtus,</hi> that his ill-led life, and worse gotten honour should haue tumbled together to destruction; had there not come in <hi>Tydeus</hi> and <hi>Telenor,</hi> with forty or fifty in their suite, to the defence of <hi>Plex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irtus.</hi> These two were brothers, of the noblest house of that country, brought vppe from their infancy with <hi>Plexirtus</hi>: men of such prowesse, as not to knowe feare in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> themselues, and yet to teach it others that shoulde deale with them: for they had often made their liues triumph ouer most terrible daungers; neuer dismaied, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fortunate; and truely no more setled in valure, then disposed to goodnes and iustice, if either they had lighted on a better friend, or could haue learned to make friendship a childe, and not the father of Vertue. But bringing vp (rather then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> choise) hauing first knit their mindes vnto him, (indeede crafty inough, either to hide his faultes, or neuer to shewe them, but when they might pay home) they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly helde out the course, rather to satisfie him, then all the worlde; and rather to be good friendes, then good men: so as though they did not like the euill hee did, yet they liked him that did the euill; and though not councellors of the offence, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> protectors of the offender. Now they hauing heard of this sodaine going out, with so small a company, in a countrey full of euill-wishing mindes toward him (though they knew not the cause) followed him; till they founde him in such case as they were to venture their liues, or else he to loose his: which they did with such force of minde and bodie, that truely I may iustly say, <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Musidorus</hi> had neuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> till then found any, that could make them so well repeate their hardest lesson in the feates of armes. And briefly so they did, that if they ouercame not; yet were they not ouercome, but caried away that vngratefull maister of theirs to a place of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; howsoeuer the Princes laboured to the contrary. But this matter being thus farre begun, it became not the constancy of the Princes so to leaue it; but in all hast <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> making forces both in <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Phrigia,</hi> they had in fewe daies, lefte him but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that one strong place where he was. For feare hauing beene the onely knot that had fastned his people vnto him, that once vntied by a greater force, they all scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from him; like so many birdes, whose cage had beene broken.</p>
            <p>In which season the blinde King (hauing in the chiefe cittie of his Realme, set <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> the crown vppon his son <hi>Leonatus</hi> head) with many teares (both of ioy and sorrow) setting forth to the whole people, his owne fault and his sonnes vertue, after he had kist him, and forst his sonne to accept honour of him (as of his new-become sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect) euen in a moment died, as it should seeme: his heart broken with vnkindenes and affliction, stretched so farre beyond his limits with this excesse of comfort, as it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> was able no longer to keepe safe his vitall spirites. But the new King (hauing no lesse louingly performed all dueties to him dead, then aliue) pursued on the siege of his vnnaturall brother, asmuch for the reuenge of his father, as for the establishing of his owne quiet. In which siege truely I cannot but acknowledge the prowesse of those two brothers, then whome the Princes neuer found in all their trauaile two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> of greater hability to performe, nor of habler skil for conduct.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Plexirtus</hi> finding, that if nothing else, famine would at last bring him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, thought better by humblenes to creepe, where by pride he coulde not
<pb facs="tcp:12151:75"/>
marche. For certainely so had nature formed him, and the exercise of craft con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him to all turningnes of of sleights, that though no man had lesse goodnes in his soule then he, no man could better find the places whence arguments might grow of goodnesse to another: though no man felt lesse pitie, no man could tel bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how to stir pitie: no man more impudent to deny, where proofes were not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> no man more ready to confesse with a repenting manner of aggrauating his owne euill, where denial would but make the fault fowler. Now he tooke this way that hauing gotten a pasport for one (that pretended he woulde put <hi>Plexirtus</hi> aliue into his hands) to speake with the King his brother, he him selfe (though much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the minds of the valiant brothers, who rather wished to die in braue defence)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> with a rope about his necke, barefooted, came to offer himselfe to the discretion of <hi>Leonatus.</hi> Where what submission hee vsed, how cunningly in making greater the faulte he made the faultines the lesse, how artificially he could set out the torments of his owne conscience, with the burdensome comber he had found of his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous desires, how finely seeming to desire nothing but death, as ashamed to liue, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> begd life, in the refusing it, I am not cunning inough to be able to expresse: but so fell out of it, that though at first sight <hi>Leonatus</hi> saw him with no other eie, then as the murderer of his father; and anger already began to paint reuenge in many colours, ere long he had not onely gotten pitie, but pardon, and if not an excuse of the faulte past, yet an opinion of a future amendment: while the poore villaines (chiefe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> of his wickednes, now betraied by the author thereof,) were deliuered to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cruell sorts of death; he so handling it, that it rather seemed, hee had more come into the defence of an vnremediable mischiefe already committed, then that they had done it at first by his consent.</p>
            <p>In such sort the Princes left these reconciled brothers (<hi>Plexirtus</hi> in all his behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> carying him in far lower degree of seruice, then the euer-noble nature of <hi>Leona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> would suffer him) and taking likewise their leaues of their good friend the King of <hi>Pontus</hi> (who returned to enioy their benefite, both of his wife and kingdome) they priuately went thence, hauing onely with them the two valiant brothers, who would needs accompanie them, through diuers places; they foure dooing actes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> more daungerous, though lesse famous, because they were but priuat chiualries: till hearing of the faire and vertuous Queene <hi>Erona</hi> of <hi>Lycia,</hi> besieged by the puissant King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> they bent themselues to her succour, both because the weaker (and weaker as being a Ladie,) and partly because they heard the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> had in his company three of the most famous men liuing, for matters of armes, that were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> knowne to be in the worlde. Whereof one was the Prince <hi>Plangus,</hi> (whose name was sweetned by your breath, peerlesse Ladie, when the last daie it pleased you to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion him vnto me) the other two were two great Princes (though holding of him) <hi>Barzanes</hi> and <hi>Euardes,</hi> men of Giant-like bothe hugenes and force: in which two es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, the trust the King had of victorie, was reposed. And of them, those bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 
               <hi>Tydeus</hi> and <hi>Telenor</hi> (sufficient iudges in warlike matters) spake so high commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, that the two Princes had euen a youthfull longing to haue some triall of their vertue. And therefore as soone as they were entred into <hi>Lycia</hi> they ioyned themselues with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that faithfully serued the poore Queene, at that time besieged: &amp; ere long animated in such sort their almost ouerthrowne harts, that they went by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> force to relieue the towne, though they were depriued of a great part of their stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth by the parting of the two brothers, who were sent for in all hast to returne to their

            <p>But as <hi>Zelmane</hi> was comming to the latter end of her song, she might see the same water-spaniell which before had hunted, come and fetch away one of <hi>Philocleas</hi> gloues; whose fine proportion, shewed well what a daintie guest was wont there to be lodged. It was a delight to <hi>Zelmane,</hi> to see that the dogge was therewith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> and so let him goe a little way withall, who quickly caried it out of sight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong certaine trees and bushes, which were very close together. But by and by he came againe, and amongst the raiments (<hi>Miso</hi> and <hi>Mopsa</hi> being preparing sheets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their comming out) the dog lighted vpon a little booke of four or fiue leaues of paper, and was bearing that away too. But then <hi>Zelmane</hi> (not knowing what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> it might be of) ran after the dog, who going streight to those bushes, she might see the dog deliuer it to a Gentleman who secretly lay there. But she hastily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in, the Gentleman rose vp, and with a courteous (though sad) countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce presented himselfe vnto her. <hi>Zelmanes</hi> eies streight willed her minde to marke him: for she thought, in her life she had neuer seene a man of a more goodly presence, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> whom strong making tooke not away delicacie, nor beautie fiercenesse: being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed such a right manlike man, as Nature often erring, yet shewes she would faine
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:12151:78"/>
make. But when she had a while (not without admiration) vewed him, she desired him to deliuer backe the gloue and paper, because they were the Ladie <hi>Philocleas</hi>; telling him withall, that she would not willingly let them know of his close lying in in that prohibited place, while they were bathing themselues; because she knew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> they would be mortally offended withall. Faire Ladie (answered he) the worst of the complaint is already passed, since I feele of my fault in my selfe the punishment. But for these things I assure you, it was my dogs wanton boldnes, not my presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. With that he gaue her backe the paper: But for the gloue (said he) since it is my Ladie <hi>Philocleas,</hi> giue me leaue to keepe it, since my hart cannot persuade it selfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> to part from it. And I pray you tell the Lady (Lady indeed of all my desires) that owes it, that I will direct my life to honour this gloue with seruing her. O villain (cried out <hi>Zelmane,</hi> madded with finding an vnlooked-for Riuall, and that he would make her a messenger) dispatch (said she) and deliuer it, or by the life of her that owes it, I wil make thy soule (though too base a price) pay for it. And with that drew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> out her sword, which (<hi>Amazon</hi>-like) she euer ware about her. The Gentleman reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself into an open place fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among the bushes; and then drawing out his too, he offred to deliuer it vnto her, saying withall, God forbid I should vse my sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, since (if I be not deceiued) you are the same famous <hi>Amazon,</hi> that both defended my Ladies iust title of beautie against the valiant <hi>Phalantus,</hi> and saued her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> life in killing the Lion: therefore I am rather to kisse your hands, with acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging my selfe bound to obey you. But this courtesie was worse then a bastonado to <hi>Zelmane:</hi> so that againe with ragefull eyes she bad him defend himselfe, for no lesse then his life should answere it. A hard case (said he) to teach my sword that lesson, which hath euer vsed to turne it selfe to a shield in a Ladies presence. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> harkening to no more words, began with such wittie furie to pursue him with blowes and thrusts, that Nature and Vertue commanded the Gentleman to looke to his safetie. Yet still courtesie, that seemed incorporate in his hart, would not be perswaded by daunger to offer any offence, but only to stand vpon the best defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue gard he could; somtimes going backe, being content in that respect to take on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the figure of cowardise; sometime with strong and well-met wards; sometime cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning auoidings of his body; and somtimes faining some blows, which himself puld back before they needed to be withstood. And so with play did he a good while fight against the fight of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> who (more spited with that curtesie, that one that did nothing should be able to resist her) burned away with choller any motions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> which might grow out of her owne sweet dsposition, determining to kill him if he fought no better; and so redoubling her blowes, draue the stranger to no other shift, then to warde, and go backe; at that time seeming the image of innocencie against violence. But at length he found, that both in publike and priuate respects, who stands onely vpon defence, stands vpon no defence: For <hi>Zelmane</hi> seeming to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> strike at his head, and he going to warde it, withall stept backe as he was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, she stopt her blow in the aire, and suddenly turning the point, ranne full at his breast; so as he was driuen with the pommell of his sworde (hauing no other weapon of defence) to beate it downe: but the thrust was so strong, that he could not so wholy beate it awaie, but that it met with his thigh, thorow which it ranne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> But <hi>Zelmane</hi> retiring her sworde, and seeing his bloud, victorious anger was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by the before-conquered pittie; and hartily sorie, and euen ashamed with her selfe she was, considering how little he had done, who well she found
<pb facs="tcp:12151:79"/>
could haue done more. In so much that she said, truly I am sorie for your hurt, but your selfe gaue the cause, both in refusing to deliuer the gloue, and yet not figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as I knowe you could haue done. But (saide shee) because I perceaue you disdayne to fight with a woman, it may be before a year come about, you shall meete with a neere kinsman of mine, <hi>Pyrocles</hi> Prince of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and I giue you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> my worde, he for me shall maintaine this quarell against you. I would (answered <hi>Amphialus</hi>) I had many more such hurtes to meete and know that worthy Prince, whose vertue I loue and admire, though my good destiny hath not bene to see his person.</p>
            <p>But as they were so speaking, the yong Ladies came, to whom <hi>Mopsa</hi> curious in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> any thing, but her own good behauiour) hauing followed and seene <hi>Zelmane</hi> figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, had cried, what she had seene, while they were drying themselues, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (with some drops) seemed to weepe, that it should part from such bodies. But they carefull of <hi>Zelmane</hi> (assuring themselues that any <hi>Arcadian</hi> would beare reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to them) <hi>Pamela</hi> with a noble mind, and <hi>Philoclea</hi> with a louing (hastily hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the beauties, whereof Nature was prowde, and they ashamed) they made quicke worke to come to saue <hi>Zelmane.</hi> But already they found them in talke, and <hi>Zelmane</hi> carefull of his wound. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they saw him they knew it was their cousin germain, the famous <hi>Amphialus</hi>; whom yet with a sweete-graced bitternes they blamed for breaking their fathers commaundement, especially while themselues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> were in such sort retired. But he craued pardon, protesting vnto them that he had onely bene to seeke solitary places, by an extreme melancholy that had a good while possest him, and guided to that place by his spaniell, where while the dog hunted in the riuer, he had withdrawne himselfe to pacifie with sleepe his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watched eyes: till a dreame waked him, and made him see that whereof he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> dreamed, and withall not obscurely signified that he felt the smart of his owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. But <hi>Philoclea</hi> (that was euen iealous of her selfe for <hi>Zelmane</hi>) would needs haue her gloue, and not without so mighty a loure as that face could yeeld. As for <hi>Zelmane</hi> when she knew, it was <hi>Amphialus,</hi> Lord <hi>Amphialus</hi> (said she) I haue long desired to know you, heretofore I must confesse with more good will, but still with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> honoring your vertue, though I loue not your person: and at this time I pray you let vs take care of your wound, vpon condition you shall hereafter promise, that a more knightly combat shalbe performed betweene vs. <hi>Amphialus</hi> answered in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable sort, but with such excusing himselfe, that more and more accused his loue to <hi>Philoclea,</hi> and prouoked more hate in <hi>Zelmane.</hi> But <hi>Mopsa</hi> had already called cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> shepheards not far off (who knew and wel obserued their limits) to come and helpe to carrie away <hi>Amphialus,</hi> whose wound suffered him not without daunger to straine it: and so he leauing himselfe with them, departed from them, faster blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in his hart, then at his wound: which bound vp by the sheetes, wherewith <hi>Philoclea</hi> had bene wrapped, made him thanke the wound, and blesse the sword for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> that fauour.</p>
            <p>He being gone, the Ladies (with mery anger talking, in what naked simplicitie their cousin had seene them) returned to the lodge-warde: yet thinking it too early (as long as they had any day) to breake off so pleasing a company, with going to performe a cumbersome obedience, <hi>Zelmane</hi> inuited them to the little arbour, only <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> reserued for her, which they willingly did: and there sitting, <hi>Pamela</hi> hauing a while made the lute in his language, shew how glad it was to be touched by her fingers,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:12151:79"/>
               <hi>Zelmane</hi> deliuered vp the paper, which <hi>Amphialus</hi> had at first yeelded vnto her: and seeing written vpon the backside of it, the complaint of <hi>Plangus,</hi> remembring what <hi>Dorus</hi> had told her, and desiring to know how much <hi>Philoclea</hi> knew of her estate, she tooke occasion in the presenting of it, to aske whether it were any secret, or no. No <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> truely (answered <hi>Philoclea</hi>) it is but euen an exercise of my fathers writing, vpon this occasion: He was one day somwhile before your comming hether) walking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, hauing vs two with him, almost a mile hence; and crossing a hie way, which comes from the cittie of <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> he saw this Gentleman, whose name is there written, one of the proprest and best-graced men that euer I sawe, being of middle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> age, and of a meane stature.

Of late there raigned a King in <hi>Lydia,</hi> who had for the blessing of his mariage, this onely daughter of his, <hi>Erona</hi>; a Princesse worthie for her beautie, as much praise, as beautie may be prayse-worthy.

But nether she liked perswasions, nor feared threateninges, nor changed for absence: and when she thought him dead, she sought all meanes (as well by poyson as knife) to send her soule, at least, to be maried in the eternall church with him. This so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> brake the tender fathers hart, that (leauing things as he found them) hee shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter died.

            <p>But before she could accomplish all the solemnities, she was ouertaken with a war the King <hi>Tiridates</hi> made vpon her, only for her person; towards whom (for her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> ruine) Loue had kindled his cruel hart; indeed cruell and tyrannous: for (being far too strong in the field) he spared not man, woman, and child, but (as though there could be found no foile to set foorth the extremitie of his loue, but extremity of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred) wrote (as it were) the sonets of his Loue, in the bloud, and tuned them in the cries of her subiects; although his faire sister <hi>Artaxia</hi> (who would accompany <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> him in the army) sought all meanes to appease his fury: till lastly, he besieged <hi>Erona</hi> in her best citie, vowing to winne her, or lose his life. And now had he brought her to the point ether of a wofull consent, or a ruinous deniall; when there came thether (following the course which Vertue and Fortune led them) two excellent young Princes, <hi>Pyrocles</hi> &amp; <hi>Musidorus,</hi> the one Prince of <hi>Macedon,</hi> the other of <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> two princes, as <hi>Plangus</hi> said, (and he witnessed his saying with sighes and teares) the most accomplished both in body &amp; minde, that the Sun euer lookt vpon. While <hi>Philoclea</hi> spake those words, O sweete wordes (thought <hi>Zelmane</hi> to herselfe) which are not onely a praise to mee, but a praise to praise it selfe, which out of that mouth issueth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
            </p>
            <p>These 2. princes (said <hi>Philoclea</hi>) aswell to help the weaker (especially being a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) as ta saue a Greeke people from being ruined by such, whom we call and count Barbarous, gathering to gether such of the honestest <hi>Lycians,</hi> as would venture their liues to succour their Princesse: giuing order by a secret message they sent into the Citie, that they should issue with al force at an appointed time; they set vpon <hi>Tirida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> campe, with so well-guided a fiercenes, that being of both sides assaulted, he was like to be ouerthrowen: but that this <hi>Plangus</hi> (being Generall of <hi>Tiridates</hi> hors-men) especially ayded by the two mightie men, <hi>Euardes</hi> and <hi>Barzanes,</hi> rescued the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen almost defeated: but yet could not barre the Princes (with their succoures both of men and victuall) to enter the Citie.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>Which when <hi>Tiridates</hi> found would make the war long, (which length seemed to him worse then a languishing consumption) he made a challenge of three Princes in his retinue, against those two Princes and <hi>Antiphilus</hi>: and that thereupon the quarrell should be decided; with compact, that neither side should helpe his fellow: but of whose side the more ouercame, with him the victorie should remaine. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> (though <hi>Erona</hi> chose rather to bide the brunt of warre, then venture him, yet) could not for shame refuse the offer, especially since the two strangers that had
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12151:82"/>
no interest in it, did willingly accept it: besides that, he sawe it like enough, that the people (werie of the miseries of war) would rather giue him vp, if they saw him shrinke, then for his sake venture their ruine: considering that the challengers were farre of greater worthinesse then himselfe. So it was agreed vpon; and against <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> was <hi>Euardes,</hi> King of <hi>Bithinia; Barzanes</hi> of <hi>Hircania,</hi> against <hi>Musidorus,</hi> two men, that thought the world scarse able to resist them: and against <hi>Antiphilus</hi> he placed this same <hi>Plangus,</hi> being his owne cousin germain, and sonne to the King of <hi>Iberia.</hi> Now so it fell out that <hi>Musidorus</hi> slewe <hi>Barzanes,</hi> and <hi>Pyrocles Euardes</hi>; which victory those Princes esteemed aboue all that euer they had: but of the other side <hi>Plangus</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> tooke <hi>Antiphilus</hi> prisoner: vnder which colour (as if the matter had bene equall, though indeed it was not, the greater part being ouercome of his side) <hi>Tiridates</hi> continued his war: and to bring <hi>Erona</hi> to a compelled yeelding, sent her word, that he would the third morrow after, before the walles of the towne strike off <hi>Antiphilus</hi> head; without his suite in that space were graunted: adding withall (because he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> had heard of her desperate affection) that if in the meane time she did her selfe any hurt, what tortures could be deuised should be layed vpon <hi>Antiphilus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then lo if <hi>Cupid</hi> be a God, or that the tyranny of our owne thoughts seeme as a God vnto vs. But whatsoeuer it was, then it did set foorth the miserablenes of his effectes: she being drawne to two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traries by one cause. For the loue of him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> her to yeeld to no other: the loue of him commaunded her to preserue his life: which knot might well be cut, but vntied it could not be. So that Loue in her passions (like a right makebate) whispered to both sides arguments of quarrell. What (said he of the one side) doost thou loue <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> ô <hi>Erona?</hi> and shall <hi>Tiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> enioy thy bodie? with what eyes wilt thou looke vpon <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> when he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> shall know that an other possesseth thee? But if thou wilt do it, canst thou do it? canst thou force thy hart? Thinke with thy selfe, if this man haue thee, thou shalt neuer haue more part of <hi>Antiphilus</hi> then if he were dead. But thus much more, that the affection shalbe still gnawing, and the remorse still present. Death perhaps will coole the rage of thy affection: where thus, thou shalt euer loue, and euer lacke. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Thinke this beside, if thou marrie <hi>Tiridates, Antiphilus</hi> is so excellent a man, that long he cannot be from being in some high place maried: canst thou suffer that too? If an other kill him, he doth him the wrong: if thou abuse thy body, thou doost him the wrong. His death is a worke of nature, and either now, or at another time he shal die. But it shalbe thy worke, thy shamefull worke, which is in thy power to shun, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> make him liue to see thy faith falsified, and his bed defiled. But when Loue had well kindled that partie of her thoughts, then went he to the other side. What (said he) O <hi>Erona,</hi> and is thy Loue of <hi>Antiphilus</hi> come to that point, as thou doost now make it a question, whether he shall die, or no? O excellent affection, which for too much loue, will see his head off. Marke well the reasons of the other side, and thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> shalt see, it is but loue of thy selfe which so disputeth. Thou canst not abide <hi>Tirida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi> this is but loue of thy selfe: thou shalt be ashamed to looke vpon him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; this is but feare of shame, and loue of thy selfe: thou shalt want him as much then; this is but loue of thy selfe? he shalbe married; if he be well, why should that grieue thee, but for loue of thy selfe? No, no, pronounce these words if thou canst, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> let <hi>Antiphilus</hi> die. Then the images of each side stood before her vnderstanding; one time she thought she saw <hi>Antiphilus</hi> dying: an other time she thought <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> sawe her by <hi>Tiridates</hi> enioyed: twenty times calling for a seruaunt to carry
<pb facs="tcp:12151:83"/>
message of yeelding, but before he came the minde was altered. She blusht when she considered the effect of granting; she was pale, when she remembred the fruits of denying. For weeping, sighing, wringing her hands, and tearing her haire, were indifferent of both sides. Easily she would haue agreed to haue broken all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations with her owne death, but that the feare of <hi>Antiphilus</hi> furder torments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> staied her. At length, euen the euening before the day apointed of his death, the determination of yeelding preuailed, especially, growing vpon a message of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi>; who with all the coniuring termes he could deuise, besought her to saue his life, vpon any conditions. But she had no sooner sent her messenger to <hi>Tiridates,</hi> but her mind changed, and she went to the two yong Princes, <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Musidorus,</hi> &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> falling downe at their feet, desired them to try some way for her deliuerance; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her selfe resolued, not to ouer-liue <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> nor yet to yeeld to <hi>Tiridates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that knew not what she had done in priuate, prepared that night accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: &amp; as sometimes it fals out, that what is inconstancy, seemes cunning; so did this change indeed stand in as good steed as a witty dissimulation. For it made the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> King as reckles, as them diligent: so that in the dead time of the night, the Princes issued out of the towne; with whom she would needs go, either to die her selfe, or reskew <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> hauing no armour, nor weapon, but affection. And I cannot tell you how, by what deuise (though <hi>Plangus</hi> at large described it) the conclusion was, the wonderfull valour of the two Princes so preuailed, that <hi>Antiphilus</hi> was succou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and the King slaine. <hi>Plangus</hi> was then the chiefe man left in the campe; and therefore seeing no other remedie, conueied in safety into her country <hi>Artaxia,</hi> now Queene of <hi>Armenia</hi>; who with true lamentations, made known to the world, that her new greatnes did no way comfort her in respect of her brothers losse, whom she studied all meanes possible to reuenge vpon euery one of the occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> hauing (as she thought) ouerthrowne her brother by a most abhominable treason. In somuch, that being at home, she proclaimed great rewards to any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man, and her selfe in mariage to any Prince, that would destroy <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Musidorus.</hi> But thus was <hi>Antiphilus</hi> redeemed, and (though against the consent of all her nobility) married to <hi>Erona</hi>; in which case the two Greeke Princes (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> called away by an other aduenture) left them.</p>
            <p>But now me thinkes as I haue read some Poets, who when they intend to tell some horrible matter, they bid men shun the hearing of it: so if I do not desire you to stop your eares from me, yet may I wel desire a breathing time, before I am to tell the execrable treason of <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> that brought her to this misery; and withall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> wish you all, that from all mankind indeed you stop your eares. O most happy were we, if we did set our loues one vpon another. (And as she spake that word, her cheekes in red letters writ more, then her tongue did speake.) And therefore since I haue named <hi>Plangus,</hi> I pray you sister (said she) helpe me with the rest, for I haue held the stage long inough; and if it please you to make his fortune knowne, as I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> haue done <hi>Eronas,</hi> I will after take hart againe to go on with his falshood; and so betweene vs both, my Ladie <hi>Zelmane</hi> shall vnderstand both the cause and parties of this Lamentation. Nay I beshrow me then (said <hi>Miso</hi>) I will none of that, I promise you, as long as I haue the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I wil first haue my tale, &amp; then my Lady <hi>Pame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> my Lady <hi>Zelmane,</hi> &amp; my daughter <hi>Mopsa</hi> (for <hi>Mopsa</hi> was then returned from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus</hi>)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> may draw cuts, &amp; the shortest cut speake first.

The Ladies laughed to see with what an eger earnestnesse she looked, hauing threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning not onely in her Ferret eies, but while she spake, her nose seeming to threaten her chin, &amp; her shaking lims one to threaten another. But there was no remedy, they must obey: and <hi>Miso</hi> (sitting on the ground with her knees vp, and her hands vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> her knees) tuning her voice with many a quauering cough, thus discoursed vnto them. I tell you true (said she) whatsoeuer you thinke of me, you will one day be as I am; &amp; I, simple though I sit here, thought once my pennie as good siluer, as some of you do: and if my father had not plaid the hasty foole (it is no lie I tell you) I might haue had an other-gaines husband, then <hi>Dametas.</hi> But let that passe, God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> him: and yet I speake it not without good cause. You are full in your tittle tattlings of <hi>Cupid:</hi> here is <hi>Cupid,</hi> &amp; there is <hi>Cupid.</hi> I will tell you now, what a good old woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> told me, what an old wise man told her, what a great learned clerke told him, and gaue it him in writing; and here I haue it in my praier booke. I pray you (said <hi>Philoclea</hi>) let vs see it, &amp; read it. No hast but good (said <hi>Miso</hi>) you shal first know how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> I came by it. I was a young girle of a seuen and twenty yeare old, &amp; I could not go thorow the streate of our village, but I might heare the young men talke; O the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie little eies of <hi>Miso</hi>; O the fine thin lips of <hi>Miso</hi>; O the goodly fat hands of <hi>Miso:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, how well a certaine wrying I had of my necke, became me. Then the one would wincke with one eye, and the other cast daiseys at me: I must confesse, seing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> so many amorous, it made me set vp my peacocks tayle with the hiest. Which when this good old woman perceiued (O the good wold woman, well may the bones rest of the good wold woman) she cald me to her into her house. I remember full well it stood in the lane as you go to the Barbers shop, all the towne knew her, there was a great losse of her: she called me to her, and taking first a soppe of wine to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> her hart (it was of the same wine that comes out of <hi>Candia,</hi> which we pay so deere for now adaies, and in that good world was very good cheape) she cald me to her; Minion said she, (indeed I was a pretie one in those daies though I say it) I see a number of lads that loue you; Well (said she) I say no more: doo you know what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Loue is? With that she brought me into a corner, where there was painted a foule fiend I trow: for he had a paire of hornes like a Bull, his feete clouen, as many eyes vpon his bodie, as my gray-mare hath dappels, &amp; for all the world so placed. This monster sat like a hangman vpon a paire of gallowes, in his right hand he was pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted holding a crowne of Laurel, in his left hand a purse of mony, &amp; out of his mouth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> hong a lace of two faire pictures, of a man and a woman, and such a countenance he shewed, as if he would perswade folks by those alureme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to come thither &amp; be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. I, like a tender harted wench, skriked out for feare of the diuell. Well (said she) this same is euen Loue: therefore do what thou list with all those fellows, one after another; and it recks not much what they do to thee, so it be in secret; but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my charge, neuer loue none of them. Why mother (said I) could such a thing come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the belly of the faire <hi>Venus?</hi> for a few dayes before, our (priest betweene him &amp; me) had told me the whole storie of <hi>Venus.</hi> Tush (said she) they are all deceaued: and therwith gaue me this Booke, which she said a great maker of ballets had giuen to an old painter, who for a litle pleasure, had bestowed both booke and picture of her. Reade there (said she) &amp; thou shalt see that his mother was a cowe, and the false <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>
               <hi>Argus</hi> his father. And so she gaue me this Booke, and there now you may reade it. With that the remembrance of the good old woman, made her make such a face to weepe, as if it were not sorrow, it was the carkasse of sorrow that appeared there.

But <hi>Pamela</hi> pleasantly persisting to haue fortune their iudge, they set hands, and <hi>Mopsa</hi> (though at the first for squea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishnes going vp and downe, with her head like a boate in a storme) put to her golden gols among them, and blind Fortune (that saw not the coulor of them) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> gaue her the preheminence: and so being her time to speake (wiping her mouth, as there was good cause) she thus tumbled into her matter. In time past (sayd she) there was a King, the mightiest man in all his country, that had by his wife, the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest daughter that euer did eate pappe. Now this King did keepe a great house, that euery body might come and take their meat freely. So one day, as his daughter was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> sitting in her window, playing vpon a harpe, as sweete as any Rose; and combing her head with a combe all of precious stones, there came in a Knight into the court, vpon a goodly horse, one haire of gold, and the other of siluer; <hi>and so</hi> the Knight ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting vp his eyes to the window, did fall into such loue with her, that he grew not worth the bread he eate; till many a sorry day going ouer his head, with Dayly Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and Grisly Grones, he wan her affection, so that they agreed to run away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither. <hi>And so in May, when all true hartes reioyce,</hi> they stale out of the Castel, without staying so much as for their breakfast. Now forsooth, as they went togither, often all to kissing one another, the Knight told her, he was brought vp among the water Nymphes, who had so bewitched him, that if he were euer askt his name, he must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> presently vanish away: and therefore charged her vpon his blessing, that she neuer aske him what he was, nor whether he would. <hi>And so</hi> a great while she kept his commandement; til once, passing through a cruell wildernes, as darke as pitch; her mouth so watred, that she could not choose but aske him the question. And then, he making the greeuousest complaints that would haue melted a tree to haue heard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> them, vanisht quite away: and she lay downe, casting forth as pitifull cries as any shrich-owle. But hauing laien so, (wet by the raine, &amp; burnt by the Sun) fiue dayes, and fiue nights, she gat vp and went ouer many a high hill, and many a deepe riuer; till she came to an Aunts house of hers; and came, and cried to her for helpe: and she for pittie gaue her a Nut, and bad her neuer open her Nut, till she was come to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> the extremest misery that euer tongue could speake of. <hi>And so</hi> she went, and she went, and neuer rested the euening, where she went in the morning; till she came to a second Aunt; and she gaue her another Nut.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12151:85"/>Now good <hi>Mopsa</hi> (said the sweete <hi>Philoclea</hi>) I pray thee at my request keepe this tale, till my marriage day, and I promise thee that the best gowne I weare that day shalbe thine. <hi>Mopsa</hi> was very glad of the bargaine, especially that it should grow a festiuall Tale: so that <hi>Zelmane,</hi> who desired to finde the vttermost what these La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies vnderstood touching her selfe, and hauing vnderstood the danger of <hi>Erona</hi> (of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> which before she had neuer heard) purposing with her selfe (as soone as this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit she now was in, was brought to any effect) to succour her, entreated againe, that she might know as well the story of <hi>Plangus,</hi> as of <hi>Erona. Philoclea</hi> referred it to her sisters perfecter remembrance, who with so sweet a voice, and so winning a grace, as in themselues were of most forcible eloquence to procure attention, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> this maner to their earnest request soone condiscended.</p>
            <p>The father of this Prince <hi>Plangus</hi> as yet liues, and is King of <hi>Iberia:</hi> a man (if the iudgement of <hi>Plangus</hi> may be accepted) of no wicked nature, nor willingly doing euill, without himselfe mistake the euill, seeing it disguised vnder some forme of goodnesse. This Prince, being married at the first to a Princesse (who both from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> her auncesters, and in her selfe was worthy of him) by her had this sonne, <hi>Plangus.</hi> Not long after whose birth, the Queene (as though she had perfourmed the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage for which she was sent into the world) returned againe vnto her maker. The King (sealing vp all thoughts of loue vnder the image of her memorie) remained a widdower many yeares after; recompencing the griefe of that disioyning from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> her, in conioyning in himselfe both a fatherly and a motherly care toward her onely child, <hi>Plangus.</hi> Who being growne to mans age, as our owne eies may iudge, could not but fertilly requite his fathers fatherly education.</p>
            <p>This Prince (while yet the errors in his nature were excused by the greenenes of his youth, which tooke all the fault vpon it selfe) loued a priuate mans wife of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> principall Citie of that Kingdome, if that may be called loue, which he rather did take into himselfe willingly, then by which he was taken forcibly. It sufficeth, that the yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perswaded himself he loued her: she being a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beautifull enough, if it be possible, that the onely outside can iustly entitle a beauty. But finding such a chase as onely fledde to be caught, the young Prince brought his affection with her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> to that point, which ought to engraue remorse in her hart, &amp; to paint shame vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her face. And so possest he his desire without any interruption; he constantly fauouring her, and she thinking, that the enameling of a Princes name, might hide the spots of a broken wedlock. But as I haue seene one that was sick of a sleeping disease, could not be made wake, but with pinching of him: so out of his sinfull sleepe his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> minde (vnworthie so to be lost) was not to be cald to it selfe, but by a sharpe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. It fell out, that his many-times leauing of the court (in vndue times) began to be noted; and (as Princes eares be manifolde) from one to another came vnto the King; who (carefull of his onely sonne) sought, and found by his spies (the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie euill seruaunts to a King) what it was, whereby he was from his better delights <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> so diuerted. Whereupon, the King (to giue his fault the greater blow) vsed such meanes, by disguising himselfe, that he found them (her husband being absent) in her house together: which he did, to make him the more feelingly ashamed of it. And that way he tooke, laying threatnings vpon her, and vpon him reproaches. But the poore young Prince (deceiued with that young opinion, that if it be euer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> lawful to lie, it is for ones Louer,) employed all his wit to bring his father to a better opinion. And because he might bende him from that (as he counted it) crooked
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:12151:85"/>
conceit of her he wrested him, as much as he coulde possiblie, to the other side: not sticking with prodigal protestations to set foorth her chastitie; not denying his own attempt, but thereby the more extolling her vertue. His Sophistrie preuayled, his father beleeued; and so beleeued, that ere long (though he were already stept into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the winter of his age) he founde himselfe warme in those desires, which were in his sonne farre more excusable. To be short, he gaue himselfe ouer vnto it; and (because he would auoide the odious comparison of a yong riuall) sent away his sonne with an armie, to the subduing of a Prouince lately rebelled against him, which he knew could not be a lesse worke, then of three or foure yeares. Wherein he behaued him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> so worthilie, as euen to this country the fame thereof came, long before his owne comming: while yet his father had a speedier succes, but in a far vnnobler conquest. For while <hi>Plangus</hi> was away, the old man (growing onely in age and affection) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his suite with all meanes of vnhonest seruants, large promises, and each thing els that might help to counteruaile his owne vnlouelines.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> And she (whose husband about that time died) forgetting the absent <hi>Plangus,</hi> or at lest not hoping of him to obtaine so aspiring a purpose, lefte no art vnused, which might keepe the line from breaking, whereat the fishe was alredy taken; not draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him violently, but letting him play himselfe vpon the hooke, which he had so greedily swalowed. For, accompanying her mourning garments with a dolefull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> countenaunce, yet neither forgetting handsomnes in her mourning garments, nor sweetenes in her dolefull countenance; her wordes were euer seasoned with sighes; and any fauour she shewed, bathed in teares, that affection might see cause of pity; and pity might perswade cause of affection. And being growen skilful in his humors she was no lesse skilfull in applying his humors: neuer suffering his feare to fall to a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> despaire, nor his hope to hasten to an assurance: shee was content he should thinke that she loued him; and a certaine stolne looke should sometimes (as though it were against her will) bewray it: But if thereupon hee grewe bolde, hee straight was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tered with a maske of vertue. And that which seemeth most impossible vnto me, (for as neere as I can I repeate it as <hi>Plangus</hi> tolde it) she could not only sigh when she <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> would, as all can doo; &amp; weep whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she would, as (they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay) some can doo; but (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most impudent in her heart) she could, when she would, teach her chekes blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; make shamefastnes the cloake of shamelesnes. In sum, to leaue out many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities which he recited, she did not only vse so the spurre, that his Desire ran on, but so the bit, that it ran on euen in such a careere as she would haue it; that within a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> while the king, seing with no other eys but such as she gaue him, &amp; thinking on other thoughts, but such as she taught him; hauing at the first liberal measure of fauors, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shortned of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most his Desire was inflam'd; he saw no other way but mariage to satisfie his longing, and her minde (as he thought) louing, but chastly louing. So that by the time <hi>Plangus</hi> returned from being notably victorious of the Rebels, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> found his father, not onely maried, but alredy a father of a sonne and a da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ghter by this woman. Which though <hi>Plangus</hi> (as he had euery way iust cause) was grieued at; yet did his griefe neuer bring foorth ether contemning of her, or repining at his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But she (who besides she was growen a mother, and a stepmother, did read in his eies her owne fault, and made his conscience her guiltines) thought still that his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> presence caried her condemnation: so much the more, as that she (vnchastly attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his wonted fancie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) found (for the reuerence of his fathers bed) a bitter refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which breeding rather spite then shame in her, or if it were a shame, a shame not
<pb facs="tcp:12151:86"/>
of the fault, but of the repulse, she did not onely (as hating him) thirst for a reuenge, but (as fearing harm form him) endeuoured to doo harme vnto him. Therefore did she trie the vttermost of her wicked wit, how to ouerthrow him in the foundation of his strength, which was, in the fauour of his father: which because she saw strong both in nature and desert, it required the more cunning how to vndermine it. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> therefore (shunning the ordinary trade of hireling sycophants) shee made her prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of him, to be accusations; and her aduancing him, to be his ruine. For first with words (neerer admiration then liking) she would extoll his excellencies, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of his shape, the power of his witte, the valiantnes of his courage, the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natenes of his successes: so as the father might finde in her a singular loue towards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> him: nay, shee shunned not to kindle some fewe sparkes of ielousie in him. Thus hauing gotten an opinion in his father, that shee was farre from meaning mischiefe to the sonne, then fell shee to praise him with no lesse vehemencie of affection, but with much more cunning of malice. For then she sets foorth the liberty of his mind the high flying of his thoughts, the fitnesse in him to beare rule, the singular loue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the Subiects bare him; that it was doubtfull, whether his wit were greater in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their fauours, or his courage in imploying their fauours: that he was not borne to liue a subiect-life, each action of his bearing in it Maiestie, such a Kingly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, such a Kingly magnificence, such a Kingly harte for enterprises: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally remembring those vertues, which in successor are no more honoured by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> subiects, then suspected of the Princes. Then would shee by putting-off obiections, bring in obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to her husbands head, already infected with suspitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nay (would she say) I dare take it vpon my death, that he is no such sonne, as many of like might haue bene, who loued greatnes so well, as to build their greatnes vpon their fathers ruine. Indeed Ambition, like Loue, can abide no lingring, and euer vrgeth on his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> owne successes; hating no thing, but what may stop them. But the Gods forbid, we should euer once dreame of any such thing in him, who perhaps might be content, that you and the world should know, what he can do: but the more power he hath to hurte, the more admirable is his praise, that he will not hurt. Then euer remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring to strengthen the suspition of his estate with priuate ielousie of her loue, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> him excessiue honour whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was in presence, &amp; repeating his pretie speaches and graces in his absence; besides, causing him to be imployed in all such dangerous matters, as ether he should perish in them, or if hee preuailed, they should increase his glorie: which she made a weapon to wound him, vntill she found that suspition began already to speake for it selfe, and that her husbands eares were growne hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> of rumours, and his eies prying into euery accident.</p>
            <p>Then tooke she help to her of a seruant neere about her husband, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she knew to be of a hasty ambition, and such a one, who wanting true sufficiencie to raise him, would make a ladder of any mischiefe. Him shee vseth to deale more plainely in alleaging causes of iealousie, making him knowe the fittest times when her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> husband already was stirred that way. And so they two, with diuers wayes, nourished one humour, like Musitians, that singing diuers parts, make one musicke. He sometime with fearefull countenaunce would desire the King to looke to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; for that all the court and Cittie were full of whisperinges, and expectation of some soddaine change, vpon what ground himselfe knew not. Another time hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> would counsell the King to make much of his sonne, and holde his fauour, for that it was too late now to keepe him vnder. Now seeming to feare himselfe, because
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:12151:86"/>
(he said) <hi>Plangus</hi> loued none of them that were great about his father. Lastly, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him directly (making a sorrowful countenance, and an humble gesture beare false witnesse for his true meaning) that he found, not onely souldiery, but people weary of his gouernment, and all their affections bent vpon <hi>Plangus.</hi> Both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> he and the Queene concurring in strange dreames, and each thing else, that in a minde (already perplexed) might breed astonishment: so that within a while, all <hi>Plangus</hi> actions began to be translated into the language of suspition.</p>
            <p>Which though <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngus</hi> found, yet could he not auoid, euen contraries being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to draw one yoke of argument: if he were magnificent, he spent much with an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> aspiring intent: if he spared, hee heaped much with an aspiring intent: if hee spake curteously, he angled the peoples harts: if he were silent he mused vpon some daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous plot. In summe, if hee could haue turned himselfe to as many formes as <hi>Proteus,</hi> euery forme should haue bene made hideous.</p>
            <p>But so it fell out, that a meere trifle gaue them occasion of further proceeding. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> The King one morning, going to a vineyard that lay a long the hill where vpon his castle stood, he saw a vine-labourer, that finding a bowe broken, tooke a branch of the same bowe for want of another thing, and tied it about the place broken. The King asking the fellow what he did, Marry (said he) I make the sonne binde the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This word (finding the King alredy supersticious through suspition) amazed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> him streight, as a presage of his owne fortune: so that, returning, and breaking with his wife how much he misdoubted his estate, she made such gaine-saying answeres as while they straue, straue to be ouercome. But euen while the doubtes most boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, she thus nourished them.</p>
            <p>She vnder-hand dealt with the principall men of that country, that at the great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Parliament (which was then to bee held) they should in the name of all the estates perswade the King (being now stept deeply into old age) to make <hi>Plangus,</hi> his asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate in gouernment with him: assuring them, that not onely she would ioine with them, but that the father himfelfe would take it kindly; charging them not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
               <hi>Plangus</hi> withall; for that perhaps it might be harmefull vnto him, if the King should finde, that he were a party. They (who thought they might do it, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly willingly, because they loued him, and truely, because such indeed was the mind of the people, but safely because she who ruled the King was agreed thereto) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished her counsell: she indeed keeping promise of vehement perswading the same: which the more she and they did, the more shee knew her husband woulde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> feare, and hate the cause of his feare. <hi>Plangus</hi> found this, and humbly protested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such desire, or will to accept. But the more hee protested, the more his father thought he dissembled, accounting his integrity to be but a cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning face of falshood: and therefore delaying the desire of his subiects, attended some fit occasion to lay hands vpon his sonne: which his wife thus brought to passe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> She caused that same minister of hers to go vnto <hi>Plangus,</hi> and (enabling his words with great shew of faith, and endearing them with desire of secresie) to tell him, that he found his ruine conspired by his stepmother, with certaine of the noble men of that country, the King himselfe giuing his consent, and that few daies shoulde passe before the putting it in practize: with all discouering the very truth indeede, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> with what cunning his stepmother had proceeded. This agreing with <hi>Plangus</hi> his owne opinion, made him giue him the better credit: yet not so far, as to flie out of his country (according to the naughty fellowes persuasion) but to attend, and to
<pb facs="tcp:12151:87"/>
see further. Whereupon the fellow (by the direction of his mistresse) told him one day, that the same night about one of the clocke, the King had appointed to haue his wife, and those noble men together, to deliberate of their manner of proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Plangus</hi>: and therefore offered him, that if himselfe would agree, hee woulde bring him into a place where hee should heare all that passed; and so haue the more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> reason both to himselfe, and to the world, to seeke his safetie. The poore <hi>Plangus</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subiect to that onely disaduantage of honest harts, credulitie) was perswaded by him: and arming himselfe (because of his late going) was closely conueied into the place appointed. In the meane time his stepmother, making al her gestures cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly counterfait a miserable affliction, she lay almost groueling on the flower of her cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> not suffering any body to comfort her; vntill they calling for her husband, and he held of with long enquiry, at length, she tolde him (euen almost crying out euery word) that she was wery of her life, since shee was brought to that plunge, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conceale her husbands murther, or accuse her sonne, who had euer beene more deare, then a sonne vnto her. Then with many interruptions and exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> she tolde him, that her sonne <hi>Plangus</hi> (solliciting her in the olde affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them) had besought her to put her helping hand to the death of the King; assuring her, that though all the lawes in the world were against it, he would marrie her when he were King.</p>
            <p>She had not fully said thus much, with many pitifull digressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, when in comes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the same fellow, that brought <hi>Pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gus</hi>: &amp; ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning himself out of breath, fell at the Kings feet, beseeching him to saue himself; for that there was a man with a sword drawen in the next roome. The King affrighted, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out, &amp; called his gard, who entring the place, fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d indeed <hi>Plangus</hi> with his sword in his hand, but not naked, but standing suspiciously inough, to one already suspicious. The King (thinking hee had put vp <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> his sworde because of the noise) neuer tooke leasure to heare his answer, but made him prisoner, meaning the next morning to put him to death in the market place.</p>
            <p>But the day had no sooner opened the eies &amp; eares of his friends &amp; followers, but that there was a little army of them, who came, &amp; by force deliuered him; although numbers on the other side (abused with the fine framing of their report) took armes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> for the King. But <hi>Plangus,</hi> though he might haue vsed the force of his friends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge his wrong, and get the crowne; yet the naturall loue of his father, and hate to make their suspition seeme iust, caused him rather to choose a voluntarie exile, then to make his fathers death the purchase of his life: and therefore went he to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridates,</hi> whose mother was his fathers sister, liuing in his Court eleuen or twelue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> yeares, euer hoping by his intercession, and his owne desert, to recouer his fathers grace. At the end of which time, the warre of <hi>Erona</hi> happened, which my sister with the cause thereof discoursed vnto you.</p>
            <p>But his father had so deeply engraued the suspition in his hart, that he thought his flight rather to proceed of a fearefull guiltines, then of an humble faithfulnes; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> therefore continued his hate, with such vehemencie, that he did euen hate his Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hew <hi>Tiridates,</hi> and afterwardes his neece <hi>Artaxia,</hi> because in their Court hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued countenance, leauing no meanes vnattempted of destroying his son; among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, employing that wicked seruant of his, who vndertooke to empoyson him. But his cunning disguised him not so well, but that the watchful seruants of <hi>Plangus</hi> did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> discouer him. Whereupon the wretch was taken, &amp; (before his well deserued exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution) by torture forced to confesse the particularities of this, which in generall I
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12151:87"/>
haue told you.</p>
            <p>Which confession autentically set downe (though <hi>Tiridates</hi> with solemne Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage sent it to the King) wrought no effect. For the King hauing put the reines of the gouernment into his wiues hande, neuer did so much as reade it; but sent it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> streight by her to be considered. So as they rather heaped more hatred vpon <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> for the death of their seruaunt. And now finding, that his absence, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports had much diminished the wauering peoples affection towardes <hi>Plangus,</hi> with aduauncing fit persons for faction, and graunting great immunities to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, they preuailed so farre; as to cause the sonne of the second wife, called <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> to be proclaymed successour, and <hi>Plangus</hi> quite excluded: so that <hi>Plangus</hi> was driuen to continue his seruing <hi>Tiridates,</hi> as hee did in the warre against <hi>Erona,</hi> and brought home <hi>Artaxia,</hi> as my sister tolde you; when <hi>Erona</hi> by the treason of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphilus,</hi> But at that word she stopped. For <hi>Basilius</hi> (not able longer to abide their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence) came sodainly among them, and with smiling countenance (telling <hi>Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> hee was affraid shee had stollen away his daughters) inuited them to follow the Sunnes counsell in going then to their lodging; for indeed the Sun was readie to set. They yeelded, <hi>Zelmane</hi> meaning some other time to vnderstand the storie of <hi>Antiphilus</hi> treason, and <hi>Eronas</hi> daunger, whose cause she greatly tendred. But <hi>Miso</hi> had no sooner espied <hi>Basilius,</hi> but that as spitefully, as her rotten voice could vtter it, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> she set foorth the sawcinesse of <hi>Amphialus.</hi> But <hi>Basilius</hi> onely attended what <hi>Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> opinion was, who though she hated <hi>Amphialus,</hi> yet the nobilitie of her courage preuailed ouer it, and shee desired he might be pardoned that youthfull error; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the reputation he had, to be one of the best knights in the world; so as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after he gouerned himselfe, as one remembring his fault. <hi>Basilius</hi> giuing the infinite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> tearmes of praises to <hi>Zelmanes</hi> both valour in conquering, and pittifulnesse in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning, commanded no more wordes to be made of it, since such he thought was her pleasure.</p>
            <p>So brought he them vp to visite his wife, where betweene her, and him, the poore <hi>Zelmane</hi> receaued a tedious entertainement; oppressed with being loued, almost as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> much, as with louing. <hi>Basilius</hi> not so wise in couering his passion, coulde make his tong go almost no other pace, but to runne into those immoderate praises, which the foolish Louer thinkes short of his Mistres, though they reach farre beyond the heauens. But <hi>Gynecia</hi> (whome womanly modestie did more outwardly bridle) yet did oftentimes vse the aduantage of her sexe in kissing <hi>Zelmane,</hi> as shee sate vpon her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> bedde-side by her; which was but still more and more sweete incense, to cast vpon the fire wherein her harte was sacrificed: Once <hi>Zelmane</hi> coulde not stirre, but that, (as if they had bene poppets, whose motion stoode onely vpon her pleasure) <hi>Basili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> with seruiceable steppes, <hi>Gynecia</hi> with greedie eyes would follow her. <hi>Basilius</hi> mind <hi>Gynecia</hi> well knew, and could haue found in her hart to laugh at, if mirth could haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> borne any proportion with her fortune. But all <hi>Gynecias</hi> actions were interpreted by <hi>Basilius,</hi> as proceeding from iealousie of his amorousnesse. <hi>Zelmane</hi> betwixt both (like the poore childe, whose father while he beates him, will make him beleeue it is for loue; or like the sicke man, to whom the Phisition sweares, the ill-tasting wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish medicine he profers, is of a good taste) their loue was hatefull, their courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> troublesome, their presence cause of her absence thence, were not only her light, but her life consisted. Alas (thought she to her selfe) Deare <hi>Dorus,</hi> what ods is there betweene thy destiny and mine? For thou hast to doo in thy pursuite but with shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdish

folkes, who trouble thee with a little enuious care, and affected diligence. But I (besides that I haue now <hi>Miso</hi> the worst of thy diuels, let loose vpon me) am waited on by Princes, and watched by the two wakefull eyes of Loue and Iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. Alas, incomparable <hi>Philoclea,</hi> thou euer seest me, but dost neuer see me as I am: thou hearest willingly all that I dare say, and I dare not say that which were most fit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> for thee to heare. Alas who euer but I was imprisoned in libertie, and banished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still present? To whom but me haue louers bene iaylours, &amp; honour a captiuitie?</p>
            <p>But the night comming on with her silent steps vpon them, they parted each fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other (if at lest they could bee parted, of whom euery one did liue in another) and went about to flatter sleepe with their beds, that disdained to bestow it selfe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> vpon such eies which by their will would euer be looking: and in lest measure vpon <hi>Gynecia.</hi> who (when <hi>Basilius</hi> after long tossing was gotten a sleepe, and the cheereful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of the lights remoued her) kneeling vp in her bed, began with a soft voice, and swolne hart, to renue the curses of her birth; &amp; then in a maner em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing her bed; Ah chastest bed of mine (said she) which neuer heretofore couldst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> accuse me of one defiled thought, how canst thou now receaue this desastred cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? Happie, happie be they onely which bee not: and thy blessednes onely in this respect thou maiest feele, that thou hast no feeling. With that she furiously tare off great part of her faire haire: Take here ô forgotten vertue (saide shee) this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable sacrifice; while my soule was clothed with modestie, that was a comely orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> now why should nature crowne that head, which is so wicked, as her onely despaire is, she cannot be enough wicked? More she would haue said, but that <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> (awaked with the noise) tooke her in his armes, and began to comfort her; the good-man thinking, it was all for a iealous loue of him: which humor if she would a little haue maintained, perchance it might haue weakned his new conceaued fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> But hee finding her answers wandring from the purpose, left her to herselfe (glad the next morning to take the aduantage of a sleepe, which a little before day, ouer-watched with sorrow, her teares had as it were sealed vp in her eyes) to haue the more conference with <hi>Zelmane,</hi> who baited on this fashion by these two louers, and euer kept for many meane to declare herselfe, found in her selfe a dayly encrease <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of her violent desires; like a riuer the more swelling, the more his current is stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
            <p>The chiefe recreation she could finde in her anguish, was sometime to visite that place, where first she was so happy as to see the cause of her vnhap. There would she kisse the ground, and thanke the trees, blisse the aier, &amp; doo dutifull reuerence to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> thing that she thought did accompany her at their first meeting: then returne againe to her inward thoughts; sometimes despaire darkning all her imaginations, sometimes the actiue passion of Loue cheering and cleering her inuention, how to vnbar that combersome hinderance of her two ill-matched louers, But this mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Basilius</hi> himself gaue her good occasion to go beyond them.

               <hi>Basilius</hi> made no great haste from behind the tree, till he perceaued she had fully <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> ended her musick. But then loth to loose the pretious fruite of time, he presented himselfe vnto her, falling downe vpon both his knees, and holding vp his hands, as the old gouernesse of <hi>Danae</hi> is painted, when she sodainly saw the golden shoure, O heauenly woman, or earthly Goddesse (said he) let not my presence be odious vnto you, nor my humble suite seeme of small weight in your eares.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as she could not imagine what they might intend. Intend? (said <hi>Basilius,</hi> proud that that was brought in question) what may they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> intend, but a refreshing of my soule, and a swaging of my heat, and enioying those your excellencies, wherein my life is vpheld, and my death threatned? <hi>Zelmane</hi> lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp her face as if she had receaued a mortall iniurie of him. And is this the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion your ceremonies haue bene bent vnto? said she: Is it the disdaine of my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, or the opinion of my lightnesse, that haue emboldned such base fancies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> me? enioying quoth you? now little ioy come to them that yeeld to such enioying. Poore <hi>Basilius</hi> was so appalled, that his legges bowed vnder him; his eyes lookt as though he would gladly hide himselfe; and his old blood going to his hart, a generall shaking all ouer his bodie possessed him. At length with a wanne mouth; he was about to giue a stammering answere, when it came into <hi>Zelmanes</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> head by this deuise to make her profite of his folly; and therefore with a relented countenance, thus said vnto him. Your words (mightie Prince) were vnfit either for me to heare, or you to speake: but yet the large testimonie I see of your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction makes me willing to suppresse a great number of errors. Onely thus much I thinke good to say, that the same words in my Ladie <hi>Philocleas</hi> mouth, as from one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> woman to another (so as there were no other bodie by) might haue had a better grace; and perchance haue found a gentler receipt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Basilius</hi> (whose senses by Desire were held open, and conceipt was by Loue
<pb facs="tcp:12151:89"/>
quickned) heard scarcely halfe her answere out, but that (as if speedie flight might saue his life) he turned away, and ran with all the speede his bodie would suffer him, towards his daughter <hi>Philoclea:</hi> whom he found at that time duetifully wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching by her mother, and <hi>Miso</hi> curiouslie watching her; hauing left <hi>Mopsa</hi> to doo the like seruice to <hi>Pamela. Basilius</hi> foorthwith calling <hi>Philoclea</hi> aside, (with all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> coniuring words which Desire could endite, and authoritie vtter) besought her she would preserue his life, in whom her life was begonne; she would saue his graye haires from rebuke, and his aged mind from despaire; that if she were not cloyed with his companie, and that she thought not the earth ouer-burdened with him, she would coole his fierie griefe, which was to be done but by her breath. That in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> fine, whatsoeuer he was, he was nothing but what it pleased <hi>Zelmane</hi>; all the powers of his spirite depending of her: that if she continued cruell, he could no more su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine his life, then the earth remaine fruitefull in the Sunnes continuall absence. He concluded, she should in one payment requite all his deserts: and that she nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not disdaine any seruice (though neuer so meane) which was warranted by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the sacred name of a father. <hi>Philoclea</hi> more glad then euer she had knowen her selfe, that she might by this occasion, enioy the priuate conference of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> yet had so sweete a feeling of vertue in her minde, that she would not suffer a vile colour to be cast ouer her faire thoughts; but with humble grace answered her father: That there needed neither promise nor perswasion to her, to make her doo her vttermost <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> for her fathers seruice. That for <hi>Zelmanes</hi> fauour, she would in all vertuous sort seeke it towards him: and that as she would not pearce further into his meaning, then himselfe should declare, so would she interprete all his doings to be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in goodnes: and therefore desired, (if otherwise it were) that he would not impart it to her, who then should be forced to beginne (by true obedience) a shew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> of disobedience: rather perfourming his generall commandement, which had euer beene, to embrace vertue, then any new particular, sprong out of passion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the former. <hi>Basilius</hi> content to take that, since he could haue no more (thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a great point, if by her meanes, he could get but a more free accesse vnto <hi>Zelmane</hi>) allowed her reasons, and tooke her proffer thankfully, desiring only a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> returne of comfort. <hi>Philoclea</hi> was parting, and <hi>Miso</hi> streight behind her, like <hi>Alecto</hi> following <hi>Proserpina.</hi> But <hi>Basilius</hi> forced her to stay, though with much a doo, she being sharp-set vpon the fulfilling of a shrewde office, in ouer-looking <hi>Philoclea:</hi> and so said to <hi>Basilius,</hi> that she did as she was commanded, and could not answere it to <hi>Gynecia,</hi> if she were any whit from <hi>Philoclea:</hi> telling him true, that he did euill to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> take her charge from her. But <hi>Basilius,</hi> (swearing he would put out her eyes, if she stird a foote to trouble his daughter) gaue her a stop for that while.</p>
            <p>So away departed <hi>Philoclea,</hi> with a new field of fancies for her trauayling mind. For well she sawe, her father was growen her aduerse partie, and yet her fortune such, as she must fauour her Riuall; and the fortune of that fortune such, as neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> that did hurt her, nor any contrarie meane helpe her.</p>
            <p>But she walkt but a little on, before she saw <hi>Zelmane</hi> lying vpon a banke, with her face so bent ouer <hi>Ladon,</hi> that (her teares falling into the water) one might haue thought, that she began meltingly to be metamorphosed to the vnder-running ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. But by and by, with speech she made knowen, as well that she liued, as that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> she sorrowed. Faire streames (said she) that do vouchsafe in your cleerenes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present vnto me my blubbered face, let the tribute-offer of my teares vnto you,

But now she demaunded leaue not to loose this long sought-for commoditie of time, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> ease her hart thus farre, that if in her agonies her destinie was to be condemned by <hi>Philocleas</hi> mouth, at lest <hi>Philoclea</hi> might know, whom she had condemned. <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi> easily yeelded to graunt her owne desire: and so making the greene banke

the situation, and the riuer the prospect of the most beautifull buildings of Nature, <hi>Zelmane</hi> doubting how to beginne, though her thoughts already had runne to the ende, with a minde fearing the vnworthinesse of euery word that should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to her eares, at length brought it forth in this manner.</p>
            <p>Most beloued Ladie, the incomparable excellencies of your selfe, (waited-on by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the greatnesse of your estate) and the importaunce of the thing (whereon my life consisteth) doth require both many ceremonies before the beginning, and many circumstaunces in the vttering my speech, both bolde, and fearefull. But the small opportunitie of enuious occasion (by the malicious eie hatefull Loue doth cast vpon me) and the extreme bent of my affection (which will eyther breake out in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> words, or breake my harte) compell me, not onely to embrace the smallest time, but to passe by the respects due vnto you, in respect of your poore caitifes life, who is now, or neuer to be preserued. I doo therefore vowe vnto you, hereafter neuer more to omit all dutifull forme: doo you onely now vouchsafe to heare the matter of a minde most perplexed. If euer the sound of Loue haue come to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> your eares, or if euer you haue vnderstood, what force it hath had to conquere the strongest hartes, and change the most setled estates: receiue here an example of those straunge Tragedies; one, that in himselfe conteineth the particularities of all those misfortunes: and from hencefoorth beleeue that such a thing may be, since you shall see it is. You shall see (I say) a liuing image, and a present storie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> of what Loue can doo, when he is bent to ruine.</p>
            <p>But alas, whether goest thou my tongue? or how doth my harte consent to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture the reuealing his neerest touching secrete? But peace Feare, thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest too late, when already the harme is taken. Therefore I say againe, O onely Princesse, attend here a miserable miracle of affection. Behold here before your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> eyes <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> Prince of <hi>Macedon,</hi> whome you onely haue brought to this game of Fortune, and vnused <hi>Metamorphosis:</hi> whome you onely haue made neglect his countrie, forget his Father, and lastly, forsake to be <hi>Pyrocles:</hi> the same <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> who (you heard) was betrayed by being put in a ship, which being burned, <hi>Pyrocles</hi> was drowned. O most true presage: for these traytors, my eyes, putting me into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> a shippe of Desire, which dayly burneth, those eyes (I say) which betraied me, will neuer leaue till they haue drowned me. But be not, be not, (most excellent Lady) you that Nature hath made to be the Load-starre of comfort, be not the Rocke of shipwracke: you whome vertue hath made the Princesse of felicitie, be not the minister of ruine: you, whom my choyse hath made the Goddesse of my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> safetie, O let not, let not, from you be powred vpon me destruction. Your faire face hath manie tokens in it of amazement at my words: thinke then what his amazement is, from whence they come: since no words can carry with them the life of the inward feeling. I desire, that my desire may be waied in the ballances of Honour, and let Vertue hold them. For if the highest Loue in no base person may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> aspire to grace, then may I hope your beautie will not be without pittie. If other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise you be (alas but let it neuer be so) resolued, yet shall not my death be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortles, receiuing it by your sentence.</p>
            <p>The ioy which wrought into <hi>Pygmalions</hi> minde, while he found his beloued image was softer, and warmer in his folded armes, till at length it accomplished his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> gladnes with a perfect womans shape (still beautified with the former perfections) was euen such, as by each degree of <hi>Zelmanes</hi> words creepingly entred into <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea:</hi>

till her pleasure was fully made vp with the manifesting of his being; which was such as in hope did ouer-come Hope. Yet Doubt would faine haue playd his parte in her minde, and cald in question, how she should be assured that <hi>Zelmane</hi> was <hi>Pyrocles.</hi> But Loue streight stood vp and deposed, that a lie could not come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> from the mouth of <hi>Zelmane</hi>

               </gap> Besides, a certaine sparke of honour, which rose in her well-disposed minde, made her feare to be alone with him, with whome alone she desired to be (with all the other contradictions growing in those minds, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther absolutely clime the rocke of Vertue, nor freely sinke into the sea of Vanitie) but that sparke soone gaue place, or at lest gaue no more light in her minde, then a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> candle doth in the Sunnes presence. But euen sicke with a surfet of ioy, and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of she knewe not what (as he that newly findes huge treasures, doubts whether he sleepe or no; or like a fearefull Deere, which then lookes most about, when he comes to the best feede) with a shrugging kinde of tremor through all her princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall partes, she gaue these affectionate words for answere. Alas, how painefull a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> thing it is to a deuided minde to make a well-ioyned answere? how hard it is to bring inward shame to outward confession? and what handsomnes trow you can be obserued in that speeche, which is made one knowes not to whom? Shall I say ô <hi>Zelmane?</hi> Alas your words be against it. Shall I say Prince <hi>Pyrocles?</hi> wretch that I am, your shew is manifest against it. But this, this I may well say; If I had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> as I ought, <hi>Philoclea,</hi> you had either neuer bene, or euer bene <hi>Zelmane:</hi> you had either neuer attempted this change, set on with hope, or neuer discouered it, stopt with despaire. But I feare me, my behauiour ill gouerned, gaue you the first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: I feare me, my affection ill hid, hath giuen you this last assurance: I feare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the weakenesse of my gouernment before, made you thinke such a maske <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> would be gratefull vnto me: and my weaker gouernment since, makes you to pull off the visar. What shall I doo then? shall I seeke far-fetched inuentions? shall I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to lay marble coulours ouer my ruinous thoughts? or rather, though the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of my virgin-minde be stained, let me keepe the true simplicitie of my word. True it is, alas, too true it is, ô <hi>Zelmane</hi> (for so I loue to call thee, since in that name <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> my loue first began, and in the shade of that name my loue shall best lie hidden,) that euen while so thou wert, (what eye bewitched me I know not) my passions were fitter to desire, then to be desired. Shall I say then, I am sory, or that my loue must be turned to hate, since thou art turned to <hi>Pyrocles?</hi> how may that wel be, since when thou wert <hi>Zelmane,</hi> the despaire thou mightest not be thus, did most torment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> me.

            <p>Then held she her tongue, and cast downe a self-accusing looke, finding, that in her selfe she had (as it were) shot out of the bow of her affection, a more quick opening of her minde, then she minded to haue done. But <hi>Pyrocles</hi> so caried vp <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> with ioy, that he did not enuy the Gods felicitie, presented her with some iewels of right princely value, as some little tokens of his loue, and qualitie: and withall shewed her letters from his father King <hi>Euarchus,</hi> vnto him, which euen in the Sea had amongst his iewels bene preserued. But little needed those proofes to one, who would haue fallen out with herselfe, rather then make any contrarie coniectures to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>
               <hi>Zelmane</hi> speeches; so that with such imbracements, as it seemed their soules desired to meete, and their harts to kisse, as their mouthes did: which faine <hi>Pyrocles</hi> would haue sealed with the chiefe armes of his desire, but <hi>Philoclea</hi> commaunded
<pb facs="tcp:12151:91"/>
the contrary; and yet they passed the promise of mariage.</p>
            <p>And then at <hi>Philocleas</hi> entreaty, who was willing to purloine all occasions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning with <hi>Zelmane,</hi> she told her the storie of her life, from the time of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from <hi>Erona,</hi> for the rest she had already vnderstood of her sister.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> parted from <hi>Thessalia,</hi> and of diuers aduentures, which with no more daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then glory you passed through, till your comming to the succour of the Queene <hi>Erona</hi>; and the ende of that warre (you might perceiue by my selfe) I had vnderstood of the Prince <hi>Plangus.</hi> But what since was the course of your doings, vntill you came, after so many victories, to make a conquest of poore me, that I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> know not, the fame thereof hauing rather shewed it by pieces; then deliuered any full forme of it. Therefore, deere <hi>Pyrocles</hi> (for what can mine eares be so sweetly fed with as to heare you of you) be liberall vnto me of those things which haue made you indeede pretious to the worlde, and now doubt not to tell of your perils; for since I haue you here out of them, euen the remembrance of them is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> 
               <hi>Pyrocles</hi> easily perceiued she was content with kindnesse, to put off occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of further kindnesse; wherein Loue shewed himselfe a cowardly boy, that durst not attempt for feare of offending. But rather Loue prooued himselfe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, that durst with the sworde of reuerent dutie gaine-stand the force of so many enraged desires. But so it was, that though he knewe this discourse was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> to entertaine him from a more streight parley, yet he durst not but kisse his rod, and gladly make much of that entertainement which she allotted vnto him: and therefore with a desirous sigh chastning his brest for too much desiring, Sweete Princesse of my life (said he) what Trophees, what Triumph, what Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what Histories might euer make my fame yeeld so sweete a Musicke to my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> eares, as that it pleaseth you to lend your minde to the knowledge of any thing touching <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> onely therefore of value, because he is your <hi>Pyrocles?</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grow I now so proud, as to thinke it worth the hearing, since you vouchsafe to giue it the hearing. Therefore (onely height of my hope) vouchsafe to know, that after the death of <hi>Tiridates,</hi> and setling <hi>Erona</hi> in her gouernment; for setled we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> left her, howsoeuer since (as I perceiued by your speech the last day) the vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full treason of her ill-chosen husband ouerthrew her (a thing in trueth neuer till this time by me either heard, or suspected) for who could thinke without hauing such a minde as <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> that so great a beautie as <hi>Eronas</hi> (indeed excellent) could not haue held his affection? so great goodnes could not haue bound <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> gratefulnesse? and so high aduancement could not haue satisfied his ambition? But therefore true it is, that wickednesse may well be compared to a bottomlesse pit, into which it is farre easier to keepe ones selfe from falling, then being fallen, to giue ones selfe any stay from falling infinitely. But for my Cosen, and me, vpon this cause we parted from <hi>Erona.</hi>

               <hi>Euardes</hi> (the braue and mighty Prince, whom it was my fortune to kill in the combat for <hi>Erona</hi>) had three Nephewes, sonnes to a sister of his; all three set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the foremost rancks of Fame for great minds to attempt, and great force to perfourme what they did attempt; especially the eldest, by name <hi>Anaxius</hi>; to whom all men would willingly haue yeelded the height of praise, but that his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> was such, as to bestow it vpon himselfe, before any could giue it. For of so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable a pride he was, that where his deeds might wel stir enuie, his demeanor
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:12151:91"/>
did rather breed disdaine. And if it bee true that the <hi>Gyants</hi> euer made war against heauen, he had bene a fit ensigne-bearer for that company. For nothing seemed hard to him, though impossible; and nothing vniust, while his liking was his iustice. Now he in these wars flatly refused his aid; because he could not brooke, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the worthy Prince <hi>Plangus</hi> was by his cosen <hi>Tiridates</hi> preferred before him. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing no other weights, but the sword and speare in iudging of desert, how-much he esteemed himselfe before <hi>Plangus</hi> in that, so much would he haue had his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in his seruice.</p>
            <p>But now that he vnderstood that his vncle was slaine by me, I think rather scorne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that any should kil his vncle, then any kindnesse (an vn-vsed guest to an arrogant soule) made him seeke his reuenge; I must confesse in manner gallant enough. For he sent a challenge vnto me to meete him at a place appointed, in the confines of the kingdome of <hi>Lycia</hi>; where he would proue vpon me, that I had by some trecherie ouercome his vncle, whom els many hundreds such as I, could not haue withstood. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Youth and successe made mee willing enough to accept any such bargaine; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, because I had heard that your cosen <hi>Amphialus</hi> (who for some yeares hath vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally borne the name of the best Knight in the world) had diuers times fought with him, and neuer bene able to master him; but so had left him, that euery man thought <hi>Anaxius</hi> in that one vertue of curtesie far short of him, in all other his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> match; <hi>Anaxius</hi> still deeming himselfe for his superiour. Therefore to him I would goe, and I would needs goe alone, because so I vnderstood for certaine, he was; and (I must confesse) desirous to do something without the company of the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Prince <hi>Musidorus,</hi> because in my hart I acknowledge that I owed more to his presence, then to any thing in my selfe, whatsoeuer before I had done. For of him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> indeed (as of any worldly cause) I must grant, as receiued, what euer there is, or may be good in me. He taught me by word, and best by example, giuing mee in him so liuely an Image of vertue, as ignorance could not cast such mist ouer mine eyes, as not to see, and to loue it, and all with such deare friendship and care, as (ô heauen) how can my life euer requite vnto him? which made me indeed finde in my selfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> such a kind of depending vpon him, as without him I found a weakenesse, and a mistrustfulnes of my selfe, as one strayed from his best strength, when at any time I mist him. Which humour perceiuing to ouer-rule me, I straue against it; not that I was vnwilling to depend vpon him in iudgement, but by weakenesse I would not; which though it held me to him, made me vnworthy of him. Therefore I desired <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> his leaue, and obtained it: such confidence he had in me, preferring my reputation before his owne tendernesse; and so priuately went from him, hee determining (as after I knew) in secret maner, not to be far from the place, where we appointed to meete, to preuent any foule play that might be offered vnto me. Full loth was <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> to let vs depart from her, (as it were) forefeeling the harmes which after fel to her. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> But I, (ridde fully from those combers of kindnesse, and halfe a dayes iorney in my way toward <hi>Anaxius</hi>) met an adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture, which (though in it self of smal importance) I wil tel you at large, because by the occasion thereof I was brought to as great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and danger, as lightly any might escape.</p>
            <p>As I past through a Laund (ech side whereof was so bordred both with high <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> tymber trees, and copses of farre more humble growth, that it might easily bring a solitarie minde to looke for no other companions then the wild burgesses of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest) I heard certaine cries, which comming by pawses to mine eares from within
<pb facs="tcp:12151:92"/>
the wood of the right hand, made mee well assured by the greatnesse of the crie, it was the voice of a man, though it were a verie vnmanlike voice, so to crie. But making mine eare my guide, I left not many trees behinde me, before I sawe at the bottome of one of them a gentle-man bound (with many garters) hand &amp; foot, so as well he might tomble and tosse, but neither runne nor resist he coulde. Vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> him (like so many Eagles vpon an Oxe) were nine Gentle-women; truely such, as one might wel enough say, they were hansome. Eche of them held bodkins in their handes, wherewith they continually pricked him, hauing bene before-hand vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of any defence from the wast vpward, but onely of his shirte: so as the poore man wept and bled, cried and praied, while they sported themselues in his paine,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and delighted in his praiers, as the argumentes of their victorie.</p>
            <p>I was moued to compassion, and so much the more that hee straight cald to me for succour, desiring me at lest to kill him, to deliuer him from those tormenters. But before my-selfe could resolue, much lesse any other tell what I would resolue, there came in cholericke hast towards me about seuen or eight knights; the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> of which willed me to get me away, &amp; not to trouble the Ladies, while they were taking their due reuenge, but with so ouer-mastring a maner of pride, as truly my heart could not brooke it: and therefore (answering them, that howe I woulde haue defended him from the Ladies I knew not, but from them I would) I began a combat first with him particularly, and after his death with the others (that had lesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> good maners) ioyntly. But such was the ende of it, that I kept the fielde with the death of some, and flight of others. In so much as the women (afraid, what angrie victorie would bring forth) ran all away; sauing onely one; who was so flesht in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, that neyther during, nor after the fight, she gaue anie truce to her crueltie, but still vsed the little instrument of her great spight, to the well-witnest paine of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> patient: and was now about to put out his eyes, which all this while were spared, because they should doe him the discomfort of seeing who preuayled ouer him. When I came in, and after much adoe, brought her to some conference, (for sometime it was before she would harken, more before she would speake; and most, before shee would in her speeche leaue off the sharpe remembrance of her bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> but at length when I puld off my head-peece, and humbled entreated her pardon, or knowledge why she was cruell; out of breath more with choller (which increased in his owne exercise) then with the paine she tooke, much to this purpose she gaue her griefe vnto my knowledge.

And to conclude, such a one, as who can keepe him at armes end, need neuer wish a better companion. But vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:12151:92"/>
these qualities lies such a poysonous addar as I wil tell you. For by those gifts of Nature and Fortune (being in all places acceptable) he creepes, nay (to say truely) he flies so into the fauour of poore sillie wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that I would be too much ashamed to confesse, if I had not reuenge in my hande, as well as shame in my cheekes. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> his hart being wholy delighted in deceiuing vs, we could neuer be warned, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one bird caught, serued for a stale to bring in more. For the more he gat, the more still he shewed, that he (as it were) gaue away to his new mistresse, when hee betrayed his promises to the former. The cunning of his flatterie, the readines of his teares, the infinitenes of his vowes, were but among the weakest threedes of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> nette. But the stirring our owne passions, and by the entrance of them, to make himselfe Lord of our forces; there lay his Masters part of cunning, making vs now iealous, now enuious, now proud of what we had, desirous of more; now giuing one the triumph, to see him that was Prince of many, Subiect to her; now with an estranged looke, making her feare the losse of that minde. which indeede could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> be had: neuer ceasing humblenes and diligence, till he had imbarked vs in some such disaduantage, as wee could not returne dryshod; and then suddenly a tyrant, but a craftie tyrant. For so would hee vse his imperiousnes, that we had a delightfull feare &amp; an awe which made vs loath to lose our hope. And, which is strangest (when sometimes with late repentance I thinke of it) I must confesse, euen in the greatest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> tempest of my iudgement was I neuer driuen to thinke him excellent, and yet so could set my minde, both to get and keepe him, as though therein had laien my fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie: like them I haue seene play at the ball, growe extremely earnest, who should haue the ball, and yet euery one knew it was but a ball. But in end, the bitter sauce of the sport was, that wee had ether our hartes broken with sorrow, or our estates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> spoyled with being at his direction, or our honours for euer lost, partly by her owne faults, but principally by his faultie vsing of our faults. For neuer was there man that could with more scornefull eyes beholde her, at whose feete he had lately laine, nor with a more vnmanlike brauerie vse his tongue to her disgrace, which lately <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> had song Sonets of her praises: being so naturally inconstant, as I maruell his soule findes not some way to kill his bodie, whereto it had beene so long vnited. For so hath he dealt with vs (vnhappie fooles,) as we could neuer tell, whether hee made greater haste after he once liked, to enioy, or after he once enioyed, to forsake. But making a glorie of his owne shame, it delighted him to bee challenged of vnkinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: it was a triumph vnto him to haue his mercie called for: and hee thought the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> fresh colours of his beautie were painted in nothing so well, as in the ruines of his Louers: yet so farre had we engaged our selues, (vnfortunate soules) that we listed not complaine, since our complaints could not but carrie the greatest accusation to our selues. But euerie of vs (each for her selfe,) laboured all meanes how to recouer him, while he rather daily sent vs companions of our deceipt, then euer returned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> in any sound and faithfull manner. Till at length he concluded all his wronges with betrothing himselfe to one (I must confesse) worthie to be liked, if any worthinesse might excuse so vnworthie a changeablenesse; leauing vs nothing but remorse for what was past, and dispaire of what might followe. Then in deede the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie made vs all ioyne in fellowshipp, who till that time, had employed our ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> one against the other. For wee thought nothing was a more condemning of vs, then the iustifiing of his loue to her by mariage: then Despaire made Feare vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and Reuenge gaue Shame countenance: whereupon, we (that you saw here)
<pb facs="tcp:12151:93"/>
deuised how to get him among vs alone: which hee (suspecting no such matter of them, whom he had by often abuses he thought made tame to be still abused) easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gaue vs opportunitie to do.</p>
            <p>And a man may see, euen in this, how soone Rulers grow proud, and in theyr pride foolish: he came with such an authoritie among vs, as if the Planets had done <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> inough for vs, that by vs once he had beene delighted. And when wee began in courteous maner, one after the other, to lay his vnkindnes vnto him, he seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe confronted by so many (like a resolute Orator,) went not to deniall, but to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisie his cruell falshood, and al with such iestes, and disdainfull passages, that if the iniurie coulde not bee made greater, yet were our conceites made the apter to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> apprehend it.</p>
            <p>Among other of his answeres (forsooth) I shall neuer forget, howe hee woulde proue it was no inconstancie to chaunge from one loue to another, but a great constancie; and contrarie, that which we call constancie, to be most chaungeable. For (said he) I euer loued my delight, and delighted alwaies in what was Louely:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> and where-soeuer I found occasion to obtaine that, I constantly followed it. But these constant fooles you speake of, though their Mistres growe by sicknesse foule, or by fortune miserable, yet still will loue her, and so commit the absurdest incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie that may be, in changing their loue from fairenesse to foulenesse, and from loulinesse to his contrarie; like one not content to leaue a friend, but will streight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> giue ouer himselfe to his mortall enemie: where I (whome you call inconstant) am euer constant; to Beautie, in others; and Delight in my selfe. And so in this iolly scoffing brauerie he went ouer vs all, saying, He left one, because she was ouerwai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: another, because she was too soone wonne: a third, because she was not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie inough: a fourth, because she was ouer-gamesome: the fifth, because shee was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> growne with griefe subiect to sicknesse: the sixt because she was so foolish, as to be ielous of him: the seuenth, because shee had refused to carrie a letter for him, to another that he loued: the eight, because she was not secret, the ninth, because she was not liberall: but to me, who am named <hi>Dido,</hi> (and indeede haue mette with a false <hi>AEneas</hi>) to me, I say, (ô the vngratefull villanie) he could finde no other fault to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> obiect, but that (perdie) he met with many fayrer.</p>
            <p>But when he had thus plaide the carelesse Prince, we (hauing those seruants of ours in readines, whom you lately so manfully ouercame) laide holde of him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at first but that trifling reuenge, in which you fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vs busie; but meaning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes to haue mangled him so, as should haue lost his credit for euer abusing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> more. but as you haue made my fellowes flie away, so for my part the greatnesse of his wrong ouershadowes in my iudgement the greatnesse of any daunger. For was it not inough for him, to haue deceiued me, and through the deceipt abused mee, and after the abuse forsaken me, but that hee must now, of all the company, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the company lay want of beautie to my charge? Many fairer? I trow euen in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> your iudgement, Sir, (if your eies do not beguile me) not many fairer; and I know (whosoeuer saies the contrary) there are not many fairer. And of whom should I receiue this reproch, but of him, who hath best cause to know there are not many fairer? And therefore how-soeuer my fellowes pardon his iniuries, for my parte I will euer remember, and remember to reuenge this scorne of all scornes. With that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> she to him afresh; and surely would haue put out his eies (who lay mute for shame, if hee did not sometimes crie for feare) if I had not lept from my horse, and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

force with intreaty, staied her furie.</p>
            <p>But, while I was perswading her to meekenes, comes a number of his friends, to whom he forthwith cried, that they should kill that woman, that had thus betraied and disgraced him. But then I was faine to forsake the ensigne; vnder which I had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> before serued, and to spend my vttermost force in the protecting of the Ladie; which so well preuailed for her, that in ende there was a faithfull peace promised of all sids. And so I leauing her in a place of securitie (as she thought) went on my iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney towards <hi>Anaxius,</hi> for whom I was faine to stay two daies in the apointed place, he disdaining to waite for me, till he was sure I were there.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> I did patientlie abide his angrie pleasure, till about that space of tyme he came (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, according to promise) alone: and (that I may not say too little, because he is wont to say too much) like a man, whose courage was apt to clime ouer any daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And assoone as euer he came neere me, in fit distaunce for his purpose, he with much fury, (but with fury skilfully guided) ran vpon me; which I (in the best sort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> I could) resisted, hauing kept my selfe ready for him, because I had vnderstood, that he obserued few complements in matter of armes, but such as a proud anger did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And so putting our horses into a full careere, we hit each other vpon the head with our Launces: I think he felte my blowe, for my parte (I must confesse) I neuer receiued the like: but I thinke though my senses were astonished, my mind <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> forced them to quicken themselues, because I had learned of him, how little fauour he is woont to show in any matter of aduantage. And indeede hee was turned, and comming vpon me with his sworde drawne, both our staues hauing beene broken at that encounter. But I was so ready to answere him, that truely I knowe not who gaue the first blowe. But whosoeuer gaue the first, was quickly seconded by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> And indeed (excellentest Ladie) I must say truly, for a time it was well fought betweene vs; he vndoubtedly being of singular valour, (I would to God, it were not abased by his too much loftinesse) but as by the occasion of the combate, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and loosing ground, we chaunged places, his horse happened to come vpon the point of the broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> speare, which fallen to the ground chaunced to stand vpward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> so as it lighting vpon his hart, the horse died. He driuen to dismount, threatned, if I did not the like, to do as much for my horse, as Fortune had done for his. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that, or because I would not be beholding to Fortune for any part of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, I descended. So began our foote-fight in such sort that we were well entred to bloud of both sides, when there comes by, that vnconstant <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> whom I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> had deliuered (easie to be knowne, for he was bare faced) with a dosen armed men after him; but before him he had <hi>Dido</hi> (that Ladie, who had most sharpely punished him) riding vpon a palfery, he following her with most vnmanlike crueltie; beating her with wandes he had in his hande, she crying for sense of paine, or hope of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour: which was so pittifull a sight vnto me, that it mooued me to require <hi>Anaxius</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to deferre our combate, till an other day, and now to performe the duties of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in helping this distressed Ladie. But hee that disdaines to obey any thing but his passion (which hee cals his minde) bad mee leaue of that thought; but when hee had killed mee, hee woulde then (perhaps) go too her succour. But I well finding the fight would bee long betweene vs (longing in my hart too deliuer the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> poore <hi>Dido</hi>) giuing him so great a blowe, as somwhat staied him, to terme it a right) I flatly ran away from him towarde my horse, who trotting after the companie, in in mine armour I was put to some paine, but that vse made mee nimble vnto it.

And accordingly she demaunded my name, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> estate, with such earnestnesse, that I whom Loue had not as then so robbed me of my selfe, as to be another then I am, told her directly my name and condition: whereof she was no more gladde then her father, as I might well perceaue by some ill fauoured cheerefulnesse, which then first began to wrinckle it selfe in his face.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>But the causes of their ioyes were farre different; for as the shepheard and the butcher both may looke vpon one sheepe with pleasing conceipts, but the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard with minde to profit himselfe by preseruing, the butcher with killing him: So she reioyced to finde that mine own benefits had tyed me to be her friend, who was a Prince of such greatnesse, and louingly reioyced: but his ioye grew,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> (as I to my danger after perceiued) by the occasion of the Queene <hi>Artaxias</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my head to sale, for hauing slaine her brother <hi>Tiridates</hi>; which being the summe of an hundreth thousand crownes (to whosoeuer brought me aliue into her hands) that olde wretch, (who had ouer-liued all good nature) though he had lying idly by him much more then that, yet aboue all things louing money, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> monies owne sake determined to betray me, so well deseruing of him to haue that which he was determined neuer to vse. And so knowing that the next morning I was resolued to go to the place where I had left <hi>Anaxius,</hi> he sent in all speed to a Captaine of a Garrison neere by; which though it belonged to the King of <hi>Iberia,</hi> (yet knowing the Captaines humor to delight so in riotous spending <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> as he cared not how he came by the meanes to maintaine it) doubted not that to be halfe with him in the gaine, he would playe his quarters part in the treason. And therefore that night agreeing of the fittest places where they might surprise me the morning, the olde caitiffe was growne so ceremonious, as he would needs accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie me some myles in my way; a sufficient token to me, if Nature had made me <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> apte to suspect; since a churles curtesie rarely comes but either for gaine, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood. But I suffered him to stumble into that point of good manner: to which purpose he came out with all his clownes, horst vpon such cart-iades, and so fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, as in good faith I thought with my selfe, if that were thrift, I wisht none of my freends or subiects euer to thriue. As for his daughter (the gentle <hi>Dido</hi>) she <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> would also (but in my conscience with a farre better minde) prolong the time of farewell, as long as he.</p>
            <p>And so we went on togither: he so old in wickednes, that he could looke me in the face, and freely talke with me, whose life he had alreadie contracted for: till comming into the falling of a way which ledde vs into a place, of each-side <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> whereof men might easilye keepe themselues vndiscouered, I was encompassed sodainly by a great troupe of enemies both of horse and foote, who willed me to yeelde my selfe to the Queene <hi>Artaxia.</hi> But they could not haue vsed worse eloquence to haue perswaded my yeelding, then that; I knowing the little good will <hi>Artaxia</hi> bare me. And therefore making necessitie and iustice my best sword <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> and shielde, I vsed the other weapons I had as well as I could; I am sure to the little ease of a good number, who trusting to their number more then to their

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But I was growne so wearie, that I supported my selfe more with anger then strength, when the most excellent <hi>Musidorous</hi> came to my succour; who hauing followed my trace as well as he could, after he found I had left the fight with <hi>Anaxius,</hi> came to the niggards Castell, where he found all burnd and spoiled by the countrie people, who bare mortall hatred to that couetous man, and now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> tooke the time, when the castell was left almost without garde, to come in, and leaue monuments of their malice therein: which <hi>Musidorus</hi> not staying either to further, or impeache, came vpon the spurre after me (because with one voice ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tolde him, that if I were in his company, it was for no good meant vnto me) and in this extremitie found me. But when I saw that Cosen of mine, me thought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> my life was doubled, and where before I thought of a noble death, I now thought of a noble victorie. For who can feare that hath <hi>Musidorus</hi> by him? who, what he did there for me, how many he killed, not straunger for the number then for the straunge blowes wherwith he sent them to a wel-deserued death, might well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light me to speak off, but I should so holde you too long in euery particular.

            <p>Yet what the vnmeasurable excesse of their number woulde haue done in the ende I knowe not, but the triall thereof was cutte off by the chaunceable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither of the King of <hi>Iberia,</hi> that same father of the worthy <hi>Plangus,</hi> whom it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> hath pleased you sometimes to mention: who, (not yeelding ouer to olde age his countrie delights, especially of hauking) was at that time (following a Merline) brought to see this iniurie offred vnto vs: and hauing great numbers of Courtiers waiting vpon him, was straight known by the souldiers that assaulted vs, to be their King, and so most of them with-drew themselues.</p>

            <p>This iustice thus done, and we deliuered, the King indeed in royall sorte inuited <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> vs to his Court, not farre thence: in all pointes entertaining vs so, as truelye I must euer acknowledge a beholdingnes vnto him: although the streame of it fel out not to be so sweet as the spring. For after some daies being there (curing our selues of
<pb facs="tcp:12151:95"/>
such wounds as we had receiued, while I, causing diligent search to be made of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxius,</hi> could learne thing, but that he was goneno out of the countrie, boasting in euerye place how he had made me run away) we were brought to receaue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of acquaintance with this Queene <hi>Andromana,</hi> whom the Princesse <hi>Pamela</hi> did in so liuelye colours describe the last day, as still me thinkes the figure thereof pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> mine eyes confirmed by the knowledge my selfe had.</p>
            <p>And therefore I shall neede the lesse to make you know what kinde of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man she was; but this onely, that first with the raines of affection, and after with the very vse of directing, she had made her selfe so absolute a maister of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands minde, that a while he would not, and after, he could not tell how to gouern <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> without being gouerned by her: but finding an ease in not vnderstanding, let loose his thoughts wholy to pleasure, entrusting to her the entire conduct of all his royall affaires. A thing that may luckely fall out to him that hath the blessing, to match with some Heroicall minded Lady. But in him it was neither guided by wisdome, nor followed by Fortune, but therby was slipt insensiblie into such an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> that he liued at her vndiscreete discretion: all his subiectes hauing by some yeares learned so to hope for good, and feare of harm, onely from her, that it should haue needed a stronger vertue then his, to haue vnwound so deeply an entred vice. So that either not striuing (because he was contented) or contented (because he would not striue) he scarcely knew what was done in his owne chamber, but as it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> pleased her Instruments to frame the relation.</p>
            <p>Now we being brought knowen vnto her (the time that we spent in curing some very dangerous wounds) after once we were acquainted, (and acquainted we were sooner then our selues expected) she continually almost haunted vs, till (and it was not long a dooing) we discouered a most violent bent of affection: and that so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> strangely, that we might well see, an euill minde in authoritie, dooth not onely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the sway of the desires already within it, but frames to it selfe new desires, not before thought of. For, with equall ardour she affected vs both: &amp; so did her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes disdaine shamefastnes, that she was content to acknowledge it to both. For, (hauing many times torne the vaile of modestie) it seemed, for a last delight, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> she delighted in infamy: which often she had vsed to her husbands shame, filling all mens eares (but his) with his reproch; while he hoodwinkt with kindenes) lest of all men knew who strake him. But her first degree was, by setting forth her beauties, (truely in nature not to be misliked, but as much aduanced to the eye, as abased to the iudgement by art) thereby to bring vs (as willingly-caught fishes) to bite at her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> baite. And thereto had she that scutchion of her desires supported by certaine bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-diligent ministers, who often cloyed our eares with her praises, and would needs teach vs a way of felicitie by seeking her fauour. But when she found, that we were as deafe to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as dumb to her; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she lifted no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger stay in the suburbs of her foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish desires, but directly entred vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; making her self an impudent suter, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> her selfe very much with making vs see that all fauor and power in that realm, so depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon her, that now (being in her hands) we were ether to keep, or lose our liberty, at her discretion; which yet a while she so tempted, as that we might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suspect, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she threaten. But when our woundes grew so, as that they gaue vs leaue to trauell, and that she found we were purposed to vse all meanes we could to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> depart thence, she (with more and more importunatenes) craued, which in all good maners was either of vs to be desired, or not granted.

Which proceeding of hers I do the more largely set before you (most deare Lady) because by the foile therof, you may see the noblenes of my desire to you, and the warrantablenes of your fauour to me.</p>

But (said <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) when she perceiued no hope by suite to preuaile, then (perswaded by the rage of affection, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> by daring to doo any thing) she founde meanes to haue vs accused to the King, as though we went about some practise to ouerthrowe him in his owne estate. Which because of the straunge successes we had had in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Phrigia, Pontus</hi> &amp; <hi>Galatia</hi>) seemed not vnlikely to him, who (but skimming any thing that came before him) was disciplined to leaue the through-handling of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> all, to his gentle wife: who foorthwith caused vs to be put in prison, hauing (while we slept) depriued vs of our armes: a prison, indeede iniurious, because a prison, but els well testifying affection because in all respects as commodious, as a prison might be: and indeede so placed, as she might at all houres (not seene by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, though she cared not much how many had seen her) come vnto vs. Then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> fell she to sause her desires with threatnings, so that we were in a great perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, restrained to so vnworthie a bondage, and yet restrained by loue, which I (I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how (in noble mindes, by a certain duety, claimes an answering. And how much that loue might moue vs, so much, and more that faultines of her minde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued vs; her beauty being balanced by her shamelesnes. But that which did (as it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> were) tie vs in captiuitie, was, that to graunt, had ben wickedly iniurious to him, that had saued our liues: and to accuse a Lady that loued vs, of her loue vnto vs, we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed almost as dishonorable: and but by one of those waies we sawe no likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of going out of that place, where the words would be iniurious to your eares, which should expres the manner of her suite: while yet many times earnestnes died <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> her cheekes with the colour of shamefastnes; and wanton languishing borrowed of her eyes the down-castlooke of modestie. But we in the mean time farre from louing her, and often assuring her, that we would not so recompence her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes sauing of our liues; to such a ridiculous degree of trusting her, she had brought him, that she caused him send vs worde, that vpon our liues, we should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> doo whatsoeuer she commaunded vs: good man, not knowing any other, but that all her pleasures were directed to the preseruation of his estate. But when that made vs rather pittie, then obey his folly, then fell she to seruile entreating vs, as though force could haue bene the schoole of Loue, or that an honest courage would not rather striue against, then yeeld to iniurie. All which yet could not make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> vs accuse her, though it made vs almost pine away for spight, to loose any of our time in so troublesome an idlenesse.</p>
            <p>But while we were thus full of wearinesse of what was past, and doubt of what
<pb facs="tcp:12151:96"/>
was to follow, Loue (that I thinke in the course of my life hath a spot sometimes to poyson me with roses, sometimes to heale me with wormewood) brought forth a remedy vnto vs: which though it helped me out of that distres, alas the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion was such, as I must euer while I liue, think it worse then a wracke, so to haue bene preserued. This King by this Queene had a sonne of tender age, but of great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> expectation, brought vp in the hope of themselues, and already acceptation of the inconstant people, as successour of his fathers crowne: wherof he was as worthy, considering his partes, as vnworthie, in respect of the wrong was thereby done against the most noble <hi>Plangus</hi>: whose great desertes now either forgotten, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully remembred, all men set their sayles with the fauourable winde, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> blewe on the fortune of this young Prince, perchaunce not in their harts, but sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not in their mouths, now giuing <hi>Plangus</hi> (who some yeares before was their only champion) the poore comfort of calamitie, pittie. This youth therefore accounted Prince of that region, by name <hi>Palladius,</hi> did with vehement affection loue a yong Ladye, brought vp in his fathers court, called <hi>Zelmane,</hi> daughter to that mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouslie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> vnhappie Prince <hi>Plexirtus</hi> (of whom already I haue, and sometimes must make, but neuer honorable mention) left there by her father, because of the intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate changeablenes of his estate; he by the motherside being halfe brother to this Queene <hi>Andromana,</hi> and therefore the willinger committing her to her care. But as Loue (alas) doth not alwaies reflect it selfe, so fell it out that this <hi>Zelmane,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> (though truely reason there was enough to loue <hi>Palladius</hi>) yet could not euer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade her harte to yeelde thereunto: with that paine to <hi>Palladius,</hi> as they feele, that feele an vnloued loue. Yet louing indeed, and therefore constant, hee vsed still the intercession of diligence and faith, euer hoping, because he would not put him selfe into that hell, to be hopelesse: vntill the time of our being come, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> there, brought foorth this ende, which truely deserues of me a further degree of sorrow then teares.</p>
            <p>Such was therein my ill destinie, that this young Ladye <hi>Zelmane</hi> (like some vnwisely liberall, that more delight to giue presentes, then pay debtes) she chose (alas for the pittie) rather to bestowe her loue (so much vndeserued, as not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> vpon me, then to recompence him, whose loue (besides many other thinges) might seeme (euen in the court of Honour) iustly to claime it of her. But so it was (alas that so it was) whereby it came to passe (that as nothing doth more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follow his cause, then care to preserue, and benefite doth follow vnfained af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) she felt with me, what I felt of my captiuitie, and streight laboured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> my paine, which was her paine: which she could do by no better meanes, then by vsing the helpe therein of <hi>Palladius</hi>: who (true Louer) considering what, and not why, in all her commaundements; and indeed she concealing from him her affection (which shee intituled compassion,) immediatly obeyed to imploye his vttermost credite to relieue vs: which though has great, as a beloued son with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> a mother, faultye otherwise, but not hard-harted toward him, yet it could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile to procure vs libertie. Wherefore he sought to haue that by practise, which he could not by praier. And so being allowed often to visite vs (for indeede our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints were more, or lesse, according as the ague of her passion was either in the fit or intermission) he vsed the opportunitie of a fit time thus to deliuer vs.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>
            </p>
            <p>The time of the marrying that Queene was euery year, by the extreme loue of her husband, and the seruiceable loue of the Courtiers, made notable by some pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12151:96"/>
honours, which did (as it were) proclaime to the worlde, how deare shee was to that people. Among other, none was either more grateful to the beholders, or more noble in it selfe, then iusts, both with sword &amp; launce, mainteined for a seuen-night together: wherein that Nation doth so excel, both for comelines and hablenes, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> from neighbour-countries they ordinarilye come, some to striue, some to learne, some to behold.</p>
            <p>This day it happened that diuers famous Knights came thither from the Court of <hi>Helen,</hi> Queene of <hi>Corinth,</hi> a Lady, whome fame at that time was so desirous to honor, that she borrowed all mens mouthes to ioyne with the sounde of her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Trumpet. For as her beautie hath wonne the prize from all women, that stande in degree of comparison (for as for the two sisters of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> they are far beyond all conceipte of comparison) so hath her gouernment bene such as hath bene no lesse beautifull to mens iudgementes, then her beautie to the eiesight. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought by right of birth, a woman, a yong woman, a faire woman, to gouern a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> people, in nature mutinously proud, and alwaies before so vsed to hard gouernours, as they knew not how to obey without the sworde were drawne. Yet could she for some yeares, so carry her selfe among them, that they found cause in the delicacie of her sex, of admiration, not of contempt: &amp; which was notable, euen in the time that many countries about her were full of wars (which for old grudges to <hi>Corinth</hi> were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> thought stil would conclude there) yet so handled she the matter, that the threatens euer smarted in the threatners; she vsing so strange, and yet so well-succeding a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that she made her people by peace, warlike; her courtiers by sports, learned; her Ladies by Loue, chast. For by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall martiall exercises without bloud, she made them perfect in that bloudy art. Her sportes were such as carried riches of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> vpon the stream of Delight: and such the behauiour both of her selfe and her Ladies, as builded their chastitie not vpon waiwardnes, but choice of worthines: So as it seemed, that court to haue bene the mariage place of Loue &amp; Vertue, and that herself was a <hi>Diana</hi> apparrelled in the garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of <hi>Venus.</hi> And this which Fame only deliuered vnto me, (for yet I haue neuer seene her) I am the willinger to speake of to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> you, who (I know) know her better, being your neer neighbor, because you may see by her example (in her self wise, and of others beloued) that neither folly is the cause of vehement loue, nor reproch the effect. For neuer (I think) was there any woman, that with more vnremoueable determination gaue her selfe to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of loue, after she had once set before her minde the worthines of your cosin <hi>Amphialus</hi>; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> yet is nether her wisedome doubted of, nor honor blemished. For (O God) what doth better become wisedome, then to discerne what is worthy the louing? what more agreable to goodnes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to loue it so discerned? and what to greatnes of hart, then to be constant in it once loued? But at that time, that loue of hers was not so publikely known, as the death of <hi>Philoxenus</hi> and search of <hi>Amphialus</hi> hath made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> it: but then seemed to haue such leasure to send thither diuerse choise knights of her court, because they might bring her, at lest the knowledge, perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the honor of, that triumph. Wherin so they behaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues as for three daies they carried the prize; which being come from so far a place to disgrace her seruaunts, <hi>Palladius</hi> (who himselfe had neuer vsed armes) perswaded the Queene <hi>Andromana</hi> to be content <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>(for the honour sake of her court) to suffer vs two to haue our horse and armour, that he with vs might vndertake the recouerie of their lost honour: which she gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; taking our oath to goe no further then her sonne, nor euer to abandon
<pb facs="tcp:12151:97"/>
him. Which she did not more for sauing him, then keeping vs: and yet not satisfied with our oth, appointed a band of horsemen to haue eye, that we should not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond appointed limits. We were willing to gratifie the young Prince, who (we saw) loued vs. And so the fourth day of that exercise, we came into the field: where (I remember) the manner was, that the forenoone they should run at tilt, one after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the other: the afternoone in a broad field, in manner of a battell, till either the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or that countrie Knights wan the field.</p>
            <p>The first that ran was a braue Knight, whose deuise was to come in, all chayned with a Nymph leading him: his <hi>Impresa</hi> was</p>
            <p>Against him came forth an <hi>Iberian,</hi> whose manner of entring was,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> with Bagpipes in steed of trumpets; a shepheards boy before him for a Page, and by him a dozen apparelled like shepherds for the fashion, though rich in stuffe, who caried his Launces, which though strong to giue a launcely blow indeede, yet so were they couloured with hooks neere the mourn, that they pretilye represented shephooks. His own furniture was drest ouer with wooll, so enriched with Iewels <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> artificially placed, that one would haue thought it a mariage betweene the lowest and the highest. His <hi>Impresa</hi> was a Sheepe marked with pitch, with this woord <hi>Spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be knowne.</hi> And because I may tell you out his conceipt (though that were not done, till the running for that time was ended) before the Ladies departed from the windowes, among whom there was one (they say) that was the <hi>Star,</hi> whereby his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> course was onely directed. The Shepherds attending vpon <hi>PHILISIDES</hi> went among them, and sang an eclogue; one of them answering another, while the other shepherds pulling out recorders (which possest the place of pipes) accorded their musicke to the others voice. The Eclogue had great praise: I onely remember sixe verses, while hauing questioned one with the other, of their fellow-shepheards so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> growing a man of armes, and the cause of his so doing, they thus said.</p>
            <q>
               <l>ME thought some staues he mist: if so, not much amisse:</l>
               <l>For where he most would hit, he euer yet did misse.</l>
               <l>Once said he brake a crosse; full well it so might be:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
               </l>
               <l>For neuer was there man more crossely crost then he.</l>
               <l>But most cryed, O well broke: O foole full gaily blest:</l>
               <l>Where failing is a shame, and breaking is his best.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thus I haue digrest, because his maner liked me well: But when he began to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> run against <hi>LElius,</hi>, it had neere growne (though great loue had euer bene betwixt them) to a quarell. For <hi>Philisides</hi> breaking his staues with great commendation, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> (who was knowne to be second to none in the perfection of that art) ranne euer ouer his head, but so finely to the skilfull eyes, that one might wel see he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more knowledge in missing, then others did in hitting. For with so gallant a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> grace his staffe came swimming close ouer the crest of the Helmet as if he would represent the kisse, and not the stroke of <hi>Mars.</hi> But <hi>Philisides</hi> was much moued with it, while he thought <hi>Lelius</hi> would shew a contempt of his youth: till <hi>Lelius</hi> (who therefore would satisfie him, because he was his friend (made him know, that to such bondage he was for so many courses tyed by her, whose disgraces to him were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> graced by her excellencye, and whose iniuries he could neuer otherwise returne, then honors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:12151:97"/>But so by <hi>Lelius</hi> willing-missing was the oddes of the <hi>Iberian</hi> side, and continued so in the next by the excellent running of a Knight, though fostred so by the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> as many times the very rusticke people left both their delights and profites to harken to his songs, yet could he so well performe all armed sports, as if he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> had any other pen, then a Launce in his hand. He came in like a wilde man; but such a wildenes, as shewed his eye-sight had tamed him, full of withered leaues, which though they fell not, still threatned falling. His <hi>Impresa</hi> was, a mill-horse still bound to goe in one circle; with this word, <hi>Data fata sequutus.</hi> But after him the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> knights absolutely preuailed, especially a great noble man of <hi>Corinth,</hi> whose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> deuise was to come without any deuise, all in white like a new Knight, as indeede he was; but so new, as his newnes shamed most of the others long exercise. Then another from whose tent I remember a birde was made flie, With such art to carry a written embassage among the Ladies, that one might say, If a liue bird, how so taught? if a dead bird, how so made? Then he, who hidden, man and horse in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> great figure liuely representing the <hi>Phoenix</hi>: the fire tooke so artificially, as it consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the bird, and left him to rise as it were, out of the ashes thereof. Against whom was the fine frosen Knight, frosen in despaire; but his armor so naturallye represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ice, and all his furniture so liuely answering therto, as yet did I neuer see any thing that pleased me better.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> But the delight of those pleasing sightes, haue carried me too farre into an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary discourse. Let it then suffice (most excellent Ladye) that you know the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that morning in the exercise (as they had done the daies before) had the better; <hi>Palladius</hi> neither suffring vs, nor himself to take in hand the partie til the after noone; when we were to fight in troupes, not differing otherwise from earnest, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> that the sharpenesse of the weapons was taken away. But in the triall <hi>Pall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> But his mother (as I learned since) vnderstanding by the gard her sonnes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaying vs away (forgetting her greatnes, and resining modestye to more quiet thoughts (flew out from her place, and cried to be accompanied, for she her-selfe would follow vs. But what she did (being rather with vehemencie of passion, then conduct of reason) made her stumble while she ran, &amp; by her own confusion hinder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> her own desires. For so impatiently she comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, as a good while no body knew what she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded; so as we had gotten so far the start, as to be alredye past the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of her kingdome before she ouertook vs: and ouertake vs she did in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> not regarding shame, or da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of hauing entred into anothers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: but (hauing with her about a threescore hors-men) streight co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> take vs aliue, and not to regard her sonnes threatening therin: which they attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to doo, first by speach, and then by force. But neither liking their eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, nor fearing their might, we esteemed fewe swordes in a iust defence, able to resist many

vniust assaulters. And so <hi>Musidorus</hi> incredible valour (beating downe all lets) made both me, and <hi>Palladius,</hi> so good way, that we had little to doo to ouercome weake wrong.</p>
            <p>And now had the victorie in effect without bloud, when <hi>Palladius</hi> (heated with the fight, and angrie with his mothers fault) so pursued our assaylers, that one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of them (who as I heard since had before our comming bene a speciall minion of <hi>Andromanas,</hi> and hated vs for hauing dispossest him of her hart) taking him to be one of vs, with a traiterous blow slew his young Prince: who falling downe before our eyes, whom he specially had deliuered, iudge (sweetest Lady) whether anger might not be called iustice in such a case: once, so it wrought in vs, that many of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> bodies we left there dead, to wait on him more faithfully to the other world.</p>
            <p>All this while disdaine, strengthened by the furie of a furious loue, made <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana</hi> stay to the last of the combat: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she saw vs light down, to see what help we might doo to the helplesse <hi>Palladius,</hi> she came running madly vnto vs, then no lesse threatning, when she had no more power to hurt.

But depriued of all comfort, with eyes full of death, she ranne to her sonnes dagger, and before we were aware of it (who else would haue stayed it) strake her selfe a mortall wound. But then her loue, though not her person, awaked pittie in vs, and I went to her, while <hi>Musidorus</hi> laboured obout <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladius.</hi> But the wound was past the cure of a better surgeon then my selfe, so as I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> could but receaue some fewe of her dying words; which were cursings of her ill set affection, and wishing vnto me many crosses and mischaunces in my loue, when soeuer I should loue, wherein I feare, and only feare that her praiers is from aboue granted. But the noise of this fight, and issue thereof being blazed by the countrye people to some noble-men there-abouts, they came thither, and finding the wrong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> offered vs, let vs go on our iourney, we hauing reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended those royall bodies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them to be conueied to the King of <hi>Iberia.</hi> With that <hi>Philoclea,</hi> seeing the teares stand in his eyes with reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of <hi>Palladius,</hi> but much more of that which ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon grew, she would needs drink a kisse from those eyes, and he sucke another fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her lippes; wherat she blushed, and yet kissed him again to hide her blushing, Which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> had almost brought <hi>Pyrocles</hi> into another discourse, but that she with so sweete a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor forbad him, that he durst not rebell, though he found it a great warre to keepe that peace, but was faine to goe on in his storie: for so she absolutely bad him, and he durst not know how to disobey.</p>

at times say. Thou dost kill me with thy vnkinde falshood: and, It greeues me not to die, but it greeues me that thou art the murtherer: neither doth mine own paine so much vexe me, as thy errour. For God knowes, it would not trouble me to be slain for thee, but much it torments me to be slaine by thee. Thou art vntrue, <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> thou art vntrue, and woe is me therefore. How oft didst thou sweare vnto me, that the Sunne should loose his light, and the rocks runne vp and downe like little kiddes, before thou wouldst falsifie thy faith to me? Sunne therefore put out thy shining, and rockes runne madde for sorrow, for <hi>Pamphilus</hi> is false. But alas, the Sun keepes his light, though thy faith be darckned; the rockes stand still; though thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> change like a wethercocke. O foole that I am, that thought I could graspe water, and binde the winde. I might well haue knowen thee by others, but I would not; and rather wished to learne poison by drinking it my selfe, while my loue helped thy words to deceiue me. Wel, yet I would thou hadst made a better choise when thou didst forsake thy vnfortunate <hi>Leucippe.</hi> But it is no matter, <hi>Baccha</hi> (thy new mistres) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> wil reuenge my wrongs. But do not <hi>Baccha,</hi> let <hi>Pamphilus</hi> liue happy though I dye.</p>
            <p>And much more to such like phrase she spake, but that I (who had occasion to know some-thing of that <hi>Pamphilus</hi>) stept to comfort her: and though I could not doo that, yet I gotte thus much knowledge of her, that this being the same <hi>Leucip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,</hi> to whome the vnconstant <hi>Pamphilus</hi> had betrothed himselfe, which had moued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the other Ladies to such indignation as I tolde you: neither her worthines (which in trueth was great) nor his owne suffering for her (which is woont to endeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) could fetter his ficklenes, but that before his mariage-daye appointed, he had taken to wife that <hi>Baccha,</hi> of whome she complained; one, that in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I had heard before blazed, as the most impudently vnchaste woman of all <hi>Asia</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> and withall, of such an imperiousnes therein, that she would not stick to employe them (whome she made vnhappie with her fauour) to drawe more companions of their follie: in the multitude of whome she did no lesse glorie, then a Captaine would doo, of being followed by braue Souldiers: waiwardly proud; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bold, because extreamely faultie: and yet hauing no good thing to redeeme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> both these, and other vnlouely parts, but a little beautie, disgraced with wandring eyes, and vnwaied speeches; yet had <hi>Pamphilus</hi> (for her) left <hi>Leucippe,</hi> and withal, left his faith: <hi>Leucippe,</hi> of whom one look (in a cleer iudgement) would haue bene more acceptable, then all her kindnesses so prodigallie bestowed. For my selfe, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his cruell handling <hi>Dido,</hi> ioyned to this, stirred me to seeke some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> vpon him, but that I thought, it should be a gayne to him to lose his life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so matched: and therefore (leauing him to be punished by his owne election) we conueyed <hi>Leucippe</hi> to a house thereby, dedicated to <hi>Vestall</hi> Nunnes, where she resolued to spend all her yeares (which her youth promised should be many) in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling the wrong, and yet praying for the wrong doer.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> But the next morning, we (hauing striuen with the Sunnes earlines) were scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beyond the prospect of the high turrets of that building, when there ouertoke vs a young Gentleman, for so he seemed to vs, but indeede (sweete Ladie) it was the faire <hi>Zelmane, Plexirtus</hi> daughter; whom vnconsulting affection (vnfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borne to me-wardes) had made borrowe so much of her naturall modestie, as to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> leaue her more-decent rayments, and taking occasion of <hi>Andromanas</hi> tumultuous pursuing vs, had apparelled her selfe like a page, with a pitifull crueltie cutting of her golden haire, leauing nothing, but the short curles, to couer that noble heade,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:99"/>
but that she ware vpon it a faire head-peece, a shielde at her back, and a launce in her hand, els disarmed. Her apparell of white, wrought vpon with broken knots, her horse, faire and lustie, which she rid so, as might shew a fearefull boldnes, daring to doo that, which she knew that she knew not how to doo: and the sweetenes of her countenance did giue such a grace to what she did, that it did make hansome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the vnhansomnes, and make the eye force the minde to beleeue, that there was a praise in that vnskilfulnesse. But she straight approached me, and with fewe woords (which borrowed the help of her countenance to make themselues vnderstoode) she desired me to accept her into my seruice; telling me she was a noblemans sonne of <hi>Iberia,</hi> her name <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> who hauing seene what I had done in that court, had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> stolne from her father, to follow me. I enquired the particularities of the maner of <hi>Andromanas</hi> following me, which by her I vnderstood, she hiding nothing (but her sexe) from me. And still me thought I had seen that face, but the great alteration of her fortune, made her far distant from my memorie: but liking very well the yong Gentleman, (such I tooke her to be) admitted this <hi>Daiphantus</hi> about me, who well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> shewed there is no seruice like his, that serues because he loues. For though born of Princes bloud, brought vp with te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derest education, vnapt to seruice (because a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) and full of thoughts (because in a strange estate;) yet Loue enioyned such diligence, that no apprentise, no, no bondslaue could euer be by feare more readie at all commaundementes, then that yong Princesse was. How often (alas) did her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> eyes say vnto me, that they loued? and yet, I not looking for such a matter) had not my conceipt open, to vnderstand them, how often would she come creeping to me, betweene gladnes to be neere me, and feare to offend me? Truely I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that then I meruailed to see her receiue my commandements with sighes, and yet do them with cheerefulnes: sometimes answering me in such riddles, as I then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> thought a childish inexperience: but since returning to my reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance they haue come more cleere vnto my knowledge: and pardon me (onely deare Lady) that I vse many words: for her affection to me deserues of me an affectionate speach.</p>
            <p>But in such sort did she serue me in that kingdom of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> for two moneths space. In which time we brought to good end, a cruell warre long maintained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the king of <hi>Bythinia</hi> and his brother. For my excellent cousin, and I (diuiding our selues to either side) found meanes (after some triall we had made of our selues) to get such credit with them, as we brought them to as great peace between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as loue towards vs, for hauing made the peace. Which done, we intended to returne through the Kingdome of <hi>Galatia,</hi> towarde <hi>Thrace,</hi> to ease the care of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> father and mother, who (we were sure) first with the shipwracke; and then with the other dangers we dayly past, should haue little rest in their thoughts till they saw vs. But we were not entred into that kingdome, when by the noise of a great fight, we were guided to a pleasant valey, which like one of those Circusses, which in great cities some-where doth giue a pleasant spectacle of running horses; so of either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> side stretching it selfe in a narrow length was it hemd in by wooddy hilles; as if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Nature had meant therein to make a place for beholders. And there we behelde one of the cruellest fightes betweene two Knights, that euer hath adorned the most martiall storie. So as I must confesse, a while we stood bewondred, another while delighted with the rare brauery therof; til seeing such streames of bloud, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> threatned a drowning of life, we gallopped toward them to part them. But we were preuented by a dosen armed Knights, or rather villains, who vsing this time of their
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12151:99"/>
extreame feeblenesse, all together set vpon them. But common daunger brake off particular discord, so that (though with a dying weakenes) with a liuely courage they resisted, and by our help draue away, or slue those murdering attempters: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom we hapt to take aliue the principall. But going to disarme those two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> excellent Knights, we found with no lesse wonder to vs, then astonishment to themselues, that they were the two valiaunt, and indeede famous Brothers, <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus</hi> and <hi>Telenor</hi>; whose aduenture (as afterward we made that vngratious wretch confesse) had thus fallen out.</p>
            <p>After the noble Prince <hi>Leonatus</hi> had by his fathers death succeeded in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> of <hi>Galatia,</hi> he (forgetting all former iniuries) had receiued that naughtie <hi>Plexirtus</hi> into a streight degree of fauour, his goodnesse being as apt to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as the others craft was to deceiue. Till by plaine proofe finding, that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull man went about to poyson him, yet would not suffer his kindnesse to be ouercome, not by iustice it selfe: but calling him to him, vsed words to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/>
               <hi>Plexirtus</hi> (said he) this wickednesse is founde by thee. No good deedes of mine haue bene able to keepe it downe in thee. All men counsell me to take away thy life, likely to bring foorth nothing, but as daungerous, as wicked effects. But I cannot finde it in my harte, remembring what fathers sonne thou art. But since it is the violence of ambition, which perchaunce puls thee from thine owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> I will see, whether the satisfying that, may quiet the ill working of thy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. Not farre hence is the great cittie of <hi>Trebisonde</hi>; which, with the territorie about it, aunciently pertained vnto this crowne, now vniustly possessed, and as vniustly abused by those, who haue neither title to holde it, nor vertue to rule it. To the conquest of that for thy selfe I will lende thee force, and giue thee my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> right. Go therefore, and with lesse vnnaturalnesse glut thy ambition there; and that done, if it be possible, learne vertue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plexirtus,</hi> mingling forsworne excuses with false-meant promises, gladly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the offer: and hastilie sending backe for those two Brothers (who at that time were with vs succouring the gratious Queene <hi>Erona</hi>) by their vertue chiefly (if not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> onely) obteined the conquest of that goodly dominion. Which indeede done by them, gaue them such an authoritie, that though he raigned, they in effect ruled, most men honouring them, because they onely deserued honour; and many, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king therein to please <hi>Plexirtus,</hi> considering how much he was bound vnto them: while they likewise (with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> certaine sincere boldnesse of selfe-warranting friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> accepted all openly and plainely, thinking nothing should euer by <hi>Plexirtus</hi> be thought too much in them, since all they were, was his.</p>
            <p>But he (who by the rules of his own mind, could construe no other end of mens doings, but selfe seking) sodenly feared what they could doo; and as sodainely suspected, what they would doo, and as sodainly hated them, as hauing both might, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and minde to doo. But dreading their power, standing so strongly in their owne valour, and others affection, he durst not take open way against them: and as hard it was to take a secrete, they being so continually followed by the best, and euery way hablest of that region: and therefore vsed this diuelish sleight (which I will tell you) not doubting (most wicked man) to turne their owne friendship toward him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> to their owne destruction. He, (knowing that they well knew, there was no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship betweene him and the new King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> neuer since he succoured <hi>Leona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and vs, to his ouerthrow) gaue them to vnderstand that of late there had passed
<pb facs="tcp:12151:100"/>
secrete defiance betweene them, to meete priuately at a place apointed. Which though not so fit a thing for men of their greatnes, yet was his honour so engaged, as he could not go backe. Yet faining to find himselfe weake by some counterfait infirmitie, the day drawing neere, he requested each of them to go in his stead; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sweare, to keepe the matter secret, euen ech from other, deliuering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the selfe same particularities to both, but that he told <hi>Tydeus,</hi> the King would meet him in a blew armour; and <hi>Telenor,</hi> that it was a black armour: and with wicked subtiltie (as if it had bene so apointed) caused <hi>Tydeus</hi> to take a black armour, and <hi>Telenor</hi> a blew; appointing them waies how to go, so as he knew they should not meet, till they came to the place appointed, where each had promised to keepe si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> lest the King should discouer it was not <hi>Plexirtus:</hi> and there in a wait had he laied these murtherers, that who ouerliued the other, should by them be dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: he not daring trust more then those, with that enterprise, and yet thinking them too few, till themselues by themselues were weakened.</p>
            <p>This we learned chiefly, by the chiefe of those way-beaters, after the death of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> those two worthie brothers, whose loue was no lesse, then their valour: but well we might finde much thereof by their pitifull lamentation, when they knew their mismeeting, and saw each other (in despite of the Surgerie we could doo vnto them) striuing who should runne fastest to the goale of death: each bewailing the other, and more dying in the other, then in himselfe: cursing their owne hands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> for doing, and their breastes for not sooner suffering: detesting their vnfortunately-spent time in hauing serued so vngratefull a Tyraunt: and accusing their folly in hauing beleeued, he could faithfully loue, who did not loue faithfulnes: wishing vs to take heed, how we placed our good will vpon any other ground, then proofe of vertue: since length of acquaintance, mutuall secrecies, nor height of benefits <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> could binde a sauage harte; no man being good to other, that is not good in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Then (while any hope was) beseeching vs to leaue the care of him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought, and onely looke to the other. But when they found by themselues, and vs, no possibilitie, they desired to be ioined; and so embracing and crauing that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don each of other, which they denied to themselues, they gaue vs a most sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> spectacle of their death; leauing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But with wofull hartes, we caused those bodies to be conueyed to the next towne of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> where we learning thus much (as I haue tolde you) caused the wicked Historian to conclude his story, with his owne well-deserued death.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>
            </p>
            <p>But then (I must tell you) I found such wofull countenances in <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> that I could not but much maruaile (finding them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinew beyond the first assault of pittie) how the case of strangers (for further I did not conceiue) could so deepely pearce. But the truth indeed is, that partly with the shame and sorrow she tooke of her fathers faultinesse, partly with the feare, that the hate I conceiued against him,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> would vtterly disgrace her in my opinion, whensoeuer I should know her, so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly perplexed her, that her fayre colour decaied; and dayly, &amp; hastily grew into the very extreme working of sorowfulnes: which oft I sought to learne, and helpe.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> But the griefe of that (finding a bodie alreadie brought to the last degree of weakenesse) so ouerwhelmed the little remnant of the spirits left in <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> that she fell sodainely into deadly soundings; neuer comming to her selfe, but that withall she returned to make most pittifull lamentations; most straunge vnto vs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> because we were farre from ghessing the ground thereof. But finding her sicknesse such, as began to print death in her eyes, we made all hast possible to conuey her to the next towne: but before we could lay her on a bed, both we, and she might find in herselfe, that the harbingers of ouer-hastie death, had prepared his lodging in that daintie body, which she vndoubtedly feeling, with a weake chearefulnes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> shewed comfort therein; and then desiring vs both to come neere her, and that no bodie els might be present; with pale, and yet (euen in palenes) louely lips, Now or neuer, and neuer indeed, but now is it time for me (said she) to speake: and I thanke death which giues me leaue to discouer that, the suppressing whereof per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance hath bene the sharpest spur, that hath hasted my race to this end.

            <p>But she that had inward ambassadors from the tyrant that shortly would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse her, No, my deere master (said she) I neither hope nor desire to liue.

It sufficeth me that the strange course I haue taken, shall to your remembrance, witnesse my loue: and yet this breaking of my hart, before I would discouer my paine, will make you (I hope) thinke that I was not altogether vnmodest.

I besought her to doo, vowing the performance, though my life were the price thereof. She shewed great ioy: The first (said she) is this, that you will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my father the displeasure you haue iustly conceiued against him, and for this once, succour him out of the daunger wherein he is: I hope he will amend: and I pray you, whensoeuer you remember him to be the faultie <hi>Plexirtus,</hi> remember <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> withall that he is <hi>Zelmanes</hi> father. The second is, that when you come once into <hi>Greece,</hi> you will take vnto your selfe this name (though vnlucky) of <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> and vouchsafe to be called by it: for so shall I be sure, you shall haue cause to remember me: and let it please your noble cousin to be called <hi>Palladius,</hi> that I doo that right to that poore Prince, that his name yet may liue vpon the earth in so excellent a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> and so betwene you, I trust sometimes your vnluckie page shall be (perhaps with a sigh) mencioned. Lastly, let me be buried here obscurely, not suffering my friends to know my fortune, till (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you are safely returned to your own countrie) you cause my bones to be conueied thither, and laid (I beseech you) in some place, where your selfe vouchsafe sometimes to resort. Alas, small petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for such a suter; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> which yet she so earnestly craued, that I was faine to sweare the accomplishment. And then kissing me, and often desiring me not to condemne her of lightnesse, in mine armes she deliuered her pure soule to the purest place: leauing me as full of agonie, as kindnes, pitie, and sorow could make an honest hart. For I must confesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as farre short of your perfection, as her selfe dying, was of her selfe flourishing: yet somthing there was, which (when I saw a picture of yours) brought againe her fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure into my remembrance, and made my hart as apt to receiue the wounde, as the power of your beauty with vnresistable force to pearce.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But we in wofull (and yet priuat) manner burying her, performed her comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: and then enquiring of her fathers estate, certainly learned that he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to be succoured, or by death to passe the neede of succour. Therefore we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to diuide our selues; I, according to my vowe, to helpe him, and <hi>Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> toward the King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> who stood in no lesse need then immediat succour, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> &amp; euen readie to depart one from the other, there came a messenger from him, who after some enquirie found vs, giuing vs to vnderstand, that he trusting vpon vs two, had apointed the combat betweene him and vs, against <hi>Otanes,</hi> and the two <hi>Gyants.</hi> Now the day was so accorded, as it was impossible for me both to succour <hi>Plexirtus,</hi> and be there, where my honour was not only so far engaged, but (by the straunge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> working of vniust fortune) I was to leaue the standing by <hi>Musidorus,</hi> whom better then my selfe I loued, to go saue him whom for iust causes I hated. But my promise giuen, and giuen to <hi>Zelmane,</hi> &amp; to <hi>Zelmane</hi> dying, preuailed more with me, then my friendship to <hi>Musidorus:</hi> though certainely I may affirme, nothing had so great rule in my thoughts, as that. But my promise caried me the easier, because <hi>Musidorus</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> himselfe would not suffer me to breake it. And so with heauy mindes (more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full each of others successe, then of our owne) we parted; I toward the place, where I vnderstood <hi>Plexirtus</hi> was prisoner to an auncient Lord, absolutely gouerning a goodly Castle, with a large territory about it, whereof he acknowledged no other soueraigne, but himselfe: whose hate to <hi>Plexirtus,</hi> grew for a kinsman of his, whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> he malitiously had murdered, because in the time that he raigned in <hi>Galatia,</hi> he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him apt to practise for the restoring of his vertuous brother <hi>Leonatus.</hi> This old Knight, still thirsting for reuenge, vsed (as the way to it) a pollicie, which this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion I will tell you, prepared for him. <hi>Plexirtus</hi> in his youth had maried <hi>Zelmanes</hi> mother, who dying of that only child-birth, he a widdower, and not yet a King, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> haunted the Court of <hi>Armenia</hi>; where (as he was cunning to winne fauour) he obteined great good liking of <hi>Artaxia,</hi> which he purs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he (no more wittie to frame, then blinde to iudge hopes) bit ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stely at the baite, and in priuate maner poasted toward her, but by the way he was met by this Knight, far better accompanied, who quickly laid hold of him, and condemned him to death, cruell inough, if any thing may be both cruell and iust. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> For he caused him to be kept in a miserable prison, till a day appointed, at which time he would deliuer him to be deuoured by a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strous beast of most vgly shape, armed like a <hi>Rhinoceros,</hi> as strong as an Elephant, as fierce as a Lion, as nimble as a

Leopard, and as cruell as a Tigre: whom he hauing kept in a strong place, from the first youth of it, now thought no fitter match, then such a beastly monster with a monstrous Tyrant: proclaiming yet withall, that if any so well loued him, as to venture their liues against his beast, for him, if they ouercame, he should be saued: not caring how many they were (such confidence he had in that monsters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> strength) but especially hoping to entrappe thereby the great courages of <hi>Tydeus</hi> and <hi>Telenor,</hi> whom he no lesse hated, because they had bene principall instruments of the others power.</p>
            <p>I dare say, if <hi>Zelmane</hi> had knowen what daunger I should haue passed, she would rather haue let her father perish, then me to haue bidden that aduenture. But my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> word was past, and truely, the hardnes of the enterprise, was not so much a bitte, "as a spurre vnto me; knowing well, that the iorney of high honor lies not in plaine wayes. Therefore, going thether, and taking sufficient securitie, that <hi>Plexirtus</hi> should be deliuered if I were victorious, I vndertooke the combatte: and (to make short, excellent Ladie, and not to trouble your eares with recounting a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> terrible matter) so was my weakenes blessed from aboue, that without dangerous wounds I slew that monster, which hundreds durst not attempt: to so great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of many (who from a safe place might looke on) that there was order giuen, to haue the fight, both by sculpture and picture, celebrated in most parts of <hi>Asia.</hi> And the olde noble-man so well liked me, that he loued me; onely bewayling,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> my vertue had beene imployed to saue a worse monster then I killed: whom yet (according to faith giuen) he deliuered, and accompanied me to the kingdome of <hi>Pontus,</hi> whether I would needes in all speede go, to see whether it were possible for me (if perchance the day had bene delaied) to come to the combat. But that (before I came) had bene thus finished.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
            </p>
            <p>The vertuous <hi>Leonatus</hi> vnderstanding two so good friends of his were to be in that danger, would perforce be one him selfe: where he did valiantly, and so did the King of <hi>Pontus.</hi> But the truth is, that both they being sore hurt, the incomparable <hi>Musidorus</hi> finished the combat by the death of both the Giants, and the taking of <hi>Otanes</hi> prisoner. To whom as he gaue his life, so he gotte a noble friend: for so he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> gaue his word to be, and he is well knowen to thinke himselfe greater in being subiect to that, then in the greatnes of his principalitie.</p>
            <p>But thither (vnderstanding of our being there) flocked great multitudes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great persons, and euen of Princes; especially those, whom we had made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding vnto vs: as, the Kings of <hi>Phrygia, Bythinia,</hi> with those two hurte, of <hi>Pontus</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Otanes</hi> the prisoner, by <hi>Musidorus</hi> set free; and thither came <hi>Plexirtus</hi> of <hi>Trebisonde,</hi> and <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> then King of <hi>Lycia</hi>; with as many mo great Princes, drawen either by our reputation, or by willingnes to acknowledge themselues obliged vnto vs, for what we had done for the others. So as in those partes of the woild, I thinke, in many hundreds of yeares, there was not seene so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> royall an assemblie: where nothing was let passe to doo vs the highest honors, which such persons (who might commaund both purses and inuentions) could perfourme. All from all sides bringing vnto vs right toyall presents (which we to auoide both vnkindnes, and importunitie, liberally receiued,) and not content therewith, would needes accept, as from vs, their crownes, and acknowledge to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> hold them of vs: with many other excessiue honors, which would not suffer the measure of this short leisure to describe vnto you.</p>

We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore suffred but short delayes, desiring to take this countrey in our way, so renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ouer the worlde, that no Prince coulde pretend height, nor bigger lownesse, to barre him from the sound thereof: renowmed indeede, not so much for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient prayses attributed thereunto, as for the hauing in it <hi>Argalus</hi> and <hi>Amphialus</hi> (two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> knights of such rare prowes, as we desired especially to know) and yet by farre, not so much for that, as without suffering of comparison for the beautie of you and your sister, which makes all indifferent iudges, that speake thereof, account this countrie as a temple of deities. But these causes indeed mouing vs to come by this land, wee embarked our selues in the next porte, whether all those Princes (sauing <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> who returned, as he pretended, not able to tarry longer from <hi>Erona</hi>) conueied vs. And there found we a ship most royally furnished by <hi>Plexirtus,</hi> who had made all thinges so proper (as well for our defence, as ease) that all the other Princes greatly commended him for it: who (seeming a quite altered man) had nothing but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in his eies, friendship in his gesture, and vertue in his mouth: so that we who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> had promised the sweete <hi>Zelmane</hi> to pardon him, now not onely forgaue, but began to fauour; perswading our selues with a youthfull credulitie, that pechance thinges were not so euill as wee tooke them and as it were desiring our owne memorie, that it might be so. But so were we licensed from those Princes, truely not without teares, especially of the vertuous <hi>Leonatus,</hi> who with the king of <hi>Pontus,</hi> would haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> come with vs, but that we (in respect of the ones young wife, and both their new settled kingdomes) would not suffer it. Then would they haue sent whole fleetes to to guard vs: but we, that desired to passe secretely into <hi>Greece,</hi> made them leaue that motion, when they found that more ships, then one, would be displeasing vnto vs. But so committing our selues to the vncertaine discretion of the wind, we (then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> as soone as we came to <hi>Greece,</hi> to take the names of <hi>Daiphantus</hi> &amp; <hi>Palladius</hi> as well for our owne promise to <hi>Zelmane,</hi> as because we desired to come vnknowne into <hi>Greece</hi>) left the <hi>Asian</hi> shore full of Princely persons, who euen vpon their knees recommended our safeties to the deuotion of their chiefe desires: among whome none had bene so officious (though I dare affirme, all quite contrarie to his vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> as <hi>Plexirtus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And So hauing sailed almost two daies, looking for nothing but when we might looke vpon the land, a graue m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n (whom we had seene of great trust with <hi>Plexirtus</hi> and was sent as our principall guide) came vnto vs, and with a certaine kinde man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner mixt with shame, &amp; repentance, began to tel vs, that he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such a loue vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> vs (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering our youth &amp; fame) that though he were a seruant &amp; a seruant of such, trust about <hi>Plexirtus,</hi> as that he had committed vnto him euen those secretes of his hart, which abhorde all other knowledge; yet he rather chose to reueale at this time a most pernitious counsel; then by councealing it bring to ruin those, whom he could not choose but honour. So went he on, and tolde vs, that <hi>Plexirtus</hi> (in hope therby <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> to haue <hi>Artaxia,</hi> endowed with the great Kingdome of <hi>Armenia,</hi> to his wife) had giuen him order when we were neere <hi>Greece,</hi> to finde some opportunitie to murder vs, bidding him to take vs a sleepe, because he had seene what we could do waking.
<pb facs="tcp:12151:103"/>
Now sirs (said he) I would rather a thousand times loose my life, then haue my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance (while I liued) poysoned with such a mischiefe: and therefore if it were onely I, that knewe herein the Kings order, then should my disobedience be a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of your safetie. But to one more (said hee) namely the Captaine of the shippe, <hi>Plexirtus</hi> hath opened so much touching the effect of murdering you, though I think <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> laying the cause rather vpon old grudge, then his hope o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Artaxia.</hi> And my selfe, (before the consideration of your excellencies had drawn loue and pittie into mind imparted it to such, as I thought fittest for such a mischiefe. Therefore, I wishe you to stand vpon your garde assuring you, that what I can doo for your safetie, you shal see (if it come to the pushe) by me perfourmed. We thanked him, as the matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> deserued, and from that time would no more disarme our selues, nor the one "sleepe without his friendes eyes waked for him: so that it delaied the going forward of their bad enterprize, while they thought it rather chaunce, then prouidence, which made vs so behaue ourselues.</p>
            <p>But when we came within halfe a daies sayling of the shore, so that they sawe it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> was speedily, or not at all to be done. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (&amp; I remember it was about the first watch in the night) came the Captaine and whispered the Councellour in the eare: But he (as it should seem) disswading him from it, the Captaine (who had bene a pyrate from his youth, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ten blouded in it) with a lowde voice sware, that if <hi>Plexirtus</hi> bad him, he would not sticke to kill God him selfe. And therewith cald his mates,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and in the Kings name willed them to take vs, aliue or dead; encouraging them with the spoile of vs, which he said, (and indeed was true) would yeeld many exceeding rich iewels. But the Councellour according to his promise) commanded them they should not commit such a villany, protesting that hee would stand betweene them and the Kings anger therein. Wherewith the Captaine enraged: Nay (said he) then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> we must begin with this traitor him selfe: and therewith gaue him a sore blow vpon the head, who honestly did the best he could to reuenge himselfe.</p>
            <p>But then we knew it time rather to encounter, then waite for mischiefe. And so against the Captaine wee went, who straight was enuironned with most parte of the Souldiers and Mariners. And yet the trueth is, there were some, whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> either the authoritie of the councellour, doubt of the Kinges minde, or liking of vs, made drawe their swords of our side: so that quickely it grewe a most confused fight. For the narrownesse of the place, the darkenesse of the time, and the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in such a tumult how to know friends from foes, made the rage of swordes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guide, then be guided by their maisters. For my cousin and mee, truely I thinke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> wee neuer perfourmed lesse in any place, doing no other hurte, then the defence of our selues, and succouring them who came for it, draue vs too: for not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning perfectly, who were for, or against vs, we thought it lesse euill to spare a foe, then spoile a freend. But from the highest to the lowest parte of the shippe there was no place lefte, without cryes of murdring, and murdred persons. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Captaine I hapt a while to fight withall, but was driuen to parte with him, by hearing the crie of the Councellour, who receiued a mortall wounde, mistaken of one of his owne side. Some of the wiser would call to parley, and wish peace, but while the words of peace were in their mouthes, some of their euill auditours gaue them death for their hire. So that no man almost could conceiue hope of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> liuing, but by being last aliue: and therefore euery one was willing to make him selfe roome, by dispatching almost any other: so that the great number in the ship
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12151:103"/>
was reduced to exceeding few, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of those few the most part weary of those trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles leapt into the boate, which was fast to the ship: but while they that were first, were cutting of the rope that tied it, others came leaping in, so disorderly, that they drowned both the boate, and themselues.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But while euen in that little remnant (like the children of <hi>Cadmus</hi>) we continued still to slay one an other, a fire, which (whether by the desperate malice of some, or intention to separate, or accidentally while all thinges were cast vp and downe) it should seeme had taken a good while before, but neuer heeded of vs, (who onely thought to preserue, or reuenge) now violently burst out in many places, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> to maister the principall partes of the ship. Then necessitie made vs see, that, a common enimy sets at one a ciuill warre: for that little all we were (as if wee had bene waged by one man to quench a fire) streight went to resist that furious enimie by all art and labour: but it was to late, for already it did embrace and deuoure from the sterne, to the wast of the ship: so as labouring in vaine, we were driuen to get vp <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> to the prowe of the ship, by the worke of nature seeking to preserue life, as long as we could: while truely it was a straunge and ougly sight, to see so huge a fire, as it quickly grew to be, in the Sea, and in the night, as if it had come to light vs to death. And by and by it had burned off the maste, which all this while had prowdly borne the sayle (the winde, as might seeme, delighted to carrie fire &amp; bloud in his mouth) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> but now it fell ouerboord, and the fire growing neerer vs, it was not onely terrible in respect of what we were to attend, but insupportable through the heat of it.</p>
            <p>So that we were constrained to bide it no longer, but disarming and stripping our selues, and laying our selues vpon such things, as we thought might help our swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the lande (too far for our owne strength to beare vs) my cousin and I threw <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> ourselues into the Sea. But I had swomme a very little way, when I felt (by reason of a wound I had) that I should not be able to bide the trauaile, and therefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the maste (whose tackling had bene burnt of) flote cleare from the ship, I swa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me vnto it, and getting on it, I found mine owne sworde, which by chaunce, when I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> threw it away (caught by a peece of canuas) had honge to the maste. I was glad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I loued it well; but gladder, when I saw at the other end, the Captaine of the ship and of all this mischiefe; who hauing a long pike, belike had borne himselfe vp with that, till he had set him selfe vpon the mast. But when I perceiued him. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine (said I) doost thou thinke to ouerliue so many honest men, whom thy false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> hath brought to destruction? with that bestriding the mast, I gat by little and little towardes him, after such a manner as boies are wont (if euer you saw that sport) when they ride the wild mare. And he perceiuing my intention, like a fellow that had much more courage then honestie, set him selfe to resist. But I had in short space gotten within him, and (giuing him a sound blowe) sent him to feede fishes. But there my selfe remainde, vntill by pyrates I was taken vp, &amp; among them againe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> taken prisoner, and brought into <hi>Laconia.</hi>

               <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> I long
<pb facs="tcp:12151:104"/>
to heare out till your meeting me: for there to me-ward is the best part of your sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Ah sweet <hi>Philoclea</hi> (said <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) do you thinke I can thinke so precious leysure as this well spent in talking. Are your eyes a fit booke (thinke you) to reade a tale vpon? Is my loue quiet inough to be an historian? Deare Princesse, be gracious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. And then he faine would haue remembred to haue forgot himselfe. But she,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> with a sweetly disobeying grace, desired him that her desire (once for euer) might serue, that no spote might disgrace that loue which shortly she hoped should be to the world warrantable. Faine he would not haue heard, till shee threatned anger. And then the poore louer durst not, because he durst not. Nay I pray thee, deare <hi>Pyrocles</hi> (said she) let me haue my story. Sweet Princesse (said he) giue my thoughts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a little respite: and if it please you, since this time must so bee spoiled, yet it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the lesse harme, if you vouchsafe to bestow your voice, and let mee know, how the good Queene <hi>Erona</hi> was betraied into such danger, and why <hi>Plangus</hi> sought me. For indeede, I should pitie greatly any mischance fallen to that Princesse. I will, said <hi>Philoclea</hi> smiling, so you giue me your worde, your handes shall be quiet auditours.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> They shall, said he, because subiect. Then began shee to speake, but with so prettie and delightfull a maiestie, when she set her countenaunce to tell the matter, that <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles</hi> could not chuse but rebell so far, as to kisse her. She would haue puld her head away, and speake, but while she spake he kist, &amp; it seemed he fedde vpon her words: but she gate away. How will you haue your discourse (said she) without you let my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> lips alone? Hee yeelded and tooke her hand. On this (saide hee) will I reuenge my wrong: and so began to make much of that hand, when her tale, &amp; his delight were interrupted by <hi>Miso</hi>: who taking her time, while <hi>Basilius</hi> backe was turned, came vnto them: and tolde <hi>Philoclea,</hi> she deserued she knew what, for leauing her mother, being euill at ease, to keepe companie with straungers. But <hi>Philoclea</hi> telling her, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> she was there by her fathers commandement, she went away muttering, that though her back, &amp; her shoulders, &amp; her necke were broken, yet as long as her tongue would wagge, it should do her errand to her mother. And so went vp to <hi>Gynecia,</hi> who was at that time miserably vexed with this manner of dreame. It seemed vnto her to bee in a place full of thornes, which so molested her, as she could neither abide standing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> still, nor tread safely going forward. In this case she thought <hi>Zelmane,</hi> being vpon a faire hill, delightfull to the eye, and easie in apparance, called her thither: whither with much anguish being come, <hi>Zelmane</hi> was vanished, and she found nothing but a dead bodie like vnto her husband, which seeming at the first with a strange smel to infect her, as she was redie likewise within a while to die, the dead bodie she thought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> tooke her in his armes, and said, <hi>Gynecia,</hi> leaue all; for here is thy onely rest.</p>
            <p>With that she awaked, crying very loud, <hi>Zelmane, Zelmane.</hi> But remembring her selfe, and seeing <hi>Basilius</hi> by, (her guiltie conscience more suspecting, then being su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected she turned her cal, and called for <hi>Philoclea. Miso</hi> forthwith like a valiant shrew, (looking at <hi>Basilins,</hi> as though she would speake though she died for it) tolde <hi>Gynecia,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> that her daughter had bene a whole houre togither in secrete talke with <hi>Zelmane</hi>: And (sayes she) for my part I coulde not be heard (your daughters are brought vp in such awe) though I tolde her of your pleasure sufficiently. <hi>Gynecia,</hi> as if shee had heard her last doome pronounced against her, with a side-looke &amp; chaunged coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, O my Lorde (said she) what meane you to suffer these yong folkes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> 
               <hi>Basilius</hi> (that aymed nothing at the marke of her suspition) smilingly tooke her in his armes, sweete wife (said he) I thanke you for your care of your childe: but
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:12151:104"/>
they must be youthes of other mettall, then <hi>Zelmane,</hi> that can endaunger her. O but; cryed <hi>Gynecia,</hi> and therewith she stayed: for then indeede she did suffer a right conflict, betwixt the force of loue, and rage of iealousie. Manie times was she about to satisfie the spite of her minde, and tell <hi>Basilius,</hi> how she knewe <hi>Zelmane</hi> to bee farre <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> otherwise then the outwarde appearance. But those many times were all put backe by the manifolde obiections of her vehement loue. Faine shee would haue barde her daughters happe, but loth she was to cut off her owne hope. But now, as if her life had bene set vppon a wager of quicke rysing, as weake as shee was, shee gat vp; though <hi>Basilius,</hi> (with a kindnesse flowing onely from the fountaine of vnkindnesse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> being indeed desirous to winne his daughter as much time as might bee) was loth to suffer it, swearing hee sawe sickenesse in her face, and therefore was loath shee should aduenture the ayre.</p>
            <p>But the great and wretched Ladie <hi>Gynecia,</hi> possessed with those deuils of Loue and Iealousie, did rid herselfe from her tedious husbande: and taking no body with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> her going toward them; O Iealousie (said she) the phrensie of wise folkes, the well-wishing spite, and vnkinde carefulnesse, the selfe-punishment for others fault, and selfe-miserie in others happinesse, the cousin of enuie, daughter of loue, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of hate, how couldest thou so quietly get thee a seate in the vnquiet hart of <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necia, Gynecia</hi> (said she sighing) thought wise, and once vertuous? Alas it is thy bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> power which plantes thee there: it is the flaming agonie of affection, that works the chilling accesse of thy feuer, in such sort, that nature giues place; the growing of my daughter seemes the decay of my selfe; the blessings of a mother turne to the curses of a competitor; and the faire face of <hi>Philoclea,</hi> appeares more horrible in my sight, then the image of death. Then remembred she this song, which she thought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> tooke a right measure of her present minde,

But her vnleasured thoughtes ran not ouer the ten first wordes; but going with a pace, not so much to fast for her bodie, as slowe for her minde, shee found them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> who after <hi>Misos</hi> departure, had left their tale, and determined what to say to <hi>Basilius.</hi> But full abashed was poore <hi>Philoclea,</hi> (whose conscience now began to know cause of blushing) for first salutation, receyuing an eye from her mother, full of the
<pb facs="tcp:12151:105"/>
same disdainefull scorne, which <hi>Pallas</hi> shewed to poore <hi>Arachne,</hi> that durst contend with her for the prize of well weauing: yet did the force of loue so much rule her, that though for <hi>Zelmanes</hi> sake she did detest her, yet for <hi>Zelmanes</hi> sake shee vsed no harder words to her, then to bid her go home, and accompany her solitarie father.</p>
            <p>Then began she to display to <hi>Zelmane</hi> the storehouse of her deadly desires, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> sodainly the confused rumor of a mutinous multitude gaue iust occasion to <hi>Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> to breake of any such conference, (for well shee found, they were not friendly voices they heard) and to retire with as much diligence as conueniently they could towards the lodge. Yet before they coulde winne the lodge by twentie paces, they were ouertaken by an vnruly sort of clownes, and other rebels, which like a violent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> floud, were caried, they themselues knewe not whether. But assoone as they came within perfect discerning these Ladies, like enraged beastes, without respect of their estates, or pitie of their sexe, they began too runne against them, as right villaines, thinking abilitie to doo hurt, to be a great aduancement: yet so many as they were, so many almost were their mindes, all knitte together only in madnes. Some cried,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Take; some, Kill; some, Saue: but euen they that cried saue, ran for companie with them that meant to kill. Euerie one commaunded, none obeyed, he onely seemed chiefe Captaine, that was most ragefull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zelmane</hi> (whose vertuous courage was euer awake) drew out her sword, which vpon those il-armed churls giuing as many wounds as blowes and as many deathes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> almost as wounds (lightning courage, and thundering smart vpon them) kept them at a bay, while the two Ladies got themselues into the lodge: out of the which, <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> (hauing put on an armour long vntried) came to proue his authoritie among his subiects, or at lest, to aduenture his life with his deare mistresse, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he brought a shield, while the Ladies tremblingly atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the issue of this dangerous aduenture.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> But <hi>Zelmane</hi> made them perceiue the ods betweene an Eagle and a Kight, with such a nimble stayednes, and such an assured nimblenes, that while one was running backe feare, his fellow had her sword in his guts.</p>
            <p>And by and by was both her harte and helpe well encreased by the comming of <hi>Dorus,</hi> who hauing beene making of hurdles for his masters sheepe, hearde the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> horrible cries of this madde multitude; and hauing streight represented before the eies of his carefull loue, the perill wherein the soule of his soule might bee, hee went to <hi>Pamelas</hi> lodge, but found her in a caue hard by, with <hi>Mopsa</hi> and <hi>Dametas,</hi> who at that time would not haue opened the entrie to his father. And therefore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them there (as in a place safe, both for being strong, and vnknowen) he ranne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> as the noise guyded him. But when hee sawe his friende in such danger among them, anger and contempt (asking no counsell but of courage) made him runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, with no other weapon but his sheephooke, and with that ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the villaines, tooke away a two-hand sword from him, and withall, helpt him from euer being ashamed of loosing it. Then lifting vp his braue heade, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ashing terror into their faces, he made armes and legs goe complaine to the earth, how euill their maisters had kept them. Yet the multitude still growing, and the verie killing wearying them (fearing, lest in long fight they should bee conquered with conquering) they drew back toward the lodge; but drew back in such sort, that still their terror went forwarde: like a valiant mastiffe, whom when his master pulles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> backe by the taile from the beare (with whom he hath alreadie interchanged a hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imbracement) though his pace be backwarde, his gesture is foreward, his teeth
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:12151:105"/>
and eyes threatning more in the retiring, then they did in the aduancing: so gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they themselues homeward, neuer stepping steppe backward, but that they proued themselues masters of the ground where they stept.</p>
            <p>Yet among the rebels there was a dapper fellowe, a tayler by occupation, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> fetching his courage onelie from their going back, began to bow his knees, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fencer-like to draw neere to <hi>Zelmane.</hi> But as he came within her distance, turning his swerd very nicely about his crown, <hi>Basilius,</hi> with a side blow, strake off his nose. He (being a suiter to a seimsters daughter, and therefore not a little grieued for such a disgrace) stouped downe, because he had hard, that if it were fresh put to, it would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> cleaue on againe. But as his hand was on the ground to bring his nose to his head, <hi>Zelmane</hi> with a blow, sent his head to his nose. That saw a butcher, a butcherlie chuffe indeed (who that day was sworn brother to him in a cup of wine) and lifted vp a great leauer, calling <hi>Zelmane</hi> all the vile names of a butcherly eloquence. But she (letting slippe the blowe of the leauer) hitte him so surely vpon the side of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> face, that she left nothing but the nether iawe, where the tongue still wagged, as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to say more, if his masters remembrance had serued. O (said a miller that was halfe dronke) see the lucke of a good fellow, and with that word, ran with a pitch-forke at <hi>Dorus:</hi> but the nimblenes of the wine caried his head so fast, that it made it ouer-runne his feet, so that he fell withall, iust betwene the legs of <hi>Dorus:</hi> who set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> his foote on his neck (though he offered two milche kine, and foure fat hogs for his life) thrust his sword quite through, from one eare to the other; which toke it very vnkindlie, to feele such newes before they heard of them, in stead of hearing, to be put to such feeling. But <hi>Dorus</hi> (leauing the miller to vomit his soule out in wine and bloud) with his two-hand sword strake off another quite by the waste, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> who the night before had dreamed he was growen a couple, and (interpreting it that he should be maried) had bragd of his dreame that morning among his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors. But that blow astonished quite a poore painter, who stood by with a pike in his hands. This painter was to counterfette the skirmish betwene the <hi>Centaures</hi> and <hi>Lapithes,</hi> and had bene very desirous to see some notable wounds, to be able the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> more liuely to expresse them; and this morning (being caried by the streame of this companie) the foolish felow was euen delighted to see the effect of blowes. But this last (hapning neere him) so amazed him, that he stood stock still, while <hi>Dorus</hi> (with a turne of his sword) strake off both his hands. And so the painter returned, well skilled in wounds, but with neuer a hand to performe his skill.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> In this manner they recouered the lodge, &amp; gaue the rebels a face of wood of the outside. But they then (though no more furious, yet more couragious whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they saw no resister) went about with pickaxe to the wall, &amp; fire to the gate, to get themselues entrance. Then did the two Ladies mixe feare with loue, especially <hi>Philoclea,</hi> who euer caught hold of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> so (by the follie of loue) hindering the succour which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> she desired. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> seeing no way of defence, nor time to deliberate (the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The blowes she had dealt before (though all in generall were hastie) made each of them in particular take breath, before they brought them so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>er-neere her, so that she had time to get vp to the iudgement-seate
<pb facs="tcp:12151:106"/>
of the Prince, which (according to the guise of that countrie) was before the court gate. There she paused a while, making signe with her hand vnto them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, speaking aloud, that she had something to say vnto them, that would please them. But she was answered awhile with nothing but shouts and cries; and some beginning to throw stones at her, not daring to approach her. But at length, a yong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> farmer (who might do most among the countrie sort, and was caught in a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towardes <hi>Zelmane</hi>) hoping by this kindenesse to haue some good of her, desired them, if they were honest men, to heare the woman speake. Fie fellowes, fie, (said he) what will all the maides in our towne say, if so many tall men shall be afraide to heare a faire wench? I sweare vnto you by no little ones, I had rather giue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> my teeme of oxen, then we should shewe our selues so vnciuill wights. Besides, I tell you true, I haue heard it of old men counted wisdome, to heare much, and say little. His sententious speech so preuailed, that the most part began to listen. Then she, with such efficacie of gracefulnes, and such a quiet magnanimitie represented in her face in this vttermost perill, as the more the barbarous people looked, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> more it fixed their looks vpon her, in this sort began vnto them.</p>
            <p>It is no small comfort vnto me (said she) hauing to speake something vnto you for your owne behoofs, to finde that I haue to deale with such a people, who shew indeed in themselues the right nature of valure, which as it leaues no violence vnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, while the choller is nourished with resistance; so when the subiect of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> their wrath, doth of it self vnloked-for offer it selfe into their hands, it makes them at lest take a pause before they determine cruelty. Now then first (before I come to the principall matter) haue I to say vnto you; that your Prince <hi>Basilius</hi> himselfe in person is within this Lodge, and was one of the three, whom a few of you went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to fight withall: (and this she said, not doubting but they knew it well inough; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> but because she would haue them imagine, that the Prince might thinke that they did not know it) by him am I sent vnto you, as from a Prince to his well approoued subiects, nay as from a father to beloued children, to know what it is that hath bred iust quarrell among you, or who they be that haue any way wronged you? what it is with which you are displeased, or of which you are desirous? This he requires:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and indeed (for he knowes your faithfulnes) he commaunds you presently to set downe, and to choose among your selues some one, who may relate your griefes or demaundes vnto him.</p>
            <p>This (being more then they hoped for from their Prince) asswaged well their furie, and many of them consented (especially the young farmer helping on, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> meant to make one of the demaunds that he might haue <hi>Zelmane</hi> for his wife) but when they began to talke of their grieues, neuer Bees made such a confused hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: the towne dwellers demanding putting downe of imposts: the country fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes laying out of commons: some would haue the Prince keepe his Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And of ech side were like diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, one neighbourhood beginning to finde fault with another.

No lesse ado was there about choosing him, who should be their spokes-man. The finer sort of Burgesses, as Marchants, Prentises, and Clothworkers, because of their riches, disdaining the baser occupations, and they because of their number as much disdaining them: all they scorning the countrimens ignorance, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> suspecting as much their cunning: So that <hi>Zelmane</hi> (finding that their vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rage was now growne, not only to a diuiding, but to a crossing one of another, and that the mislike growne among themselues did well allay the heate against her) made tokens againe vnto them (as though she tooke great care of their well doing, and were afraid of their falling out) that she would speake vnto them. They now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> growne iealous one of another (the stay hauing ingendred diuision, and diuision hauing manifested their weaknes) were willing inough to heare, the most part stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to show themselues willinger then their fellowes: which <hi>Zelmane</hi> (by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaunce she had had with such kinde of humors) soone perceiuing, with an angerles brauery, and an vnabashed mildnes, in this manner spake vnto them.</p>

But the strangenes of your action makes that vsed for vertue, which your violent necessitie imposeth. For certainely, a woman may well speake to such men, who haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> all manlike gouernment: a straunger may with reason instruct such subiects, that neglect due points of subiection: and is it maruaile this place is entred into by another, since your owne Prince (after thirtie yeares gouernment) dare not shew his face vnto his faithfull people?

For such a hellish madnes (I know) did neuer enter into your harts, as to attempt any thing against his

person; which no successor, though neuer so hatefull, will euer leaue (for his owne sake) vnreuenged. Neither can your wonted valour be turned to such a basenes, as in stead of a Prince, deliuered vnto you by so many royall ancestors, to take the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous yoke of your fellow subiect, in whome the innate meanes will bring forth rauenous couetousnes, and the newnes of his estate, suspectfull cruelty. Imagine,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> what could your enimies more wish vnto you, then to see your owne estate with your owne handes vndermined? O what would your fore-fathers say, if they liued at this time, and saw their of-spring defacing such an excellent principalitie, which they with much labour and bloud so wisely haue establisht? Do you thinke them fooles, that saw you should not enioy your vines, your cattell, no not your wiues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and children, without gouernment; and that there could be no gouernment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Magistrate, and no Magistrate without obedience, and no obedience where euery one vpon his owne priuate passion, may interprete the doings of the rulers? Let your wits make your present example a lesson to you. What sweetnes (in good faith) find you in your present condition? what choise of choise finde you, if you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> had lost <hi>Basilius?</hi> vnder whose ensigne would you go, if your enimies should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade you? If you cannot agree vpon one to speake for you, how will you agree vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one to fight for you? But with this feare of I cannot tell what, one is troubled, and with that passed wrong another is grieued. And I pray you did the Sunne euer bring you a fruitfull haruest, but that it was more hote then pleasant? Haue any of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> you children, that be not sometimes cumbersome? Haue any of you fathers, that be not sometime weerish? What, shall we curse the Sonne, hate our childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or disobey our fathers? But what need I vse these words, since I see in your countenances (now vertuously settled) nothing els but loue and dutie to him, by whom for your only sakes the gouernment is embraced. For all what is done, he doth not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> you, but thanke you; iudging the action by the minds, &amp; not the minds by the action. Your grieues, and desires, whatsoeuer, and whensoeuer you list, he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of, and to his consideration it is reason you should refer them. So then, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; the vncertainty of his estate made you take armes; now you see him well, with the same loue lay them downe. If now you end (as I know you will) he will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> make no other account of this matter, but as of a vehement, I must confesse ouer-ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement affection: the only continuance might proue a wickednes.

            <p>The action <hi>Zelmane</hi> vsed, being beautified by nature and apparelled with skill, her gestures being such, that as her words did paint out her minde, so they serued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> as a shadow, to make the picture more liuely and sensible, with the sweete cleernesse of her voice, rising and falling kindly as the nature of the worde, and efficacie of the matter required, altogether in such an admirable person, whose incomparable valour they had well felte, whose beautie did pearce through the thicke dulnes of their senses, gaue such a way vnto her speach through the rugged wildernesse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> their imaginations, who (besides they were striken in admiration of her, as of more then a humane creature) were coold with taking breath, and had learned doubts out of leasute, that in steed of roaring cries, there was now heard nothing, but a confused muttring, whether her saying were to be followed, betwixt feare to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, and lothnesse to leaue: most of them could haue bene content, it had neuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> bene begun, but how to end it (each afraid of his companion,) they knew not, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it far easier to tie then to loose knots.

such mutinies, to giue the mutinous some occasion of such seruice, as they might thinke (in their owne iudgement) would counteruaile their trespasse, withall, to take the more assured possession of their mindes, which she feared might begin to wauer, Loiall <hi>Arcadians</hi> (said she) now do I offer vnto you the manifesting of your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> duties: all those that haue taken armes for the Princes safetie, let them turne their backs to the gate, with their weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s bent against such as would hurt his sacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. O weake trust of the many-headed multitude, whom inconstancie onely doth guide to wel doing: who can set confidence there, where co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany takes away shame, and ech may lay the fault on his fellow? So said a craftie felow among them, named <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
               <hi>Clinias,</hi> to himselfe, when he saw the word no sooner out of <hi>Zelmanes</hi> mouth, but that there were some shouts of ioy, with, God saue <hi>Basilius,</hi> and diuers of them with much iollity growne to be his guard, that but litle before ment to be his murderers.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Clinias</hi> in his youth had bene a scholler so farre, as to learne rather words then maners, and of words rather plentie then order; and oft had vsed to be an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> actor in Tragedies, where he had learned, besides a slidingnesse of language, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with many passions, and to frame his face to beare the figure of them: long vsed to the eyes and eares of men, and to recken no fault, but shamefastnesse; in nature, a most notable Coward, and yet more strangely then rarely venturous in priuie practises.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> This fellowe was become of neere trust to <hi>Cecropia, Amphialus</hi> his mother, so that he was priuy to all the mischieuous deuises, wherewith she went about to ruine <hi>Basilius,</hi> and his children, for the aduauncing of her sonne: and though his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation had made him full of tongue, yet his loue to be doing, taught him in any euill to be secret; and had by his mistresse bene vsed (euer since the strange retiring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> of <hi>Basilius</hi>) to whisper rumors into the peoples eares: and this time (finding great aptnes in the multitude) was one of the chiefe that set them in the vprore (though quite without the consent of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> who would not for all the Kingdoms of the world so haue aduentured the life of <hi>Philoclea.</hi>) But now perceiuing the flood of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> their furie began to ebbe, he thought it policie to take the first of the tide, so that no man cried lowder then he, vpon <hi>Basilius.</hi> And some of the lustiest rebels not yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to the rest, he caused two or three of his mates that were at his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to lift him vp, &amp; then as if he had had a prologue to vtter, he began with a nice grauitie to demaund audience. But few attending what he said, with vehement ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> as if he would teare the stars from the skies, he fell to crying out so lowde, that not onely <hi>Zelmane,</hi> but <hi>Basilius</hi> might heare him. O vnhappie men, more mad then the Giants that would haue plucked <hi>Iupiter</hi> out of heauen, how long shall this rage continue? why do you not all throw downe your weapons, and submit your selues to our good Prince, our good <hi>Basilius,</hi> the <hi>Pelops</hi> of wisdom, and <hi>Minos</hi> of all good gouernment? when will you begin to beleue me, and other honest and faithfull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> subiects, that haue done all we could to stop your furie?</p>
            <p>The farmer that loued <hi>Zelmane</hi> could abide him no longer. For as at the first he was willing to speake of conditions, hoping to haue gotten great souerainties, and among the rest <hi>Zelmane:</hi> so now perceiuing, that the people, once anything downe the hill from their furie, would neuer stay till they came to the bottom of absolute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> yeelding, and so that he should be nearer feares of punishment, then hopes of such aduancement, he was one of them that stood most against the agreement: and to begin withal, disdaining this fellow should play the preacher, who had bin one of
<pb facs="tcp:12151:108"/>
the chiefest make-bates, strake him a great wound vpon the face with his sword. The cowardly wretch fell downe, crying for succour, and (scrambling through the legs of them that were about him) gat to the throne, where <hi>Zelmane</hi> tooke him, and comforted him, bleeding for that was past, and quaking for feare of more.</p>
            <p>But as soone as that blow was giuen (as if <hi>AEolus</hi> had broke open the doore to let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> all his winds out) no hand was idle, ech one killing him that was next, for feare he should do as much to him. For being diuided in minds and not diuided in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they that would yeeld to <hi>Basilius</hi> were intermingled with them that would not yeeld. These men thinking their ruine stood vpon it; those men to get fauour of their Prince, conuerted their vngracious motion into their owne bowels, and by a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> true iudgement grew their owne punishers. None was sooner killed then those that had bene leaders in the disobedience: who by being so, had taught them, that they did leade disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the same leaders. And many times it fell out that they killed them that were of their owne faction, anger whetting, and doubt hastening their fingers. But then came downe <hi>Zelmane</hi>; and <hi>Basilius</hi> with <hi>Dorus</hi> issued, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> somtimes seeking to draw together those of their party, somtimes laying indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among them, made such hauocke (among the rest <hi>Zelmane</hi> striking the farmer to the hart with her sword, as before she had done with her eyes) that in a while all they of the contrary side were put to flight, and fled to certaine woods vpon the frontiers; where feeding wildly, and drinking onely water, they were disciplined <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> for their dronken riots; many of them being slaine in the chase, about a score onely escaping. But when these late rebels, now souldiers, were returned from the chase, <hi>Basilius</hi> calling them togither, partly for policy sake, but principally because <hi>Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> before had spoken it (which was to him more then a diuine ordinance) he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their generall pardon, willing them to returne to their houses, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> be more circumspect in their proceedings: which they did most of them with sharp marks of their folly. But imagining <hi>Clinias</hi> to be one of the chiefe that had bred this good alteration, he gaue him particular thanks, and withall willed him to make him know, how this frenzie had entred into the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clinias</hi> purposing indeede to tell him the trueth of all, sauing what did touch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> himselfe, or <hi>Cecropia,</hi> first, dipping his hand in the blood of his wound, Now by this blood (said he) which is more deare to me, then al the rest that is in my body, since it is spent for your safety: this tong (perchance vnfortunate, but neuer false) shall not now begin to lie vnto my Prince, of me most beloued. Then stretching out his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and making vehement countenances the vshers to his speches, in such maner of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> tearms recounted this accident. Yesterday (said he) being your birth-day, in the goodly greene two mile hence before the city of <hi>Enispus,</hi> to do honour to the day, were a four or fiue thousand people (of all conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as I think) gathered together, spending al the day in dancings &amp; other exercises: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> night came, vnder tents and bowes making great cheare, and meaning to obserue a wassaling watch all that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> night for your sake. <hi>Bacchus</hi> (the learned say) was begot with thunder: I thinke, that made him euer since so full of stur &amp; debate. <hi>Bacchus</hi> indeed it was which sounded the first tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet to this rude Alaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For that barbarous opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being generally amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to think with vice to do honor, &amp; with actiuitie in beastlines to shew abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of loue, made most of them seeke to shew the depth of their affection in the depth of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> their draught. But being once wel chafed with wine (hauing spent al the night, and some peece of the morning in such reuelling) &amp; imboldned by your absented ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:12151:108"/>
of liuing, there was no matter their eares had euer heard of that gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w not to be a subiect of their winie conference. I speake it by proofe: for I take witnes of the Gods (who neuer leaue periuries vnpunished) that I often cried out against their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency, and (when that would not serue) stopt mine ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, because I woulde not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> be partaker of their blasphemies, till with buffets they forced me to haue mine eares and eies defiled. Publike affairs were mingled with priuate grudges neither was any man thought of wit, that did not pretende some cause of mislike. Rayling was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fruite of freedome, and saying nothing had his vttermoste prayse in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce. At the length, your sacred person (alas) why did I liue to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>are it? alas howe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> do I breath to vtter it? But your commandement doth not onely enioine obedience, but giue me force: your sacred person (I say) fell to be their table-talke: a proud word swelling in their stomacks, &amp; disdainful reproches against so great a greatnes, hauing put on the shew of greatnes in their little mindes: till at length the very vnbrideled vse of wordes hauing increased fire in their mindes (which God wott thought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> their knowledge notable, because they had at all no knowledge to condemne their owne want of knowledge) they descended (O neuer to be forgotten presumption) to a direct mislike of your liuing from among them. Whereupon it were tedious to remember their far-fetched constructions. But the summe was, you disdained them: and what were the pompes of your estate, if their armes mainteyned you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> not? Who woulde call you a Prince, if you had not a people? When certaine of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wretched estates, &amp; worse minds (whose fortunes change could not impaire) began to say, that your gouernment was to be looked into; how the great treasures (you had leuied among them) had beene spent; why none but great men and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen could be admitted into counsel, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons (forsooth) were too plain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> headed to say their opinnions: but yet their blood and sweat must maintaine all. Who could tell whether you were not betraied in this place, where you liued? nay whether you did liue or no? Therefore that it was time to come and see; and if you were here, to know (if <hi>Arcadia</hi> were growne lothsome in your sight) why you did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> not ridde your selfe of the trouble? There woulde not want those that woulde take so faire a cumber in good parte. Since the Countrie was theirs, and the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment an adherent to the countrie, why should they not consider of the one as well as inhabite the other? Nay rather (said they) let vs beginne that, which all <hi>Arcadia</hi> will followe. Let vs deliuer our Prince from daunger of practises, and our selues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>

Lastly, to haue saide and heard so much, was as dangerous, as to haue attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and to attempt they had the glorious name of liberty with them. These words being spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (like a furious storme) presently carried away their wel inclined brains. What I, &amp; some other of the honester sort could do, was no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if with a puffe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> of breath, one should goe about to make a saile goe against a mightie winde: or, with one hand, stay the ruine of a mighty wall. So generall grewe this madnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, there needed no drumme, where each man cried, each spake to other that spake as fast to him, and the disagreeing sounde of so many voices was the chiefe token of their vnmeete agreement. Thus was their banquette turned to a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> battaile, their winie mirthes to bloudie rages, and the happie praiers for your life to monstrous thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:12151:109"/>
that follie, that the more it seekes to hurt, the lesse it considers how to bee able to hurt: they neuer wayed how to arme themselues but tooke vp euery thinge for a weapon, that furie offered to their handes. Many swordes, pikes, and billes there were: others tooke pitchforkes and rakes, conuerting husbandrie to souldierie some caught holde of spittes (thinges seruiceable for life) to bee the instruments of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> death. And there was some such one, who held the same pot wherein he drank to your health, to vse it (as he coulde) to your mischiefe. Thus armed, thus gouerned forcing the vnwilling, and hartening the willing, adding furie to furie, and encre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing rage with running, they came headlong towarde this lodge: no man (I dare say) resolued in his owne hart, what was the vttermost he would doo when he came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> hether. But as mischiefe is of such nature, that it cannot stand but with strengthning one euill by an other, and so multiplie in it selfe, till it come to the highest, and then fall with his owne weight: so to their mindes (once passed the boundes of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) more and more wickednes opened it selfe, so that they who first pretended to preserue you, then to reforme you, (I speak it in my conscience, and with a bleeding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> hart) now thought no safetie for them, without murdering you, So as if the Goddes (who preserue you for the preseruation of <hi>Arcadia</hi>) had not shewed their miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous power, and that they had not vsed for instruments, both your owne valour (not fit to be spoken of by so meane a mouth as mine) and some (I must confesse) honest minds, (whom alas why should I mention, since what wee did, reached not to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> hundred part of our duetie?) our handes (I tremble to think of it) had destroyed all that, for which we haue cause to reioyce that we are <hi>Arcadians.</hi>

And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> therefore pitying his wound willed him to get him home, and looke well vnto it, &amp; make the best search he could, to know if there were any further depth in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for which he should be well rewarded. But before he went away, certain of the shepheards being come (for that day was appointed for their pastorals) he sent one of them to <hi>Philanax,</hi> and an other to other principall noble-men, and cities there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> abouts, to make through-inquirie of this vprore, and withall, to place such garrisons in all the townes and villages neere vnto him, that he might thereafter keepe his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary lodge in more security, vpon the making of a fire, or ringing of a bell, hauing them in a redines for him.</p>

For as, while she stoode at the discretion of those vndis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> rebelles, euery angry countenance any of them made, seemed a knife layde vpon their owne throates; so vnspeakable was now their ioy, that they sawe (besides her safetie and their owne) the same wrought, and safely wrought by her meanes, in whom they had placed al their delightes.

            <p>For you forsoth (said he) whn I told you, that some supernaturall cause sent mee strange visions, which being confirmed with presagious chaunces, I had gon to <hi>Delphos,</hi> &amp; there receiued this answere, you replied to me, that the onely supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> causes were the humors of my body, which bred such melancholy dreames; and that both they framed a mind ful of conceipts, apt to make presages of things, which in themselues were meerly chaunceable: and with all as I say, you remember what you wrote vnto me, touching authoritie of the Oracle: but now I haue some nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble triall of the truth thereof, which hereafter I will more largly communicate vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> you. Only now, know that the thing I most feared is alredy performed; I mean that a forraine state should possesse my throne. For that hath been done by <hi>Zelmane,</hi> but not as I feared, to my ruine, but to my preseruation. But when he had once named <hi>Zelmane,</hi> that name was as good as a pully, to make the clocke of his praises run on in such sort, that (<hi>Philanax</hi> found) was more exquisite then the onely admiration of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> vertue breedeth: which his faithfull hart inwardly repining at, made him shrinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as soone as he could, to go about the other matters of importance, which <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> had enioyned vnto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Basilius</hi> returned into the Lodge, thus by him selfe construing the oracle, that in that hee saide, his elder care should by Princely meane bee stolne away from him,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> and yet not lost, it was now perfourmed, since <hi>Zelmane</hi> had as it were robd from him the care of his first begotten childe, yet was it not lost, since in his harte the ground of it remained. That his younger should with Natures blisse embrace the loue of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> because he had so commaunded her for his sake to doo; yet shoulde it be with as much hate of Nature, for being so hatefull an opposite to the iealousie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> hee thought her mother had of him. The sitting in his seate hee deemed by her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perfourmed: but that which most comforted him, was his interpretation of the adulterie, which hee thought hee shoulde commit with <hi>Zelmane,</hi> whom after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he should haue to his wife. The point of his daughters marriage, because it threatned his death withall, he determined to preuent with keeping them (while he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> liued) vnmaried. But hauing as hee thought, gotten thus much vnderstanding of the Oracle, hee determined for three daies after to perfourme certaine rites to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo:</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> But <hi>Artaxia</hi> (mortally hating them both for her brothers sake) was content to hide her hate, till she had time to shew it: and pretending that all her grudge was against the two paragons of vertue, <hi>Musidorus</hi> and <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> euen met them halfe way in excusing her brothers murder, as not being principall actors; and of the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, driuen to what they did by the euer-pardonable necessitie: and so well hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the matter, as, though she promised nothing, yet <hi>Antiphilus</hi> promised himselfe all that she would haue him thinke. And so a solemne enteruiew was appointed. But (as the Poets say) <hi>Hymen</hi> had not there his saffron-coloured cote. For <hi>Artaxia</hi> laying men secretly (and easily they might be secret, since <hi>Antiphilus</hi> thought she ouerran him in loue) when he came euen readie to embrace her, shewing rather a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> countenaunce of accepting then offering, they came forth, and (hauing much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage both in number, valure, and fore-preparation) put all his companie to the sword; but such as could flie away. As for <hi>Antiphilus</hi> she caused him and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona</hi> both to be put in irons, hasting backe toward her brothers tombe, vpon which she ment to sacrifice them; making the loue of her brother stand betwene her and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> all other motions of grace, from which by nature she was alienated.</p>
            <p>But great diuersitie in them two quickly discouered it selfe for the bearing of that affliction. For <hi>Antiphilus</hi> that had no greatnesse but outward, that taken away, was readie to fall faster then calamitie could thrust him; with fruitlesse begging of life (where reason might well assure him his death was resolued) and weake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> his fortune, to giue his enemies a most pleasing musique, with manie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and protestations, to as little purpose, as from a little minde. But <hi>Erona</hi> sad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, yet like one rather vsed, then new fallen to sadnesse (as who had the ioyes of her hart alreadie broken) seemed rather to welcome then to shun that ende of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, speaking little, but what she spake was for <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> remembring his guiltles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> being at that time prisoner to <hi>Tiridates,</hi> when the valiant princes slue him: to the disgrace of men, shewing that there are women both more wise to iudge what is to be expected, and more constant to beare it when it is happened.</p>
            <p>But her wit endeared by her youth, her affliction by her birth, and her sadnesse by her beautie, made this noble prince <hi>Plangus,</hi> who (neuer almost from his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>
               <hi>Artaxia</hi>) was now present at <hi>Eronaes</hi> taking, to perceyue the shape of loueli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse more perfectly in wo, then in ioyfulnesse (as in a picture which receiues greater life by the darkenesse of shadowes, then by more glittering colours) and
<pb facs="tcp:12151:112"/>
seeing to like; and liking to loue; and louing straight to feele the most incident effects of loue, to serue and preserue. So borne by the hastie tide of short leysure, he did hastily deliuer together his affection, and affectionate care. But she (as if he had spoken of a small matter, when he mencioned her life, to which she had not leisure to attend) desired him if he loued her, to shew it, in finding some way to saue <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> For her, she found the world but a wearisome stage vnto her, where she played a part against her will: and therefore besought him, not to cast his loue in so vnfruitfull a place, as could not loue it selfe: but for a testimonie of constancie, and a sutablenes to his word, to do so much comfort to her minde, as that for her sake <hi>Antiphilus</hi> were saued. He tolde me how much he argued against her tende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> him, who had so vngratefully betraied her, and foolishly cast away himselfe. But perceiuing she did not only bend her very good wits to speake for him against her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but when such a cause could be allied to no reason, yet loue would needes make it-selfe a cause, and barre her rather from hearing, then yeeld that she should yeeld to such arguments: he likewise in whom the power of Loue (as they say of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> spirits) was subiect to the loue in her, with griefe consented, &amp; (though backwardly) was diligent to labor the help of <hi>Antiphilus:</hi> a man whom he not only hated, as a traitour to <hi>Erona,</hi> but enuied as a possessor of <hi>Erona.</hi> Yet Loue sware, his hart, in spite of his hart, should make him become a seruant to his riuall. And so did he, seeking all the meanes of perswading <hi>Artaxia,</hi> which the authority of so neere, and so vertuous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> a kinsman could giue vnto him. But she to whom the eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of hatred had giuen reuenge the face of delight, reiected all such motions; but rather the more closely imprisoning them in her chiefe citie, where she kept them with intention at the birth-day of <hi>Tiridates</hi> (which was very nere) to execute <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> and at the day of his death (which was about halfe a yeere after) to vse the same rigor towards <hi>Erona.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Plangus</hi> much grieued (because much louing) attempted the humors of the <hi>Lyci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to see, whether they would come in with forces to succor their Princesse. But there the next inheritor to the crowne (with the true play that is vsed in the game of kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) had no sooner his mistres in captiuity, but he had vsurped her place, and making her odious to her people, because of the vnfit electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she had made, had so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> left no hope there: but which is worse, had sent to <hi>Artaxia,</hi> perswading the iusticing her, because that vniustice might giue his title the name of iustice. Wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting that way, <hi>Plangus</hi> practised with some deere friends of his, to saue <hi>Antiphilus</hi> out of prison, whose day because it was much neerer then <hi>Eronaes,</hi> and that he well found, she had twisted her life vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same threed with his, he determined first to get him out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> prison: and to that end hauing prepared all matters as well as in such case he could, where <hi>Artaxia</hi> had set many of <hi>Tiridates</hi> old seruants to haue well-marking eyes, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred with <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> as (by the aucthoritie he had) he found meanes to do; and agreed with him of the time &amp; maner, how he should by the death of some of his iaylors escape. But all being well ordered, and <hi>Plangus</hi> willinglie putting himselfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> into the greatest danger, <hi>Antiphilus</hi> (who, like a bladder, sweld redie to breake, while it was full of the winde of prosperitie, that being out, was so abiected, as apt to be trode on by euery bodie) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it came to the point, that with some hazard, he might be in apparant likelihood to auoid the vttermost harme, his hart fainted, and (weake foole, neither hoping, nor fearing as he should) gat a conceit, that with bewraying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> this practise, he might obtaine pardon: and therefore, euen a little before <hi>Plangus</hi> should haue come vnto him, opened the whole practise to him that had the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12151:112"/>
charge, with vnpittyed teares idly protesting, he had rather die by <hi>Artaxias</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, then against her will escape: yet begging life vpon any the hardest, and wretchedest conditions that she would lay vpon him. His keeper prouided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, so that when <hi>Plangus</hi> came, he was like, himselfe to haue bene entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> but that finding (with a luckie in-sight) that it was discouered, he retired; and (calling his friendes about him) stood vpon his guard, as he had good cause. For, <hi>Artaxia</hi> (accounting him most vngratefull, considering that her brother and she, had not only preserued him against the malice of his father, but euer vsed him much liker his birth, then his fortune) sent forces to apprehend him. But he among <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the martiall men had gotten so great loue, that he could not onely keep himselfe from her malice, but worke in their mindes a compassion of <hi>Eronas</hi> aduersitie.</p>
            <p>But for the succour of <hi>Antiphilus</hi> he could get no bodie to ioyne with him, the contempt of him hauing not bene able to qualifie the hatred; so that <hi>Artaxia</hi> might easilie vpon him perfourme her will; which was (at the humble suite of all the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> of that citie) to deliuer him to their censure, who mortally hating him for hauing made a lawe of <hi>Polygamie,</hi> after many tortures, forst him to throw himselfe from a high <hi>Pyramis,</hi> which was built ouer <hi>Tiridates</hi> tombe, and so to end his false-harted life, which had planted no strong thought in him, but that he could be vnkinde.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> But <hi>Plangus</hi> well perceiuing that <hi>Artaxia</hi> staied onely for the appointed day, that the faire <hi>Eronas</hi> bodie, (consumed to ashes) should make a notorious testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, how deepely her brothers death was engrauen in her brest, he assembled good numbers of friends, whom his vertue (though a stranger) had tied vnto him, by force to giue her libertie. Contrariwise, <hi>Artaxia,</hi> to whom Anger gaue more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> courage then her sexe did feare, vsed her regall authoritie (the most she could) to suppresse that sedition, and haue her will: which (she thought) is the most princely thing that may be. But <hi>Plangus,</hi> who indeede (as all men witnes) is one of the best captaines (both for policie and valour) that are trained in the schoole of <hi>Mars,</hi> in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> a conflict ouerthrew <hi>Artaxias</hi> power, though of far greater number: and there toke prisoner a base sonne of her brothers, whom she deerly affected, and then sent her word that he should run the same race of fortune (whatsoeuer it was) that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona</hi> did: and happy was that threatning for her; for els <hi>Artaxia</hi> had hastened the day of her death, in respect of those tumults.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> But now (some principall noble-men of that countrie interposing themselues) it was agreed, that all persons els fullie pardoned, and all prisoners (except <hi>Erona</hi>) deliuered, she should be put into the hands of a principall nobleman, who had a castle of great strength, vpon oath, that if by the day two yeare from <hi>Tiridates</hi> death, <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Musidorus</hi> did not in person combat, and ouercome two knights, whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> she appointed to maintain her quarrell against <hi>Erona</hi> and them, of hauing by treason destroyed her brother, that then <hi>Erona</hi> should be that same day burned to ashes: but if they came, and had the victorie, she should be deliuered; but vpon no occasion, neither freed, nor executed, till that day. And hereto of both sides, all toke solemne oath, and so the peace was concluded; they of <hi>Plangus</hi> partie forcing him to agree, though he himselfe the sooner condiscended, knowing the courtesie of those two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> excellent Princes, not to refuse so noble a quarrell, and their power such, as two more (like the other two) were not able to resist. But <hi>Artaxia</hi> was more, and vpon better ground, pleased with this action; for she had euen newly receiued newes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:12151:113"/>
               <hi>Plexirtus,</hi> that vpon the sea he had caused them both to perish, and therefore she held her selfe sure of the match.</p>
            <p>But poore <hi>Plangus</hi> knew not so much, and therefore seeing his partie (as most times it falles out in like case) hungry of any conditions of peace, accepted them; and then obteined leaue of the Lord, that indifferently kept her, to visite <hi>Erona,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> whom he found full of desperate sorow, not suffering, neither his vnworthinesse, nor his wrongs, nor his death (which is the naturall conclusion of all worldly acts) either to couer with forgetfulnes, or diminish with consideration, the affection she had borne him: but euen glorying in affliction, and shunning all comfort, she see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue no delight, but in making herselfe the picture of miserie. So that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> when <hi>Plangus</hi> came to her, she fell in deadlie traunces, as if in him she had seene the death of <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> because he had not succoured him: and yet (her vertue striuing) she did at one time acknowledge her selfe bound, and professe her selfe iniured; in steede of allowing the conclusion they had made, or writing to the Princes (as he wisht her to doo) crauing nothing but some speedie death to follow,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> her (in spite of iust hate) beloued <hi>Antiphilus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that <hi>Plangus</hi> hauing nothing but a rauisht kisse from her hand at their parting, went away toward <hi>Greece,</hi> whetherward he vnderstoode the Princes were embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. But by the way it was his fortune to intercept letters, written by <hi>Artaxia</hi> to <hi>Plexirtus:</hi> wherein she signified her accepting him to her husband, whom she had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> euer fauoured, so much the rather, as he had perfourmed the conditions of her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in bringing to their deserued end, her greatest enemies: withall, thanking the sea, in such tearmes, as he might well perceiue, it was by some treason wrought in <hi>Plexirtus</hi> shippe. Whereupon (to make more diligent search) he tooke shippe himselfe, and came into <hi>Laconia,</hi> enquiring, and by his enquirie finding, that such a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> shippe was indeede with fight, and fire, perished, none (almost) escaping. But for <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Musidorus,</hi> it was assuredly determined that they were cast away: for the name of such Princes (especially in <hi>Greece</hi>) would quickly els haue bene a large witnesse to the contrarie. Full of griefe with that, for the losse of such, who left the world poore of perfection: but more sorie for <hi>Eronas</hi> sake, who now by them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> could not be relieued. A new aduertisement from <hi>Armenia</hi> ouertooke him, which multiplied the force of his anguish. It was a message from the Noble-man who had <hi>Erona</hi> in ward, giuing him to vnderstand, that since his departure, <hi>Artaxia</hi> (vsing the benefite of time) had besieged him in his castell, demaunding present deliuery of her, whom yet for his faith giuen, he would not, before the day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> if possibly he could resist, which he foresaw, long he should not do for want of victuall, which he had not so wisely prouided, because he trusted vpon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall oth taken for two yeares space: and therefore willed him to make hast to his succour, and come with no small forces; for all they that were of his side in <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> were consumed, and <hi>Artaxia</hi> had encreased her might by mariage of <hi>Plexirtus,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> who now crowned King there, stickt not to glory in the murder of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidorus,</hi> as hauing iust cause thereto, in respect of the deaths of his sister <hi>Andromana,</hi> her sonne his nephew, and his owne daughter <hi>Zelmane,</hi> all whose losse he vniustly charged them withall, and now openly stickt not to confesse, what a reuenge his wit had brought forth. <hi>Plangus</hi> much astonished herewith, bethought himselfe what to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> doo. For to returne to <hi>Armenia</hi> was vaine, since his friends there were vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. Then thought he of going to his father; but he had already (euen since the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:12151:113"/>
death of his stepmother, and brother) attempted the recouering his fauour, and all in vaine. For they, that had before ioined with <hi>Andromana</hi> to do him the wrong, thought now no life for them if he returned, and therefore kept him still (with new forged suspicions) odious to his father. So that <hi>Plangus</hi> reseruing that for a worke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of longer time, then the sauing of <hi>Erona</hi> could beare, determined to goe to the mighty and good King <hi>Euarchus:</hi> who lately hauing (to his eternall fame) fully, not onely conquered his enemies, but established good gouernment in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, he hoped he might haue present succour of him, both for the iustnes of the cause, &amp; reuenge of his childrens death, by so hainous a treason murthered. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> with diligence he went to him; &amp; by the way (passing through my country) it was my hap to find him, the most ouerthrowne man with griefe, that euer I hope to see againe. For still it seemed he had <hi>Erona</hi> at a stake before his eies; such an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension he had taken of her daunger; which in despite of all the comfort I could giue him, he poured out in such lamentations, that I was moued not to let him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> passe, till he had made full declaration, which by peeces my daughters and I haue deliuered vnto you. Faine he would haue had succour of my selfe, but the course of my life being otherwise bent, I onely accompanied him with some that might safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guide him to the great <hi>Euarchus:</hi> for my part hauing had some of his speeches so feelingly in my memory, that at an idle time (as I told you) I set them downe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue-wise, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> in such manner as you haue seene. And thus, excellent Ladie, I haue obeyed you in this storie; wherein if it well please you to consider, what is the straunge power of Loue, and what is due to his authoritie, you shall exercise therein the true noblenesse of your iudgement, and doo the more right to the vnfortunate Historian. <hi>Zelmane</hi> (sighing for <hi>Eronaes</hi> sake, yet inwardly comforted in that she as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> her selfe, <hi>Euarchus</hi> would not spare to take in hand the iust deliuering of her, ioyned with the iust reuenge of his childrens losse) hauing now what she desired of <hi>Basilius,</hi> to auoide his further discourses of affection, encouraged the shepheards to begin, whom she saw allready ready for them.</p>

But she, as if she had bin ready to drink a wine of excellent tast &amp; colour, which suddenly she perceiued had poison in it, so did she <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> put him away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her: loking first vp to heauen, as amazed to finde herselfe so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled in him; then laying the cruell punishment vpon him of angry Loue, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring beautie, shewing disdain, &amp; a despising disdain, Away (said she) vnworthy man to loue, or to be loued. Assure thy self, I hate my selfe for being so deceiued; iudge then what I doo thee, for deceiuing me.

For finding himselfe not onely vnhappy, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> vnhappy after being falne from all happines: and to be falne from all happines, not by any misconceiuing, but by his own fault, and his fault to be done to no other but to <hi>Pamela</hi>: he did not tender his owne estate, but despised it; greedily drawing into his minde, all conceipts which might more and more torment him.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> And so as they sate deuising how to giue more feathers to the wings of Time, there came to the lodge dore, sixe maides, all in one liuerie of skarlet petticotes, which were tuckt vp almost to their knees, the petticotes them selues being in many places garnished with leaues, their legges naked, sauing that aboue the anckles they had little black silke laces, vpon which did hang a few siluer belles: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> like which they had a little aboue their elbowes, vpon their bare armes. Vpon their haire they ware garlands of roses and gilliflowers; and the haire was so drest, as that came againe aboue the garlandes; enterchaunging a mutuall couering: so as it was doubtfull, whether the haire drest the garlandes, or the garlands drest the haire. Their breasts liberall to the eye: the face of the formost of them, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> faire; and of the rest louely, if not beautifull: and beautifull might haue bene, if they had not suffered greedy <hi>Phaebus,</hi> ouer-often, and harde, to kisse them. Their countenaunces full of a gracefull grauitie; so as the gesture matcht with the apparrell, it might seeme a wanton modestie, and an entising sobernes. Each of them had an instrument of musick in their hands, which consorting their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> wel-pleasing tunes, did charge each eare with vnsensiblenes, that did not lend it self vnto them. The Musick entring alone into the lodge, the Ladies were all desirous to see fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence so pleasant a guest was come: and therfore went out together; where
<pb facs="tcp:12151:126"/>
before they could take the paines to doubt, much lesse to aske the question of their qualitie, the fairest of them (with a gay, but yet discreete demeanour) in this sort spake vnto them. Most excellent Ladies, (whose excellencies haue power to make cities enuie these woods, and solitarines to be accounted the sweetest companie) vouchsafe our message your gracious hearing, which as it comes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Loue, so comes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> it from louely persons. The maides of all this coast of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> vnderstanding the often accesse that certaine shepheards of these quarters, are allowed to haue in this forbidden place; and that their rurall sports are not disdained of you, haue ben stird with emulation to them, &amp; affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to you, to bring forth some thing, which might as well breed your contentment: and therefore hoping that the goodnes of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> &amp; the hurtlesnes of their sex shal excuse the breach of the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in comming to this place vnsent for, they chose out vs, to inuite both your princely pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and your selues, to a place in the woods about halfe a mile hence: where they haue prouided some such sports, as they trust your gratious acceptations will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret to be delightfull. We haue bene at the other lodge, but finding them there, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> in weightier affaires, our trust is, that you yet will not denie the shining of your eies vpon vs. The Ladies stood in some doubt, whether they should goe or not, lest <hi>Basilius</hi> might be angry withall. But <hi>Miso</hi> (that had bene at none of the pastorals, &amp; had a great desire to lead her old senses abroad to some pleasure) told them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they should nor will nor choose, but go thether, and make the honest countrie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> people know, that they were not so squeamish as folkes thought of them. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies glad to be warranted by her authoritie; with a smiling humblenesse obeied her: <hi>Pamela</hi> only casting a seeking looke, whether she could see <hi>Dorus</hi> (who poore wretch wandred halfe mad for sorrow in the woods, crying for pardon of her, who could not heare him) but indeed was grieued for his absence, hauing giuen the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> wound to him through her owne harte. But so the three Ladies &amp; <hi>Miso</hi> went with those six <hi>Nymphes,</hi> conquering the length of the way with the force of musique, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing only <hi>Mopsa</hi> behind, who disgraced weeping with her countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, because her mother would not suffer her to shew her newskoured face among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But the place apointed (as they thought) met them halfe in their way, so well were they pleased <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> with the sweete tunes &amp; prettie conuersation of their inuiters. There found they in the midst of the thickest part of the wood, a litle square place, not burdened with trees, but with a boord couered, &amp; beautified with the pleasantest fruites, that Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnd <hi>Autumne</hi> could deliuer vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The maids besought the Ladies to sit down and tast of the swelling grapes, which seemed great with child of <hi>Bacchus:</hi> and of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> the diuers coloured plums, which gaue the eye a pleasant tast before they came to the mouth. The Ladies would not shew to scorne their prouision, but eat, &amp; dranke a little of their coole wine, which seemed to laugh for ioy to come to such lips.</p>
            <p>But after the collation was ended, and that they looked for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming foorth of such deuises, as were prepared for them, there rusht out of the woods twentie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> men, who round about enuironed them, and laying hold of <hi>Zelmane</hi> before she could draw her sword, and taking it from her, put hoods ouer the heads of all fower, and so muffled, by force set them on horsebacke and carried them away; the sisters in vaine crying for succour, while <hi>Zelmanes</hi> harte was rent in peeces with rage of the iniurie, and disdaine of her fortune. But when they had caried them a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> foure or fiue mile further, they lefte <hi>Miso</hi> with a gagge in her mouth, and bound hande and foote, so to take her fortune: and brought the three Ladies
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:12151:126"/>
(by that time that the Night seemed with her silence to conspire to their treason) to a castle about ten mile fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lodges: where they were fain to take a boat which wayted for them. For the castle stood in the midst of a great lake vpon a high rocke, where partly by Arte, but principallie by Nature, it was by all men estemed impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But at the Castle gate their faces were discouered, &amp; there were mett with a great number of torches, after whom the sisters knew their aunt in law, <hi>Cecropia.</hi> But that sight increased the deadly terrour of the Princesses, looking for nothing but death, since they were in the power of the wicked <hi>Cecropia</hi>: who yet came vnto them, making courtesie the outside of mischiefe, and desiring them not to bee discomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> for they were in a place dedicated to their seruice, <hi>Philoclea</hi> (with a looke where Loue shined through the miste of Feare) besought her to be good vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing neuer deserued euill of her. But <hi>Pamelas</hi> high harte disdayning humblenesse to iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Aunt, (said she) what you haue determined of vs I pray you doo it speedily: for my part I looke for no seruice, where I finde violence.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> But <hi>Cecropia</hi> (vsing no more words with them) conueyed them all three to seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lodgings (<hi>Zelmanes</hi> harte so swelling with spite, that she could not bring foorth a word) and so lefte them: first taking from them their kniues, because they should do themselues no hurte, before she had determined of them: and then giuing such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they wanted nothing but libertie, &amp; comfort, shee went to her sonne, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> yet kept his bed, because of his wounde hee had receiued of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> &amp; tolde him, whom now he had in his power. <hi>Amphialus</hi> was but euen then returned from far countries, where he had wonne immortal fame, both of courage &amp; courtesie, when he met with the Princesses, and was hurt by <hi>Zelmane,</hi> so as hee was vtterly ignorant of all his mothers wicked deuises, to which he would neuer haue consented, being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>(like a rose out of a brier) an excellent sonne of an euill mother: and now when hee heard of this, was as much amazed, as if he had seen the Sunne fall to the earth. And therefore desired his mother that shee would tell him the whole discourse, howe all these matters had happened. Sonne (saide shee) I will doo it willingly, &amp; since all is done for you, I will hide nothing from you. And howsoeuer I might be ashamed to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> tell it straungers, who would thinke it wickednes, yet what is done for your sake (how euill soeuer to others) to you is vertue. To begin then euen with the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, this doting foole <hi>Basilius</hi> that now raignes, hauing liued vnmaried till hee was nigh threescore yeares old (and in all his speaches affirming, and in all his dooinges assuring, that he neuer would marrie) made all the eyes of this country to bee bent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> vpon your father, his onely brother (but younger by thirty yeares) as vpon the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted successour: being indeed a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worthy to raigne, thinking nothing enough for himselfe: where this goose (you see) puts downe his head, before there be any thing neere to touch him. So that he holding place and estimation as heyre of <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> obteyned me of my father the King of <hi>Argos,</hi> his brother helping to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> with protesting his bachelerly intention: for else you may be sure the King of <hi>Argos,</hi> nor his daughter would haue suffered their Royall bloud to bee stained with the base name of subiection. So that I came into this countrie as apparant Princesse thereof, and accordingly was courted, and followed of all the Ladies of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. My porte and pompe did well become a King of <hi>Argos</hi> daughter: in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> their tongues were turned into eares, and their eares were captiues vnto my tongue. Their eyes admired my Maiestie, &amp; happy was he or she, on whom I would suffer the beames therof to fall. Did I goe to church? it seemed the very Goddes
<pb facs="tcp:12151:127"/>
wayted for me, their deuotions not being solemnized till I was ready. Did I walke abroad to see any delight? Nay, my walking was the delight it selfe: for to it was the concourse; one thrusting vpon another, who might shewe him selfe most diligent and seruiceable towardes me: my sleepes were inquired after, and my wakings ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnsaluted: the very gate of my house full of principall persons, who were glad,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> if their presents had receaued a gratefull acceptation. And in this felicitie wert thou borne, the very earth submitting it self vnto thee to be troden on as by his Prince; &amp; to that passe had my husbands vertue (by my good help) within short time brought it, with a plot we laide, as wee should not haue needed to haue waited the tedious worke of a naturall end of <hi>Basilius</hi>; when the heauens (I thinke enuying my great fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> then stopt thy fathers breath, when he breathed nothing but power and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie. Yet did not thy orphancie, or my widdowhood, depriue vs of the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prospect, which the hill of honour dooth yeeld, while expectation of thy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession did bind dependencies vnto vs.</p>
            <p>But before, (my sonne) thou wert come to the age to feele the sweetnesse of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> this beast (whom I can neuer name with patience) falsely and foolishly married this <hi>Gynecia,</hi> then a young girle, and brought her to sit aboue me in al feasts to turne her shoulder to me-warde in all our solemnities. It is certaine, it is not so great a spite to bee surmounted by straungers, as by ones owne allies. Thinke then what my minde was, since withall there is no question: The fall is greater from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> first to the second, then from the second to the vndermost. The rage did swell in my harte, so much the more as it was faine to bee suppressed in silence, and disguised with humblenes. But aboue all the rest, the griefe of grieues was, when with these two daughters (now thy prisoners (she cut of all hope of thy successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It was a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing to me; that my eies should loke lower then any bodies, that (my self being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> by) anothers voice then mine, should be more respected. But it was in supportable vnto me, to think that not only I, but thou shouldst spend al thy time in such misery and that the Sun should see my eldest son lesse then a Prince. And though I had ben a sainct I could not choose, finding the chaunge this chaunge of fortune bred vnto me, for now from the multitude of followers, sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce grew to be at my gate, &amp; absence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> in my presence. The guesse of my mind could preuaile more before; then now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my earnest requests. And thou (my deare sonne) by the fickle multitude no more then an ordinary person (borne of the mud of the people) regarded. But I (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that in all miseries weeping becomes fooles, and practize wise folks) haue tried diuers meanes to pull vs out of the mire of subiection. And though many times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Fortune failed me, yet did I neuer faile my selfe. Wild beastes I kept in a caue harde by the lodges, which I caused by night to be fed in the place of their pastorales, I as then liuing in my house hard by the place, and against the houre they were to meet (hauing kept the beastes without meate) then let them loose, knowing that they would seeke their food there, and deuoure what they founde. But blind Fortune <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> hating sharpe-sighted inuentions, made them vnluckily to bee killed. After I vsed my seruant <hi>Clinias</hi> to stir a notable tumult of country people: but those loutes were too grosse instruments for delicate conceits. Nowe lastly, finding <hi>Philanax</hi> his exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations grow daungerous, I thought to play double or quit; and with a sleight I vsed of my fine-witted wench <hi>Artesia,</hi> with other maids of mine, woulde haue sent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> these goodly inheritrixes of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> to haue pleaded their cause before <hi>Pluto,</hi> but that ouer-fortunatly for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you made me know the last day how veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly this childish
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:12151:127"/>
passion of loue, doth torment you. Therfore I haue brought them vnto you, yet wishing rather hate then loue in you. For Hate often begetteth victory; Loue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is the instrument of subiection. It is true, that I would also by the same prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise haue entrapped the parentes, but my maides failed of it, not daring to tary long <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> about it. But this sufficeth, since (these being taken away) you are the vndoubted inheritor, and <hi>Basilius</hi> will not long ouer-liue this losse.</p>
            <p>O mother (said <hi>Amphialus</hi>) speak not of doing them hurt, no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to mine eyes, or my hart, or if I haue any thing more deare then eyes, or hart vnto me. Let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers finde what sweetnes they will in euer fearing, because they are euer feared: for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> my part, I will think my selfe highlye intitled, if I may be once by <hi>Philoclea</hi> accepted for a seruant. Well (said <hi>Cecropia</hi>) I would I had borne you of my minde, as wel as of my body: then should you not haue suncke vnder these base weaknesses. But since you haue tied your thoughts in so wilful a knot, it is happie my policy hath brought matters to such a passe, as you may both enioy affection, and vpon that builde your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> soueraigntie. Alas (said <hi>Amphialus</hi>) my hart would faine yeeld you thanks for setting me in the way of felicitie, but that feare killes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in me, before they are fully borne. For if <hi>Philoclea</hi> be displeased, how can I be pleased? if she count it vnkindenes, shal I giue tokens of kindnes? perchance she condemnes me of this action, and shall I tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph? perchance she drownes now the beauties I loue with sorrowfull teares, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> where is then my reioycing?

Pretie intricate follies (said <hi>Cecropia</hi>) but get you vp, and see how you can preuaile with her, while I go to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> the other sister. For after we shal haue our hands full to defend our selues, if <hi>Basilius</hi> hap to besiege vs. But remembring herselfe, she turned back and asked him what he would haue done with <hi>Zelmane,</hi> since now he might be reuenged of his hurt. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but honorably, answered <hi>Amphialus,</hi> hauing deserued no other of me, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being (as I hear) greatly cherished of <hi>Philoclea</hi>: and therfore I could wish they were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> lodged together.

His hurt (not yet fully well) made him a little halt, but he straue to giue the best grace he coulde vnto his halting.</p>

               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:12151:128"/>But <hi>Amphialus</hi> was like the poore woman, who louing a tame Doe she had, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all earthly things, hauing long played withall, and made it feed at her hand and lappe, is constrained at length by famine (all her flocke being spent, and she fallen into extreeme pouertie) to kill the Deare, to sustaine her life.

For euen so <hi>Amphialus</hi> by a hunger-starued affection, was compelled to offer this iniurie, and yet the same affection made him with a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting griefe, thinke vnkindnesse in himselfe, that he coulde finde in his hart any way to restraine her freedome. But at length, neither able to graunt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> nor denie, he thus answered her. Deare Lady (said he) I will not say vnto you (how iustly soeuer I may do it) that I am nether author, nor accessarie vnto this your with holding.

But alas, that tirant Loue, (which now possesseth the holde of all my life and reason) will no way suffer it. It is Loue, it is Loue, not I, which disobey you.

It is you your selfe, that imprison your selfe: it is your beauty which makes these castlewalles embrace you: it is your own eyes, which reflect vpon themselues this iniurye.

               <hi>Amphialus</hi> hauing the colde ashes of Care cast vpon the coales of Desire, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing some of his mothers Gentlewomen to waite vpon <hi>Philoclea,</hi> himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede a prisoner to his prisoner, and making all his authoritie to be but a foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole

To whome with words which Affection endited, but Amazement vttered, he deliuered what had passed between him and <hi>Philoclea:</hi> beseeching her to trie what her perswasions could doo with her, while he gaue order for all such things as were necessarie against such forces, as he looked dayly <hi>Basilius</hi> would bring before his castle. His mother bad him quiet him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> selfe, for she doubted not to take fit times. But that the best way was, first to let her owne Passion a little tire it selfe.</p>
            <p>So they calling <hi>Clinias,</hi> and some other of their counsell, aduised vpon their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent affaires. First, he dispatched priuat letters to all those principall Lords and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the country, whom he thought ether alliance, or friendship to himselfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> might drawe; with speciall motions from the generall consideration of duetie: not omitting all such, whom either youthfull age, or youthlike mindes did fill with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited desires: besides such, whom any discontentment made hungry of change, or an ouer-spended want, made want a ciuill war: to each (according to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of his mother) conforming himselfe after their humors. To his friends, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> to the ambitious, great expectations; to the displeased, reuenge; to the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, spoile: wrapping their hopes with such cunning, as they rather seemed giuen ouer vnto them as partakers: then promises sprong of necessitie. Then sent he to his mothers brother, the king of <hi>Argos</hi>: but he was as then so ouer-laid with war him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as from thence he could attend small succour.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>But because he knew how violently rumors doo blow the sailes of popular iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and how fewe there be that can discerne betweene truth and truthlikenes, betweene showes and substance; he caused a iustification of this his action to be written, wherof were sowed abroad many copies, which with some glosses of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie, might hide in deede the foulenes of his treason; and from true common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> fetch downe most false applications. For, beginning how much the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which is owed to the countrie, goes beyond all other dueties, since in it selfe it conteines them all, and that for the respect therof, not onely all tender respectes of kinred, or whatsoeuer other friendshippes, are to be laide aside, but that euen long-helde opinions (rather builded vpon a secret of gouernement, then any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ground of truthe) are to be forsaken. He fell by degrees to shew, that since the ende whereto any thing is directed, is euer to be of more noble reckning, then the thing thereto directed: that therefore, the weale-publike was more to be regarded, then any person or magistrate that thereunto was ordained. The feeling consideration whereof, had moued him (though as nere of kinne to <hi>Basilius</hi> as could be, yet) to set <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> principally before his eyes, the good estate of so many thousands, ouer whom <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> raigned: rather then so to hoodwinke himselfe with affection, as to suffer the realme to runne to manifest ruine.

himselfe) in so vnfit and il-guarded a place, as it was not only dangerous for their persons, but (if they should be conueied to any forraine country) to the whole common-wealth pernicious: that therefore he had brought them into this strong castle of his, which way, if it might seem strange, they were to consider, that new ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> require new remedies: but there they should be serued and honored as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to their greatnes, vntill by the generall assembly of the estates, it should be determined how they should to their best (both priuate, and publique) aduantage be matched; vowing all faith &amp; duty both to the father &amp; children, neuer by him to be violated. But if in the meane time, before the estates could be asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled, he should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> be assailed, he would the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his own defence take armes: desiring al, that either ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous case of their country, or in their harts loued iustice, to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him in this iust actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And if the Prince should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund them otherwise, yet to know, that therein he was no more to be obeied, then if he should call for poison to hurt himself withal: since all that was done, was done for his seruice, howsoeuer he might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/>(seduced by <hi>Philanax</hi>) interprete of it: he protesting, that whatsoeuer he should do for his owne defence, should be against <hi>Philanax,</hi> and no way against <hi>Basilius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this effect, amplified with arguments and examples, and painted with rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall colours, did he sow abroad many discourses: which as they preuailed with some of more quicke then sounde conceipt, to runne his fortune with him; so in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> many did it breed a coolenesse, to deale violently against him, and a false-minded neutralitie to expect the issue. But besides the waies he vsed to weaken the aduerse partie, he omitted nothing for the strengthning of his owne. The chiefe trust whereof (because he wanted men to keepe the field) he reposed in the suretie of his castle; which at lest would winne him much time, the mother of many muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> To that therfore he bent both his outward and inward eyes, striuing to make Art striue with Nature, to whether of them two that fortification should be most beholding. The seat Nature bestowed, but Arte gaue the building: which as his rocky hardnesse would not yeeld to vndermining force, so to open assaults he tooke counsell of skill, how to make all approches, if not impossible, yet difficult; as well at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the foot of the castle, as round about the lake, to giue vnquiet lodgings to them, whome onely enmitie would make neighbors. Then omitted he nothing of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as well simple defence, as that which did defend by offending, fitting instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mischiefe to places, whence the mischiefe might be most liberally besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.

            <p>But wherein he sharpned his wits to the pearcingest point, was touching his men (knowing them to be the weapon of weapons, &amp; master-spring (as it were) which makes all the rest to stir; and that therfore in the Arte of man stood the quintessence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and ruling skill of all prosperous gouernment, either peaceable, or military) he chose in number as many as without pestring (and so daunger of infection) his victuall would serue for two yeare to maintaine; all of hable bodies, and some few of able mindes to direct, not seeking many commaunders, but contenting himselfe, that the multitude should haue obeying wittes, euery one knowing whom he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> should commaund, and whom he should obey, the place where, and the matter wherein; distributing each office as neere as he could, to the disposition of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that should exercise it: knowing no loue, daunger, nor discipline can sodainly
<pb facs="tcp:12151:130"/>
alter an habite in nature. Therefore would he not employ the still man to a shifting practise, nor the liberall man to be a dispenser of his victuals, nor the kind-harted man to be a punisher: but would exercise their vertues in sorts, where they might be profitable, employing his chiefe care to know them all particularly, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, regarding also the constitution of their bodies; some being able better to abide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> watching, some hunger, some labour, making his benefit of ech hability, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing beyond power. Time to euery thing by iust proportion he allotted, and as wel in that, as in euery thing els, no small errour winckt at, lest greater should be anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Euen of vices he made his profite, making the cowardly <hi>Clinias</hi> to haue care of the watch, which he knew his own feare would make him very wakefully performe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> And before the siege began, he himselfe caused rumors to be sowed, and libels to be spread against himselfe, fuller of mallice, then witty persuasion: partly, to knowe those that would be apt to stumble at such motions, that he might cull them from the faithfuller band; but principally, because in necessitie they should not know when any such thing were in earnest attempted, whether it were, or not, of his owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> inuention. But euen then (before the enemies face came neere to breed any ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour) did he exercise his men dayly in all their charges, as if Daunger had present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly presented his most hideous presence: him selfe rather instructing by example, then precept; being neither more sparing in trauaile, nor spending in diet, then the meanest souldier: his hand and body disdaining no base matters, nor shrinking <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> from the heauy.</p>
            <p>The onely ods was, that when others tooke breath, he sighed; and when others rested, he crost his armes. For Loue passing thorow the pikes of Daunger, and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling it selfe in the dust of Labour, yet still made him remember his sweete desire, and beautifull image. Often when he had begun to commaund one, somewhat <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> before halfe the sentence were ended, his inward guest did so entertaine him, that he would breake it off, and a prettie while after end it, when he had (to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile of the standers by) sent himselfe in to talke with his own thoughts. Sometimes when his hand was lifted vp to do some thing, as if with the sight of <hi>Gorgons</hi> head he had bene sodainely turned into a stone, so would he there abide with his eyes plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and hand lifted, till at length, comming to the vse of himselfe, he would looke about whether any had perceiued him; then would he accuse, and in himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne all those wits, that durst affirme Idlenesse to be the well-spring of Loue. O, would he say, all you that affect the title of wisdome, by vngratefull scorning the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of Nature, am I now piping in a shaddow? or doo slouthfull feathers now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> enwrap me? Is not hate before me, and doubt behinde me? is not daunger of the one side, and shame of the other? And doo I not stande vpon paine, and trauaile, and yet ouer all, my affection triumphes? The more I stirre about vrgent affaires, the more me thinks the very stirring breedes a breath to blow the coales of my loue: the more I exercise my thoughts, the more they encrease the appetite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> of my desires. O sweet <hi>Philoclea</hi> (with that he would cast vp his eyes wherein some water did appeare, as if they would wash themselues against they should see her) thy heauenly face is my Astronomie; thy sweet vertue, my sweet Philosophie: let me profite therein, and farewell all other cogitations. But alas, my minde misgiues me, for your planets beare a contrarie aspect vnto me.

Thus would he exercise his eloquence, when she could not heare him, and be dumbe-striken, when her presence gaue him fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of speaking: so that his witte could finde out no other refuge, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and counsell of his mother, desiring her ( whose thoughts were vnperplexed) to vse for his sake the most preuailing manners of intercession.</p>
            <p>She seing her sonnes safetie depende thereon, (though her pride much disdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the name of a desirer) tooke the charge vpon her, not doubting the easie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of an vnexpert virgin, who had alreadie with subtiltie and impudencie begun <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> to vndermine a monarchy. Therefore, waighing <hi>Philocleas</hi> resolutions by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpease of her owne youthfull thoughts, which she then called to minde, she doubted not at least to make <hi>Philoclea</hi> receiue the poyson distilled in sweete li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour, which she with little disguising had drunke vp thirstily.

Your fortune (saide <hi>Cecropia</hi>) if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> she could see to attire herselfe, would put on her best raiments.

you esteeme your selfe a prisoner, and are in truth a mistres: you feare hate, and shall finde loue. And truely, I had a thing to say to you, but it is no matter, since I finde you are so obstinatly melancholy, as that you woo his felowship: I will spare my paines, and hold my peace: And so staied indeede, thinking <hi>Philoclea</hi> would haue had a female inquisitiuenesse of the matter. But she, who rather wished to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> what she knewe, then to burden her hart with more hopeles knowledge, only desired her to haue pity of her, and if indeed she did meane her no hurt, then to graunt her liberty: for else the very griefe and feare, would proue her vnappointed executioners. For that (said <hi>Cecropia</hi>) beleue me vpon the faith of a kings daughter, you shall be free, so soone as your freedome may be free of mortall danger, being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> brought hither for no other cause, but to preuent such mischiefes as you know not of. But if you thinke indeed to winne me to haue care of you, euen as of mine owne daughter, then lend your eares vnto me, and let not your mind arme it selfe with a wilfulnesse to be flexible to nothing.

O the sweet name of a mother: O the comfort of comforts, to see your children grow vp, in whom you are (as it were) eternized: if you could conceiue what a hart-tickling ioy it is to see your owne litle ones, with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> awfull loue come running to your lap, &amp; like litle models of your selfe, still cary you about them, you would think vnkindnes in your owne thoughts, that euer they did rebel against the mean vnto it.

Therefore, giuing new courage to her wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked inuentions, and vsing the more industry, because she had mist in this, and taking <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> euen precepts of preuailing in <hi>Pamela,</hi> by her fayling in <hi>Philoclea,</hi> shee went to her chamber, and (according to her owne vngratious method of subtile proceeding) stood listning at the dore, because that out of the circumstance of her present beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, there might kindly arise a fitte beginning of her intended discourse.</p>
            <p>And so shee might perceaue that <hi>Pamela</hi> did walke vp and downe, full of deepe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>(though patient) thoughts. For her look and countenance was setled, her pace soft and almost still of one measure, without any passionate gesture, or violent motion: till at length (as it were) awaking, and strengthning her selfe, Well (said she) yet this is, the best, and of this I am sure, that how soeuer they wrong me, they cannot ouer-master God.

And therewith kneeling downe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen where she stood, she thus said.

            <p>The other parte <hi>Cecropia</hi> might well heare, but this latter prayer for <hi>Musidorus,</hi> her hart helde it, as so iewel-like a treasure, that it woulde scarce trust her owne lippes withall.

            <p>But quite contrarily <hi>Amphialus,</hi> who before the enimies came was carefull, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> diligent, &amp; not somtimes with out doubting of the issue; now the nearer dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger approched (like the light of a glow-worme) the lesse still it seemed: and now his courage began to boile in choler, and with such impatience to desire to powre out both vpon the enimie, that he issued presently into certaine boates he had of purpose and carying with him some choise men, went to the fortresse he had vpon the edge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> of the lake, which hee thought would bee the first thing, that the enimy woulde at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; because it was a passage, which commanding all that side of the country, and being lost would stop victuall, or other supply, that might be brought into the castle &amp; in that fortresse hauing some force of horsemen, he issued out with two hundred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> horse, &amp; fiue hundred footmen, embushed his footmen in the falling of a hill, which was ouer shadowed with a wood, he with his horsmen went a quarter of a mile fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; aside hand of which he might perceaue the many troupes of the enimie, who came but to take view where best to encampe themselues.</p>
            <p>But as if the sight of the enimie had bene a Magnes stone to his courage he could not containe himselfe, but shewing his face to the enimie, and his backe to his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> vsed that action, as his onely oration, both of denouncing warre to the one and perswading help of the other. Who faithfully following an example of such au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, they made the earth to grone vnder their furious burden, and the enimies to begin to be angry with them, whom in particular they knew not. Among whom there was a young man, youngest brother to <hi>Philanax,</hi> whose face as yet did notbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> his sex, with so much as shew of haire; of a minde hauing no limits of hope, nor knowing why to feare; full of iollitie in conuersation, and lately growne a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. His name was <hi>Agenor,</hi> of all that armie the most beautifull: who hauing ridden in sportfull conuersation among the foremost, all armed sauing that his beauer was vp, to haue his breath in more freedome, seing <hi>Amphialus</hi> come a pretty way before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, neither staying the commaundement of the captaine, nor recking whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his face were armed, or no, set spurs to his horse, and with youthfull brauerie casting his staffe about his head, put it then in his rest, as carefull of comely carying it, as if the marke had beene but a ring, and the lookers on Ladies, But <hi>Amphialus</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> launce was already come to the last of his descending line, and began to make the ful point of death against the head of this young Gentleman, when <hi>Amphialus</hi> percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his youth and beautie, Compassion so rebated the edge of Choller, that hee
<pb facs="tcp:12151:134"/>
spared that faire nakednesse, and let his staffe fal to <hi>Agenors</hi> vampalt: so as both with braue breaking should hurtleslie haue perfourmed that match, but that the pittilesse launce of <hi>Amphialus</hi> (angry with being broken) with an vnlucky counterbuffe ful of vnsparing splinters, lighted vpon that face farre fitter for the combats of <hi>Venus</hi>; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not onely a suddaine, but a fowle death, leauing scarsely any tokens of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> beautie: but his hands abandoning the reynes, and his thighes the saddle, hee fell sidewarde from the horse. Which sight comming to <hi>Leontius,</hi> a deere friende of his, who in vaine had lamentably cried vnto him to stay, when he saw him beginne his careere, it was harde to say, whether pittie of the one, or reuenge against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, helde as then the soueraigntie in his passions. But while hee directed his eye to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> his friende, and his hinde to his enimie, so worngly-consorted a power coulde not resist the ready minded force of <hi>Amphialus</hi>: who perceyuing his il-directed direction against him, so paide him his debt before it was lent, that hee also fell to the earth onely happy that one place, and one time, did finish both their Loues and liues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/>
            </p>
            <p>But by this time there had bene a furious meeting of either side: where after the terrible salutation of warlike noyse, the shaking of handes was with sharpe weapons: some launces according to the mettall they mett, and skill of the guider, did staine themselues in bloud; some flew vp in pieces, as if they would threaten heauen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they fayled on earth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> But their office was quickly inherited, either by (the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Prince of weapons) the sworde, or by some heauy mase, or biting axe; which hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting still the weakest chase, sought euer to light there, wher smallest resistance might worse preuent mischiefe. The clashing of armour, and crushing of staues; the iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of bodies, the resounding of blowes, was the first parte of that ill-agreeing mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, which was beautified with the griselinesse of woundes, the rising of dust; the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> hideous falles, and grones of the dying. The very horses angrie in their masters an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, with loue and obedience brought foorth the effects of hate and resistance, and with minds of seruitude, did as if they affected glorie. Some lay deade vnder their dead maisters, whome vnknightly wounds had vniustly punished for a faithfull du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Some lay vppon their Lordes by like accidents, and in death had the honour to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> be borne by them, whom in life they had borne. Some hauing lost their commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding burthens, ranne scattered about the fielde, abashed with the madnesse of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. The earth it selfe woont to be a buriall of men) was nowe (as it were) buried with men: so was the face thereof hidden with deade bodies, to whom Death hade come masked in diuerse manners. In one place lay disinherited heades, dispossessed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> of their naturall seignories: in an other, whole bodies to see to, but that their hartes wont to be bound all ouer so close, were nowe with deadly violence opened: in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, fowler deaths had ouglily displayed their trayling guttes. There lay armes, whose fingers yet mooued, as if they would feele for him that made them feele: and legges, which contrarie to common reason, by being discharged of their burden,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> were growne heauier. But no sword payed so large a tribute of soules to the eternall Kingdome, as that of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> who like a Tigre, from whome a companie of Woolues did seeke, to rauish a newe gotten pray; so he (remembring they came to take away <hi>Philoclea</hi>) did labour to make valure, strength, choller and hatred, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the proportion of his loue, which was infinit.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>
            </p>
            <p>There died of his handes the olde knight <hi>AEschylus,</hi> who though by yeares might well haue beene allowed to vse rather the exercises of wisedome, then of courage;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:12151:134"/>
yet hauing a lustie bodie and a merrie hart, he euer tooke the summons of Time in iest, or else it had so creepingly stollen vpon him, that he had heard scarcely the noise of his feete, and therefore was as fresh in apparell, and as forwarde in enterprises, as a farre yonger man: but nothing made him bolder, then a certaine prophecie had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> beene tolde him, that he shoulde die in the armes of his sonne, and therefore feared the lesse the arme of an enemie. But now when <hi>Amphialus</hi> sword was passed through his throate, he thought himselfe abused; but that before he died, his sonne, indeede seeing his father beginne to fall, helde him vp in his armes, till a pitilesse souldier of of the other side, with a mace brained him, making father &amp; sonne become twinnes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in the neuer againe dying birth. As for <hi>Drialus. Memnon, Nisus</hi> and <hi>Policrates</hi>; the first had his eyes cut out so, as he could not see to bid the neare following death wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: the seconde had met with the same Prophet that olde <hi>AEschylus</hi> had, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing founde many of his speeches true, beleeued this to, that hee should neuer bee killed, but by his owne companions: and therefore no man was more valiant then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> he against an enimie, no man more suspicious of his friends: so as he seemed to sleep in securitie, when he went to a battell, and to enter into a battaile, when he began to sleepe, such guards he would set about his person; yet mistrusting those verie guards lest they would murther him. But now <hi>Amphialus</hi> helped to vnriddle his doubtes; for he ouerthrowing him from his horse, his owne companions comming with a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> fresh supplie, pressed him to death. <hi>Nisus</hi> grasping with <hi>Amphialus,</hi> was with a short dagger slaine. And for <hi>Policrates,</hi> while hee shunned as much as hee could, keeping onely his place for feare of punishment, <hi>Amphialus</hi> with a memorable blowe strake of his head, where, with the conuulsions of death setting his spurres to his horse, he gaue so braue a charge vpon the enemie, as it grewe a prouerbe, that <hi>Policrates</hi> was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> onely valiant, after his head was off. But no man escaped so well his handes as <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilus</hi> did: for hee hauing long loued <hi>Philoclea,</hi> though for the meannesse of his estate he neuer durst reueale it, nowe knowing <hi>Amphialus,</hi> setting the edge of a riuall vpon the sworde of an enemie, he helde strong fight with him. But <hi>Amphialus</hi> had already in the daungerousest places disarmed him, and was lifting vp his sworde to send him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> away from himselfe, when he thinking indeede to die, O <hi>Philoclea</hi> (said he) yet this ioyes mee, that I die for thy sake. The name of <hi>Philoclea</hi> first staied his sworde, and when he heard him out, though heabhord him much worse then before, yet could he not vouchsafe him the honour of dying for <hi>Philoclea,</hi> but turned his sworde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, doing him no hurt for ouer-much hatred. But what good did that to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> poore <hi>Phebilus,</hi> if escaping a valiant hand, hee was slaine by base souldiour, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him so disarmed, thrust him through?</p>
            <p>But thus with the well-followed valure of <hi>Amphialus</hi> were the other almost ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, when <hi>Philanax</hi> (who was the marshall of the army) came in, with newe force renuing the almost decayed courage of his souldiers. For, crying to them (and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> asking them whether their backes or their armes were better fighters) hee himselfe thrust into the presse, and making force and furie waite vppon discretion and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, he might seeme a braue Lion who taught his yong Lionets, how in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a pray, to ioine courage with cunning. Then Fortune (as if shee had made chases inow of the one side of that bloody Teniscourt) went of the other side the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> line, making as many fall downe of <hi>Amphialus</hi> followers, as before had done of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanaxis,</hi> they loosing the ground, as fast as before they had woon it, onely leauing them to keepe it, who had lost themselues in keeping it. Then those that had killed,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:135"/>
inherited the lot of those that had bene killed; and cruel Deaths made them lie qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to gether, who most in their liues had sought to disquiet ech other; and many of those first ouerthrowne, had the comfort to see the murtherers ouerrun them to <hi>Charons</hi> ferrie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Codrus, Ctesiphon,</hi> and <hi>Milo,</hi> lost their liues vpon <hi>Philanax</hi> his sword: but no bodies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> case was more pitied, then of a yong esquire of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> called <hi>Ismenus,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer abandoning his maister, and making his tender age aspire to actes of the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest manhoode, in this time that his side was put to the worst, and that <hi>Amphialus</hi>-his valure was the onely stay of them from deliuering themselues ouer to a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full flight, hee sawe his masters horse killed vnder him. Whereupon, asking no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> of no thought, but of faithfulnes and courage, he presently lighted from his owne horse, and with the helpe of some choise and faithfull seruants, gat his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster vp. But in the multitude that came of either side, some to succour, some to saue <hi>Amphialus,</hi> hee came vnder the the hande of <hi>Philanax</hi>: and the youth perceyuing he was the man that did most hurt to his partie, (desirous euen to change his life sor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> glorie) strake at him, as hee rode by him, and gaue him a hurt vpon the legg, that made <hi>Philanax</hi> turn towards him; but seing him so yong, and of a most louely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, he rather toke pity of him; meaning to make him prisoner, &amp; then to giue him to his brother <hi>Agenor</hi> to be his companion, because they were not much vnlike, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in yeeres, nor countenance. But as he loked down vpon him with that thought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> he spied wher his brother lay dead, &amp; his friend <hi>Leontius</hi> by him, euen almost vnder the squiers feet. Then soroing not only his owne sorow, but the past-comfort sorow which he fore-knew his mother would take, (who with many teares, and misgiuing sighs had suffred him to go with his elder brother <hi>Philanax</hi>) blotted out all figures of pitie out of his minde, and putting foorth his horse (while <hi>Ismenus</hi> doubled two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> or three more valiant, then well set blowes) saying to himselfe, Let other mothers bewaile and vntimely death as well as mine; hee thrust him through. And the boy fearce though beautifull; &amp; beautifull, though dying, not able to keepe his failinge feete, fell downe to the earth, which he bit for anger, repining at his Fortune, and as long as he could resisting Death, which might seeme vnwilling to; so long he was in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> taking away his yong struggling soule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philanax</hi> himselfe could haue wished the blow vngiuen, when hee saw him fall like a faire apple, which some vncourteous bodie (breaking his bowe) should throw downe before it were ripe. But the case of his brother made him forget both that, and himselfe: so as ouerhastily pressing vpon the retiring enemies, hee was (ere hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> was aware) further engaged then his owne souldiers could relieue him; where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouerthrowne by <hi>Amphialus, Amphialus</hi> glad of him, kept head aginst his enemies while some of his men caried away <hi>Philanax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Philanax</hi>-his men as if with the losse of <hi>Philanax</hi> they had lost the fountaine of their valure, had their courages so dried vp in feare; that they began to set ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> at their backs, and to vse the vertue of pacience in an vntimely time: when into the presse comes (as hard as his horse, more afraied of the spurre, then the sworde coulde carie him) a Knight in armor as darke as blacknes coulde make it, followed by none, and adorned by nothing; so far without authoritie that hee was without knowledge, But vertue quickly made him knowne, and admiration bred him such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> authoritie, that though they of whose side he came knew him not, yet they all knew it was fitte to obey him: and while he was followed by the valiantest, hee made way
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12151:135"/>
for the vilest. For, taking part with the besiegers, he made the <hi>Amphialians</hi> bloud serue for a caparison to his horse, and a decking to his armour. His arme no oftner gaue blowes, then the blowes gaue wounds, then the wounds gaue deathes: so terrible was his force, and yet was his quicknes more forcible then his force, and his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> iudgement more quick then his quicknes. For though his sword went faster then eyesight could follow it, yet his owne iudgement went still before it. There died of his hand, <hi>Sarpedon, Plistonax, Strophilus,</hi> and <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> men of great proofe in warres, and who had that day vndertaken the guard of <hi>Amphialus.</hi> But while they sought to saue him, they lost the fortresses that Nature had placed them in. Then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> slew he <hi>Megalus,</hi> who was a little before proude, to see himselfe stained in the bloud of his enemies: but when his owne bloud came to be married to theirs, he then felt, that Crueltie dooth neuer enioy a good cheape glorie. After him sent he <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon,</hi> who had that daye vowed (with foolish brauerie) to be the death of tenne: and nine already he had killed, and was careful to performe his (almost performed) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> vowe, when the Blacke Knight helpt him to make vp the tenth himselfe.</p>
            <p>And now the often-changing Fortune began also to chaunge the hewe of the battailes. For at the first, though it were terrible, yet Terror was deckt so brauelie with rich furniture, guilt swords, shining armours, pleasant pensils, that the eye with delight had scarce leasure to be afraide: But now all vniuersally defiled with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> dust, bloud, broken armours, mangled bodies, tooke away the maske, and sette foorth Horror in his owne horrible manner. But neither could danger be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to <hi>Amphialus</hi> his vndismayable courage, nor yet seeme o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gly to him, whose truely-affected minde, did still paint it ouer with the beautie of <hi>Philoclea.</hi> And therefore he, rather enflamed then troubled with the encrease of dangers, and glad <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> to finde a woorthie subiect to exercise his courage, sought out this newe Knight, whom he might easilie finde: for he, like a wanton rich man, that throwes downe his neighbours houses, to make himselfe the better prospecte, so had his sworde made him so spatious a roome, that <hi>Amphialus</hi> had more cause to wonder at the finding, then labour for the seeking: which, if it stirred hate in him, to see <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> how much harme he did to the one side, it prouoked as much emulation in him, to perceaue how much good he did to the other side. Therefore, they approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching one to the other, as in two beautifull folkes, Loue naturally stirres a desire of ioyning, so in their two courages Hate stirred a desire of triall. Then began there a combatte betweene them, worthy to haue had more large listes, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> more quiet beholders: for with the spurre of Courage, and the bitte of Respect, each so guided himselfe, that one might well see, the desire to ouercome, made them not forget how to ouercome: in such time and proportion they did employ their blowes, that none of <hi>Ceres</hi> seruaunts could more cunningly place his flaile: while the left foote spurre set forward his owne horse, the right set backward the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> contrarie horse, euen sometimes by the aduauntage of the enemies legge, while the left hande (like him that helde the sterne) guyded the horses obedient cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: All done in such order, that it might seeme, the minde was a right Prince indeede, who sent wise and diligent Lieutenants into each of those well gouerned partes. But the more they fought, the more they desired to fight; and the more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> they smarted, the lesse they felte the smarte: and now were like to make a quicke proofe, to whome Fortune or Valour would seeme most friendly, when in comes an olde Gouernour of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> alwayes a good Knight, and carefull
<pb facs="tcp:12151:136"/>
of his charge; who giuing a sore wound to the blacke Knights thigh, while he thought not of him, with an other blowe slewe his horse vnder him. <hi>Amphialus</hi> cried to him, that he dishonoured him: You say well (answered the olde Knight) to stand now like a priuate souldier, setting your credite vpon particular fighting, while you may see <hi>Basilius</hi> with all his hoste, is getting betweene you and your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> towne. He looked that way, and found that true indeede, that the enemie was beginning to encompasse him about, and stoppe his returne: and therefore causing the retreite to be sounded, his Gouernour ledde his men homeward, while hee kept himselfe still hindmost, as if hee had stoode at the gate of a sluse, to let the streame goe, with such proportion, as should seeme good vnto him: and with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> so manfull discretion perfourmed it, that (though with losse of many of his men) he returned in him selfe safe, and content, that his enemies had felte, how sharpe the sworde could bite of <hi>Philocleas</hi> Louer. The other partie being sorie for the losse of <hi>Philanax,</hi> was yet sorrier when the blacke Knight could not be found. For he hauing gotten a horse, whom his dying master had bequeathed to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> world, finding him selfe sore hurt, and not desirous to be knowen, had in the time of the enemies retiring, retired away also: his thigh not bleeding bloud so fast, as his harte bledde reuenge. But <hi>Basilius</hi> hauing attempted in vaine to barre the safe returne of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> encamped himselfe as strongly as he could, while he (to his griefe) might heare the ioy was made in the towne by his owne subiects,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> that he had that day sped no better. For <hi>Amphialus</hi> (being well beloued of that people) when they saw him not vanquished, they esteemed him as victorious, his youth setting a flourishing shew vpon his worthinesse, and his great nobilitie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobling his dangers.</p>
            <p>But the first thing <hi>Amphialus</hi> did, being returned, was to visite <hi>Philoclea,</hi> and first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> presuming to cause his dreame to be song vnto her (which he had seen the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fell in loue with her) making a fine boy he had, accorde a prettie dolefulnes vnto it.

            <p>But while that deliberation was handeled, according rather to the humour then the reason of ech speaker, <hi>Philoclea</hi> comming to knowledge of the hard plight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> wherein <hi>Philanax</hi> stood, she desired one of the gentlewomen appoynted to waite vpon her, to goe in her name, and beseech <hi>Amphialus,</hi> that if the loue of her had any power of perswasion in his minde, he would lay no further punishment, then imprisonment, vppon <hi>Philanax.</hi> This message was deliuered euen as <hi>Philanax</hi> was entring to the presence of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> comming (according to the warning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> was giuen him) to receyue a iudgement of death. But when he with manfull reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution attended the fruite of such a tyrannicall sentence, thinking it wrong, but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:12151:138"/>
no harme to him that shoulde die in so good a cause; <hi>Amphialus</hi> turned quite the fourme of his pretended speech, &amp; yeelded him humble thankes, that by his meanes he had come to that happinesse, as to receiue a commaundement of his Ladie: and therfore he willingly gaue him libertie to returne in safetye whether he would, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> him, not onely of all former grudge, but assuring him that he would be willing to do him any friendshipp, and seruice: onely desiring thus much of him, that hee would let him know the discourse and intent of <hi>Basilius</hi>-his proceeding.</p>
            <p>Truely my Lorde (answered <hi>Philanax</hi>) if there were any such knowne to mee, secrete in my maisters counsaile, as that the reuealing thereof might hinder his good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> successe, I should loath the keeping of my blood, with the losse of my faith; &amp; would thinke the iust name of a traitour a hearde purchase of a fewe yeares liuing. But since it is so, that my maister hath indeede no way of priuie practise, but meanes openly &amp; forcibly to deale against you, I will not sticke in few words to make your required declaration. Then told he him in what a maze of a mazeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, both <hi>Basilius</hi> &amp; <hi>Gynecia</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> were, when they mist their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; <hi>Zelmane.</hi> Somtimes apt to suspect some prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> because she was a straunger; somtimes doubting some reliques of the late mutinie, which doubt was rather encreased, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any way satisfied, by <hi>Miso</hi>: who (being fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, almost dead for hunger, by certaine Countrey-people) brought home word, with what cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning they were trayned out, &amp; with what violence they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> away. But that within a few dayes they came to knowledge wher they were, by <hi>Amphialus</hi>-his own letters sent abroad to procure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federates in his attemptes. That <hi>Basilius</hi> his purpose was neuer to leaue the sieg of this town, til he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, &amp; reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the iniurie done vnto him. That he meant rather to winne it by time, &amp; famine, then by force of assault: knowing howe valiant men he had to deale withall in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> towne: that he had sent order, that supplyes of souldiours, pioners, and all thinges else necessarie, should dayly be brought vnto him: so as, my Lord (sayde <hi>Philanax</hi>) let me nowe, hauing receyued my life by your grace. let me giue you your life and and honour by my counsaile; protesting vnto you, that I cannot choose but loue you, being my maister-his nephewe; and that I wish you well in all causes but this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> You knowe his nature is as apte to forgiue, as his power is able to conquere. Your fault passed is excusable, in that Loue perswaded, and youth was perswaded. Doo not vrge the effects of angrie victorie, but rather seeke to obtaine that constantly by courtesie, which you can neuer assuredly enioy by violence. One might easily haue seene in the cheare of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> that disdainfull choller would faine haue made the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> aunswere for him, but the remembraunce of <hi>Philoclea</hi> serued for forcible barriers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Anger, and angry effects: so as he said no more, but that he woulde not put him to the trouble to giue him any further counsaile: But that hee might returne, if hee listed, presently. <hi>Philanax</hi> glad to receyue an vncorrupted libertie, humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his fauourable conuoy out of the towne; and so departed, not visitinge the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Princesses, thinking it might be offensiue to <hi>Amphialus,</hi> and no way fruitfull to them who were no way but by force to be reskued.</p>
            <p>The poore Ladies indeede, not suffered either to meet together, or to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with any other, but such as <hi>Cecropia</hi> had alreadie framed to sing al their songs to her tune, she herselfe omitting no day, and catching holde of euerie occasion to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> mooue forwarde her sonnes desire, and remoue their owne resolutions: vsing the same arguments to the one sister, as to the other; determining that whom she could winne first, the other shoulde (without her sonnes knowledge) by poyson be made

away. But though the reasons were the same to both, yet the handling was diuerse, according as she saw their humours to prepare a more or lesse aptnesse of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. This day hauing vsed long speech to <hi>Philoclea,</hi> amplifying not a little the great duetifulnesse her sonne had shewed in deliuering <hi>Philanax</hi>: of whom she could get no aunswere, but a silence sealed vp in vertue, &amp; so sweetly graced, as that in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> it caried with it both resistance, and humblenes: <hi>Cecropia</hi> threatning in her selfe to ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne a more rugged race with her, went to her sister <hi>Pamela</hi>: who that day hauing wearied her self with reading, &amp; with the height of her hart disdaining to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie with any of the Gentlewome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appointed to attend her, whome she accounted her iaylours, was working vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a purse certain Roses &amp; Lillies, as by the finenesse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the worke, one might see she had borowed her wittes of the sorow that then owed them, &amp; lent them wholy to that exercise. For the flowers shee had wrought, caried such life in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningest painter might haue learned of her needle: which with so prety a maner made his careers to &amp; fro through the cloth, as if the needle it self wold haue ben loth to haue gone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ward such a mistres, but that it hoped to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> thitherward very quickly againe: the cloth loking with many eies vpon her, &amp; louingly embracing the wounds she gaue it: the sheares also were at hand to behead the silke, that was grown to short. And if at any time she put her mouth to bite it off it seemed, that where she had beene long in making of a Rose with her hands, shee would in an insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t make Roses with her lips; as the Lillies semed to haue their white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> rather of the hand that made them, then of the matter wherof the were made; &amp; that they grew therby the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of her eys, &amp; were refreshed by the most indisco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort comfortable ayre, which an vnwares sigh might bestow vpon them. But the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours for the ground were so well chosen, neither sullenly darke, nor glaringly light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, &amp; so wel proportioned, as that, though much cunning were in it, yet it was but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> to serue for an ornament of the principall woorke; that it was not without maruaile to see, how a mind which could cast a carelesse semblant vpon the greatest conflictes of Fortune, could commaund it selfe to take care for so small matters. Neither had she neglected the daintie dressing of her selfe: but as if it had been her mariage time to Affliction, she rather semed to remember her owne worthinesse, then the vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of her husband. For wel one might perceyue she had not reiected the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile of a glasse, &amp; that her hands had pleased themselues, in paying the tribute of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceyuing skill, to so high perfections of Nature.</p>
            <p>The sight whereof so diuerse from her sister, (who rather suffered sorrowe to dresse it selfe in her beautie, then that she would bestow any intertainment of so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> a guest made <hi>Cecropia</hi> take a suddaine assurednesse of hope, that she should obtaine somewhat of <hi>Pamela</hi>: thinking (according to the squaring out of her owne good nature) that beautie, carefully set foorth, woulde soone proue a signe of an vnrefusing harborough. Animated wherewith, shee sate downe by <hi>Pamela</hi>: and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the purse, and with affected curiositie looking vpon the worke, Full happie is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> he (saide she) at least if hee knew his owne happinesse, to whom a purse in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and by this hand wrought, is dedicated. In faith he shall haue cause to account it, not as a purse for treasure, but as a treasure it selfe, worthie to bee pursed vp in the purse of his owne hart. And thinke you so indeede (saide <hi>Pamela</hi> halfe smiling) I promise you I wrought it, but to make some tedious houres beleeue, that I thought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> not of them: for else I valued it, but euen as a verie purse. It is the right nature (saide <hi>Cecropia</hi>) of Beauty, to worke vnwitting effectes of wonder. Truely (saide <hi>Pamela</hi>) I neuer thought till now, that this outward glasse, intitled Beautie, which it pleaseth
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:12151:139"/>
you to lay to my (as I thinke) vnguiltie charge, was but a pleasaunt mixture of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall colours, delightfull to the eye, as musicke is to the eare, without any further consequence: since it is a thing, which not onely beastes haue; but euen stones and trees many of them doo greatly excell in it. That other thinges (answered <hi>Cecropia</hi>) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> haue some portion of it, takes not away the excellencie of it, where indeede it doth excell: since we see, that euen those beastes, trees, &amp; stones, are in the name of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty onely highly praised. But that the beautie of humaine persons be beyond al other things there is great likelihood of reason, since to them onely is giuen the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to discerne Beautie; and among reasonable wightes, as it seemes, that our sex <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> hath the preheminence, so that in that preheminence, Nature counteruailes al other liberalities, wherein she may bee thought to haue dealte more fauourably towarde mankind. How doo men crowne (thinke you) themselues with glorie, for hauing either by force brought others to yeelde to their minde, or with long studie, and premeditated orations, perswaded what they would haue perswaded? and see, a faire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> woman shall not onely commaund without authoritie, but perswade without spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. She shall not neede to procure attention, for their owne eyes will chaine their eares vnto it. Men venture liues to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quere; she conqueres liues without venturing. She is serued, and obeyed, which is the most notable, not because the lawe: so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund it, but because they become lawes themselues to obey her; not for her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> sake, but for her own sake. She need not dispute, whether to gouerne by Feare or Loue, since without her thinking thereof, their loue will bring foorth feare, and their feare will fortifie their loue: and shee neede not seeke offensiue, or defensiue force, since her onely lippes may stande for ten thousand shieldes, and tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand vneuitable shot goe from her eyes. Beautie, Beautie (deere Neece) is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> crowne of the feminine greatnes; which gifte, on whom soeuer the heauens (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in most nigardly) do bestowe, without question, she is bound to vse it to the noble purpose, for which it is created: not onely winning, but preseruing; since that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is the right happines, which is not onely in itselfe happie, but can also deriue the happines to another. Certainly Aunt (said <hi>Pamela</hi>) I feare me you will make me <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> not only think my selfe fairer then euer I did, but think my fairenes a matter of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter valew then heretofore I could imagine it. For I euer (til now) conceaued these conquests you speake of, rather to proceed from the weakenes of the conquered, then from the strength of the conquering power: as they say, the Cranes ouerthrow whole battailes of <hi>Pygmees,</hi> not so much of their Cranish courage, as because the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> are <hi>Pygmees,</hi> and that wee see, young babes thinke babies of woonderfull excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, and yet the babies are but babies. But since your elder yeares, &amp; abler iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, finde Beautie to be worthy of so incomparable estimation, certainly me thinks it ought to be held in dearnes, according to the excellencie, and (no more then we would do of things which we account pretious) euer to suffer it to be defiled.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Defiled? (saide <hi>Cecropia</hi>) Mary God forbid that my speech shoulde tend to any such purpose, as should deserue so foul a title. My meaning is to ioyne your beauty to loue; your youth to delight. For truely, as coulours should be as good as nothing if there were no eyes to behold them: so is Beauty nothing, without the eye of Loue behold it: and therfore, so far is it from defiling it, that it is the onely honoring of it, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> the onely preseruing of it: for Beauty goes awaye, deuoured by Time, but where remaines it euer flourishing, but in the hart of a true louer? And such a one (if euer there were any) is my son: whose loue is so subiected vnto you, that rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> breed
<pb facs="tcp:12151:140"/>
any offence vnto you, it will not delight it selfe in beholding you. There is no effect of his loue (answered <hi>Pamela</hi>) better pleaseth mee then that: but as I haue often an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered you, so, resolutely I say vnto you, that he must get my parents consent, and then he shall know further of my minde; for, without that, I know I should offend God. O sweet youth (said <hi>Cecropia</hi>) how vntimely subiect it is to deuotion (No, no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> sweet neece, let vs old folks thinke of such precise considerations; do you enioy the heauen of your age, whereof you are sure: and like good housholders, which spend those thinges that will not bee kept, so do you pleasantly enioy that, which else will bring an ouer-late repentance, when your glas shall accuse you to your face, what a change there is in you. Do you see how the spring-time is full of flowers, decking it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> selfe with them, and not aspiring to the fruits of <hi>Autumn?</hi> what lesson is that vnto you, but that in the april of your age, you should be like <hi>April?</hi> Let not some of them for whom alredy the graue gapeth, and perhaps enuy the felicity in you, which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues cannot enioy, perswade you to lose the holde of occasion; while it may not onely be taken, but offers, nay sues to bee taken: which if it bee not now taken, wil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> neuer hereafter be ouertaken. Your selfe know, how your father hath refused all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers made by the greatest Princes about you, &amp; wil you suffer your beauty to be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the wrinckles of his peuish thoughts? If hee be peuish (said <hi>Pamela</hi>) yet is he my father, and how beautifull so euer I be, I am his daughter: so as God claimes at my hands obedience, and makes me no iudge of his imperfections<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>These often replies vpon conscience in <hi>Pamela</hi>; made <hi>Cecropia</hi> thinke, that there was no righter waye for her, then as shee had (in her opinion) set her in liking of Beautie, with perswasion not to suffer it to be voide of purpose, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o if she could make her lesse feeling of those heauenly conceipts, that then shee might easilie winde her to her croked bias. Therefore, employing the vttermost of her mischieuous witte,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> and speaking the more earnestly, because she spake as shee thought, shee thus dealt with her. Deare neece, or rather, deare daughter, if my affection &amp; wish might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile therein, how much dooth it increase (trowe you) the earnest desire I haue of this blessed match, to see these vertues of yours knit fast with such zeale of Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (indeede the best bonde) which the most politicke wittes haue founde, to holde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> mans witte in well doing? For, as children must first by feare bee induced to knowe that, which after (when they doo know) they are most glad of: So are these bug-beares of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s brought by great Clearks into the world, to serue as shewelles to to keepe them from those faults, whereto els the vanitie of the worlde, and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of senses might pull them. But in you (Neece) whose excellencie is such, as it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> neede not to be helde vp by the staffe of vulgar opinions, I would not you shoulde loue Vertue seruillie, for feare of I know not what, which you see not: but euen for the good effects of vertue which you see. Feare, and indeede, foolish feare, &amp; feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ignorance, was the first inuenter of those conceates. For, when they hearde it thunder, not knowing the naturall cause, they thought there was some angrie body <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> aboue, that spake so lowde: and euer the lesse they did perceiue, the more they did conceiue. Whereof they knew no cause that grew streight a miracle: foolish folkes, not marking that the alterations be but vpon particular accidents, the vniuersalitie being alwaies one. Yesterday was but as to day, and to morrow will tread the same footsteps of his foregoers: so as it is manifest inough, that all thinges follow but the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> course of their owne nature, sauing onely Man, who while by the pregnancie of his imagination he striues to things supernaturall, meane-while hee looseth his owne
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:12151:140"/>
naturall felicitie. Be wise, and that wisedome shalbe a God vnto thee; be contented, and that is thy heauen: for els to thinke that those powers (if there bee any such) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue are moued either by the eloquence of our prayers, or in a chafe at the folly of our actions; caries asmuch reason as if flies should thinke, that men take great care <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> which of them hums sweetest, and which of them flies nimblest.</p>
            <p>She woulde haue spoken further to haue enlarged and confirmed her discourse: when <hi>Pamela</hi> (whose cheeks were died in the beautifullest graine of vertuous anger, with eies which glistered foorth beames of disdaine) thus interrupted her. Peace (wicked woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) peace, vnworthy to breath, that doest not acknowledge the breath-giuer; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> most vnworthy to haue a tongue, which speakest against him, through whom thou speakest: keepe your affection to your selfe, which like a bemired dog, would defile with fauning. You say yesterday was as to day. O foolish woman, and most miserablely foolish, since wit makes you foolish. What dooth that argue, but that there is a constancie in the euerlasting gouernour? Woulde you haue an inconstant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> God, since wee count a man foolish that is inconstant? He is not seene you say, and woulde you thinke him a God, who might bee seene by so wicked eyes, as yours? which yet might see enough if they were not like such, who for sport-sake willingly hood-winke themselues to receaue blowes the easier. But though I speake to you without any hope of fruite in so rotten a harte, and there bee no bodie else here to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> iudge of my speeches, yet be thou my witnesse, O captiuitie, that my yeares shal not be willingly guiltie of my Creators blasphemie. You saie, because we know not the causes of things; therfore feare was the mother of superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: nay, because we know that each effect hath a cause, that hath engendred a true &amp; liuely deuotion. For this goodly work of which we are, &amp; in which we liue, hath not his being by Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> which opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d meruaile by what chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce any braine could stumble. For if it be eternall (as you would seeme to conceiue of it) Eternity, and Chaunce are things vnsufferable together. For that is chaunceable which happeneth; and if it happen, there was a time before it happned, when it might haue not happened; or els it did not happen; and so if chaunceable, not eternall. And as absurd it is to thinke that if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> it had a beginning, his beginning was deriued from Chaunce: for Chaunce could neuer make all things of nothing: and if there were substaunces before, which by chaunce shoulde meete to make vp this worke, thereon followes another bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse pitt of absurdities. For then those substaunces must needs haue bene from euer and so eternall: and that eternall causes should bring forth chaunceable effectes, is as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> sensible, as that the Sunne shoulde bee the author of darkenesse. Againe, if it were chaunceable, then was it not necessarie; whereby you take away all consequents. But we see in all thinges, in some respect or other, necessitie of consequence: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in reason we must needs know that the causes were necessarie.</p>
            <p>Lastly Chaunce is variable, or els it is not to be called Chaunce: but wee see this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> worke is steady and permanent. If nothing but Chaunce had glewed those pieces of this All, the heauie partes would haue gone infinitely downward, the light infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpwarde, and so neuer haue mett to haue made vp his goodly bodie. For before there was a heauen, or a earth, there was neyther a heauen to stay the height of the rising, nor an earth, which (in respect of the round walles of heauen) should become <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> a centre. Lastly, perfect order, perfect beautie, perfect constancie, if these be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Chaunce, let wisedome be counted the roote of wickednesse. But you will say it is so by nature, as much as if you saide it is so, because it is so: if you meane of
<pb facs="tcp:12151:141"/>
many natures conspiring together, as in a popular gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to establish this faire estate; as if the Elementishe and ethereall partes shoulde in their towne-house set downe the bounds of each ones office; then consider what followes: that there must needes haue bene a wisedome which made them concurre: for their natures beyng absolute contrarie, in nature rather would haue sought each others ruine, then haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> serued as well consorted partes to such an vnexpressable harmonie. For that contrary things should meete to make vp a perfection without a force and Wisedome aboue their powers, is absolutely impossible; vnles you will flie to that hissed-out opinion of Chaunce againe. But you may perhaps affirme, that one vniuersal Nature (which hath ben for euer) is the knitting together of these many partes to such an excellent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> vnitie. If you meane a Nature of wisdome, goodnes, &amp; prouidence, which knowes what it doth, then say you that, which I seeke of you, and cannot conclude those blasphemies, whith which you defiled your mouth, &amp; mine eares. But if you meane a Nature, as we speake of the fire, which goeth vpward, it knowes not why: and of the nature of the Sea which in ebbing and flowing semes to obserue so iust a daunce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> and yet vnderstands no musicke, it is but still the same absurditie superscribed with another title. For this worde, one, being attributed to that which is All, is but one mingling of many, and many ones; as in a lesse matter, when we say one kingdome which conteines many citties; or one cittie which conteines many persons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the vnder ones (if there be not a superiour power and wisedome) cannot by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> regarde to any preseruation but of themselues: no more wee see they doo, since the water willingly quenches the fire, and drownes the earth; so farre are they from a conspired vnitie: but that a right heauenly Nature indeed, as it were vnnaturinge them, doth so bridle them.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is as absurde in nature that from an vnitie many contraries should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> still kept in a vnitie: as that from the number of contrarieties an vnitie should arise. I say still, if you banish both a singularitie, and pluralitie of iudgement from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them then (if so earthly a minde can lift it selfe vp so hie) doo but conceaue, how a thing whereto you giue the highest, and most excellent kind of being (which is eternitie) can be of a base &amp; vilest degree of being, and next to a not-being; which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> is so to be, as not to enioy his owne being? I will not here call all your senses to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which can heare, nor see nothing, which yeeldes not most euident euidence of of the vnspeakeablenesse of that Wisedome: each thinge being directed to an ende, and an ende of preseruation: so proper effects of iudgement, as speaking, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are of mankind.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>

This hearde I once alledged against such a godlesse minde as yours, who being driuen to acknowledge this beastly absurditie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> that our bodies should be better then the whole worlde, if it had the knowledge, whereof the other were voide; he sought (not able to answere directly) to shifte it off in this sorte: that if that reason were true, then must it followe also, that the world must haue in it a spirite, that could write and read too, and be learned; since that was in vs commendable: wretched foole, not considering that Bookes bee but supplies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> of defects; and so are praysed, because they helpe our want, and therefore cannot be incident to the eternall intelligence, which needes no recording of opinions to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme

And if his power be aboue all thinges, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently it must needes be infinite, since there is nothing aboue it to limit it. For beyond which there is nothing, must needes be boundlesse, and infinite: if his power be infinite, then likewise must his knowledge be infinite: for else there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> should be an infinite proportion of power which he should not know how to vse; the vnsensiblenesse whereof I thinke euen you can conceaue: and if infinite, then must nothing, no not the estate of flies (which you with so vnsauerie skorne did iest at) be vnknowne vnto him. For if it were, then there were his knowledge bounded, and so not infinite: if knowledge and power be infinite, then must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> needs his goodnesse and iustice march in the same rancke: for infinitenes of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and knowledge, without like measure of goodnesse, must necessarily bring foorth destruction and ruine, and not ornament and preseruation. Since then there is a God, and an all-knowing God, so as he sees into the darkest of all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall secretes, which is the hart of Man; and sees therein the deepest dissembled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> thoughts, nay sees the thoughts before they be thought: since he is iust to exercise his might, and mightie to performe his iustice, assure thy selfe, most wicked wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (that hast so plaguily a corrupted minde, as thou canst not keepe thy sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to thy selfe, but must most wickedly infect others) assure thy selfe, I say, (for what I say dependes of euerlasting and vnremooueable causes) that the time will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> come, when thou shalt knowe that power by feeling it, when thou shalt see his wisedome in the manifesting thy ougly shamefulnes, and shalt onely perceiue him to haue bene a Creator in thy destruction.</p>

went to his stable, where himselfe chose out a horse, whom (though he was neere twentie yeere olde) he preferred for a peece of sure seruice, before a great number of yonger. His colour was of a browne bay, dapled thick with black spots; his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head marked with a white starre; to which, in all his bodie there was no part su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but the left foote before; his mane and taile black, and thick, of goodly, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> well proportioned greatnes. He caused him to be trimmed with a sumptuous saddle of tawnie, and golde ennamell, enriched with pretious stones: his furniture was made into the fashion of the branches of a tree, from which the leaues were falling: and so artificiallie were the leaues made, that as the horse moued, it seemed indeed that the leaues wagged, as when the winde plaies with them; and being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> made of a pale cloath of gold, they did beare the straw-coloured liuerie of ruine. His armour was also of tawnie and golde, but formed into the figure of flames darckened, as when they newelie brake the prison of a smoakie furnace. In his shielde he had painted the <hi>Torpedo</hi> fish. And so appointed; he caused himselfe, with his trumpet and squire (whom he had taken since the death of <hi>Ismenus</hi>) to be ferried <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> ouer into the Iland: a place well chosen for such a purpose. For, it was so plaine, as there was scarcely any bush, or hillock, either to vnleuell, or shadow it: of length and breadth enough, to trie the vttermost both of launce and sword, and the one end of it facing the castle, the other extending it selfe toward the campe, and no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to it, but by water: there could no secret trecherie be wrought, and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> violence, ether side might haue time inough to succour their party.</p>
            <p>But there he found <hi>Phalantus,</hi> alredy waiting for him vpon a horse, milke white, but that vpon his shoulder and withers, he was freckned with red staines, as when a few strawberies are scattered into a dish of creame. He had caused his mane and taile to be died in carnation; his reines were vine branches, which ingendring one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> with the other, at the end, when it came to the bitte, there, for the bosse, brought foorth a cluster of grapes, by the workeman made so liuely, that it seemed, as the horse champed on his bitte, he chopped for them, and that it did make his mouth water, to see the grapes so neere him. His furniture behind was of vines, so artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made, as it seemed the horse stood in the shadow of the vine, so pretily were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> clusters of rubie grapes dispersed among the trappers which embraced his sides. His armour was blew, like the heauen, which a Sun did with his rayes (proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deliuered) guild in most places. His shield was beautified with this deuice; A greyhound, which ouerrunning his fellow, and taking the hare, yet hurts it not when it takes it. The word was, <hi>The glorie, not the pray.</hi>

delectable sight, in a dangerous effect; and a pleasant consideration, that there was so perfect agreement, in so mortall disagreement: like a musick, made of cunning discords. But their horses keeping an euen line their masters had skilfully allotted vnto them, passed one by another without encountring, although either might feel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the angry breath of other. But the staues being come to a iust descent, but euen when the mark was ready to meet them, <hi>Amphialus</hi> was runne through the vam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, and vnder the arme: so as the staffe appearing behind him, it semed to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders he had bene in danger.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> trusting more to the strength, then to the nimblenes of his horse, put him foorth with speedie violence, and making his head ioyne to the others flanke, guiding his blow with discretion, and strengthning it with the course of his horse, strake <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantus</hi> vpon the head, in such sort, that his feeling sense did both dazell his sight, and astonish his hearing.

And so remayned they awhile, rather angry with fighting, then fighting for anger, till <hi>Amphialus</hi>-his horse, leaning harde vpon the other, and winning grounde, the other horse feeling himselfe prest, began to rise a little <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> before, as he was woont to doo in his coruette: which aduantage <hi>Amphialus</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, set forward his owne horse with the further spurre, so as <hi>Phalantus</hi>-his horse came ouer with his master vnder him.

But <hi>Amphialus</hi> (that many like trials had taught, great spending to leaue small remnants) let passe the storme with strong wards, and nimble auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: till seeing his time fit, both for distaunce &amp; nakednes, he strake him so cruell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> a blow on the knee, that the poore Gentleman fell downe withall in a sowne.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Amphialus,</hi> pittying approued valoure, made pretious by naturall curtesie, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to him, &amp; taking off his head-piece to giue him aire, the young Knight (disdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

to buy life with yeelding) bad him vse his fortune: for he was resolued neuer to yeeld. No more you shall (said <hi>Amphialus</hi>) if it be not to my request, that you will account your selfe to haue great interest in me. <hi>Phalantus</hi> more ouercome by his kindnes, then by his fortune, desired yet once againe to know his name, who in his first beginning had shewed such furie in his force, and yet such stay in his surie.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
               <hi>Amphialus,</hi> then named himselfe, telling him withall, he would think his name much bettred, if it might be honored by the title of his friend. But no Baulme could be more comfortable to his wound, then the knowledge thereof was to his minde, when he knew his mishap should be excused by the renowmed valour of the other. And so promising each to other assurednes of good will, <hi>Phalantus,</hi> (of whom <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> would haue no other raunsome, but his word of friendship) was conueyed into the campe, where he would but litle remaine among the enimies of <hi>Amphia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus:</hi> but went to seeke his aduentures other-where.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Amphialus</hi> he was receaued with triumph into the castle; although one might see by his eyes (humbly lifted vp to the window where <hi>Philoclea</hi> stood) that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> he was rather suppliaunt, then victorious: which occasion <hi>Cecropia</hi> taking, (who as then stood by <hi>Philoclea,</hi> and had lately lefte <hi>Pamela</hi> in another roome, whence also she might see the combate) Sweet Lady (said she) now you may see, whether you haue cause to loue my sonne, who then lies vnder your feete, when he standes vpon the necke of his brauest enemies. Alas said <hi>Philoclea,</hi> a simple seruice to me,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> me thinkes it is, to haue those, who come to succour me, destroied: If it be my dutie to call it loue, be it so: but the effects it brings foorth I confesse I account hatefull. <hi>Cecropia</hi> grew so angry with this vnkinde answere, that she could not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayne from telling her, that she was like them that could not sleepe, when they were softly layed: but that if her sonne would follow her counsell, he should take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> another course with her: and so flang away from her.</p>
            <p>Yet (knowing the desperate melancholy of <hi>Amphialus</hi> in like cases) framed to him a very thankefull message, poudring it with some hope-giuing phrases; which were of such ioy to <hi>Amphialus,</hi> that he (though against publike respect, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of dissuaders) presently caused it to be made knowne to the campe, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> whatsoeuer Knight would trie the like fortune as <hi>Phalantus</hi> did, he should in like sort be answered: so as diuers of the valiantest, partly of themselues, partly at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation of <hi>Basilius,</hi> attempted the combat with him: and according to euery ones humour, so were the causes of the challenge grounded: one laying treason to his charge; another preferring himselfe in the worthinesse to serue <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> a third, exalting some Ladies beautie beyonde either of the sisters; a fourth, laying disgraces to Loue it selfe, naming it the bewitcher of the witte, the rebell to Reason, the betrayer of resolution, the defiler of thoughts, the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner of magnanimitie, the flatterer of vice, the slaue to weakenes, the infection of youth, the madnes of age; the curse of life, and reproch of death; a fifth, disday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to cast at lesse then at all, would make the cause of his quarrell the causers of loue, and proclayme his blasphemies against womankinde; that namely that sex was the ouersight of Nature, the disgrace of reasonablenes, the obstinate cowards, the slaue-borne tyrants, the shops of vanities, the guilded wethercocks; in whome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science is but peeuishnes, chastitie way wardnes, and gratefulnes a miracle. But all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> these challenges (how well so euer endited) were so well answered, that some by death taught others, though past learning themselues; and some by yeelding gaue
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:12151:144"/>
themselues the lie for hauing blasphemed; to the great griefe of <hi>Basilius,</hi> so to see his Rebell preuaile, and in his owne sight to crowne himselfe with deserued honour.</p>
            <p>Whereupon thirsting for reuenge, and else not hoping to preuaile, the best of his campe being already ouerthrowne; he sent a messenger to <hi>Argalus,</hi> in whose ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> courage and force, he had (and had cause) to haue great considence, with a letter; requiring him, to take this quarrell in hand, from which hee had hetherto spared him in respect of his late mariage. But now his honour, and (as he esteemed it) felicitie standing vpon it, hee coulde no longer forbeare to chalenge of him his faithfull seruice.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> The messenger made speede, and found <hi>Argalus</hi> at a castle of his owne, sitting in a parler with the faire <hi>Parthenia,</hi> he reading in a booke the stories of <hi>Hercules,</hi> she by him, as to heare him reade; but while his eyes looked on the booke, shee looked on his eies, and sometimes staying him with some prety question, not so much to bee resolued of the doubte; as to giue him occasion to looke vpon her. A happy couple, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> he ioying in her, she ioying in her selfe, but in her selfe, because shee enioyed him: both encreasing their riches by giuing to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> But when the messenger came in with letters in his hand, and hast in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, though she knew not what to feare, yet she feared, because she knew not; but she rose, and went aside, while hee deliuered his letters and message; yet a far off she looked, now at the messenger, and then at her husband: the same feare, which made her loth to haue cause of feare, yet making her seeke cause to nourish her feare. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> well she found there was some serious matter; for her husbands countenance figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red some resolution betweene lothnesse and necessitie: and once his eie cast vpon her, and finding hers vpon him, he blushed; and she blushed, because hee blushed; and yet streight grew pale, because she knew not why he had blushed. But when he had read, and heard, and dispatched away the messenger (like a man in whom Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> could not be rocked a sleepe by Affection) with promise quickly to follow; he came to <hi>Parthenia,</hi> and as sorie as might bee for parting, and yet more sorie for her sorrow, he gaue her the letter to reade. She with fearfull slownes tooke it, and with fearefull quicknesse read it; and hauing read it, <hi>Ah</hi> my <hi>Argalus</hi> (said she) and haue you made such hast to answere? and are you so soone resolued to leaue me? But hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> discoursing vnto her, how much it imported his honour (which since it was deare to him, he knew it would be deare vnto her) her reason ouerclowded with sorrow, suffered her not presently to replie, but left the charge thereof to teares, and sighes; which he not able to beare, left her alone, and went to giue order for his present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>

But when he tooke her in his armes, and sought to printe his harte in her sweete lippes, she fell in a sounde, so as he was faine to leaue her to her Gentlewomen: and caried away by the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> of Honour, though with manie a backe-cast looke, and hartie grone, went to the campe.

In which dayes, he sought by all meanes (hauing leaue to parley with him) to dissuade him from his enterprise: &amp; then imparting his minde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> to <hi>Basilius,</hi> because he founde <hi>Amphialus</hi> was inflexible, wrote his defie vnto him in this maner.</p>
            <p>RIght famous <hi>Amphialus,</hi> if my persuasion in reason, or prayer in good will, might preuaile with you, you should by better meanes be like to obtaine your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> desire. You shoulde make many braue enemies become your faithfull seruants, and and make your honor flie vp to heauen, being caried vp by both the wings of valure and iustice; whereof now it wants the latter. But since my suite, nor counsell can get no place in you, disdaine not to receiue a mortall chalenge, from a man so farre infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour vnto you in vertue, as that I do not so much mislike of the deede, as I haue the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> doer in admiration.

            <p>The chalenge thus denounced, and accepted, <hi>Argalus</hi> was armed in a white ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which was al guilded ouer with knots of womans haire, which came downe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> from the crest of his head-peece, &amp; spred it selfe in rich qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie ouer all his armour: his furniture was cut out into the fashion of an Egle, whereof the beake (made into

But when they drew nere, <hi>Argalus</hi> horse being hot, prest in with his head: which <hi>Amphialus</hi> perceiuing, knowing if he gaue him his side, it shoulde bee to his disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> prest in also with him, so as both the horses &amp; men met shoulder to shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, so as the horses (hurt as much with the striking, as being striken) tumbled down to the earth, daungerously to their maisters, but that they by strength nimble, &amp; by vse skilfull, in the falling shunned the harme of the fall, and without more respite, drewe out their swordes with a gallant brauerie, eche striuing to shewe himselfe the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> lesse endamaged, and to make knowne that they were glad, they had nowe nothing else to trust to, but their owne vertue. True it is, that <hi>Amphialus</hi> was the sooner vp; but <hi>Argalus</hi> had his sworde out the sooner: and then fell they to the cruellest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, that any present eye had seene.

But the fire of that strife, blowen with his inward rage, boyled out his bloud in such aboundance, that hee was driuen to rest him vpon the pommel of his sworde: and then each thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to turne round in the daunce of Death before his eyes, his sight both daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> &amp; dimmed, till (thinking to sit downe) he fel in a sowne, <hi>Parthenia,</hi> and <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alus</hi> both hastely went vnto him: <hi>Amphialus</hi> tooke off his helmet, and <hi>Parthenia</hi> laid his head in her lap, tearing of her linnen sleues &amp; partlet, to serue about his wounds to bind which, shee tooke of her hair-lace, and woulde haue cut of her faire haire herselfe, but that the squires and iudges came in with fitter things for the purpose: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> while she bewayled her selfe with so lamentable sweetnes, as was inough to haue taught sorrow to the gladdest thoughts, and haue engraued it in the mindes of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest mettall.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Parthenia,</hi> no more <hi>Parthenia</hi> (said she) What art thou? what seest thou? how is thy blisse in a moment fallen? how art thou, euen-now before all Ladies the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> of perfect happines, and nowe the gasing-stocke of endles miserie?

And well might shee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> heare as she past through the Campe, the great prayses spoken of her husbande, which all were recordes of her losse. But the more excellent he was (being indeede accounted seconde to none in all Greece) the more did the breath of those praises, beare vp the winges of <hi>Amphialus</hi>-his fame: to whom yet (such was his case) that Trophe vpon Trophe, still did but builde vp the monument of his thraldome; hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> euer finding himselfe in such fauour of <hi>Philoclea,</hi> that shee was most absent, when he was present with her; and euer sorriest, when he had best successe: which would haue made him renounce all comfort, but that his mother, with diuersity of deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, kept vp his hart.</p>
            <p>But while he allayed thus his outward glorie, with inward discomfort, hee was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> like to haue bene ouertaken with a notable treason, the beginning wherof (though meerely ridiculous) had like to haue brought forth vnto him a weeping effect.</p>
            <p>Among other that attended <hi>Basilius</hi> in this expedition, <hi>Damaetas</hi> was one; whether to be present with him, or absent from <hi>Miso</hi>: once, certaine it was without any mind to make his sword cursed by any widow.

But <hi>Amphialus,</hi> perceauing the matter, tooke him aside, and very earnestly dealt with him not to shame himselfe; <hi>Amphialus</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> onely desirous to bring it to passe to make some sport to <hi>Philoclea,</hi> but not being able to perswade with him, <hi>Amphialus</hi> licenced the Gentleman, telling him, that by next morning he should haue answere.</p>
            <p>The yong Gentleman (sory he had sped no better) returned to <hi>Damaetas,</hi> who had fetched many a sower-breathed sigh, for feare <hi>Clinias</hi> would accept the chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he perceiued by his trusty messenger, that this delay was in effect a denial, there being no disposition in him to accept it; then lo, <hi>Damaetas</hi> began to speake his lowd voice, to looke big, to march vp &amp; down, &amp; in his march to lift his legs higher then he was wont, swearing by no meane deuotions, that the wals should not keepe the coward fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, but he would fetch him out of his connie-berrie: and then was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> hotter then euer to prouide himselfe of horse &amp; armour, saying, he would go to the Iland brauely addoubed, &amp; shew himself to his charge <hi>Pamela.</hi> To this purpose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny willing hands were about him, letting him haue reynes, pettrell, with the rest of the furniture, and very braue bases; but all comming from diuers houses, nether in coulour nor fashion, shewing any kinred one with another; but that liked <hi>Damaetas</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> the better: for that he thought would argue, that he was maister of many braue fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitures. Then gaue he order to a painter for his deuice; which was, a plowe with the oxen lewsed from it, a sword with a great number of armes and legges cut off; and lastly a great armie of pen and inke-hornes, and bookes. Nether did he stick to tell the secrete of his intent, which was, that he had left off the plowe, to doo such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> bloudy deedes with his swoorde, as many inkehornes and bookes should be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about the historifying of them: and being asked, why he set no word vnto it, he said, that was indeed like the painter, that sayeth in his picture, Here is the dog, and there is the Hare: &amp; with that he laughed so perfectly, as was great consolation to the beholders. Yet remembring, that <hi>Miso</hi> would not take it well at his returne, if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> he forgat his dutie to her, he caused in a border about to be written:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Miso</hi> mine owne pigsnie, thou shalt heare news of <hi>Damaetas.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus all things being condignely ordered, with an ill fauoured impatiencie he waited, vntill the next morning, that he might make a muster of him selfe in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Iland; often asking them that very diligently wayted vpon him, whether it were not pittie, that such a coward, as <hi>Clinias,</hi> should fet his runaway feete vpon the face of the earth?</p>
            <p>But as he was by diuers principall yong Gentlemen, to his no small glory, lifted vp on horsebacke, comes me a page of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> who with humble smiling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> deliuered a letter vnto him from <hi>Clinias:</hi> whom <hi>Amphialus</hi> had brought to this, first with perswasions (that for certaine, if he did accept the combat, <hi>Damae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> would neuer dare to appeare, and that then the honour should be his) but

and then willed him to lie downe vpon the earth as flat as he could. <hi>Clinias</hi> obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and <hi>Damaetas</hi> (who neuer could thinke himselfe safe, till <hi>Clinias</hi> were dead) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to thinke with himselfe, that if he strake at him with his sworde, if he did not kill him at the first blowe, that then <hi>Clinias</hi> might happe to arise, and reuenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Therefore he thought best to kneele downe vpon him, and with a great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> whittle he had (hauing disarmed his heade) to cut his throate, which he had vsed so with Calues, as he had no small dexteritie in it. But while he sought for his Knife, which vnder his armour he could not well finde out, and that <hi>Clinias</hi> lay with so sheepish a quietnes, as if he would haue beene glad to haue his throate cut for feare of more paine, the Iudges came in, and tooke <hi>Damaetas</hi> from off <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> him, telling him he did against the lawe of Armes, hauing promised life, if hee threwe away his sworde. <hi>Damaetas</hi> was loath to consent, till they sware, they would not suffer him to fight any more, when he was vp: and then more forced, then perswaded, he let him rise, crowing ouer him, and warning him to take heede how he dealt any more with any that came of his fathers kinred. But thus this <hi>combate of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> cowardes</hi> being finished, <hi>Damaetas</hi> was with much mirth and melodie receiued into the campe as victorious, neuer a Page there failing to waite vpon this Triumph.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Clinias,</hi> though he wanted hart to preuent shame, yet he wanted not wit to feele shame; not so much repining at it for the abhorring of shame, as for the discommodities, that to them that are shamed, ensue. For well he deemed, it would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> be a great barre to his practize, and a pulling on of iniuries, when men needed not care, how they vsed him. Insomuch, that <hi>Clinias</hi> (finding himselfe the scorning-stocke of euery companie) fell with repining to hate the cause thereof; and hate in a cowards hart, could set it selfe no other limites, but death. Which purpose was well egged on by representing vnto himselfe, what daunger he lately was in; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> which still kept no lesse ougly figure in his minde, then when it was present: and quickly (euen in his dissembling countenance) might be discerned a concealed grudge. For though he forced in himselfe a farre more diligent officiousnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Amphialus,</hi> then euer before, yet a leering eye vpon the one side at him, a countenance still framed to smiling before him (how little cause soeuer there was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of smiling) and grombling behind him, at any of his commandements, with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine manner of behauiour: his words comming out, though full of flatterie, yet slowly, and hoarcely pronounced, might well haue blazed, what armes his false hart bare. But despised, because of his cowardlinesse, and not marked, because de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised, he had the freer scope of practize. Which he did the more desperately enter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> into, because the dayly dangers <hi>Amphialus</hi> did submit himselfe into, made <hi>Clinias</hi> assuredly looke for his ouerthrow, and for his owne consequently, if he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme his former treason to <hi>Basilius,</hi> with a more treasonable falshood toward <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus.</hi> His chiefe care therefore was, to finde out among all sorts of the <hi>Amphia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> whom either like feare, tediousnes of the siege, or discontentment of some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ambition would make apt to dig in the same mine that he did: &amp; some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy of welthy weary folks, &amp; vnconsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t youths (who had not found such sudden successe as they had promised the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues) he had made stoupe to his lure. But of none he made so good account as of <hi>Artesia,</hi> sister to the late slain <hi>Ismenus,</hi> &amp; the chiefe of the six maids, who had trained out the Princesses to their banket of miserie: so much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> did the sharpnes of her wit counteruaile (as he thought) any other defects of her sex: for she had vndertaken that dangerous practise by the persuasion of <hi>Cecropia</hi>;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:12151:148"/>
who assured her that the two princesses should be made away; and then <hi>Amphialus</hi> wold marry her: which she was the apter to beleue, by some false persuasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her glas had giuen her of her own incomparable excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies, &amp; by the great fauor she knew he bare to her brother <hi>Ismenus,</hi> which (like a self-flattering woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> done for her sake.

Then was the name of <hi>Philoclea</hi> graued in the glas windowes, and by the foolish idolatrie of affection, no sooner written, then adored; and no sooner adored, then pittied: all the wonted praises (she was wont to giue vnto her) being now but figures of rethorick to amplifie the iniuries of misfortune; against which being alone, she would often make inuectiue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> declamations, methodized only by raging sorow.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Artesia</hi> did insinuat herselfe into her acquaintance, she gaue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of her courage to wit, &amp; was content to familiarize herselfe with her: so much the rather, as that she perceiued in her certaine flawes of il-concealed discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

            <p>But <hi>Clinias</hi> (whose faith could neuer comprehende the misteries of Courage) perswaded <hi>Artesia,</hi> while he by corruption had drawne the guard of one gate, to open it (when he would appoint the time) to the enemie: that she should impoyson <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
               <hi>Amphialus,</hi> which she might the easier do, because she her selfe had vsed to make the broaths, when <hi>Amphialus</hi> (either wearied or wounded) did vse such diet. And all things alredy were ready to be put in execution, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they thought best to break the matter with the two excellent sisters, not doubting of their consent in a thing so behoofefull to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues: their reasons being, that the Princesses knowing their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> seruice, might be sure to preserue them from the fury of the entring souldiers: whereof <hi>Clinias</hi> (euen so) could scarcely be sufficiently certaine: and withall, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them priuie to their action, to binde them afterwardes to a promised grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes towards them. They went therefore at one time, when they knew them to be alone, <hi>Clinias</hi> to <hi>Philoclea,</hi> and <hi>Artesia</hi> to <hi>Pamela:</hi> and <hi>Clinias,</hi> with no fewe words,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> did set forth what an exploite was intended for her seruice. But <hi>Philoclea</hi> (in whose cleere minde treason could finde no hiding place) told him, that she would be glad, if he could perswade her cosin to deliuer her, and that she would neuer forget his seruice therein: but that she desired him to lay downe any such way of mischiefe, for that (for her part) she would rather yeeld to perpetuall imprisonment, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> to the destroying her cosin, who (she knewe) loued her, though wronged her. This vnlooked-for answere amazed <hi>Clinias,</hi> so that he had no other remedie in his minde, but to kneele downe to <hi>Philoclea,</hi> and beseech her to keepe it secret, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the intention was for her seruice: and vowing (since she misliked it) to proceed no further therein. She comforted him with promise of silence, which she <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> perfourmed.</p>
            <p>But that little auayled: for <hi>Artesia</hi> hauing in like sort opened this deuice to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mela,</hi> she (in whose mind Vertue gouerned with the scepter of Knowledge) hating so horrible a wickednes, and streight iudging what was fitte to doo, Wicked wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (said she) whose vnrepenting harte can finde no way to amend treason, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> by treason: now the time is come, that thy wretched wiles haue caught thy selfe in thine owne nette: as for me, let the Gods dispose of me as shall please them; but sure it shall be no such way, nor way-leader, by which I will come to libertie. This she spake something with a lowder voice then she was woont to vse, so as <hi>Cecropia</hi> heard the noise; who was (sooner then <hi>Artesia</hi> imagined she would) come vp, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> bring <hi>Pamela</hi> to a window, where she might see a notable skirmish happened in the Campe, as she thought, among themselues: and being a cunning fisher in troubled waters, streight found by their voices and gestures, there was some matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, which she desired <hi>Pamela</hi> to tell her.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But the noyse they heard in the campe, was occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the famous Prince <hi>Anaxius,</hi> nephewe to the Giant <hi>Euardes</hi> whom <hi>Pyrocles</hi> slew: A Prince, of body exceedingly strong; in armes so skilfull and fortunate, as no man was thought to excell him; of courage that knew not howe to feare: partes worthie praise, if they had not beene guyded by pride, and followed by vniustice. For by a strange composition of mind, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> there was no man more tenderly sensible in any thing offered to himselfe, which in the farthest-fette construction, might be wrested to the name of wrong; no man, that in his owne actions could worse distinguish betweene Valour and Violence: So proud, as he could not abstaine from a <hi>Thraso</hi>-like boasting, and yet (so vnluckie a lodging his vertues had gotten) he would neuer boast more then he would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> falsly accounting an vnflexible anger, a couragious constancie: esteeming feare, and astonishment, righter causes of admiration, then Loue and Honour. This man had foure sundrie times fought with <hi>Amphialus,</hi> but <hi>Mars</hi> had bene so vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall an arbiter, that neither side gate aduauntage of the other. But in the end it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that <hi>Anaxius</hi> found <hi>Amphialus</hi> (vnknowen) in a great danger, and saued his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> life: whereupon (louing his owne benefite) began to fauour him, so much the more as, thinking so well of himselfe, he coulde not choose but like him, whom he found a match for himselfe: which at last grewe to as much friendship towardes him, as could by a proud harte conceiued. So as in this trauaile (seeking <hi>Pyrocles</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of his vncles death) hearing of this siege, neuer taking paines to examine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> the quarrell (like a man whose will was his God, and his hand his lawe taking with him his two brothers (men accounted little inferiour to him selfe in martiall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) and two hundred chosen horsemen (with whome hee thought him selfe able to conquere the world) yet commaunding the rest of his forces to follow, hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vpon such an vnexpected suddainnesse entred in vpon the backe of <hi>Basilius,</hi> that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> many with great vnkindnesse tooke their death, not knowing why, nor how they were so murdred. There, if euer, did he make knowne the wonderfulnes of his force. But the valiant, and faithfull <hi>Philanax,</hi> with well gouerned speed made such head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, as would haue shewed, how soone Courage falles in the ditch which hath not the eie of Wisdome: but that <hi>Amphialus</hi> at the same time issued out, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> winning with an abundaunce of courage one of the sconses, which <hi>Basilius</hi> had buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, made waie for his friend <hi>Anaxius</hi> with great losse of both sides, but especially of the <hi>Basilians</hi>; such notable monuments had those two swords especially lefte of their Maisters redoubted worthynesse.</p>
            <p>There with the respect fit to his estate, the honour dewe to his worthinesse, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the kindnesse which accompanies friendship (made fast by enterchaunged benefits) did <hi>Amphialus</hi> enforce him selfe (as much as in a besieged towne he could) to make <hi>Anaxius</hi> know, that his succour was not so needefull, as his presence gratefull. For causing the streetes and houses of the towne to witnes his welcome (making both souldiers and Magistrates in their countenaunces to shewe their gladnesse of him) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> he led him to his mother, whom hee besought to entertaine him with no lesse loue and kindnesse, then as one, who once had saued her sonnes life, and now came to saue both life and honour. Tush (said <hi>Anaxius,</hi> speaking alowde, looking vpon his
<pb facs="tcp:12151:151"/>
brothers) I am onely sorie there are not halfe a dozen Kinges more about you: that what <hi>Anaxius</hi> can do, might be the better manifested. His brothers smiled, as though he had ouer-modestly spoken farre vnderneath the pitch of his power. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was he disarmed at the earnest request of <hi>Amphialus</hi>: for <hi>Anaxius</hi> boiled with desire to issue out vppon the enemies, perswading himself, that the Sun should not be sette, before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> he had ouerthrown them. And hauing reposed himselfe, <hi>Amphialus</hi> asked him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would visite the yong Princesses. But <hi>Anaxius</hi> whispered him in the eare: In trueth (saide hee) deare friende <hi>Amphialus,</hi> though I am none of those, that loue to speake of themselues, I neuer came yet in companie of Ladies, but that they fell in loue with me. And I that in my hart scorne them as a peeuish paltrie sexe, not woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> to communicate with my vertues, woulde not doo you the wrong: since (as I heare) you doo debase your selfe so much as to affect them. The curteous <hi>Amphialus</hi> could haue beene angrie with him for those wordes; but knowing his humour suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him to daunce to his owne musicke: and gaue himselfe to entertaine both him and his brothers, with as cheerefull a maner, as coulde issue from a mind whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> vnluckie loue had filled with melancholie. For to <hi>Anaxius</hi> he yeelded the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all. He gaue the watchwoorde, and if any grace were graunted, the meanes were to be made to <hi>Anaxius.</hi> And that night when supper was ended, wherein <hi>Amphialus</hi> woulde needes himselfe waite vpon him, he caused in Boates vpon the Lake an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent musicke to be ordered: which, though <hi>Anaxius</hi> might conceiue was for his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> honour, yet indeede he was but the Bricke-wall to conuey it to the eares of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued <hi>Philoclea.</hi>

            <p>The musicke was of Cornets, whereof one aunswering the other, with a sweete emulation, striuing for the glorie of musicke, and striking vpon the smooth face of the quiet Lake, was then deliuered vp to the castle walles, which with a proude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But his mother (as she had plentifull cause) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him see, that of his other griefes there was little or no fault in himself, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there ought to be little or no griefe in him; when she came to the head of the sore, indeed seeing that she could no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger patch vp her former promises (he taking <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> a desperat deafnes to all delaying hopes) she confest plainly, that she could preuaile nothing: but the fault was his owne, who had marred the yong Girle by seeking to haue that by praier, which he should haue taken by authoritie. That as it were an absurd cunning to make hie ladders to go in a plaine way; so was it an vntimely and foolish flattery, there to beseech, where one might commaund, puffing them vp by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> being besought, with such a selfe-pride of superioritie, that it was not (forsooth) to be held out, but by a denial.

My sonne, beleeue me, a woman, speaking of women: a louers" modesty among vs is much more praised, then liked: or if we like it, so well we like it, that for marring of his modestie, he shall neuer proceed further. Each vertue hath his time: if you command your souldier to march formost, and he for curtesie put others before him, would you praise his modesty? loue is your Generall: he bids <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> you dare: and will <hi>Amphialus</hi> be a dastard?

Truly I haue knowen a great Lady, long sought by most great, most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> wise, most beautifull, most valiant persons; neuer wonne, because they did ouer-superstitiously sollicite her: the same Ladie brought vnder by an other, inferiour to all them in all those qualities, onely because he could vse that imperious maister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, which nature giues to men aboue women.

Awake thy spirits (good <hi>Amphialus</hi>) and assure thy selfe, that though she refuseth, she refuseth but to endeere the obtaining. If she weepe, and chide, and protest, before it be gotten, she can but weepe, and chide, and protest, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> when it is gotten.

            <p>Which aliance of passions so moued <hi>Amphialus</hi> (alredy tender-minded by the afflictions of Loue) that without staffe or sword drawne, he trotted fairely to the forsaken Knight, willing to haue put off this combat, to which his melancholy hart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> did (more then euer in like occasion) misgiue him: and therefore saluting him, Good Knight (said he) because we are men, and should know reason why we doo things; tell me the cause, that makes you thus eager to fight with me.

            <p>But <hi>Amphialus</hi> by that thinking (though wrongly, each indeede mistaking other) that he was his riuall, forgat all minde of reconciliation, and hauing all his thoughts bound vp in choler, neuer staying either iudge, trumpet, or his owne launce, drew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> out his sword, and saying, Thou lyest false villaine, vnto him; his words &amp; blowes came so quick together, as the one seemed a lightning of the others thunder. But he found no barren ground of such seede: for it yeelded him his owne with such encrease, that though Reason and Amazement go rarely togither, yet the most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable eies that saw it, found reason to be amazed at the fury of their combat. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> game of death better plaid; neuer fury set it selfe forth in greater brauerie. The curteous <hi>Vulcan,</hi> when he wrought at his more curteous wiues request, <hi>AEnaeas</hi> an armour, made not his hammer beget a greater sounde, then the swords of those noble Knights did, they needed no fire to their forge, for they made the fire to shine at the meeting of their swords, &amp; armours, ech side fetching still new spirit from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> castle window, and carefull of keeping their sight that way as a matter of greater consideration in their combat, then either the aduantage of Sun or winde: which Sunne &amp; wind (if the astonished eies of the beholders were not by the astonishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t deceiued) did both stand still to be beholders of this rare match. For neither could their amazed eies discerne motion in the Sunne, and no breath of winde stirred, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> if either for feare it would not come among such blows, or with delight had his eies so busie, as it had forgot to open his mouth. This fight being the more cruell, since both Loue and Hatred conspired to sharpen their humours, that hard it was to say, whether Loue with one trumpet, or Hatred with another, gaue the lowder ala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Spite, rage, disdaine, shame, reuenge, came waighting vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> Hatred: of the other side came with loue-longing Desire, both inuincible Hope, and fearelesse Despaire, with riuallike Iealousie, which (although brought vp within doores in the schoole of <hi>Cupid</hi>) woulde shewe them-selues no lesse

forward, then the other dustie band of <hi>Mars,</hi> to make themselues notable in the notablenes of this combat. Of eyther side Confidence, vnacquainted with Losse, but assured trust to ouercome, and good experience how to ouercome: now seconding their terrible blowes with cunning labouring the horses, to winne ground of the enimie; now vnlooked-for parting one from the other, to win ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> by an aduantageous retourne. But force against force, skill against skill, so enterchangeably encountred, that it was not easie to determine, whether enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising, or preuenting came former: both, sometimes at one instant, doing and suffring wrong, and choller no lesse rising of the doing, then of the suffring. But as the fire, the more fuell is put to it, the more hungrie still it is to deuoure more: so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the more they strake, the more vnsatisfied they were with striking. Their verie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour by piecemeale fell away from them: and yet their flesh abode the wounds constantly, as though it were lesse sensible of smart, then the senselesse armour: their blood in most places stayning their blacke couler, as if it would giue a more liuely coulour of mourning, then blacke can doo. And so a long space they fought,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> while neither vertue, nor fortune seemed partiall of either side: which so tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the vnquiet hart of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> that he resolued to see a quicke ende: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the violence of courage, adding strength to his blow, he strake in such wise vpon the side of the others head, that his remembrance left that battered lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: so as he was quite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom himselfe, casting his armes abroade, and redie to fall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> downe; his sword likewise went out of his hand; but that being fast by a chaine to his arme, he could not loose. And <hi>Amphialus</hi> vsed the fauour of occasion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling his blowes: but the horse (weary to be beaten, as well as the master) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his master away, til he came vnto himself: But then who could haue seene him, might well haue discerned shame in his cheekes, and reuenge in his eyes: so as set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> his teeth togither with rage, he came running vpon <hi>Amphialus,</hi> reaching out his arme, which had gathered vp the sword, meaning with that blow to haue clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Amphialus</hi> in two. But <hi>Amphialus</hi> seeing the blow comming, shunned it with nimble turning his horse aside; wherwith the forsaken Knight ouer-strake himselfe so, as almost he came downe with his owne strength. But the more hungrie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of his purpose, the more he was bard the food of it: disdaining the resistance, both of force, and fortune, he returned vpon the spurre againe, and ranne with such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence vpon <hi>Amphialus,</hi> that his horse with the force of the shocke rose vp before, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ouerturned: which <hi>Amphialus</hi> perceauing, with rayne and spurre put forth his horse; and withall gaue a mightie blow in the descent of his horse, vpon the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> of the forsaken Knight; from whence sliding, it fell vpon the necke of his horse, so as horse and man fell to the ground: but he was scarce downe before he was vp on his feete againe, with braue gesture shewing rising of corage, in the falling of fortune. But the curteous <hi>Amphialus</hi> excused himselfe, for hauing (against his will) kild his horse. Excuse thy selfe for viler faults (answered the forsaken Knight) and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> vse this poore aduantage the best thou canst; for thou shalt quickly finde thou hast neede of more. Thy folly (said <hi>Amphialus</hi>) shall not make me forget my selfe: and therewith (trotting a little aside) alighted from his horse, because he would not haue fortune come to claime any part of the victory. Which curteous act would haue mollified the noble harte of the forsaken Knight, if any other had done it,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> besides the Iaylor of his mistres: but that was a sufficient defeazaunce for the firmest bond of good nature; and therefore he was no sooner alighted, but that he
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:12151:155"/>
ranne vnto him, re-entring into as cruell a fight, as eye did euer see, or thought could reasonably imagine; farre beyond the reach of weak words to bee able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it. For what they had done on horsebacke, was but as a morsell to keep their stomakes in appetite, in comparison of that, which now (being themselues) they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> did. Nor euer glutton by the change of daintie diet could be brought to fresh fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (when he might haue bene satisfied before) with more earnestnes, then those (by the change of their maner of fight) fell cleane to a new fight, though any else would haue thought they had had their fil alredy. <hi>Amphialus</hi> being the taller ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the most part stood with his right legge before; his shield at the vtterm ost length of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> his arme; his sworde hie, but with the point toward his enemy. But when he strake, which came so thick, as if euery blow would striue to be foremost, his arme seemed still a postillion of death. The forsaken Knight shewed with like skill, vnlike gesture, keeping himselfe in continuall motion, proportioning the distance betweene them to any thing that <hi>Amphialus</hi> attempted: his eye guided his foote, and his foote con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> his hand; and since nature had made him something the lower of the two, he made art follow, and not striue with nature: shunning rather then warding his blowes; like a cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning mastiffe, who knowes the sharpnes of the horne &amp; strength of the Bull; fights low to get his proper aduantage; answering mightines with nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes, and yet at times imploying his wonderfull force, wherein he was second to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> none. In summe, the blowes were stronge, the thrusts thicke, and the auoydinges cunning. But the forsaken Knight (that thought it a degree of being conquered to belong in conquering) strake him so mightie a blowe, that he made <hi>Amphialus</hi> put knee to the grounde, without any humblenes. But when hee felt himselfe striken downe, and saw himselfe striken downe by his riuall, then shame seemed one arme, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> and disdaine another; fury in his eyes, and reuenge in his harte; skill and force gaue place, and they tooke the place of skill and force: with so vnweariable a manner, that the forsaken Knight also was driuen to leaue the sterne of cunning, &amp; giue himselfe wholly to be guided by the storme of fury: there being in both (because hate would not suffer admiration) extreame disdaine to finde themselues so matched.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> What (said <hi>Amphialus</hi> to himselfe) am I <hi>Amphialus,</hi> before whom so many mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Gyantes haue falne dead, when I onely sought causelesse aduentures? and can one Knight now withstand me in the presence of <hi>Philoclea,</hi> and fighting for <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea</hi>? or since I lost my liberty, haue I lost my courag? haue I gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hart of a slaue, as wel as the fortu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e?

O beast, on man resists thee: thy riual resists thee or am I indeed <hi>Amphialus</hi>? haue not passions kild him, and wretched I (I know not how) succeeded into his place? Of the other side the forsaken Knight with no lesse spite, fell out with himselfe; Hast thou broken (saide hee to himselfe) the commandement of thy onely Princesse to come now into her presence, and in her presence to proue thy selfe a coward?

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12151:156"/>So was the forsaken Knight (layed vpon clokes) carried home to the campe. But his two friends knowing his earnest desire not to be knowen, couering him from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bodies eyes, conueyed him to their owne tente: <hi>Basilius</hi> himselfe conquering his earnest desire to see him, with feare to displease him, who had fought so notably in his quarrell. But Fame set the honour vpon his backe, which he would not suffer to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> shine in his face: no mans mouth being barrein of prayses to the noble Knight, that had bettered the most esteemed Knight in the worlde: euery bodie praying for his life, and thinking that therein they prayed for themselues. But hee himselfe, when by the diligent care of friends, and well applied cunning of surgeons, he came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe againe the league betweene his minde and body; then fell he to a freshe warre <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> with his owne thoughts, wrongfully condemning his manhood, laying cowardise to himselfe, whome the impudentest backbiter would not so haue wronged. For his courage (vsed to vse victory as an inheritaunce) coulde brooke no resistance at any time: but now that hee had promised him selfe not onely the conquest of him, but the scaling of the walles, and deliuery of <hi>Pamela,</hi> though he had done beyond all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> expectation, yet so short was he of his owne; that hee hated to looke vpon the Sunne, that had seene him doo so weakely: and so much abhorred all visitation or honour, whereof he thought him selfe vnworthy, that hee besought his two noble friends to carrie him away to a castle not far of, where he might cure his woundes, and neuer bee knowne till he made successe excuse this (as he thought) want in him.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> They louingly obeyed him, leauing <hi>Basilius</hi> and all the campe very sorrie for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of these three vnknowne Knights, in whose prowesse they had reposed greatest trust of victory.</p>
            <p>But they being gone, <hi>Basilius</hi> and <hi>Philanax</hi> gaue good order to the strengthning of the siege, fortifying themselues, so as they feared no more any such suddaine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> as that of <hi>Anaxius.</hi> And they within (by reason of <hi>Anaxius</hi> hurt, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of <hi>Amphialus</hi>-is) gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues only to diligent watch &amp; ward, making no sallies out, but committing the principall trust to <hi>Zoilus</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus.</hi> For <hi>Anaxius</hi> was yet forced to keepe his chamber. And as for <hi>Amphialus,</hi> his body had such wounds, and he gaue such wounds to his minde; as easily it coulde not bee determined, whether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> death or he made the greater haste one to the other: for when the diligent care of cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning surgeons had brought life to the possession of his owne right, Sorrowe and Shame (like two corrupted seruaunts) came waiting of it, perswading nothing but the giuing ouer of itselfe to destruction. They laide before his eyes his present case, painting euery piece of it in moste ougly colours: they shewed him his loue wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> in dispaire, his fame blotted by ouerthrow; so that if before he languished, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could not obtaine his desiring, hee now lamented because he durst not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the obtaining. Recreant <hi>Amphialus,</hi> (would hee say to him selfe) how darest thou intitle thy selfe the louer of <hi>Philoclea,</hi> that hast neither shewed thy selfe a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full coward, nor a valiant rebell, but both rebellious and cowardly, which no lawe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> can quite, nor grace haue pittie of? Alas life, what little pleasure thou doost me, to giue me nothing but sense of reproach, and exercise of ruine? I would sweete <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea,</hi> I had died, before thy eyes had seene my weakenes: &amp; then perchaunce with some sigh thou wouldest haue confessed, thou hadst lost a worthy seruant. But nowe, caitife that I am, what euer I haue donne, serues but to builde vp <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> my riuals glory. To these speeches he would couple such gestures of vexation, and
<pb facs="tcp:12151:156"/>
would fortifie the gestures with such effects of furie, as sometimes offring to teare vp his wounds, sometimes to refuse the sustenance of meat, and counsell of phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that his perplexed mother was driuen to make him by force to be tended, with extreame corsey to her selfe, and annoiance to him: till in the ende he was conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to promise her, he would attempt no violence vpon himselfe, vpon condition he might be troubled by no body, but onely his Phisitions: his melancholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing all company, so as not the very surgeons nor seruants durst speake vnto him in doing him seruice: only he had praied his mother, as she tendered his life, she would procure him grace; and that without that, she would neuer come at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> him more.</p>
            <p>His mother, who had confined all her loue only vnto him, set only such about him, as were absolutely at her commandement, whome she forbad to let him knowe any thing that passed in the castle, till his woundes were cured, but as she from time to time should instruct them: she (for her selfe) being resolued, nowe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> she had the gouernment of all things in her owne handes, to satisfie her sonnes loue, by their yeelding, or satisfie her owne reuenge in their punishment. Yet first, because she would be the freer from outward force, she sent a messenger to the campe, to denounce vnto <hi>Basilius,</hi> that if he did not presently raise his siege, she would cause the heads of the three Ladies, prisoners, to be cut off before his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> eyes. And to make him the more feare a present performance, she caused his two daughters and <hi>Zelmane</hi> to be led vnto the walls, where she had made a scaffold, easie to be seene by <hi>Basilius:</hi> and there caused them to be kept, as ready for the slaughter, till answere came from <hi>Basilius.</hi> A sight full of pittie it was, to see those three (all excelling in all those excellencies, wherewith Nature can beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> any body: <hi>Pamela</hi> giuing sweetnes to maiesty, <hi>Philoclea</hi> enriching noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with humblenes, <hi>Zelmane</hi> setting in womanly beautie manlike valour) to be thus subiected to the basest iniury of vniust Fortune. One might see in <hi>Pamela</hi> a willingnesse to dye, rather then to haue life at others discretion, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a princely disdaine would sparkle out of her Princely eyes, that it should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> be in others power to force her to dye. In <hi>Philoclea</hi> a pretie feare came vp, to endamaske her rosie cheekes: but it was such a feare, as rather seemed a kindly childe to her innate humblenes, then any other dismayednes: or if she were dismayed, it was more for <hi>Zelmane,</hi> then for her selfe; or if more for her selfe, it was because <hi>Zelmane</hi> should loose her. As for <hi>Zelmane,</hi> as she went with her hands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> bound (for they durst not aduenture on her well knowne valour, especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a people which perchance might be moued by such a spectacle to some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolte) she was the true image of ouermaistred courage, and of spite, that sees no remedie. For her breast swelled withall, the bloud burst out at her nose, and she looked paler then accustomed, with her eies cast on the ground, with such a grace, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> as if she were fallen out with the heauens, for suffering such an iniury. The lookers on were so moued withall, as they misliked what themselues did, and yet still did what themselues misliked. For some, glad to rid themselues of the dangerous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance of this siege, some willing to shorten the way to <hi>Amphialus</hi>-his succession (whereon they were dependents) some, and the greatest some, doing because o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> did, and suffring because none durst begin to hinder, did in this sort set their hands to this (in their owne conscience) wicked enterprise.</p>
            <p>But when this message was brought to <hi>Basilius,</hi> and that this pittifull preparation
<pb facs="tcp:12151:157"/>
was a sufficient letter of credit for him to beleeue it, hee called vnto him his chiefe councelors: among which, those he chiefly trusted were <hi>Philanax</hi> &amp; <hi>Kalander</hi> (late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to the campe at <hi>Basilius</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, and in him selfe wery of his solitary life, wanting his sons presence, &amp; neuer hauing heard from his beloued guestes since they parted from him). Now in this doubt what he should do, he willed <hi>Kalander</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> giue him his aduise: who spake much to this purpose. You commaund me Sir (said he) to speake, rather because you will keepe your wonted graue, and noble manner, to do nothing of importance without cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, then that in this cause (which indeed hath but one way) your mind needs to haue any councell: so as my speech shall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be to confirme what you haue alredy determined then to argue against any pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibillitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> of other determination. For what sophistical scholler can find any question in this, whether you will haue your incomparable daughters liue, or dye? whether since you be here to cause their deliuerance, you wil make your being here the cause of their destruction? for nothing can bee more vnsensible, then to thinke what one doth, and to forget the end why it is done. Do therfore as I am sure you meane to do,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> remoue the siege, and after seeke by practise, or other gentle meanes, to recouer that which by force you cannot: and therof is indeed (when it please you) more counsel to be taken. Once, in extremities the winning of time is the purchase of life, &amp; worse by no meanes then their deaths can befal vnto you. A man might vse more words, if it were to any purpose to guild gold, or that I had any cause to doubt of your mind:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> But you are wise, and are a father. He said no more, for he durst not attempt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the marrying of his daughter to <hi>Amphialus,</hi> but left that to bring in at another consultation. But <hi>Basilius</hi> made signe to <hi>Philanax,</hi> who standing a while in a maze as inwardly perplexed, at last thus deliuered his opinion.</p>
            <p>If euer I could wish my faith vntried, &amp; my counsell vntrusted, it should be at this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in truth I must confesse I would be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to purchase silence with discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. But since you command, I obey: onely let me say thus much, that I obey not to these excellent Ladies father, but to my Prince: &amp; a Prince it is to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I giue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel. Therefore as to a Prince I say, that the graue &amp; (I well know) true-minded counsell of my Lord <hi>Kalander</hi> had come in good time when you first tooke armes, before all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> your subiects gate notice of your intention, before so much blood was spent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were driuen to seeke this shift for their last remedy. But if nowe, this force you away, why did you take armes? since you might be sure when euer they were in extremitie they would haue recourse to this threatning? and for a wise man to take in hand that which his enimy may with a word ouerthrow, hath in my conceit great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> incongruity, and as great not to forethinke what his enemy in reason will doo. But they threaten they wil kil your daughters. What if they promised you if you remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued your siege, they would honorably send home your daughters? would you bee angled by their promises? truly no more ought you be terrified by their threatnings. For yet of the two, promise binds faith more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> threatning. But indeed a Prince of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> iudgement ought not to consider what his enimies promise, or threaten, but what the promisers and threatners in reason wil do: and the neerest coniecture thereunto, is what is best for their owne behoofe to do. They threaten if you remoue not, they wil kil your daughters, and if you doo remoue, what surety haue you, but that they will kil them, since if the purpose be to cut off all impediments of <hi>Amphialus</hi>-his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> the same cause will continue when you are away; and so much the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coraged, as the reuenging power is absent, and they haue the more oportunitie to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12151:157"/>
draw their factious friends about them: but if it be for their security onely, the same cause will bring forth the same effect: and for their security they will preserue them. But it may be said, no man knows what desperate folks wil do: it is true, and as true that no reason nor policie can preuent what desperate folks wil do: &amp; therfore they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> are among those dangers, which wisdome is not to recken.
<q>Only let it suffice to take away their despaire, which may be by granting pardon for what is past; so as the Ladies may be freely deliuered. And let them that are your subiects, trust you that are their Prince: doo not you subiect your selfe to trust them, who are so vntrusty as to be manifest traitors.</q>
For if they finde you so base-minded, as by their threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> to remoue your force, what indignitie is it, that they would not bring you vnto, still by the same threatning? since then if Loue stir them, loue will keep them from murthering what they loue; and if Ambition prouoke them, ambitious they will be, when you are away, as well as while you are here: take not away your force, which bars not the one, and bridels the other. For as for their shewes and words <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> they are but feare-babes, not worthy once to moue a worthy mans conceit; which must still consider what in reason they are like to do. Their despaire I grant you shall do well to preuent, which as it is the last of all resolutions, so no man fals" into it, while so good a way as you may offer, is open vnto them.
<q>In sum, you are a Prince, and a father of a people, who ought with the eye of wisdome, the hand of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> fortitude, and the hart of iustice to set downe all priuate conceits, in comparison of what for the publike is profitable.</q>

            <p>He would haue proceeded on, when <hi>Gynecia</hi> came running in amazed for her daughter <hi>Pamela,</hi> but mad for <hi>Zelmane:</hi> and falling at <hi>Basilius</hi> feet, besought him to make no delay: vsing such gestures of compassion in steed of stopped words, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
               <hi>Basilius,</hi> otherwise enough tender minded, easily granted to raise the siege, which he saw dangerous to his daughters: but indeed more carefull for <hi>Zelmane,</hi> by whose besieged person, the poore old man was streightly besieged: so as to rid him of the famine of his mind, he went in speed away, discharging his souldiors: only leauing the authority, as before, in <hi>Philanaxis</hi> hands, he himselfe went with <hi>Gynecia</hi> to a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> strong Castle of his, where he tooke counsell how first to deliuer <hi>Zelmane,</hi> whom he called the poore stranger, as though onely Law of hospitalitie moued him, and for that purpose sent diuers messengers to trafficke with <hi>Cecropia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But she by this meanes rid of the present daunger of the siege (desiring <hi>Zoilus</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> to take the care, till their brother recouered, of reuictualling, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> the Citie, both with men and what els wanted, against any new occasion should vrge them, she her selfe disdaining to harken to <hi>Basilius,</hi> without he would grant his daughter in mariage to her son, which by no means he would be brought vnto) bent all the sharpenesse of her malicious wit, how to bring a comfortable graunt to her sonne, whereupon she well found no lesse then his life depended. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Therfore for a while she atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted all meanes of eloquent praying, &amp; flattering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, mingling sometimes gifts, somtimes threatnings, as she had cause to hope, that either open force, or vndermining, would best win the castle of their Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And euer as much as she did to <hi>Philoclea,</hi> so much did she to <hi>Pamela,</hi> though in manner sometimes differing, as she found fit to leuell at the ones noble height, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> and the others sweet lowlinesse. For though she knew her sonnes harte had wholly giuen it selfe to <hi>Philoclea,</hi> yet seeing the equall gifts in <hi>Pamela,</hi> she hoped, a faire grant would recouer the sorrow of a faire refusall: cruelly entending the present
<pb facs="tcp:12151:158"/>
impoysoning the one, as soone as the others affection were purchased.</p>
            <p>But in vaine was all her vaine oratory employed. <hi>Pamelaes</hi> determination was built vpon so braue a Rock, that no shot of hers could reach vnto it: and <hi>Philoclea</hi> (though humbly seated) was so inuironed with sweete riuers of cleere vertue, as could neither be battred, nor vndermined: her witty perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had wise answers; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> her eloquence recompenced with sweetnes; her threatnings repelled with disdaine in the one, and patience in the other; her gifts either not accepted, or accepted to obey, but not to binde. So as <hi>Cecropia</hi> in nature violent; cruell, because ambitious; hatefull, for old rooted grudge to their mother, and now spitefull because she could not preuaile with girles, as she counted them; lastly, drawne on by her loue to her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> son, and held vp by a tyrannicall authoritie, forthwith followed the byas of her own crooked disposition, and doubling and redoubling her threatnings, fell to confirme some of her threatned effects: first withdrawing all comfort, both of seruants, &amp; ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice from them. But that those excellent Ladies had bene vsed vnto, euen at home, and then found in themselues how much good the hardnes of education doth to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the resistance of misery. Then dishonorably vsing them both in dyet, and lodging, by a contempt to pull downe their thoughts to yeelding. But as before, the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of a prison had disgraced all ornaments, so now the same consideration made them attend al diseasefulnes. Then stil, as she found those not preuaile, would she go forward with giuing them terrors, sometimes with noices of horror, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> with suddaine frightings in the night, when the solitary darkenesse thereof might easier astonish the disarmed senses. But to all Vertue, and Loue resisted, strengthned one by the other, when each found itselfe ouer-vehemently assaulted. <hi>Cecropia</hi> still sweetning her fiercenesses with faire promises, if they would promise faire; that feeling euill, and seeing a way far better, their mindes might the sooner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> be mollified. But they that could not taste her behauiour, when it was pleasing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, could worse now, when they had lost all taste by her iniuries.</p>
            <p>She resoluing all extremities, rather then faile of conquest, pursued on her rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged way: letting no day passe, without new and new perplexing the poore Ladies minds, and troubling their bodies: and still swelling, the more she was stopped,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and growing hot with her owne doings, at length, abhominable rage carried her to absolute tyrannies, so that taking with her certaine olde women (of wicked dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and apt for enuie-sake to be cruell to youth and beautie) with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance impoisoned with malice, flew to the sweet <hi>Philoclea,</hi> as if so many Kites should come about a white Doue, and matching viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t gestures with mischieuous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> threatnings, she hauing a rod in her hand (like a fury that should carry wood to the burning of <hi>Dianas</hi> temple) fell to scourge that most beautifull body: Loue in vaine holding the shield of Beautie against her blind cruelty. The Son drew clouds vp to hide his face fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so pitifull a sight; and the very stone walls did yeeld drops of sweate for agonie of such a mischiefe: each senselesse thing had sense of pittie; onely they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> that had sense, were senseles. Vertue rarely found her worldly weakenes more, then by the oppression of that day: and weeping <hi>Cupid</hi> told his weeping mother, that he was sorie he was not deafe, as well as blind, that he might neuer know so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable a worke. <hi>Philoclea,</hi> with tearefull eyes, and sobbing breast (as soone as her wearines rather then compassion, gaue her respite) kneeled down to <hi>Cecropia,</hi> &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> pittie in her face honourable, and torment delightfull, besought her, since she hated her (for what cause she tooke God to witnesse she knew not) that she would at
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12151:158"/>
once take away her life, and not please her selfe with the tormenting of a poore Gentlewoman. If (said she) the common course of humanitie cannot moue you, nor the hauing me in your owne walles, cannot claime pittie: nor womanlie mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, nor neere alliance, nor remembrance (how miserable so euer now) that I am a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Princes daughter; yet let the loue (you haue often tolde me) your sonne beares me, so much procure, that for his sake, one death may be thought inough for me; I haue not liued so many yeares, but that one death may be able to conclude them: neither haue my faults, I hope, bene so many, but that one death may satisfie them. It is no great suite to an enemie, when but death is desired. I craue but that, and as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> for the graunting your request, know for certaine you lose your labours, being euery day furtherof-minded from becomming his wife, who vseth me like a slaue. But that in stead of getting grace, renued againe <hi>Cecropias</hi> fury: so that (excellent creature) she was newly againe tormented by those hellish monsters: <hi>Cecropia</hi> vsing no other words, but that she was a proud and vngratefull wench: and that she <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> would teach her to know her owne good, since of her selfe she would not conceaue it. So that with silence and patience (like a faire gorgeous armour, hammered vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon by an ilfauoured Smith) she abode their pittiles dealing with her: till, rather reseruing her for more, then meaning to end, they left her to an vncomfortable leysure, to consider with her selfe her fortune; both helplesse her selfe, being a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and hopelesse, since <hi>Zelmane</hi> was a prisoner: who therein onely was short of the bottome of miserie, that she knew not how vnworthilie her Angell, by these deuils was abused: but wanted (God wot) no stings of griefe, when those words did but strike vpon her hart, that <hi>Philoclea</hi> was a captiue, and she not able to succour her. For well she knew the confidence <hi>Philoclea</hi> had in her, and well she knew, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> had cause to haue confidence: and all troden vnder foot by the wheele of senselesse Fortune. Yet if there be that imperious power in the soule, as it can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer knowledge to another, without bodilie organs; so vehement were the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of their spirites, as one mette with other, though themselues perceaued it not, but onely thought it to be the doubling of their owne louing fancies. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> that was the onely worldly thing, whereon <hi>Philoclea</hi> rested her minde, that she knewe she should die beloued of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> and should die, rather then be false to <hi>Zelmane.</hi> And so this most daintie Nimphe, easing the paine of her minde with thinking of anothers paine; and almost forgetting the paine of her bodie, through the paine of her minde, she wasted, euen longing for the conclusion of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> her tedious tragedie.</p>
            <p>But for a while she was vnuisited, <hi>Cecropia</hi> employing her time in vsing the like crueltie vpon <hi>Pamela,</hi> her harte growing not onely to desire the fruite of punishing them, but euen to delight in the punishing them. But if euer the beames of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection shined through the clowdes of affliction, if euer Vertue tooke a bodie to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> shewe his (els vnconceaueable) beautie, it was in <hi>Pamela.</hi> For when Reason taught her there was no resistance, (for to iust resistance first her harte was encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) then with so heauenly a quietnes, and so gracefull a calmenes, did she suffer the diuers kindes of torments they vsed to her, that while they vexed her faire bodie, it seemed, that she rather directed, then obeyed the vexation. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> when <hi>Cecropia</hi> ended, and asked whether her harte woulde yeelde: she a little smiled, but such a smiling as shewed no loue, and yet could not but be louelie. And then, Beastlie woman (sayde shee) followe on, doo what thou wilte,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:159"/>
and canst vpon me: for I know thy power is not vnlimited. Thou maist well wracke this sillie bodie, but me thou canst neuer ouerthrowe. For my part, I will not doo the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the pleasure to desire death of thee: but assure thy selfe, both my life and death, shall triumph with honour, laying shame vpon thy detestable tyranny.</p>
            <p>And so, in effect, conquering their doing with her suffering, while <hi>Cecropia</hi> tried <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> as many sorts of paines, as might rather vexe them, then spoyle them (for that she would not do while she were in any hope to winne either of them for her sonne) <hi>Pamela</hi> remained almost as much content with triall in her selfe, what vertue could doo, as grieued with the miserie wherein she found her selfe plunged: only some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times her thoughts softned in her, when with open wings they flew to <hi>Musidorus.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> For then she would thinke with her selfe, how grieuously <hi>Musidorus</hi> would take this her miserie; and she, that wept not for herselfe, wept yet <hi>Musidorus</hi> teares, which he would weepe for her. For gentle Loue did easlier yeeld to lamentation, then the constancy of vertue would els admitte. Then would she remember the case wherein she had left her poore shepheard, and she that wished death for her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> selfe, feared death for him; and she that condemned in her selfe the feeblenes of sorrow, yet thought it great reason to be sory for his sorow: and she that long had prayed for the vertuous ioyning themselues together, now thinking to die herselfe, hartely prayed, that long time their fortunes might be seperated. Liue long my <hi>Musidorus</hi> (would she say) and let my name liue in thy mouth; in thy harte my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> memorie. Liue long, that thou mayst loue long the chast loue of thy dead <hi>Pamela.</hi> Then would she wish to her selfe, that no other woman might euer possesse his hart: and yet scarcely the wish was made a wish, when her selfe would finde fault with it, as being too vniust, that so excellent a man should be banished from the comfort of life. Then would she fortifie her resolution, with bethinking the worst,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> taking the counsell of vertue, and comfort of loue.</p>
            <p>So these diamonds of the world whom Nature had made to be preciously set in the eyes of men, to be the chiefe workes of her workemanship, the chiefe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the worlde, and Princesses of felicitie, by rebellious iniury were brought to the vttermost distres that an enemies hart could wish, or a womans spite inuent:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> 
               <hi>Cecropia</hi> dayly in one or other sorte punishing them, still with her euill torments giuing them feare of worse, making the feare it selfe the sorest torment of all; that in the ende wearie of their bodies, they should be content to bestow them at her appointment. But as in labour, the more one doth exercise it, the more by the doing one is enhabled to doo; strength growing vpon the worke, so as what at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> first would haue seemed impossible, after growes easie: so these Princesses second to none, and far from any second, only to be matched by themselues, with the vse of suffering their minds gat the habit of suffring so, as all feares and terrors were to them but summons to a battaile, whereof they knew before hand they would be victorious, and which in the suffering was painfull, being suffered, was a trophe to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> it selfe: whereby <hi>Cecropia</hi> found her selfe still farder off: for where at first she might perchance haue perswaded them to haue visited her sonne, and haue giuen him some comforte in his sicknesse, drawing neere to the confines of Deaths kingdome, now they protested, that they would neuer otherwise speake to him, then as to the enemy, of most vniust cruelty towards them, that any time or place could euer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> make them knowe.</p>
            <p>This made the poison swell in her cankred brest, perceiuing that (as in water)
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:12151:159"/>
the more she grasped the lesse she held: but yet now hauing run so long the way of rigour, it was too late in reason, and too contrary to her passion, to returne to a course of meekenesse. And therefore (taking counsell of one of her olde associates who so far excelled in wickednesse, as that she had not onely lost all feeling of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> but had gotten a very glory in euill) in the ende they determined, that beating, and other such sharp dealing did not so much pull downe a womans hart, as it bred anger, and that nothing was more enemy to yeelding, then anger; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their tender harts take on the armour of obstinacy: (for thus did their wicked mindes blinde to the light of vertue, and owly eied in the night of wickednes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> of it) and that therefore that was no more to be tried. And for feare of death (which no question would doo most with them) they had bene so often threatned, as they began to be familiarly acquainted with it, and learned to esteeme threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning words to be but words. Therefore the last, but best way now was, that the one seeing indeede the others death, should perceiue, there was no dallying meant: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> then there was no doubt, that a womans soule would do much, rather then leaue so beautifull a body.</p>
            <p>This being concluded, <hi>Cecropia</hi> went to <hi>Philoclea,</hi> and tolde her, that now she was to come to the last part of the play: for her part, though she found her hard harted obstinacie such, that neither the sweetnesse of louing meanes, nor the force of hard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> meanes could preuaile with her, yet before she would passe to a further degree of extremity; she had sought to win her sister; in hope, that her sonne might be with time satisfied with the loue of so faire a Lady: but finding her also rather more then lesse wilfull, she was now minded that one of their deathes should serue for an example to the other, that despising worthy folks was more hurtfull to the despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> then the despised: that yet because her sonne especially affected her, and that" in her owne selfe she was more inclinable to pittie her, then she had deserued, she would begin with her sister; who that afternoone should haue her head cut off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her face; if in the meane time one of them, did not pull out their il-wrought stiches of vnkindnes, she bad her looke for no other, nor longer time then she told <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> her. There was no assault giuen to the sweet <hi>Philocleas</hi> minde, that entered so far, as this: for where to all paines and daungers of her selfe, foresight with (his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Resolution) had made ready defence; now with the loue she bare her sister, she was driuen to a stay, before she determined: but long she staied not, before this reason did shine vnto her, that since in herselfe she preferred death before such a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> base seruitude, loue did teach her to wish the same to her sister. Therefore crossing her armes, and looking side-ward vpon the ground, Do what you will (said she) with vs: for my part, heauen shall melt before I be remoued. But if you will follow my counsell, for your owne sake (for as for praiers for my sake I haue felt how little they preuaile) let my death first serue for example to win her, who perchaunce is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> not so resolued against <hi>Amphialus,</hi> and so shall you not onely iustly punish mee (who indeede doo hate both you and your sonne) but, if that may mooue you, you shall doo more vertuously in preseruing one most worthy of life, and killing an other most desirous of death: lastly in winning her, in steed of a peeuish vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie creature, that I am, you shall blesse your sonne with the most excellent woman <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> in all praise-worthy things, that the world holdeth. But <hi>Cecropia,</hi> (who had already set downe to her selfe what she would do) with bitter both termes, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, told her, that she should not neede to woo death ouer-egerly: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or if her sister
<pb facs="tcp:12151:160"/>
going before her did not teach her wit, her selfe should quickly follow. For since they were not to be gotten, there was no way for her sonnes quiet, but to knowe, that they were past getting. And so since no intreating, nor threatning might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle, she bad her prepare her eies for a new play, which she should see within fewe houres in the hall of that castle.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
            </p>
            <p>A place indeed ouerfit for so vnfit a matter: for being so stately made that the bottome of it being euen with the ground, the roofe reached as hie as any part of the castle, at either ende it had conuenient lodgings. In the one ende was (one storie from the ground) <hi>Philocleas</hi> abode, in the other of euen height, <hi>Pamelas,</hi> and <hi>Zelmanes</hi> in a chamber aboue her: but all so vaulted of strong, and thickly built <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> stone, as one could no way heare the other: each of these chambers had a litle windowe to looke into the hall, but because the sisters should not haue so much comforte, as to looke one to another, there was (of the outsides) curtaynes drawne, which they could not reach with their hands, so barring the reach of their sight. But when the houre came that the Tragedie should beginne, the curtaynes were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> withdrawen from before the windowes of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> and of <hi>Philoclea:</hi> a sufficient challenge to call their eyes to defende themselues in such an incounter. And by and by came in at one ende of the hall, with about a dozen armed souldiers a Ladie, led by a couple, with her handes bounde before her: from aboue her eyes to her lippes muffled with a faire kerchiefe, but from her mouth to the shoulders all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> bare: and so was led on to a scaffold raised a good deale from the floore, and all couered with crimsin veluet. But neither <hi>Zelmane,</hi> nor <hi>Philoclea</hi> needed to be tolde who she was: for the apparell she ware made them too well assured, that it was the admirable <hi>Pamela.</hi> Whereunto the rare whitenesse of her naked necke gaue suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent testimonie to their astonnished senses. But the fayre Ladie being come to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> scaffold, and then made to kneele downe, and so lefte by her vnkinde suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as it seemed that she was about to speake somewhat (whereunto <hi>Philoclea,</hi> poore soule, earnestly listned, according to her speach euen minding to frame her minde, her harte neuer till then almost wauering to saue her sisters life) before the vnfortunate Ladie could pronounce three wordes, the executioner cut off the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ones speech, and the others attention, with making his sworde doo his cruell office vpon that beautifull necke. Yet the pittilesse sworde had such pittie of so pretious an obiect, that at first it did but hit flat long. But little auailed that, since the Ladie falling downe astonnished withall, the cruell villayne forced the sworde with another blowe to diuorce the faire marriage of the head and body.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>
            </p>
            <p>And this was done so in an instant, that the very act did ouerrun <hi>Philocleas</hi> sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row (sorrow not being able so quickly to thunderbolt her harte thorough her sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but first onely opprest her with a storme of amazement) but when her eies sawe that they did see, as condemning themselues to haue seene it, they became weary of their owne power of seeing: and her soule then drinking vp woe with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> great draughts, she fell downe to deadly traunces: but her waiting iaylors with cruell pitty brought lothed life vnto her; which yet many times tooke his leaue as though he would indeed depart: but when he was staied by force, he kept with him deadly Sorrow, which thus exercised her mourning speech. <hi>Pamela</hi> my sister, my sister <hi>Pamela,</hi> woe is me for thee, I would I had died for thee. <hi>Pamela</hi> neuer more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> shall I see thee: neuer more shall I enioy thy sweet companie, and wise counsell.

O my God, And with that she fell againe in a soune, so as it was a great while before they could bring her to her selfe againe; but being come to her-selfe, Alas (said she) vnkind women, since you haue giuen me so many deathes, torment me not now with life: for Gods sake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> let me goe, and excuse your hands of more blood. Let me follow my <hi>Pamela,</hi> whom euer I sought to follow. Alas <hi>Pamela,</hi> they will not let me come to thee. But if they keepe promise, I shall treade thine owne steppes after thee.

But ô that a thousand more miseries had chanced vnto me, so thou haddest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> not dyed: <hi>Pamela,</hi> my sister <hi>Pamela.</hi> And so, like lamentable <hi>Philomela</hi> complained she the horrible wrong done to her sister, which if it stird not in the wickedly closed minds of her tormentors, a pittie of her sorrow, yet bredde it a wearinesse of her sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: so as onely leauing one to preuent any harme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Philoclea.</hi> For there being such vehemencie of friendship between them, it was most likely both to moue <hi>Zelmane</hi> to perswade, and <hi>Philoclea</hi> to be perswaded, <hi>Cecropia</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked well of the counsell, and gaue order to the same woman to go deale therin with <hi>Zelmane,</hi> and to assure her with othe, that <hi>Cecropia</hi> was determined <hi>Philoclea</hi> should passe the same way that <hi>Pamela</hi> had done, without she did yeeld to satisfie the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> of her sonnes affection: which the woman did, adding thereunto many (as she thought) good reasons to make <hi>Zelmane</hi> thinke <hi>Amphialus</hi> a fit match for <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Zelmane</hi> (who had from time to time vnderstood the cruell dealing they had vsed to the sisters, and now had her own eies wounded with the sight of ones death) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> was so confused withall (her courage still rebelling against her wit, desiring stil with force to doo impossible matters) that as her desire was stopped with power, so her conceit was darkned with a mist of desire.

still would cry out, that it could not bee, <hi>Philoclea</hi> should bee in so miserable estate, and she not relieue her: and so while shee haled her wit to her courage, shee drew it from his owne limits. But nowe <hi>Philocleas</hi> death (a worde able to marshall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll his thoughts in order) being come to so short a point either with small delay to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, or by the giuing her selfe to another to be preuented, she was driuen to thinke,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and to desire some leasure of thinking: which the woman granted for that night vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her. A night that was not halfe so blacke, as her minde; not halfe so silent, as was fit for her musing thoughts. At last, he that would faine haue desperatly lost a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand liues for her sake, could not finde in his harte, that she should loose any life for her owne sake; and he that despised his owne death in respect of honour, yet could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> well nye dispense with honour it selfe in respect of <hi>Philocleas</hi> death: for once the thought could not enter into his harte, nor the breath issue out of his mouth, which could consent to <hi>Philocleas</hi> death for any bargaine. Then how to preuent the next degree to death (which was her being possest by another) was the point of his mindes labour: and in that he founde no other way, but that <hi>Philoclea</hi> shoulde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> a yeelding vnto <hi>Cecropias</hi> request; and so by speaking with <hi>Amphialus,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king faire (but delaying) promises, procure libertie for <hi>Zelmane</hi>; who only wisht but to come by a sword, not doubting then to destroy them all, and deliuer <hi>Philoclea</hi>: so little did both the men, and their forces seeme in her eyes, looking down vpon them from the hye toppe of affections tower.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>With that minde therefore (but first well bound) shee was brought to <hi>Philoclea,</hi> hauing already plotted out in her conceite, how she would deale with her: and so came she with hart and eyes, which did each sacrifice either to Loue vpon the aultar of Sorrow: and there had shee the pleasing displeasing sight of <hi>Philoclea: Philoclea,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alredy the extreame sense of sorrow had brought to a dulnesse therein, her face <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> not without tokens that beautie had bene by many miseries cruelly battered, and yet shewed it most the perfection of that beautie, which coulde remaine vnouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by such enimies. But when <hi>Zelmane</hi> was set downe by her, and the women gone away (because she might be the better perswaded when no body was by, that had heard her say she would not bee perswaded) then began first the eyes to speake,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and the harts to crie out: Sorrow a while would nedees speake his owne language without vsing their tongues to be his interpreters. At last <hi>Zelmane</hi> brake silence, but spake with the onely eloquence of amazement: for all her long methodized orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one was inherited onely by such kinde of speeches. Deare Ladie, in extreame neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities we must not. But alas vnfortunate wretch that I am, that I liue to see this daye.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> And I take heauen and earth to witnesse, that nothing: and with that her brest swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so with spite and griefe, that her breath had not leasure to turne it selfe into words. But the sweet <hi>Philoclea</hi> that had alredie dyed in <hi>Pamela,</hi> &amp; of the other side had the heauines of her hart something quickned in the most beloued sight of <hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> ghessed somewhat at <hi>Zelmanes</hi> mind; and therefore spake vnto her in this sort.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> My <hi>Pyrocles</hi> (saide shee) I knowe this exceeding comfort of your presence, is not brought vnto mee for any good-will that is owned vnto mee: but (as I suppose to make you perswade me to saue my life with the ransome of mine honour: although no bodie shoulde bee so vnfit a pleader in that cause, as your selfe, yet perchance you woulde haue me liue.

            <p>To what purpose my <hi>Pyrocles</hi>?

And why should I do all this? to liue? O <hi>Pamela,</hi> sister <hi>Pamela,</hi> why shoulde I liue? onely for thy sake <hi>Pyrocles</hi> I would liue: but to thee I know too well I shall not liue; and if not to thee, hath thy loue so base allay, my <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> as to wish mee to liue? sor dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, my <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> my simplicitie is such, that I haue hardly bene able to keepe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a straight way; what shall I doo in a crooked? But in this case there is no meane of dissimulation, not for the cunningest: present answere is required, and present per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance vpon the answere. Art thou so terrible, ô Death? No my <hi>Pyrocles</hi>; and for that I doo thanke thee, and in my soule thanke thee; for I confesse the loue of thee is heerein my chiefest vertue. Trouble mee not therefore, deare <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> double not my death by tormenting my resolution: since I cannot liue with thee, I will dye for thee. Onely remember me deare <hi>Pyrocles</hi>; and loue the remembrance of mee: &amp; if I may craue so much of thee, let me be thy last loue, for though I be not worthy of thee (who indeed art the worthiest creature liuing) yet remember that my loue was a worthy loue. But <hi>Pyrocles</hi> was so ouercome with sorrow (which wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and vertue made iust in so excellent a Ladies case, full of so excellent kindnes) that words were ashamed to come forth knowing how weak they were to expresse his mind, and her merit: and therefore so stayed in a deadly silence, forsaken of hope and forsaking comfort: till the appointed gardians came in, to see the fruits of <hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> labour: and then <hi>Zelmane</hi> warned by their presence, fell againe to perswade, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> though scarcely her selfe could tell what; but in sum, desirous of delayes. But <hi>Philoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea</hi> sweetly continuing constant, and in the end punishing her importunity with silence, <hi>Zelmane</hi> was faine to ende. Yet crauing an other times conference, shee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, and diuers others; till at the last <hi>Cecropia</hi> founde it was to no purpose, and therefore determined to follow her owne way. <hi>Zelmane</hi> yet still desirous to win (by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> any meanes) respit, euen wasted with sorrow, and vncertaine, whether in worse case in her presence, or absence, being able to doo nothing for <hi>Philocleas</hi> succour, but by submitting the greatest corage of the earth to fall at the feete of <hi>Cecropia,</hi> and craue stay of their sentence til the vttermost was seene, what her perswasions might doo.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>
               <hi>Cecropia</hi> seemed much to bee moued by her importunitie, so as diuers dayes were wonne of painefull life to the excellent <hi>Philoclea:</hi> while <hi>Zelmane</hi> suffred some hope to cherrish her minde, especially trusting vpon the helpe of <hi>Musidorus,</hi> who (shee knew) woulde not bee idle in this matter, till one morning a noise awaked <hi>Zelmane,</hi> from whose ouer-watchfull mind, the tired body had stolne a little sleep: &amp; streight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> with the first opening of her eyes, Care taking his woonted place, she ranne to the window which looked into the hall (for that way the noise guided her,) and there might shee see (the curtaine being left open euer since the last execution) seuen or eight persons in a cluster vpon the scaffold: who by and by retiring themselues, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge was to bee seene thereupon, but a basan of golde, pittifully enameled with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> bloud, and in the midst of it, the head of the most beautifull <hi>Philoclea.</hi> The horrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the mischiefe was such, as <hi>Pyrocles</hi> coulde not at first beleeue his owne senses, but bent his woefull eyes to discerne it better: where too well hee might see it was
<pb facs="tcp:12151:162"/>
               <hi>Philocleas</hi> selfe, hauing no veile, but beautie, ouer the face, which still appeared to be aliue: so did those eyes shine, euen as they were woont, and they were woont more then any other: and sometimes as they moued, it might well make the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der think, that death therein had borowed her beautie, and not they any way dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced by death: so sweet and pearsing a grace they caried with them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
            </p>
            <p>It was not a pitie, it was not an amazement, it was not a sorrow which then laid hold on <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> but a wilde furie of desperate agonie, so that hee cried out, O ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt heauen, traytor earth, blinde prouidence; no iustice, howe is this done? how is this suffered? hath this worlde a gouernment? If it haue, let it poure out all his mischiefes vpon mee, and see whether it haue power to make mee more wrecthed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> then I am. Did she excell for this? haue I prayed for this? abhominable hande that did it; detestable deuill that commaunded it; cursed light that beheld it: and if the light be cursed, what are then mine eyes that haue seene it? And haue I seene <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea</hi> dead, and doo I liue? and haue I liued, not to helpe her, but to talke of her? and stande I still talking? And with that (caried with the madnes of anguish, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> a redier waye to kill himselfe) hee ranne as hard as euer hee coulde, with his head against the wall, with intention to braine himselfe: but the haste to do it made the doing the slower. For, as hee came to giue the blow, his foot tript, so as it came not with the full force: yet forcible inough to strike him downe; and withall, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue him of his sense, so that he lay a while comforted by the hurt, in that hee felte <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> not his discomfort.</p>
            <p>And when he came againe to himselfe, he heard, or he thought he heard a voice which cried, Reuenge, Reuenge vnto him; whether indeede it were his good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, which vsed that voice to stay him from vnnaturall murdering of himselfe; or that his wandering spirites lighted vpon that conceite, and by their weakenes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> to apprehensions) supposed they heard it. But that indeed, helped with Vertue, and her valiant seruant Anger, stopped him from present destroying himselfe: yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in reason and manhoode, first to destroy, man, woman, and childe, that were any way of kinne to them that were accessarie to this crueltie; then to raze the Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and to builde a sumptuous monument for her sister; and a most sumptuous for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> her selfe, and then, himselfe to die vpon her tomb. This determining in himselfe to do, and to seek all meanes how (for that purpose) to get out of prison: he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent a while to beare the thirst of death: and yet went he againe to the windowe, to kisse the beloued heade with his eies, but there saw hee nothing but the scaffold, all couered ouer with skarlet, &amp; nothing but solitarie silence, to mourn this mischiefe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> But then, Sorrow hauing disperste it selfe from his harte, into all his noble partes, it proclaimed his authoritie, in cries, and teares, and with a more gentle dolefulnes, coulde poure out his inward euill.</p>
            <p>Alas (saide he) and is that head taken away too, so soone from mine eyes? What, mine eyes, perhappes they enuie the excellencie of your sorrowe?

Alas, why should they diuide such a head from such a bodie? no other bodye is worthy of that head; no other head is worthie of that body: O yet, if I had taken my last leaue, if I might haue taken a holie kisse from that dying mouth.

but for some fewe yeares: so as it is time, and this world that seeme so louely things, and not <hi>Philoclea</hi> vnto you.

And truely (said she) I will yet a little longer trouble you.

In truth (said she) you would thinke your selfe a greatly priuiledged person, if since the strongest building, and lastingest monarchies are subiect to ende, onely your <hi>Philoclea</hi> (because she is yours) should be exempted.

            <p>But that the speech put al good manners out of the conceit of <hi>Pyrocles</hi>; in so much, that leaping out of his bed, he ran to haue striken her: but comming neere her (the morning then winning the field of darkenesse) he saw, or hee thought hee sawe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the very face of <hi>Philoclea</hi>; the same sweetenesse, the same grace, the same beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> with which carried into a diuine astonishment, he fell downe at her feete.

            <p>The truth is (said she) my <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> that neither I (as you finde) nor yet my deare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> sister is dead: although the mischieuously suttle <hi>Cecropia</hi> vsed slights to make either of vs thinke so of other. For, hauing in vaine attempted the fardest of her wicked eloquence, to make eyther of vs yeeld to her sonne, and seeing that neither it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with great flatteries, and riche presents, could get any ground of vs, nor yet the violent way she fell into of cruelly tormenting our bodies, could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> with vs; at last, she made either of vs thinke the other dead, and so hoped to haue wrested our mindes to the forgetting of vertue: and first she gaue to mine eyes the miserable spectacle of my sisters (as I thought) death: but indeede it was not my sister: it was onely <hi>Artesia,</hi> she who so cunningly brought vs to this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. Truly I am sory for the poore Gentlewoman, though iustly she be punished <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> for her double falshood: but <hi>Artesia</hi> muffled so, as you could not easily discerne her; and in my sisters apparell (which they had taken from her vnder colour of giuing her other) did they execute: And when I (for thy sake especially deare <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) could by no force, nor feare be won, they assayed the like with my sister, by bringing me downe vnder the scaffolde, and (making me thrust my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> head vp through a hole they had made therein) they did put about my poore necke a dishe of gold, whereout they had beaten the bottome, so as hauing set bloud in it, you sawe how I played the parte of death (God knowes euen willing to haue done it in earnest) and so had they set me, that I reached but on tiptoes to the grounde, so as scarcely I could breathe, much lesse speake: And truely if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> they had kept me there any whit longer, they had strangled me, in steed of behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me: but then they tooke me away, and seeking to see their issue of this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, they found my noble sister (for the deare loue she vouchsafeth to beare me) so grieued withall, that she willed them to doo their vttermost crueltie vnto her: for she vowed, neuer to receiue sustenaunce of them, that had bene the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of my murther: and finding both of vs, euen giuen ouer, not like to liue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny houres longer, and my sister <hi>Pamela,</hi> rather worse then my selfe, (the strength of her harte worse bearing those indignities) the good woman <hi>Cecropia</hi> (with the same pittie as folkes keepe foule, when they are not fatte inough for their eating) made vs knowe her deceipt, and let vs come one to another; with what ioye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> you can well imagine, who I know feele the like; sauing that we only thought our selues reserued to miseries, and therefore fitter for condoling, then congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. For my part, I am fully perswaded, it is but with a little respite, to haue a more feeling sense of the torments she prepares for vs. True it is, that one of my guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians would haue me to beleeue, that this proceedes of my gentle cousin <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus:</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> who hauing heard some inckling that we were euill entreated, had called his mother to his bedside, from whence he neuer rose since his last combat, and besought, and charged her vpon all the loue she bare him, to vse vs with all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: vowing, with all the imprecations he could imagine, that if euer he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood for his sake, that I receiued further hurt then the want of my libertie, hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> would not liue an houre longer. And the good woman sware to me that he would kill his mother, if hee knewe how I had bene dealt with; but that <hi>Cecropia</hi> keepes him from vnderstanding thinges howe they passe, onely hauing heard
<pb facs="tcp:12151:164"/>
a whispering, and my selfe named, he had (of aboundaunce, forsooth, of hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loue) giuen this charge for vs. Whereupon this enlargement of mine was growne: for my parte I know too well their cunning (who leaue no mony vnof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered that may buy mine honour) to beleeue any word they say, but (my deare <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) euen looke for the worste, and prepare my selfe for the same. Yet I must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> confesse, I was content to robbe from death, and borrowe of my misery the sweet comfort of seeing my sweet sister, and most sweete comfort of thee my <hi>Pyrocles.</hi> And so hauing leaue, I came stealing into your chamber: where (O Lord) what a ioy it was vnto me, to heare you solemnise the funerals of the poore <hi>Philoclea?</hi> That I my selfe might liue to heare my death bewailed? and by whom? by my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> deere <hi>Pyrocles.</hi> That I saw death was not strong enough to diuide thy loue from me? O my <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> I am too well paide for my paines I haue suffred: ioyfull is my woe for so noble a cause; and welcome be all miseries, since to thee I am so wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Alas how I pittied to heare thy pittie of me; and yet a great while I could not finde in my hart to interrupt thee, but often had euen pleasure to weepe with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> thee: and so kindly came forth thy lamentations, that they inforced me to lament to, as if indeed I had beene a looker on, to see poore <hi>Philoclea</hi> dye. Till at last I spake with you, to try whether I could remoue thee from sorrow, till I had almost procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my selfe a beating. And with that she pretily smiled, which, mingled with her teares, one could not tell whether it were a mourning pleasure, or a delightfull sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> but like when a few Aprill drops are scattered by a gentle <hi>Zephyrus</hi> among fine coloured flowers. But <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> who had felt (with so small distance of time) in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the ouerthrow both of hope and despaire, knew not to what key he should tune his mind, either of ioy, or sorrow. But finding perfite reason in neither, suffred himself to be caried by the tide of his imagination, and his imaginations to be raised <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> euen by the sway, which hearing or seing, might giue vnto them: he saw her aliue, he was glad to see her aliue: he saw her weep, he was sory to see her weep: he heard her comfortable speches, nothing more gladsome: he hard her prognosticating her own destruction, nothing more dolefull. But when he had a little taken breath from the panting motion of such contrarietie in passions, he fell to consider with her of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> her present estate, both comforting her, that certainely the worst of this storme was past, since alreadie they had done the worst, which mans wit could imagine: and that if they had determined to haue killed her, now they would haue done it: and also earnestly counselling her, and inhabling his counsels with vehement prayers, that she would so far second the hopes of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> as that she might but procure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> him liberty; promising then as much to her, as the liberalitie of louing corage durst promise to himselfe.</p>
            <p>But who would liuely describe the manner of these speeches, should paint out the lightsome coulours of affection, shaded with the deepest shadowes of sorrow, finding then betweene hope and feare, a kind of sweetenes in teares: till <hi>Philoclea</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> content to receaue a kisse, and but a kisse of <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> sealed vp his mouing lips, and closed them vp in comfort: and her-selfe (for the passage was left betweene them open) went to her sister: with whom she had stayed but a while, fortifying one another (while <hi>Philoclea</hi> tempered <hi>Pamelas</hi> iust disdaine, and <hi>Pamela</hi> ennobled <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locleas</hi> sweet humblenesse) when <hi>Amphialus</hi> cam vnto them: who neuer since <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> he had heard <hi>Philoclea</hi> named, could bee quiet in himselfe, although none of them about him (fearing more his mothers violence then his power) would
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:12151:164"/>
discouer what had passed: and many messages he sent to know her estate, which brought answeres backe, according as it pleased <hi>Cecropia</hi> to indite them, till his hart full of vnfortunate affection, more and more misgiuing him, hauing impatiently borne the delay of the nights vnfitnesse, this morning he gat vp, and though full of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> woundes (which not without daunger could suffer such exercise) he apparelled himselfe, and with a countenance, that shewed strength in nothing but in griefe, he came where the sisters were; and weakely kneeling downe, he besought them to pardon him, if they had not bene vsed in that castle according to their worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and his duetie; beginning to excuse small matters, poore Gentleman, not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in what sort they had bene handled.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Pamelaes</hi> hye hart (hauing conceiued mortall hate for the iniurie offred to her and her sister) could scarcely abide his sight, much lesse heare out his excuses; but interrupted him with these words. Traitor (said she) to thine owne blood, and false to the profession of so much loue as thou hast vowed, doo not defile our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> eares with thy excuses; but pursue on thy crueltie, that thou and thy godly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue vsed towards vs: for my part, assure thy selfe, and so do I answere for my sister (whose mind I know) I do not more desire mine owne safetie then thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. Amazed with this speech, he turned his eye, full of humble sorrowfulnes, to <hi>Philoclea.</hi> And is this (most excellent Ladie) your doome of me also? She, sweete <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Ladie, sate weeping: for as her most noble kinsman she had euer fauoured him, and loued his loue, though she could not be in loue with his person; and now partly vnkindnes of his wrong, partly pittie of his case, made her sweete mind yeeld some teares, before she could answere; and her answere was no other, but that she had the same cause as her sister had. He replyed no further, but deliuering from his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> hart two or three (vntaught) sighes, rose, and with most low reuerence went out of their chamber: and streight by threatning torture, learned of one of the women, in what terrible manner those Princesses had bene vsed. But when he heard it, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, O God; and then not able to say any more (for his speech went backe to rebound woe vpon his hart) he needed no iudge to goe vpon him: for no man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> could euer thinke any other worthy of greater punishment, then he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Full therefore of the horriblest despaire, which a most guiltie conscience could breed, with wild lookes promising some terrible issue, vnderstanding his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was vpon the top of the leades, he caught one of his seruants swords from him, and none of them daring to stay him, he went vp, carried by furie, in steede of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> strength; where she was at that time, musing how to goe thorough with this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and resoluing to make much of her Neeces in shew, and secreatly to impoison them; thinking since they were not to be wonne, her sonnes loue would no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise be mitigated.</p>
            <p>But when she sawe him come in with a sworde drawne, and a looke more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> then the sword, she streight was stricken with the guiltines of her owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: yet the wel known humblenes of her sonne somwhat animated her, till he, comming nearer her, and crying to her, Thou damnable creature, onely fit to bring forth such a monster of vnhappines as I am; she fearing he would haue stricken her (though indeed he meant it not, but only intended to kill himselfe in her presence) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> went backe so farre, till ere she were aware, she ouerthrew her selfe from ouer the Leades, to receaue her deathes kisse at the ground: and yet was she not so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie as presentlie to dye, but that she had time with hellish agonie to see her sonnes

This discourse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
               <hi>Lycurgus</hi> vnderstanding of <hi>Helene,</hi> deliuered to his brother, with her vehement desire to see the body, and take her last farewell of him. <hi>Anaxius,</hi> though hee were fallen out with all womankind (in respect of the hate he bare the sisters, whom hee accounted murtherers of <hi>Amphialus</hi>) yet at his brothers request, graunted her leaue. And she (poore Lady) with grieuous expectation, and languishing desire,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> caried her faint legs to the place where he lay, either not breathing, or in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance breathing nothing but death.</p>
            <p>In which pittious plight when she saw him, though Sorow had set before her minde the pittifullest conceit thereof that it could paint, yet the present sight went beyonde all former apprehensions: so that beginning to kneele by the bodie, her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> sight ranne from her seruice, rather then abide such a sight; and she fell in a soune vpon him, as if she could not choose but dye of his wounds. But when her breath (aweary to be closed vp in woe) broke the prison of her faire lippes, and brought memorie (with his seruaunt senses) to his naturall office, she yet made the breath conuey these dolefull wordes with it. Alas (said she) <hi>Amphialus,</hi> what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> strange disasters be these, that hauing sought thee so long, I should be now sorie to finde thee? that these eyes should looke vpon <hi>Amphialus,</hi> and be grieued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? that I should haue thee in my power without glory, and embrace thee without comfort? How often haue I blest the meanes that might bring me neere thee? Now, woe worth the cause that brings me so neere thee. Often, alas, often hast <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> thou disdained my teares: but now, my deare <hi>Amphialus,</hi> receiue them: these eyes can serue for nothing else, but to weepe for thee; since thou wouldest neuer vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe them thy comfort, yet disdaine not them thy sorrow. I would they had bene more deare vnto thee; for then hadst thou liued. Woe is me that thy noble harte could loue who hated thee, and hate who loued thee. Alas, why should not my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> faith to thee couer my other defects, who only sought to make my Crowne thy foote-stoole, my selfe thy seruaunt? that was all my ambition; and alas thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainedst it to serue them, by whom thy incomparable selfe were disdained. Yet (ô <hi>Philoclea</hi>) wheresoeuer you are, pardon me, if I speake in the bitternes of my soule, excellent may you be in all other things (and excellent sure you are since he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> loued you) your want of pittie, where the fault onely was infinitenesse of desert, cannot be excused. I would, O God, I would that you had graunted his deserued suite of marrying you, and that I had bene your seruing-maide, to haue made my estate the foile of your felicitie, so he had liued. How many weary steps haue I trodden after thee, while my onely complaint was, that thou wert vnkinde? Alas <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> I would now thou wert, to be vnkind. Alas why wouldest thou not commaund my seruice, in persuading <hi>Philoclea</hi> to loue thee? who could, or (if euery one could) who would haue recounted thy perfections so well, as I? who with such kindly passions could haue stirred pittie for thee as I? who should haue deliuered not only the wordes, but the teares I had of thee? and so shouldest thou haue exercised thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> disdaine in me, and yet vsed my seruice for thee.</p>

O miserable I, that haue onely fauour by miserie: and then, woulde shee haue returned to a fresh careere of complaints, when an aged and wise Gentleman came to her, and besought her, to remember what was fit for her greatnesse, wisdome, and honour: and with all, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> it was fitter to show her loue, in carying the body to her excellent Surgeon, first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying such excellent medicines as she had receiued of him for that purpose, rather then onely shew her selfe a woman-louer in fruitles lamentations. She was streight warned with the obedience of an ouerthrowen minde, and therefore leauing some surgeons of her owne to dresse the body, went herselfe to <hi>Anaxius,</hi> and humbling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> her selfe to him, as lowe as his owne pride could wish, besought him, that since the surgeons there had vtterly giuen him ouer, that he would let her carie him awaye in her litter with her, since the worst he could haue should bee to die, and to die in her armes that loued him aboue all things; and where he should haue such monuments erected ouer him, as were fit for her loue, and his worthines: beseeching him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> since she was in a country of enemies (where shee trusted more to <hi>Anaxius</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, then <hi>Basilius</hi> promise) that he would conuey them safely out of those territories Her reasons something moued him, but nothinge thoroughly perswaded him, but the last request of his helpe: which he streight promised, warranting all securitie, as long as that sword had his master aliue. She as happy therein as vnhappines coulde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> be (hauing receiued as small comfort of her owne surgeons as of the others) caused yet the body to bee easily conueyed into the litter: all the people then beginning to roare and crie, as though neuer till then they had lost their Lord. And if the terrour of <hi>Anaxius</hi> had not kept them vnder, they would haue mutinied, rather then suffered his bodie to be caried away.</p>

            <p>The generall consort of whose mourning, perfourmed so the naturall tunes of sorrow; that euen to them (if any such were) that felt not the losse, yet others griefe taught them grief; hauing before their compassionate sense so passionate a spectacle, of a young man, of great beautie, beautified with great honour, honoured by great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> valure, made of inestimable value, by the noble vsing of it, to lye there languishing, vnder the arrest of death, and a death, where the manner could be no comfort to the discomfortablenes of the matter. But when the bodie was carried through the gate, and the people (sauing such as were appointed) not suffred to goe further, then was such an vniuersall crie, as if they had all had but one life, and all receaued but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> one below.</p>
            <p>Which so moued <hi>Anaxius</hi> to consider the losse of his friend, that (his mind apter to reuenge, then tendernesse) hee presently giuing order to his brother to keepe the prisoners safe, and vnuisited, till his retourne from conueying <hi>Helen</hi> hee sent a messenger to the sisters, to tell them this curteous message: that at his retourne with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> his owne handes; hee woulde cut off their heades, and sende them for tokens to their father.</p>

But within a while, the excellent <hi>Pamela</hi> had brought her minde againe to his olde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> acquaintance: and then, as carefull for her sister (whom most deerely she loued) Sist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (saide shee) you see how many acts our Tragedy hath: Fortune is not yet a wearie of vexing vs: but what? A shippe is not counted strong for byding one storme?

Yet debating with her selfe of the manner how to preuent it, she continued her musing humour, little saying, or indeede, little finding in her hart to say, in a case of such extremitie, where peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily death was threatned: and so stayed they; hauing yet that comfort, that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> might tarrie togither. <hi>Pamela</hi> nobly, <hi>Philoclea</hi> sweetely, and <hi>Zelmane</hi> sadly, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately none of them entertaining sleep, which they thought should shortly begin neuer to awake.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Anaxius</hi> came home, hauing safely conduct <hi>Helen</hi> and safely hee might well do it: For though many of <hi>Basilius</hi> Knights would haue attempted something <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> vpon <hi>Anaxius,</hi> by that meanes to deliuer the Ladies; yet <hi>Philanax,</hi> hauing receaued his masters commandement, and knowing his word was giuen, would not consent vnto it. And the black-Knight (who by them was able to carry abroad his wounds) did not knowe thereof; but was bringing force, by force to deliuer his Lady. So as <hi>Anaxius,</hi> interpreting it rather feare, then faith, and making euen chance an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> of his vertue, returned: and as soone as hee was returned, with afelon hart cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his brothers vp with him, he went into the chamber, where they were all three togither; with full intention to kill the sisters with his owne handes, and sende their heads for tokens to their father: Though his brothers (who were otherwise encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) disswaded him: but his reuerence stayed their perswasions. But when hee was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> come into the chamber, with the very wordes of cholerike threatning climing vp his throate, his eyes first lighted vpon <hi>Pamela</hi>; who hearing hee was comming, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:12151:166"/>
looking for death, thought she would keepe her owne maiestie in welcomming it; but the beames therof so strake his eyes, with such a counterbuffe vnto his pride, that if his anger could not so quickly loue, nor his pride so easily honor, yet both were forced to finde a worthinesse.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Which while it bred a pause in him, <hi>Zelmane</hi> (who had ready in her minde both what and how to say) stept out vnto him, and with a resolute stayednes (void either of anger, kindnes, disdaine, or humblenesse) speake in this sort. <hi>Anaxius</hi> (said she) if <hi>Fame</hi> haue not bene ouerpartiall to thee, thou art a man of exceeding valour. Therefore I doo call thee euen before that vertue, &amp; will make it the iudge between <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> vs. And now I doo affirme, that to the eternall blot of all the faire actes that thou hast done, thou doest weakely, in seeking without daunger to reuenge his death, whose life with daunger thou mightst perhapes haue preserued: thou doost cowardly, in going about by the death of these excellent Ladies, to preuent the iust punishment that hereafter they by the powers, which they better then their father, or any other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> could make, might lay vpon thee; and doost most basely, in once presenting thy selfe as an executioner; a vile office vpon men, and in a iust cause: beyond the degree of any vile worde, in so vniust a cause, and vpon Ladies, and such Ladies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as a hangman. I say, thou art vnworthy to be counted a knight, or to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the companie of Knights. Neither for what, I say, will I alleadge other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> of wisdome, or iustice, to prooue my speech, because I knowe thou doost dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to be tied to their rules: but euen in thine own vertue (whereof thou so much gloriest) I will make my triall: and therfore defie thee, by the death of one of vs two to proue, or disproue these reproaches. Choose thee what armes thou likest, I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demaund, that these Ladies (whome I defende) may in liberty see the combate.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> When <hi>Zelmane</hi> began her speech, the excellency of her beautie, and grace, made him a little content to heare. Besides that, a new lesson he had read in <hi>Pamela</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taught him some regard. But when shee entered into brauerie of speech, hee thought at first, a mad, and railing humor possest her; till, finding the speeches hold well together, and at length come to flatte challenge of combat; hee stoode leaning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> backe with his bodie and head, sometimes with bent browes looking vpon the one side of her, sometimes of the other, beyonde maruell maruailing, that hee, who had neuer heard such speeches from any Knight, shoulde be thus rebuffed by a woman; and that maruell made him heare out her speech: which ended, he turned his head to his brother <hi>Zoilus,</hi> and said nothing, but onely lifting vp his eyes, smiled. But <hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>

            <p>Indeed (saide he) any woman may bee as valiaunt as that coward, and traytorly boy, who slewe my Vncle trayterously, and after ranne from me in the plaine field. Fiue thousand such could not haue ouercome <hi>Euardes,</hi> but by falshood. But I sought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> him all ouer <hi>Asia,</hi> following him stil from one of his cony-holes to another: till com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into this Countrie, I heard of my friends being besieged, and so came to blow away the wretches that troubled him. But wheresoeuer the miserable boy flie, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,

nor hell, shall keepe his harte from being torne by these handes. Thou lyest in thy throate (said <hi>Zelmane</hi>) that boye, where euer he went, did so noble actes, as thy harte (as proude as it is) dares not think of, much lesse perfourme. But to please thee the better with my presence, I tell thee, no creature can be neerer of kinne to him, then my selfe: and so well we loue, that he woulde not be sorrier for his owne death <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> then for mine: I being begotten by his father, of an Amazon Ladie. And therefore, thou canst not deuise to reuenge thy self more vpon him, then by killing me: which if thou darest doo manfullie, doo it; otherwise, if thou harme these incomparable Ladies, or my felfe without daring to fight with me, I protest before these Knights, and before heauen and earth, (that will reueile thy shame) that thou art the begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> dastardly villaine, that dishonoureth the earth with his steppes: and if thou let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test me ouer-liue them, so will I blaze thee. But all this coulde not moue <hi>Anaxius,</hi> but that he onely said, Euill should it become the terror of the world, to fight, much worse to skolde with thee.</p>
            <p>But (said he) for the death of these same (pointing to the Princesses) of my grace,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> I giue them life. And withall, going to <hi>Pamela,</hi> and offring to take her by the chin, And as for you, Minion (saide hee) yeeld but gently to my will, and you shall not onely liue, but liue so happily, Hee would haue said further, when <hi>Pamela,</hi> displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed both with wordes, matter, and maner, putting him awaye with her faire hande, Proud beast (said shee) yet thou plaiest worse thy Comedy, then thy Tragedy. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> my part, assure thy selfe, since my destiny is such, that at each moment my life and death stand in equall balance, I had rather haue thee, and thinke thee far fitter to be my hangman, then my husband. Pride and anger, woulde faine haue cruelly reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged so bitter an answere, but alredy <hi>Cupid</hi> had begun to make it his sport, to pull his plumes: so that, vnused to a waye of courtesie, and put out of his byas of pride, hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> hastily went away, grumbling to himselfe; betweene threatning and wishing; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his brothers with them: the elder of whom, <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> liked <hi>Philoclea,</hi> and <hi>Zoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> would needes loue <hi>Zelmane</hi>; or at lest, entertaine themselues with making them beleue so. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> more braggard, and neere his brothers humor, began, with set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting foorth their bloud, their deedes, howe many they had despised, of most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> women; how much they were bound to them, that woulde seeke that of them. In summe, in all his speeches, more like the bestower, then the desirer of felicitie. Whom it was an excellent pastime (to those that woulde delight in the play of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue) to see, with what a wittie ignorance shee woulde not vnderstande: and howe: acknowledging his perfections, shee woulde make, that one of his perfections, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> to be iniurious to Ladies. But when he knew not how to replie, then would hee fall to touching and toying, stil vewing his graces in no glasse but self-liking. To which, <hi>Philocleas</hi> shamefastnes, and humblenes, were as strong resisters, as choller, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine. For though she yeelded not, hee thought she was to bee ouercome: and that thought a while stayed him from further violence. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> had eye to his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and set in her memorie, vpon the score of Reuenge, while shee her selfe was no lesse attempted by <hi>Zoilus</hi>; who lesse ful of bragges was forwardest in offering (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede) dishonourable violence.</p>
            <p>But when after their fruitlesse labours they had gone awaye called by their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (who began to be perplexed betweene new conceaued desires, and disdaine,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> to bee disdained) <hi>Zelmane</hi> (who with most assured quietnesse of iudgement
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:12151:167"/>
looked into their present estate) earnestly perswaded the two sisters, that to auoide the mischiefes of prowde outrage they would onely so farre sute their behauiour to their estates, as they might winne time; which as it coulde not bring them to worse case then they were, so it might bring forth inexpected reliefe. And why (said <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mela</hi>) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> shall we any longer flatter aduersity? Why shoulde wee delight to make our selues any longer balls to iniurious <hi>Fortune</hi> since our owne parents are content to be tyraunts ouer vs, since our own kinne are content traitorously to abuse vs? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in mishap it may bee some comforte to vs, that wee are lighted in these fellowes handes, who yet will keepe vs from hauing cause of being miserable by our friends <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> meanes. Nothing grieues me more, then that you, noble Ladie <hi>Zelmane</hi> (to whome the worlde might haue made vs able to doo honour) shoulde receaue onely hurte by the contagion of our miserie. As for me, and my sister, vndoubtedly it becomes our birth to thinke of dying nobly, while we haue done, or suffered nothing, which might make our soule ashamed at the parture from these bodies. Hope is the faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> traitour of the mind, while vnder colour of friendship, it robbes it of his chiefe" force of resolution. Vertuous and faire Ladie (saide <hi>Zelmane</hi>) what you say is true; and that truth may wel make vp a part in the harmonie of your noble thoughts. But yet the time (which ought alwaies to bee one) is not tuned for it; while that may" bring foorth any good, doo not barre your selfe thereof: for then will bee the time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> to die nobly, when you can not liue nobly. Then so earnestly shee persuaded with" them both, to referre themselues to their fathers consent (in obtayning wherof they knew some while would bespent) and by that meanes to temper the minds of their prowde woers; that in the ende <hi>Pamela</hi> yeelded to her, because she spake reason; and <hi>Philoclea</hi> yeelded to her reason, because she spake it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> And so when they were againe sollicited in that little pleasing petition, <hi>Pamela</hi> forced her selfe to make answere to <hi>Anaxius,</hi> that if her father gaue his consent shee would make her selfe belieue, that such was the heauenly determination, since shee had no meanes to auoide it. <hi>Anaxius</hi> (who was the most franke promiser to him selfe of successe) nothing doubted of <hi>Basilius</hi> consent, but rather assured him selfe, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> would bee his oratour in that matter: And therefore hee chose out an officious ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt (whome he esteemed very wise, because hee neuer found him but iust of his opinion) and willed him to be his embassadour to <hi>Basilius,</hi> and to make him knowe, that if he meant to haue his daughter both safe and happie, and desired himselfe to haue such a sonne in lawe, as woulde not onely protect him in his quiet course, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>(if he listed to accept it) would giue him the monarchy of the worlde, that then he should receaue <hi>Anaxius,</hi> who neuer before knewe what it was to pray any thinge. That if he did not, he would make him know, that the power of <hi>Anaxius</hi> was in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing beyonde his will, and yet his will not to be resisted by any other power. His seruaunt with smiling and caste-vp looke, desired God to make his memorie able to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> containe the treasure of that wise speach: and therefore besought him to repeate it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that by the oftener hearing it, his minde might be the better acquainted with the diuines thereof, and that being gratiously granted, hee then doubted not by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with him in his conceit, the grace wherewith <hi>Anaxius</hi> spake it, to persuade rocky minds to their owne harme: so little doubted he to win <hi>Basilius</hi> to that, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> hee thought woulde make him thinke the heauens opened, when he harde but the proffer thereof. <hi>Anaxius</hi> grauely allowed the probabilitie of his coniecture, and therefore sent him away, promising him hee shoulde haue the bringing vp of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

But <hi>Basilius</hi> betwixt the feare of <hi>Anaxius</hi> might, the passion of his loue and iealousie of his estate, was so perplexed, that notable to determine, he tooke the common course of men, to flie onely then to deuotion, when they want resolution: therefore detaining the messenger with delaies, hee deferred the directing of his course to the counsell of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which because himselfe at that time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> coulde not well go to require, hee entrusted the matter to his best trusted <hi>Philanax</hi>: who (as one in whom obedience was a sufficient reason vnto him) wente with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to <hi>Delphos,</hi> where being entred into the secrete place of the temple, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing performed the sacrifices vsuall, the spirite that possest the prohesying woman, with a sacred fury, attended not his demaund, but as if it would argue him of incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> tolde him, not in darke wonted speeches, but plainely to bee vnderstood, what he came for, and that hee should returne to <hi>Basilius,</hi> and will him to denie his daughters to <hi>Anaxius</hi> and his brothers, for that they were reserued for such as were better beloued of the gods. That he should not doubte, for they should returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him safely and speedily. And that he should keepe on his solitary course, til both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> "<hi>Philanax</hi> &amp; <hi>Basilius</hi> fully agreed in the vnderstanding of the former prophecie: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, commaunding <hi>Philanax</hi> from thenceforward to giue tribute, but not oblation, to humane wisedome.</p>

               <hi>Anaxius,</hi> who till then had made Fortune his creator, and Force his God, nowe began to finde an other wisedome to be aboue, that iudged so rightly of him: and where in this time of his seruauntes wayting for <hi>Basilius</hi> resolution, he and his brothers had courted their Ladies, as whome they vouchsafed to haue for their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> wiues, he resolued now to dally no longer in delayes, but to make violence his Oratour, since hee had found persuasions had gotten nothing but answeres. Which intention he opened to his brothers, who hauing all this while wanted nothing to take that way, but his authoritie, gaue spurres to his running, and, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy men, neither feeling vertue in themselues, nor tendring it in others, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> were headlong to make that euill consort of loue and force, when <hi>Anaxius</hi> had worde, that from the Tower there were descried some companies of armed men, marching towards the towne; wherefore he gaue present order to his seruauntes, and souldiers, to goe to the gates and walles, leauing none within but himselfe, and his brothers: his thoughts then so full of their intended pray, that <hi>Mars</hi>-his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> lowdest trumpet could scarcely haue awaked him.</p>

But since you will honor me with so hie fauor, I must onely desire that I may performe a vow which I made among my countriwomen, the famous <hi>Amazons,</hi> that I would neuer marrie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> none, but such one as was able to withstand me in Armes: therefore, before I make mine owne desire seruiceable to yours, you must vouchsafe to lend me armor and weapons, that at least, with a blow or two of the sword, I may not finde my selfe periured to my selfe. But <hi>Zoilus</hi> (but laughing with a hartie lowdnes) went by force to embrace her; making no other answere, but since she had a mind to trie his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Knighthood, she should quickly know what a man of armes he was: and so, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reuerence to the Ladies, began to struggle with her.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Zelmane</hi> then Disdaine became wisdome, and Anger gaue occasion. For abiding no longer aboad in the matter, she that had not put off, though she had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised, <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> being farre fuller of strong nimblenes, tript vp his feete, so that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> fell downe at hers. And withall (meaning to pursue what she had begun) puld out his sword, which he ware about him: but before she could strike him withall, he gat vp, and ranne to a faire chamber, where he had left his two brethren, preparing themselues to come downe to their mistresses. But she followed at his heeles, and euen as he came to throw himselfe into their armes for succor, she hit him with his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> owne sword, such a blow vpon the waste, that she almost cut him asunder: once, she sundred his soule from his body, sending it to <hi>Proserpina,</hi> an angry Goddesse against rauishers. But <hi>Anaxius,</hi> seing before his eyes the miserable end of his brother, fuller of despite then wrath, and yet fuller of wrath then sorow, looking with a wofull eye vpon his brother <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> Brother, said he, chastice this vile creature, while I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> go downe, and take order lest further mischiefe arise: and so went downe to the Ladies, whom he visited, doubting there had bene some further practise then yet he conceiued. But finding them only strong in pacience, he went and lockt a great Iron gate, by which onely any body might mount to that part of the Castle, rather to conceale the shame of his brother, slaine by a woman, then for doubt of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> anoyance, and then went vp to receaue some comfort of the execution, he was sure his brother had done of <hi>Zelmane.</hi> But <hi>Zelmane</hi> no sooner saw those brothers, of whom Reason assured her she was to expect reuenge, but that she lept to a target, "as one that well knew the first marke of valure to be defence. And then accepting the oportunitie of <hi>Anaxius</hi> going away, she waited not the pleasure of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> without any words (which she euer thought vaine, when resolution tooke the place of perswasion) gaue her owne hart the contentment to be the assailer. <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> who was in the disposition of his nature hazardouse, and by the luckie passing through many dangers, growne confident in himselfe, went toward her, rather as to a spoile, then to fight, so farre from feare, that his assurednesse disdained to hope.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> But when her sword made demonstrations aboue all flattery of arguments, and that he found she prest so vpon him, as shewed that her courage sprang not from blinde despaire, but was garded both with cunning and strength: self-loue then first in him diuided it selfe from vain-glory, and made him finde that the world of worthines had not this whole globe comprised in his brest, but that it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> to haue strong resistance against so strong assailing. And so between them, for a fewe blowes, <hi>Mars</hi> himselfe might haue bin delighted to looke on. But <hi>Zelmane,</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:12151:169"/>
who knew that in her case, slownesse of victory was little better then ruine, with the bellowes of hate, blew the fire of courage, and he striking a maine blow at her head, she warded it with the shield, but so warded, that the shield was cut in two pieces, while it protected her, and withal she ran in to him, and thrusting at his brest, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> he put by with his target, as he was lifting vp his sword to strike againe, she let fall the piece of her shield, and with her left hand catching his sword of the inside of the pommell, with nimble and strong sleight, she had gotten his sword out of his hand before his sence could conuey to his imagination, what was to be doubted. And hauing now two swords against one shield, meaning not foolishly to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> to good fortune, while he was no more amazed with his being vnweap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then with the suddainnes therof, she gaue him such a wound vpon his head, in despite of the shields ouer-weake resista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that withall he fell to the ground, astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with the paine, &amp; agast with feare. But seing <hi>Zelmane</hi> ready to conclude her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in his death, bowing vp his head to her, with a countenance that had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> all pride, Enough excellent Lady, said he, the honor is yours: Wherof you shal want the best witnes, if you kil me. As you haue taken from men the glory of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, returne so now againe to your owne sex, for mercy. I will redeeme my life of you with no small seruices, for I will vndertake to make my brother obey all your comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements. Grant life I beseech you, for your own honor, and for the persons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> sake that you loue best. <hi>Zelmane</hi> represt a while her great hart, either disdaining to be cruell, or pitiful, &amp; therfore not cruel: &amp; now the image of humane condition, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be an Orator vnto her of compassio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she saw, as he lifted vp his armes with a supplia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts grace, about one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnhappily tied, a garter with a Iewel, which (giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>Pyrocles</hi> by his aunt of <hi>Thessalia,</hi> &amp; greatly esteemed by him) he had presented to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
               <hi>Philoclea,</hi> &amp; with inward rage promising extreame hatred, had seene <hi>Lycurgus</hi> with a proud force, &amp; not without some hurt vnto her, pull away from <hi>Philoclea,</hi> because at entreatie she would not giue it him. But the sight of that was like a cyphar, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the iniuries which <hi>Philoclea</hi> had of him suffred, &amp; that reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce feeding vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrath, trod down al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceits of mercy. And therfore saying no more, but No villain, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> dye: It is <hi>Philoclea</hi> that sends thee this token for thy loue. With that she made her sword drink the blood of his hart, though he wresting his body, &amp; with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance prepared to excuse, wold faine haue delaied the receiuing of deaths embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors. But neither that staied <hi>Zelmanes</hi> hand, nor yet <hi>Anaxius</hi> crie vnto her, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made fast the iron gate, euen then came to the top of the staires, when, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> to all his imaginations, he saw his brother lye at <hi>Zelmanes</hi> mercie. Therefore cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, promising, and threatning to her to hold her hand: the last grone of his brother was the onely answere he could get to his vnrespected eloquence. But then Pittie would faine haue drawne teares, which Furie in their spring dried; and Anger would faine haue spoken, but that Disdaine sealed vp his lippes; but in his heart he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> blasphemed heauen, that it could haue such a power ouer him; no lesse ashamed of the victorie he should haue of her, then of his brothers ouerthrow: and no more spited, that it was yet vnreuenged, then that the reuenge should be no greater, then a womans destruction. Therefore with no speach, but such a groning crie, as often is the language of sorowfull anger, he came running at <hi>Zelmane,</hi> vse of figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> then seruing in steed of patient consideration what to do. Guided wherewith, though he did not with knowledge, yet did he according to knowledge, pressing vpon <hi>Zelmane</hi> in such a well defended manner, that in all the combats that euer
<pb facs="tcp:12151:170"/>
she had fought, she had neuer more neede of quicke senses, and ready vertue. For being one of the greatest men of stature then liuing, as he did fully answere that sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in greatnesse of might, so did he exceede both in greatnes of courage, which with a countenance formed by the nature both of his mind and body, to an almost horrible fiercenes, was able to haue carried feare to any minde, that was not priuie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to it selfe of a true and constant worthines. But <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> whose soule might well be separated from his body, but neuer alienated from the remembring what was comely, if at the first he did a little apprehend the dangerousnes of his aduersarie, whom once before he had something tried, and now perfectly sawe, as the very picture of forcible furie: yet was that apprehension quickly stayed in him, rather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> strengthning, then weakning his vertue by that wrestling; like wine, growing the stronger by being moued. So that they both, prepared in harts, and able in hands, did honor solitarines there with such a combat, as might haue demaunded, as a right of fortune, whole armies of beholders. But no beholders needed there, where manhood blew the trumpet, and satisfaction did whet, as much as glorie. There <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> was strength against nimblenes; rage, against resolution; fury, against vertue; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, against courage; pride, against noblenesse: loue, in both, breeding mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall hatred, and desire of reuenging the iniurie of his brothers slaughter, to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxius,</hi> being like <hi>Philocleas</hi> captiuity to <hi>Pyrocles.</hi> Who had seene the one, would haue thought nothing could haue resisted; who had marked the other, would haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> marueiled that the other had so long resisted. But like two contrarie tides, either of which are able to carry worlds of shippes, and men vpon them, with such swiftnes, as nothing seemes able to withstand them: yet meeting one another, with ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their watrie forces, and strugling together, it is long to say whether streame gets the victorie: So betweene these, if <hi>Pallas</hi> had bene there, she could scarcely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> haue tolde, whether she had nurced better in the feates of armes. The Irish grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound, against the English mastiffe; the sword-fish, against the whale; the Rhino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceros, against the elephant, might be models, and but models of this combat. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxius</hi> was better armed defensiuely: for (beside a strong caske brauely couered, wherewith he couered his head) he had a huge shield, such perchance, as <hi>Achilles</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> shewed to the pale walles of Troy, wherewithall that great body was couered. But <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> vtterly vnarmed for defence, to offend had the aduantage: for, in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand he had a sword, and with both handes nimbly performed that office. And according as they were diuersly furnished, so did they differ in the manner of fighting. For <hi>Anaxius</hi> most by warding, and <hi>Pyrocles</hi> oftnest by auoyding, resisted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> the aduersaries assault. Both hastie to end, yet both often staying for aduantage. Time, distance, and motion, custom made them so perfect in, that as if they had bene felow Counsellers, and not enemies, each knew the others minde, and knewe how to preuent it. So as their strength fayled them sooner then their skill, and yet their breath fayled them sooner then their strength. And breathles indeed they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> grew, before either could complaine of any losse of bloud.</p>
            <p>So that consenting by the mediation of necessitie, to a breathing time of truce, being withdrawen a little one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other; <hi>Anaxius</hi> stood leaning vpon his sword, with his grim eye, so setled vpon <hi>Zelmane,</hi> as is wont to be the looke of an earnest thought. Which <hi>Zelmane</hi> marking, and, according to the <hi>Pyroclean</hi> nature, fuller of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> gay brauerie in the midst, then in the beginning of danger; What is it (said she) <hi>Anaxius,</hi> that thou so deeply musest on? Dooth thy brothers example make thee
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:12151:170"/>
thinke of thy fault past, or of thy comming punishment? I thinke (said he) what spitefull God it should be, who, enuying my glory, hath brought me to such a way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward case, that neither thy death can be a reuenge, nor thy ouerthrow a victorie. Thou doost well indeed (said <hi>Zelmane</hi>) to impute thy case to the heauenly proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> which will haue thy pride finde it selfe (euen in that whereof thou art most proud) punished by the weake sex, which thou most contemnest.</p>
            <p>But then, hauing sufficiently rested themselues, they renewed againe their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batte, farre more terribly then before: like nimble vaulters, who at the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond leape, doo but stirre, and (as it were) awake the fierie and aërie partes, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> after in the other leapes, they doo with more excellencie exercise. For in this pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, ech had brought to his thoughts the maner of the others fighting, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages, which by that, and by the qualitie of their weapons, they might worke themselues; and so againe repeated the lesson they had said before, more perfectly, by the vsing of it. <hi>Anaxius</hi> oftner vsed blowes, his huge force (as it were) more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> delighting therein, and the large protection of his shield, animating him vnto it. <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> of a more fine, and deliuer strength, watching his time when to giue fitte thrustes; as, with the quick obeying of his bodie, to his eyes quicke commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he shunned any harme <hi>Anaxius</hi> could do to him: so would he soone haue made an end of <hi>Anaxius,</hi> if he had not found him a man of wonderfull, and almost <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> matchlesse excellency in matters of armes. <hi>Pyrocles</hi> vsed diuers faynings to bring <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxius</hi> on, into some inconuenience. But <hi>Anaxius</hi> keeping a sound maner of figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, neuer offered, but seeing faire cause, and then followed it with wel-gouerned violence. Thus spent they a great time, striuing to doo, and with striuing to doo, wearying themselues, more then with the very doing. <hi>Anaxius</hi> finding <hi>Zelmane</hi> so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> neere vnto him, that with little motion he might reach her, knitting all his strength together, at that time mainly foyned at her face. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> strongly putting it by with her right hand sword, comming in with her left foote, and hand, would haue giuen a sharpe visitation to his right side, but that he was faine to leape awaye.

I ioye in your presence, but I ioye more in your good, that friendshipp brings foorth the fruites of enmitie, which preferres his owne tendernes, before his friendes domage.

But alas as your sweet disposition drew me so farre: so doth it now strengthen me in it. To you therefore be the due commendation giuen, who can conquere me in Loue, and Loue in wisedome.

And therefore since the hatefull influence; which made him embrace this solitary life, was now past ouer him (as he doubted not the iudgment of <hi>Philanax</hi> would agree with his) and his late mishapes had taught him how perillous it was to commit a Princes state to a place so weakely guarded: He was now enclined to returne to his pallace in <hi>Mantinea,</hi> and there he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> hoped he should be beter able to shew how much he desired to make al he had hers: with many other such honnie wordes which my penne growes almost weary to set downe: This indeede neerely pierced <hi>Zelmane.</hi> For the good beginning shee had there obtained of <hi>Philoclea</hi> made her desire to continue the same trade, till vnto the more perfecting of her desires: and to come to any publike place <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Alas sorrowe, nowe thou hast the full sack of my conquered spirits, rest thy selfe a while, and set not stil new fire to thy owne spoiles: O accursed reason, how many eyes thou hast to see thy euills, and thou dimme, nay blinde thou arte in preuenting them? Forlorne creature that I am! I would I might be freely wicked, since wickednesse doth preuaile, but the foote steppes of my ouer-troden <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> vertue, lie still as bitter accusations vnto me: I am deuided in my selfe, howe can I stande? I am ouerthrowne in my selfe, who shall raise mee? Vice is but a nurse of new agonies, and the vertue I am diuorsed from, makes the hatefull comparison the more manyfest. No, no vertue, either I neuer had but a shadow of thee, or thou thy selfe, art but a shadow. For how is my soule abandoned? How are all my powers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> laide waste? My desire is payned, because it cannot hope, and if hope came, his best shoulde bee but mischiefe.

And as her minde ranne still vpon <hi>Zelmane,</hi> her piercing louers eye had soone found it was she. And seeing in her a countenance to flye away, she fell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> downe at her feete, and catching fast hold of her: Alas, sayd she, whether, or from whome doost thou flye awaye? the sauagest beastes are wonne with seruice, and there is no flint but may be mollifyed: How is <hi>Gynecia</hi> so vnworthie in thine eyes? or whome cannot aboundance of loue, make worthie?

O weigh, Alas! weigh with thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> selfe, the newe effectes of this mightie passion, that I vnfit for my state, vncomely for my sexe, must become a suppliant at thy feete! By the happie woman that bare thee, by all the ioyes of thy hart, and successe of thy desire, I beseech thee turne thy selfe to some consideration of me; and rather shew pittie in now helping me, then into late repenting my death which hourely threatens me. <hi>Zelmane</hi> imputing it, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> one of her continuall mishaps, thus to haue met with this Lady, with a full weary countenance; Without doubt Madame, said she, where the desire is such, as may be obtained, and the partie well deseruing as your selfe, it must be a great excuse that may well cullour a deniall; but when the first motion carries with it a direct impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie, then must the only answere be, comfort without helpe, and sorrow to both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> parties; to you not obtaining to me not able to graunt. O sayd <hi>Gynecia,</hi> how good leisure you haue to frame these scornefull answeres? Is <hi>Ginecia</hi> thus to be despised? am I so vile a worme in your sight? no no, trust to it hard harted tigre, I will not be the only Actor of this Tragedy: since I must fall, I will presse downe some others with my ruines: since I must burne, my spitefull neighbors shall feele of my fire. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Doest thou not perceaue that my diligent eyes haue pierced through the clowdie maske of thy desguiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t?

Beleeue it, beleeue it vnkind creature, I will end my miseries with a notable example of reuenge, and that accursed cradle of mine shal feele the smart of my wound, thou of thy tiranny, and lastly (I confesse) my selfe of mine owne work. <hi>Zelmane</hi> that had long before doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her selfe to be discouered by her, and now plainely finding it, was as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> saith, like them that hold the wolfe by the eares, bitten while they hold, and slaine if they loose. If she held her off in these wonted termes, she sawe rage would make her loue worke the effects of hate; to graunt vnto her, her hart was so bounde vpon <hi>Philoclea,</hi> it had ben worse then a thousand deaths. Yet found she it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for her, to come to a resolution, for <hi>Gynecias</hi> sore could bide no leasure, and once <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> discouered, besides the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of <hi>Philoclea,</hi> her desires should be for euer vtterly stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.

Lastly she considered <hi>Dorus</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, might bring some strange alteration of this their well liked fellowship. So that encompassed with these instant difficulties, she bent her spirits to thinke of a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> which might at once both saue her from them, and serue her to the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her only pursuite. Lastly, she determined thus, that there was no way but to yeeld to the violence of their desires, since striuing did the more chafe them.
<pb facs="tcp:12151:175"/>
And that following their owne current, at length of it selfe it would bring her to the other side of her burning desires.</p>
            <p>Now in the meane while the diuided <hi>Dorus,</hi> long diuided betwene loue and frendship, and now for his loue diuided fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his frend, though indeed without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of frendships loyaltie, which doth neuer barre the minde from his free satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> yet still a cruell iudge ouer himselfe, thought he was somewayes faultie, and applied his minde how to amend it, with a speedie and behouefull returne. But then was his first studie, how to get away, whereto already he had <hi>Pamelas</hi> consent, confirmed and concluded vnder the name of <hi>Mopsa</hi> in her owne presence, <hi>Dorus</hi> taking this way, that whatsoeuer he would haue of <hi>Pamela</hi> he would aske her, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in such a case it were not best for <hi>Mopsa</hi> so to behaue her selfe, in that sort ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Mopsas</hi> enuie, an instrument of that she did enuie. So hauing passed ouer, his first and most feared difficultie, he busied his spirites how to come to the haruest of his desires, whereof he had so faire a shew. And therevnto (hauing gotten leaue for some dayes of his maister <hi>Damaetas,</hi> who now accompted him as his sonne in lawe,)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> he romed round about the desart, to finde some vnknowne way, that might bring him to the next Sea port, as much as might be out of all course of other passengers: which all very well succeeding him, and he hauing hired a Bark for his liues traffick, and prouided horsses to carrie her thither, returned homeward, now come to the last point of his care, how to goe beyond the loathsome watchfulnes of these three <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> vncomely companions, and therin did wisely consider, how they were to be taken with whom he had to deale, remembring that in the particularities of euery bodies mind &amp; fortune, there are particuler aduantages, by which they are to be held. The muddy mind of <hi>Damaetas,</hi> he found most easily sturred with couetousnes. The curst mischeuous hart of <hi>Miso,</hi> most apt to be tickled with iealousie, as whose rotten brain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> could think wel of no body. But yong mistres <hi>Mopsa,</hi> who could open her eys vpon nothing, that did not all to bewonder her, he thought curiositie the fittest bait for her. And first for <hi>Damaetas, Dorus</hi> hauing imploid a whole days work, about a tenne mile off from the lodge (quite contrary way to that he ment to take with <hi>Pamela</hi>) in digging &amp; opening the ground, vnder an auncient oke that stood there, in such sort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> as might longest hold <hi>Damaetas</hi> greedy hopes, in some shewe of comfort, he came to his master, with a countenance mixt betwixt cherefulnes and haste, and taking him by the right hand, as if he had a great matter of secrecie to reueale vnto him: Master said he, I did neuer thinke that the gods had appointed my mind freely brought vp, to haue so longing a desire to serue you, but that they minded therby to bring some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> extraordinary frute to one so beloued of them, as your honesty makes me think you are. This bindes me euen in conscience, to disclose that which I perswade my self is alotted vnto you, that your fortune may be of equal ballance with your deserts. He said no further, because he would let <hi>Damaetas</hi> play vpon the bit a while, who not vnderstanding what his words entended, yet well finding, they caried no euil news,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> was so much the more desirous to know the matter, as he had free scope to imagin what measure of good hap himselfe would. Therefore putting off his cap to him, which he had neuer done before, &amp; assuring him he should haue <hi>Mopsa,</hi> though she had bene all made of cloath of gold, he besought <hi>Dorus</hi> not to hold him long in hope, for that he found it a thing his hart was not able to beare. Maister, answered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> 
               <hi>Dorus,</hi> you haue so satisfied me, with promising me the vttermost of my desired blisse, that if my duty bound me not, I were in it sufficiently rewarded. To you
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:12151:175"/>
therefore shall my good hap be conuerted, and the fruite of all my labor dedicated. Therewith he told him, how vnder an auncient oke, (the place he made him easily vnderstand, by sufficient marks he gaue vnto him) he had found digging but a little depth, scatteringly lying a great number of rich Medailles, and that percing further <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> into the ground, he had met with a great stone, which by the hollow sound it yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, seemed to be the couer of some greater vaut, and vpon it a boxe of Cypres, with the name of the valiant <hi>Aristomenes</hi> grauen vpon it: and that within the box, he found certaine verses, which signified that some depth againe vnder that all his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures lay hidden, what time for the discord fell out in <hi>Arcadia</hi> he liued banished. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Therwith he gaue <hi>Damaetas</hi> certaine Medailles of gold he had long kept about him, and asked him because it was a thing much to be kept secret, and a matter one man in twenty houres might easily performe, whether he would haue him go and seeke the bottome of it, which he had refrained to do till he knew his mind, promising he would faithfully bring him what he found, or else that he himselfe would do it, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> be the first beholder of that comfortable spectacle. No man need doubt which part <hi>Damaetas</hi> would choose, whose fancie had alredy deuoured all this great riches, and euen now began to grudge at a partenor, before he saw his owne share. Therefore taking a strong Iade, loaden with spades and mattocks, which he ment to bring back otherwise laden, he went in all speed thetherward, taking leaue of no body, only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
               <hi>Dorus</hi> he would looke wel to the Princes <hi>Pamela.</hi> Promising him mountaines of his owne labor, which neuerthelesse he little ment to performe, like a foole not considering, that no man is to be moued with part, that neglects the whole. Thus away went <hi>Damaetas,</hi> hauing alreadie made an image in his fancie, what Pallaces he would build, how sumptuously he would fare, and among all other things imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> what money to employ in making coffers to keepe his money, his tenne mile seemed twise so many leagues, and yet contrarie to the nature of it, though it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med long, it was not wearysome. Many times he curssed his horses want of consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that in so important a matter would make no greater speede: many times he wished himself the back of an Asse, to help to carrie away the new sought riches, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>(an vnfortunate wisher, for if he had aswell wished the head, it had bene graunted him.) At length being come to the tree, which he hoped should beare so golden Akornes, downe went all his instruments, and forthwith to the renting vp of the hurtlesse earth, where by and by he was caught with the lime of a fewe promised Medailles, which was so perfect a pawne vnto him of his further expectation, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> he deemed a great number of howers well employed in groping further into it, which with loggs and great stones was made as cumbersome as might be, till at length with sweatie browes he came to the great stone. A stone, God knowes, full vnlike to the couer of a Monument, but yet there was the Cipres box with <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> grauen vpon it, and these verses written in it.</p>

And therewithall tooke her in his armes, and rocking her too and fro, In faith mistresse, sayd he, it is high time for you, to bid vs good night for euer, since others can possesse your place in your owne time. <hi>Miso</hi> that was neuer voide of mallice enough to suspect the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost euill, to satisfye a further shrewdnes, tooke on a present mildnes, and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> desired him, to tell her what he meant, for, said she, I am like enough to be kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uishly dealt with, by that churle my husband. <hi>Dorus</hi> fell off from the matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as if he had meant no such thing, till by much refusing her intreatie, and vehemently stirring vp her desire to knowe, he had strengthned a credit in her to that he should saye.

your blisfull promise now due, be verified with iust performance? with that I drew neerer to them, and saw (for now he had lifted vp his face to glasse himselfe in her faire eyes) that it was my master <hi>Damaetas,</hi> but here <hi>Miso</hi> interrupted his tale, with rayling at <hi>Damaetas,</hi> with all those exquisite termes, which I was neuer good skolde inough to imagine. But <hi>Dorus,</hi> as if he had ben much offended with her impacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> would proceed no further till she had vowed more stillnes. For said he, if the first drumme thus chafe you, what will you be when it commes to the blowes? Then he told her, how after many familiar entertainments betwixt them, <hi>Damaetas,</hi> laying before her, his great credit with the Duke, and withall giuing her very faire presents, with promise of much more, had in the ende concluded together to meete as that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> night at <hi>Mantinea,</hi> in the <hi>Oudemian</hi> streete, at <hi>Charitas</hi> vncles house, about tenne of the clocke. After which bargaine <hi>Damaetas</hi> had spied <hi>Dorus,</hi> and calling him to him, had with great brauery told him all his good happe, willing him in any case to returne to the olde witch <hi>Miso</hi> (for so indeede mistresse of liuelinesse, and not of ill will he termed you) and to make some honest excuse of his absence, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> sayde he, kissing <hi>Charita,</hi> if thou didst know what a life I lead with that driuell, it would make thee euen of pittie, receaue me into thy only comfort. Now Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse sayde he, exercise your discretion, which if I were well assured of, I would wish you to goe yourselfe to <hi>Mantinea,</hi> and (lying secrete in some one of youre gossypps houses, till the time appoynted come) so may you finde them together,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and vsing mercie, reforme my Maister from his euill wayes. There had nothing more enraged <hi>Miso,</hi> then the prayses <hi>Dorus</hi> gaue to <hi>Charitas</hi> bewtie, which made her iealosie swell the more, with the poyson of enuye. And that being increased with the presents she heard <hi>Damaetas</hi> had giuen her (which all seemed torne out of her bowells) her hollow eyes, yeelded such wretched lookes, as one might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> well thinke <hi>Pluto</hi> at that time, might haue had her soule very good cheape. But when the fire of spite had fully caught hold of all her inward partes, then whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer would haue seene the picture of <hi>Alecto,</hi> or with what maner of countenance <hi>Medea</hi> kild her owne children, needed but take <hi>Miso</hi> for the full satisfaction of that point of his knowledge. She that could before scarce go, but supported by crutches,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> now flew about the house, borne vp with the wings of Anger, there was no one sort of mortall reuenge, that had euer come to her eares, but presented it selfe nowe to her gentle minde. At length with few words, for her words were choakt vp with the rising of her reuengefull hart, she ran downe, and with her own hands sadled a mare of hers, a mare that 7. yeare before had not bene acquainted with a sadle, &amp; so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> to <hi>Mantinea</hi> she went, casting with her selfe, how she might couple shame with the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of her accursed husband: but the person is not worthie in whose passion I should too long stand. Therefore now must I tell you that Mistresse <hi>Mopsa</hi> (who was the last party <hi>Dorus</hi> was to practise his cunning withal) was at the parting of her parents, attending vpon the Princes <hi>Pamela,</hi> whom because she found to be placed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> in her fathers house, she knew it was for suspicion the Duke had of her. This made <hi>Mopsa</hi> with a right base nature (which ioyes to see anie hard hap happen to them, they deeme happie) grow prowd ouer her, &amp; vse great ostentation of her own dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, in prying curiously into each thing that <hi>Pamela</hi> did. Neither is there any thing sooner ouerthrows a weak hart, then opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of authority, like too strong a liquor for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> so feebl a glasse, which ioined it self to the humor of enuying <hi>Pamelas</hi> beauty, so far, that oft she would say to her self, if she had ben borne a Duchesse as well as <hi>Pamela,</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:12151:177"/>
her perfections then should haue beene as well seene as <hi>Pamelas,</hi> with this manner of woman, and placed in these termes, had <hi>Dorus</hi> to play his last parte, which hee would quickly haue dispatched in tying her vp in such a maner, that she should litle haue hindred his enterprise. But that the vertuous <hi>Pamela,</hi> (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she saw him so min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> by countenaunce absolutlie forbad it, resolutely determining, she would not leaue behinde her any token of wrong since the wrong done to her selfe was the best excuse of her escape. So that <hi>Dorus</hi> was compelled to take her in the maner hee first thought of, and accordingly <hi>Pamela</hi> sitting musing at the strange attempt shee had condiscended vnto, and <hi>Mopsa</hi> harde by her, (looking in a glasse with very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> eyes) <hi>Dorus</hi> put himselfe between them, and casting vp his face to the top of the house, shrugging all ouer his bodie, and stamping somtimes vpon the ground, gaue <hi>Mopsa</hi> occasion (who was as busie as a Bee to know any thing) to aske her louer <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> what ayled him, that made him vse so strange a behauiour, he, as if his spirits had beene rauished with some supernaturall contemplation, stoode still muett, somtimes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> rubbing his forehead, sometime starting in him selfe, that hee set <hi>Mopsa</hi> in such an itche of inquirie, that she would haue offred her maydenhead, rather then belonge kept from it. <hi>Dorus</hi> not yet aunswearing to the purpose, still keeping his amazement. O <hi>Hercules,</hi> saide he, resolue me in this doubt. A tree to graunt ones wishes? Is this the cause of the Kinges solitarie life? Which parte shall I take? Happie in either, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> because I cannot know which were my best happ. These doubtful selfe spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, made <hi>Mopsa</hi> yet in a further longing of knowing the matter, so that the prettie pigge, laying her sweete burden about his neck, my <hi>Dorus,</hi> saide she, tell mee these words, or els I know not what will befal mee, honny <hi>Dorus</hi> tell them me. <hi>Dorus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing stretched her minde vpon a right laste, extremely loued <hi>Mopsa,</hi> saide hee, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> matters be so great, as my harte failes me in the telling them, but since you holde the greatest seate in it, it is reason your desire should adde life vnto it. Ther with he told her a farre fet tale how that many millions of yeares before, <hi>Iupiter</hi> fallen out with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> had throwne him out of heauen, taking from him the priueledge of a God. So that poore <hi>Apollo</hi> was faine to leade a verie miserable life, vnacquainted to worke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and neuer vsed to begge, that in this order hauing in time learned to bee <hi>Admetus</hi> heardman, he had vpon occasion of fetching a certaine breed of beastes out of <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> come to that verie deserte, where wearied with trauaile, and resting himselfe in the boughes of a pleasaunt Ashe tree, stoode little of from the lodge, hee had with pittifull complaintes gotten his father <hi>Iupiters</hi> pardon, and so from that tree was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> againe to his golden spheare. But hauing that right nature of a God, neuer to be vngratefull, to <hi>Admetus</hi> hee had graunted a double life, and because that tree was the chappel of his prosperous prayers, he had giuen it this equality, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer of such estate, and in such maner as he then was, sate downe in that tree, they should obtaine whatsoeuer they wished. This <hi>Basilius</hi> hauing vnderstoode by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> was the onely cause which had made him trie, whether framing himselfe to the state of an heardman, he might haue the preuiledge of wishing onely graunted to that degree, but that hauing often in vaine attempted it, because indeede hee was not such, he had now opened the secret to <hi>Dametas,</hi> making him sweare hee should wish according to his direction. But because said <hi>Dorus, Apollo</hi> was at that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> time with extreme griefe muffled, round aboute his face, with a skarlet cloake, <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metus</hi> had giuen him, and because they that must wish must be muffled in like sorte, and with like stuffe, my master <hi>Dametas</hi> is gone I know not whither to prouide him
<pb facs="tcp:12151:178"/>
a skarlet cloake, and to morrow doth appointe to returne with it, my Mistresse I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how, hauing gotten some inckling of it, is trudged to <hi>Mantinea</hi> to get her selfe a cloake before him: because she woulde haue the first wishe. My master at his parting of great trust tould me this secret, commaunding me to see no bodie should clime that tree. But now my <hi>Mopsa,</hi> said he, I haue here the like cloake of mine owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and am not so verie a foole as though I keep his commaundement in others to barre my selfe, I rest onely extreemely perplexed, because hauing nothing in the worlde I wish for, but the enioying you &amp; your fauour, I think it a much pleasanter conquest to come to it by your owne consent, then to haue it by such a charming force, as this is. Now therefore choose since haue you I will, in what sorte I shall haue you. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> neuer child was so desirons of a gay puppet, as <hi>Mopsa</hi> was to be in the tree, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without squeamishnes, promising all he woulde, shee coniured him by all her precious Loues, that she might haue the first possession of the wishing tree, assuring him that for the enioying her he should neuer neede to clime farre. <hi>Dorus</hi> to whom time was precious, made no great ceremonies with her, but helping her vp to the top <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> of the tree, from whence likewise she could ill come downe without helpe, he muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled her round about the face, so truely that she her selfe could not vndoe it. And so he tolde her the manner was, she should hold her mind in continuall deuotion to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> without making at al any noyse, till at the farthest within twelue howers space, she should heare a voice call her by name three times, &amp; that till the thirde time shee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> must in no wise aunswere; &amp; then you shall not need to doubt your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming down, for at that time said he, be sure to wish wisely, &amp; in what shape soeuer he come vnto you speake boldly vnto him, and your wish shall haue as certaine effecte, as I haue a desire to enioy your sweet Loues, in this plight did hee leaue <hi>Mopsa,</hi> resolued in her hart, to be the greatest Lady of the world, &amp; neuer after to feede of worse then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentie.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Thus <hi>Dorus</hi> hauing deliuered his hands of his three tormentors, took spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely the benefit of his deuise, and mounting the gracious <hi>Pamela</hi> vpon a faire horse he had prouided for her he thrust himselfe forthwith into the wildest part of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarte, where he had left markes to guide him, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place to place to the next sea porte, disguising her very fitly with scarfes although he rested assured, he should meet that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> way with no body, till he came to his barck, into which hee ment to enter by night. But <hi>Pamela</hi> who al this while, transported with desire &amp; troubled with feare had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer free scope of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to look with perfect consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into her own enterprise but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the lawes of loue, had bequeathed the care of her self vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to whom she had geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her self. Now that the pang of desire with euident hope was quieted, &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> most part of the feare passed, reason began to renew his shining in her hart, &amp; make her see her self in her selfe; &amp; weigh with what wings she flew out of her natiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and vpon what ground she builte so strange a determinacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But loue fortified with her louers presence kept still his own in her hart. So that as they ridde together with her hand vpon her faithfull seruants shoulder, sodainly casting her bashfull eies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to the ground, and yet bending her self towards him, (like the clyent that committes the cause of all his worth to a well trusted aduocate,) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a milde spirit saide vnto him these sweetely deliuered wordes: Prince <hi>Musidorus,</hi> (for so my assured hope is I may iustlie call you, since with no other my harte woulde euer haue yeelded to goe; And if so I doe not rightlie tearme you, all other wordes are as bootelesse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> as my deede miserable and I as vnfortunate, as you wicked) my Prince <hi>Musidorus</hi> I saye nowe that the vehement shewes of your faithfull Loue towardes mee, haue

Your promise you Remember, which here by the eternall giuers of vertue, I coniure you to obserue, let me be your owne as I am, but by no vniust conquest; let not our ioyes which ought euer to last, bee stayned in our own consciences, let no shadow of repentaunce steale into the sweet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> consideration of our mutuall happines. I haue yeelded to bee your wife, staye then till the time that I may rightly bee so; let no other defiled name burden my harte. What shoulde I more saye?

Thus much onely I must confesse, I can neuer doe, to make the worlde see you haue chosen worthily, since all the world is not worthy of you. In such delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> discourses, kept they on their Iournye, mayntaining their hartes in that right harmonie of affection, which doth enterchangeably deliuer each to other the secret workinges of their soules, till with the vnused trauaile, the Princesse being weary, they lighted downe in a faire thyckwood, which did entise them with the pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of it to take their rest there. It was all of Pine trees, whose brodeheades meeting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> togither, yeelded a perfit shade to the ground, where their bodies gaue a spacious and pleasant roome to walke in, they were sett in so perfet an order, that euerie waye the eye being full, yet no way was stopped. And euen in the middest of them, were there many sweete springes, which did loose themselues vpon the face of the earth.

But <hi>Pamela</hi> had much more pleasure to walke vnder those trees, making in their barkes prettie knottes, which tyed togither the names of <hi>Musidorus</hi> and <hi>Pamela,</hi> sometimes entermixedly changing there, to <hi>Pammedorus</hi> and <hi>Musimela,</hi> with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie other flowers of her trauiling fancies, which had bounde them selues to a greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> restrainte, then they could without much painewell endure, and to one tree more beholdinge to her, then the rest she entrusted the treasure of her thoughtes in these verses:

            <p>The sweete <hi>Pamela,</hi> was brought into a sweete sleepe with this songe which gaue <hi>Musidorus</hi> opportunity at leasure to beholde her excellent beauties. He thought her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> faire forehead was a fielde where all his fancies fought; and euery haire of her heade semed a strong chain thattied him. Her fairer liddes then hiding her fairer eyes, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto him sweete boxes of mother of pearle, riche in themselues, but contaning in them farre richer Iewells. Her cheekes with their coullour most delicately mixed would haue entertained his eyes somewhile, but that the roses of her lippes (whose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> separating was wont to bee accompanied with most wise speeches) nowe by force drewe his sight to marke how preatily they lay one ouer the other, vniting their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided beauties: and thorough them the eye of his fancy deliuered to his memorie the lying (as in ambush) vnder her lippes of those armed rankes, all armed in most pure white, and keeping the most precise order of military discipline. And lest this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> beautie might seeme the picture of some excellent artificer, fourth there stale a softe breath, carying good testimony of her inward sweetnesse: and so stealingly it came out, as it seemed loath to leaue his contentfull mansion, but that it hoped to bee drawne in againe to that well cloased paradise, which did so tyrannize ouer <hi>Musido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> affectes that hee was compelled to put his face as lowe to hers, as hee coulde,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> sucking the breath with such ioye, that he did determine in himselfe, there had ben no life to a <hi>Camaeleons</hi> if he might be suffered to enioye that foode.

Hope then (the only succour of perplexed mindes) being quite cut off, you desire my affection, and yet you your selfe thinke my affection already bestowed. You pretend crueltie, before you haue the subiection, and are iealous of keeping that, which as yet you haue not gotten. And that which is strangest in your iealousie, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> both the vniustice of it, in being loath that should come to your daughter, which you deeme good, and the vaynnesse, since you two are in so diuers respects, that there is no necessitie one of you should fall to be a barre to the other. For neyther (if I be such as you fancie) can I mary you, which must needes be the only ende I can aspire to in her: neither neede the maryeng of her keepe me from a gratefull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> consideracion how much you honor me in the loue you vouchsafe to beare me. <hi>Gynaecia,</hi> to whome the fearefull agonies she still liued in made any small repriuall sweete, did quickly finde her words falling to a better way of comfort, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with a minde readie to shewe nothing could make it rebellious against <hi>Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> but to extreme tyrannie, she thus sayd: Alas too much beloued <hi>Zelmane,</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> thoughts are but outflowings of the minde, and the tongue is but a seruant of the thoughtes, therefore maruaile not that my words suffer contrarieties, since my minde doth hourely suffer in it selfe whole armyes of mortall aduersaries. But, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, if I had the vse of mine owne reason, then should I not neede, for want of it, to finde my selfe in this desperate mischiefe, but because my reason is vanished, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> haue I likewise no power to correct my vnreasonablenes. Do you therefore accept the protection of my minde, which hath no other resting place, and driue it not, by being vnregarded to put it selfe into vnknowne extremities. I desire but to haue my affection answered, and to haue a right reflection of my loue in you. That graunted, assure your selfe mine owne loue will easily teach me to seeke your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> and make me thinke my daughter a very meane price to keepe still in mine eyes the foode of my spirits. But take heede that contempt driue me not into despaire, the most violent cause of that miserable effect. <hi>Zelmane</hi> that alreadie sawe some fruite of her last determined fancie (so farre as came to a mollifyeng of <hi>Gynecias</hi> rage) seeing no other way to satisfye suspicion, which was help open with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the continuall prickes of loue, resolued now with plainnesse to winne trust, which trust she might after deceyue with a greater subtletie. Therefore looking vpon her with a more relenting grace, then euer she had done before, pretending a great bashfulnes before she could come to confesse such a fault, she thus sayde vnto her: Most worthye Ladye, I did neuer thinke, till now, that pittie of another coulde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> make me betray my selfe, nor that the sounde of wordes could ouerthrow any wise bodies determinacion. But your words (I thinke) haue charmed me, and your grace bewitched me. Your compassion makes me open my hart to you, and leaue vnhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured mine owne thoughts. For proofe of it, I will disclose my greatest secreate, which well you might suspect, but neuer knowe, and so haue your wandring hope <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> in a more painefull wildernesse, being neither way able to be lodged in a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solucion.

Counsellor of loue. The cause of this my chaunged attyre, was a iourney two yeares agoe I made among the <hi>Amazons,</hi> where hauing sought to trye my vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate valure, I met not one in all the Countrey but was too harde for me, till in the ende in the presence of their Queene <hi>Marpesia,</hi> I hoping to preuayle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst her, challenged an olde woman of fourescore yeares, to fight on horsse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to the vttermost with me. Who hauing ouerthrowne me, for the sauing of my life, made me sweare I should goe like an vnarmed <hi>Amazon,</hi> till the comming of my beard did, with the discharge of my oath, deliuer me of that bondage. Here <hi>Zelmane</hi> ended, not comming to a full conclusion, because she would see what it wrought in <hi>Gynecias</hi> minde, hauing in her speech sought to winne a beliefe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> of her, and, if it might be, by disgrace of her selfe to diminish <hi>Gynecias</hi> affection. For the first it had much preuailed. But <hi>Gynecia</hi> whose ende of louing her, was not her fighting, neyther could her loue too deepely grounded receiue diminishment; and besides she had seene herselfe, sufficient proofes of <hi>Zelmanes</hi> admirable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesse. Therefore sleightly passing ouer that poynt of her fayned dishonor, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> good hold of the confessing her manly sexe, with the shamefaste looke of that suitor, who hauing already obtayned much, is yet forced by want to demaunde more, put foorth her sorrowfull suite in these words: The gods, sayd she, rewarde thee for thy vertuouse pittie of my ouerladen soule, who yet hath receyued some breath of comfort, by finding thy confession to maintayne some possibilitie of my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> languishing hope. But alas! as they who seeke to enrich themselues by minerall industrie, the first labour is to finde the myne, which to their cheerefull comfort being founde, if after any vnlooked for stop, or casuall impediment keepe them from getting the desired vre, they are so much the more greeued, as the late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued hope addes torment to their former wante. So falles it out with mee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> (happie or happlesse woman as it pleaseth you to ordayne) who am now either to receyue some guerdon of my most wofull labours, or to returne into a more wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched darkenes, hauing had some glimmering of my blisfull Sunne. O <hi>Zelmane,</hi> tread not vpon a soule that lyes vnder your foote: let not the abasing of my selfe make me more base in your eyes, but iudge of me according to that I am and haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> bene, and let my errors be made excusable by the immortall name of loue. With that, vnder a fayned rage, tearing her clothes, she discouered some partes of her fayre body, which if <hi>Zelmanes</hi> harte had not bene so fully possest as there was no place left for any new guest, no doubt it would haue yelded to that gallant assault. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> so much the more arming her determination, as she sawe such force <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> threatened, yet still remembring she must wade betwixt constancie and curtesey, embracing <hi>Gynecia,</hi> and once or twise kissing her, Deare Ladie, sayd she, he were a great enemy to himselfe, that would refuse such an offer, in the purchase of which a mans life were blessedly bestowed. Nay, how can I euer yeeld due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, for so excessiue a fauour? but hauing nothing to geue you but my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> selfe, take that: I must confesse a small, but a very free gift what other affection soeuer I haue had, shall geue place to as great perfection, working besides vppon the bonde of gratefulnes. The gods forbid I should be so foolish, as not to see, or so wicked as not to remember, how much my small deserts are ouerballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by your vnspeakeable goodnes. Nay happye may I well accompt my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> among the <hi>Amazons,</hi> since that dishonor hath bene so true a path to my greatest honor, and the chaunging of my outward rayment, hath clothed my

minde in such inwarde contentacion. Take therefore noble Lady as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to youre harte, as the full commandement of me can yeeld you: wipe your faire eyes, and keepe them for nobler seruices. And nowe I will presume thus much to saye vnto you, that you make of your selfe for my sake, that my ioyes of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> my new obtayned riches may be accomplished in you. But let vs leaue this place, least you be too long missed, and henceforward quiet your minde from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther care, for I will now (to my too much ioye) take the charge vpon me, within fewe dayes to worke your satisfaction, and my felicitie. Thus much she sayde, and withall led <hi>Gynecia</hi> out of the Caue, for well she sawe the boyling minde of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
               <hi>Gynecia</hi> did easily apprehende the fitnesse of that lonely place. But in deede this direct promise of a short space, ioyned with the cumbersome familiar of woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, I meane modestie, stayed so <hi>Gynecias</hi> minde, that she tooke thus much at that present for good payment: remayning with a paynefull ioye, and a weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some kinde of comfort, not vnlike to the condemned prisoner, whose minde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> still running vppon the violent arriuall of his cruell death, heares that his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is promised, but not yet signed. In this sort they both issued out of that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure mansion: <hi>Gynecia</hi> already halfe perswaded in her selfe (ô weakenes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conceite) that <hi>Zelmanes</hi> affection was turned towards her. For such alas! we are all, in such a mould are we cast, that with the too much loue we beare our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> selues, beeing first our owne flatterers, wee are easily hooked with our owne flattery, we are easily perswaded of others loue.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Zelmane</hi> who had now to playe her prize, seeing no waye thinges could long remayne in that state, and now finding her promise had tyed her tryall to a small compasse of tyme, began to throwe her thoughtes into each corner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> of her inuention howe shee might atchieue her liues enterprise: for well shee knewe deceite cannot otherwise be mayntayned but by deceite: and how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue such heedfull eyes, and how to satisfye, and yet not satisfye such hopefull desires, it was no small skill.

For as the arriuall of enemyes, makes a towne so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> fortifye it selfe, as euer after it remaynes stronger, so that a man may say, enemyes were no small cause to the townes strength: So to a minde once fixed in a well pleased determinacion, who hopes by annoyance to ouerthrowe it, doth but teach it to knit together all his best grounds, and so perchance of a chaunceable purpose, make an vnchangeable resolucion.

O onely <hi>Philocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a,</hi> whose beautie is matched with nothing, but with the vnspeakeable beautie of thy fayrest minde, if thou didst see vpon what a racke my tormented soule is set, little would you thinke I had any scope now, to leape to any new chaunge, with that, with hastie hands she got her selfe vp turning her sight to euerie thinge, as if chaunge of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> obiecte might helpe her invention. So went she againe to the caue where forthwith it came into her head, that shoulde bee the fittest place to performe her exploite, of which she had now a kinde of confused conceipte, although she had not set downe in her fancie, the meeting with each particularitie that might fall out. But as the painter doth at the first but showe a rude proportion of the thing he imitates, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> after with more curious hande, hee drawes to the representing each lineament. So had her thoughts beating about it continually, receaued into them a ground plot of her deuise, although she had not in each parte shapte it according to a full determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But in this sorte hauing earelie visited the morninges beautie, in those plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant desartes, she came to the King and Queene and tolde them, that for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> of certaine her countrie deuotions, which onely were to be exercised in soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarines, shee did desire their leaue shee might for a fewe daies, lodge her selfe in the Caue, the fresh sweetnes of which did greately delight her, in that hot countrie; and that for that smal space, they would not otherwise trouble themselues in visiting her, but at such times as she would come to waite vpon them, which shoulde bee euerie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> daye at certaine houres, neither should it be long, shee would desire his priuiledged absence of them.

But <hi>Gynecia</hi> of all other most ioyous, holding her selfe assured that this was but a prologue to the play she had promised her. Thus both flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering them selues, with diuersly grounded hopes, they rang a bell which serued to call certaine poore women which euer lay in cabins not far off, to do the houshould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> seruices of both lodges, and neuer came to either but being called for: And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them to carry foorthwith <hi>Zelmanes</hi> bed and furniture of her chamber, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pleasaunt Caue; and to decke it vp as finelie, as it was possible for them, That their soules rest might rest her body to her best pleasing maner, that was with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence performed of them, and <hi>Zelmane</hi> alredie in possession of her newe chosen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> lodging, where she like one of <hi>Vestaes</hi> nunnes, entertaind herselfe for a fewe dayes in all showe of streightnes, yet once a day comming to doe her dutie to the King and Queene, in whom the seldomnes of the sight encreased the more vnquiet longing, though somwhat qualified, as her countenaunce was decked to either of them with more comforte then wonted. Especially to <hi>Gynecia</hi> who seing her wholy neglecting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> her daughter <hi>Philoclea,</hi> had now promisd her selfe a full possession of <hi>Zelmanes</hi> harte, still expecting the fruite, of the happie &amp; hoped for inuention. But both she and <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> kept such a continuall watch about the Precincts of the Caue, that either of them
<pb facs="tcp:12151:185"/>
was a bar to the other from hauing any secret, commoning with <hi>Zelmane.</hi> While in the meane time the sweete <hi>Philoclea</hi> forgotten of her father, despised of her mother, and in apparance lefte of <hi>Zelmane</hi> had yeelded vp her soule to be a pray to sorow and vnkindnes, not with raging conceite of reuenge as had passed thorow the stout and wise harte of her mother, but with a kindly meeknes taking vpon her the weight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of her owne woes, and suffering them to haue so full a course as it did exceedinglie weaken the estate of her bodie, aswell for which cause as for that, shee could not see <hi>Zalmane,</hi> without expressing (more then shee woulde) how farr now her loue, was imprisoned in extremitie of sorrow, she bound her selfe first to the limits of her own chamber, and after, (griefe breeding sicknes) of her bed. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> hauing now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a full libertie to cast about euery way, how to bring her conceaued attempt to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired successe, was ofte so perplexed with the manifould difficultie of it, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times she would resolue by force to take her a way, though it were with the death of her parents, somtimes to go away herself with <hi>Musidorus</hi> and bring both their forces, so to winne her. But lastly euen the same day that <hi>Musidorus</hi> by feeding the humor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> of his three loathsome gardiens, had stolne awaye the Princes <hi>Pamela</hi> (whether it were that loue ment to match them euerie waie, or that her friendes example had holpen her inuention, or that indeede <hi>Zelmane</hi> forbare to practise her deuise till she found her friend had passed through his.)

               <hi>Philoclea</hi>: where vnto shee was assured her owne loue, no lesse then her sisters, woulde easely winne her consent.

And so putting on that kinde of milde countenaunce, which doth encourage the looker on to hope for a gentle answere, according to her late receaued maner, she lefte the pleasant darkenes of her melancholy caue, to goe take her dinner of the King and Queene, and giue vnto them both a pleasant foode of seing the owner of their desires.

If I speake nothing, I choake my selfe, and am in no way of reliefe: if simplye neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> if confusedly not vnderstoode: if by the bending together all my inwarde powers, they bring forth any liuely expressing of that they truly feele, that is a token, forsooth, the thoughts are at too much leasure. Thus is silence desperate, follie puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and witt suspected. But indeed it is vaine to say any more, for wordes can bind no beliefe. Lady, I say, determine of me, I must confesse I cannot beare this battell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> in my minde, and therefore let me soone know what I may accompt of my selfe, for it is a hell of dolours, when the mind still in doubt for want of resolution, can make no resistaunce.</p>
            <p>In deed aunswered <hi>Zelmane,</hi> if I should graunt to your request, I should shew, an example in my selfe that I esteeme the holy bande of chastitie to bee but and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natife <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> rule, as you tearmed it: and not the truest obseruaunce of nature the moste noble commaundement that mankinde can haue ouer themselues, as indeede both learning teacheth, and inward feeling assureth. But first shal <hi>Zelmanes</hi> graue, become her marriage bedd, before my soule shall consent to his owne shame, before I will leaue a marke in my self of an vnredemable trespasse. And yet must I confesse that if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> euer my hart were sturred, it hath ben with the manifest &amp; manifold shewes of the misery you liue in for me. For in trueth so it is, nature giues not to vs her degenerate children, any more general precepte, then one to helpe the other, one to feele a true compassion of the others mishappe. But yet if I were neuer so contented to speake with you, (for further neuer ô <hi>Basilius</hi> looke for at my hands) I know not howe you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> can auoyde your wiues iealous attendaunce, but that her suspicion shall bring my honour into question. <hi>Basilius</hi> whose small sailes the leaste winde did fill, was forth with as farre gonne into a large promising him selfe his desire, as before hee was stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken downe with a threatned deuill. And therefore bending his browes as though he were not a man to take the matter as he had done, what saide hee, shall my wife <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> become my misteris? Thinke you not that thus much time hath taught mee to rule her? I will mewe the gentlewoman till she haue cast all her feathers, if she rouse her

selfe against me. And with that he walked vp and downe, nodding his head, as though they mistooke him much that thought he was not his wiues maister. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> now seeing it was time to conclude, of your wisdome and manhood sayd she, I doubt not, but that sufficeth not me, for both they can hardly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that you may see I doo not set light your affection, if to night after your wife be assuredly asleepe, whereof by your loue I coniure you, to haue a most precise care, you will steale handsomely to the caue vnto me, there do I graunt you as great proportion as you will take of free <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> conference with me, euer remembring you seeke no more, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or so shall you but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue your selfe, and for euer loose me. <hi>Basilius</hi> that was olde inough to know, that women are not wont to appoint secreat night meetings for the purchasing of land, holding himselfe alreadye an vndoubted possessour of his desires, kissing her hand, and lifting vp his eyes to heauen, as if the greatnes of the benefit did goe beyonde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> all measure of thankes, sayde no more, least sturring of more words, might bring forth some perhaps contrarye matter. In which traunce of ioye, <hi>Zelmane</hi> went from him, sayeng she would leaue him to the remembrance of their appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for her she would goe visite the Ladie <hi>Philoclea,</hi> into whose chamber being come, keeping still her late taken on grauitie, and asking her how she did, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> rather in the way of dutifull honour, then any speciall affection, with extreeme inward anguish to them both, she turned from her, and taking the Queene <hi>Ginae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> ledde her into a baye windowe of the same Chamber, determining in her selfe, not to vtter to so excellent a wit as <hi>Gynaecia</hi> had, the vttermost poynt of her preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded deuise, but to keepe the clause of it for the last instant, when the shortnes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> time should not geue her spirits leasure to looke into all those doubts, that easily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to an open inuention. But with smiling eyes, and with a deliuered ouer grace, fayning as much loue to her, as she did counterfeit loue to <hi>Philoclea,</hi> she began with more credible then eloquent speech to tell her, that with much consideracion of a matter so neerely importing her owne fancie, and <hi>Gynaecias</hi> honour, she had nowe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> concluded that the night following should be the fittest time for the ioyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their seuerall desires, what time sleepe should perfectly do his office vpon the King her husband, and that the one should come to the other into the Caue. Which place, as it was the fyrst receipt of their promised loue, so it might haue the fyrst honour of the due performance. That the cause why those fewe dayes past, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> she had not sought the lyke, was, least the newe chaunge of her lodging, might make the Duke more apte to marke anye sodayne euent: which nowe the vse of it would take out of his minde. And therefore nowe, most excellent Ladie sayde she, there resteth nothing but that quicklie after supper, you trayne vp the King to visit his daughter <hi>Philoclea,</hi> and then fayning your selfe not well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> at ease, by your going to bedde, drawe him not long to be after you. In the meane time I will be gone home to my lodging, where I will attend you, with no lesse deuocion, but as I hope with better fortune, then <hi>Thisbe</hi> did the toomuch louing and toomuch loued <hi>Piramus.</hi> The blood that quicklie ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e into <hi>Ginecias</hi> fayre face, was the only answeare she made, but that one might easily see, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> and consent were both to the full in her; which she did testifie with the wringing <hi>Zelmane</hi> fast by the hand, cloasing her eyes, &amp; letting her head fall, as if she would geue her to knowe, she was not ignorant of her fault, although she were
<pb facs="tcp:12151:187"/>
transported with the violence of her euill. But in this triple agreement did the daye seeme tedious of all sides, till his neuer erring course, had giuen place to the nightes succession: And the supper by eache hande hasted, was with no lesse speede ended, when <hi>Gynecia</hi> presenting a heauie sleepines in her countenance, brought vp both <hi>Basilius</hi> and <hi>Zelmane</hi> to see <hi>Philoclea</hi> still keeping her bedde, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> farre more sicke in minde then bodye, and more greeued then comforted with any such visitacion. Thence <hi>Zelmane</hi> wishing easefull rest to <hi>Philoclea,</hi> did seeme to take that nightes leaue of this princely crewe, when <hi>Gynecia</hi> likewise seeming somewhat deseased, desired <hi>Basilius</hi> to stay a while with her daughter, while she rocommended her sicknes to her beds comfort, in deede desirous to determine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> agayne of the manner of her stealing away; to no lesse comfort to <hi>Basilius,</hi> who the sooner she was asleepe, the sooner hoped to come by his long pursued praye. Thus both were bent to deceaue each other, and to take the aduantage of either others disaduantage. But <hi>Gyneacia</hi> hauing taken <hi>Zelmane</hi> into her bed-chamber, to speake a little with her of their sweete determinacion: <hi>Zelmane</hi> vpon a sodaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> (as though she had neuer thought of it before) Now the Gods forbid, sayde she, so great a Lady as you are should come to me: or that I should leaue it to the handes of fortune, if by eyther the ill gouerning of your passion, or your husbands sodayne waking, any daunger might happen vnto you. No, if there be any supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie in the poyntes of true loue, it shall be yours: if there be any daunger, since <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> my selfe am the author of this deuise, it is reason it should be mine. Therefore doo you but leaue with me the keyes of the gate, and vpon your selfe take my vpper garment, that if any of <hi>Damaetas</hi> house see you, they may thinke you to be my selfe, and I will presently lye downe in your place, so muffled for your supposed sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as the King shall nothing knowe me. And then as soone as he is a sleepe, will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> I (as it much better becommes me) waite vpon you. But if the vttermost of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes should happen, I can assure you the Kings life shall sooner pay for it, then your honour. And with the ending of her words, she threwe off her gowne, not geuing <hi>Gynaecia</hi> any space to take the full image of this newe chaunge into her fancie. But seeing no readye obiection against it in her heart, and knowing that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> there was no time then to stand long disputing; besides, remembring the geuer was to order the maner of his gift, yeelded quickly to this conceit, in deede not among the smallest causes, tickled therevnto by a certayne wanton desire, that her husbands deceipt might be the more notable. In this sort did <hi>Zelmane,</hi> nimbly disarayeng her selfe, possesse <hi>Gynaecias</hi> place, hiding her head in such a close man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> as grieuous and ouerwatched sicknesse in wont to inuite to itselfe the solace of sleepe. And of the other side the Queene putting on <hi>Zelmanes</hi> vtmost apparell, went fyrst into her closet, there quickly to beawtifie her selfe, with the best and sweetest night deckings. But there, casting an hastie eye ouer her precious things, which euer since <hi>Zelmanes</hi> comming, her head otherwise occupied had left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> she hapned to see a bottle of golde, vpon which downe along were graued these verses:
<q>
                  <l>Let him drinke this, whome long in armes to folde</l>
                  <l>Thou doest desire, and with free power to holde.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>
            <p>She remembred the bottle, for it had bene kept of long time by the Kings of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> as a thing of rare vertue, and giuen to her by her mother, when she being
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:12151:187"/>
very young maried to her husband of much greater age, her mother perswaded it was of propertie to force loue, with loue effects, had made a precious present of it to this her beloued child, though it had bene receiued rather by tradition to haue such a qualitie, then by any approued experiment. This <hi>Gynaecia,</hi> (according to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> common disposition, not only (though especiallie) of wiues, but of all other kindes of people, not to esteeme much ones owne, but to thinke the labor lost employed about it) had neuer cared to geue to her husband, but suffred his affection to runne according to his owne scope. But now that loue of her particular choyse had awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her spirits, and perchance the very vnlawfulnes of it had a litle blowne the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> coale: among her other ornaments with glad minde she tooke most part of this liquor, putting it into a faire cup, all set with diamonds: for what dares not loue vndertake armed with the night, and prouoked with lust? And thus downe she went to the Caue-ward, guyded only by the Moones faire shining, suffering no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought to haue any familiaritie with her braines, but that which did present <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> vnto her a picture of her approching contentment. She that had long disdayned this solitary life her husband had entred into, now wished it much more solitary, so she might only obtaine the priuate presence of <hi>Zelmane.</hi> She that before would not haue gone so farre, especially by night, and to so darke a place, now tooke a pride in the same courage, and framed in her minde a pleasure out of the payne it selfe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Thus with thicke doubled paces she went to the Caue, receyuing to her selfe, for her first contentment, the only lying where <hi>Zelmane</hi> had done: whose pillow she kist a thousand times, for hauing borne the print of that beloued head. And so kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, with panting heart, her trauelling fancies so attentiue, that the winde could stirre nothing, but that she stirred herselfe, as if it had bene the pace of the longed-for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
               <hi>Zelmane,</hi> she kept her side of the bed; defending only and cherishing the other side with her arme, till after a while wayting, counting with her selfe how many steps were betwixt the Lodge and the Caue, and oft accusing <hi>Zelmane</hi> of more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious stay then needed, she was visited with an vnexpected guest.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Basilius,</hi> after his wife was departed to her fayned repose, as long as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> with his daughter, to geue his wife time of vnreadying her selfe, it was easily seene it was a v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry thorny abode he made there: and the discourses with which he entertayned his daughter, not vnlike to those of earnest players, when, in the middest of their game, trifling questions be put vnto them, his eyes still loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king about, and himselfe still changing places, beginne to speake of a thing, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> breake it off before it were halfe done. To any speach <hi>Philoclea</hi> ministred vnto him, with a sodayne starting, and casting vp his head, make an answere farre out of all Grammer: a certayne deepe musing, and by and by out of it: vncertayne motions, vnstayed graces. Hauing borne out the limit of a reasonable time with as much payne as might be, he came darkeling into his chamber, forcing himselfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to treade as softly as he coulde. But the more curious he was, the more he thought euery thing creaked vnder him: and his minde being out of the way with another thought, and his eyes not seruing his turne in that darke place, each Coffer or Cupbord he met, one saluted his shinnes, another his elbowes: sometimes ready in reuenge to strike them agayne with his face. Till at length, fearing his wife <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> were not fully asleepe, he came lifting vp the cloathes, as gently as (I thinke) poore <hi>Pan</hi> did, when, in stead of <hi>Ioles</hi> bedde, he came into the rough imbracings of <hi>Hercules:</hi> and laying himselfe downe, as tenderly as a new Bride, rested a while
<pb facs="tcp:12151:188"/>
with a very open eare, to marke each breath of his supposed wife. And sometimes he himselfe would yeeld a long fetched sigh, as though that had bene a musike to drawe one another to sleepe, till within a very little while, with the other parties well counterfeyt sleepe (who was as willing to be rid of him, as he was to be gone thence) assuring himselfe he left all safe there, in the same order stale out agayne,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and putting on his night gowne, with much groping and scrambling, he gate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe out of the little house, and then did the Moone-light serue to guide his feete. Thus with a great deale of payne, did <hi>Basilius</hi> goe to her whome he fledde, and with much cunning left the person for whome he had employed all his cunning. But when <hi>Basilius</hi> was once gotten (as he thought) into a cleare coast what ioye he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> then made, how each thing seemed vile in his sight, in comparison of his fortune, how farre already he deemed himselfe in the chiefe tower of his desires, it were te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to tell: once his heart could not choose but yeeld this song, as a fayring of his contentment.</p>

            <p>Thus imagining as then with himselfe, his ioyes so held him vp, that he neuer touched ground. And, like a right olde beaten souldiour, that knewe well enough the greatest Captaynes do neuer vse long Orations, when it commes to the very point of execution, as soone as he was gotten into the Caue, and to the ioyfull (though silent) expectation of <hi>Gynaecia,</hi> come close to the bed, neuer recking his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to looke for nothing but conference, he lept into that side reserued for a more welcome guest. And layeng his louingest hold vpon <hi>Gynaecia:</hi> O <hi>Zelmane,</hi> sayd he, embrace in your fauor this humble seruant of yours: hold within me my heart, which pantes to leaue his maister to come vnto you. In what case poore <hi>Gynaecia</hi> was, when she knewe the voyce, and felt the bodie of her husband, faire Ladies,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> it is better to knowe by imagination then experience. For straight was her minde assaulted, partly with the being depriued of her vnquenched desire, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallie
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:12151:188"/>
with the doubt that <hi>Zelmane</hi> had betrayed her to her husband, besides the renewed sting of iealosie, what in the meane time might befall her daughter. But of the other side, her loue, with a fixed perswasion she had, taught her to seeke all reason of hopes. And therein thought best before discouering of her selfe, to marke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the behauiour of her husband; who, both in deedes and wordes still vsing her, as taking her to be <hi>Zelmane,</hi> made <hi>Gynaecia</hi> hope that this might be <hi>Basilius</hi> owne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, which <hi>Zelmane</hi> had not stayed, least she should discouer the matter which might be perfourmed at another time. Which hope accompanyed with <hi>Basilius</hi> maner of dealing, (he being at that time fuller of liuelier fancies, then many yeares <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> before he had bene) besides the remembrance of her daughters sicknesse, and late strange countenance betwixt her &amp; <hi>Zelmane,</hi> all comming together into her mind, which was loth to condemne it selfe of an vtter ouerthrow, made her frame her selfe, not truly with a sugred ioye, but with a determinate patience to let her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band thinke he had found a very gentle and supple-minded <hi>Zelmane</hi>; which he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> good man making full reckening of, did melt in as much gladnesse as she was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with diuers vngratefull burthens.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Pyrocles</hi> who had at this present no more to play the part of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> hauing so naturally measured the maner of his breathing, that <hi>Basilius</hi> made no doubt of his sounde sleeping, and layne a preatie while with a quiet vnquietnes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> his entended enterprise, as soone as by the debate betwixt <hi>Basilius</hi> shinnes and the vnregarding fourmes he perceiued that he had fully left the Lodge: after him went he with stealing steps, hauing his sword vnder his arme (still doubting least some mischance might turne <hi>Basilius</hi> backe againe) downe to the gate of the Lodge. Which not content to locke fast, he barred and fortified with as many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> as his wit and haste would suffer him, that so he might haue full time both for making readye <hi>Philoclea,</hi> and conueying her to her horse, before any might come in to finde them missing. For further endes of those endes, and what might ensue of this action, his loue and courage well matched neuer looked after, houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for an assured grounde, that whosoeuer in great things will thinke to preuent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> all obiections, must lye still, and doo nothing. This determination thus wayed, the first part thus perfourmed, vp to <hi>Philocleas</hi> chamber dore went <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> rapt from himselfe with the excessiue fore-feeling of his (as he assured himselfe) neere comming contentment. What euer paynes he had taken, what daungers he had runne into, and especially those sawcy pages of loue, doubts, griefes, languishing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> hopes, and threatning despayres, came all now to his minde, in one ranke to beaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifye his expected blisfulnesse, and to serue for a most fit sawce, whose sourenesse might giue a kinde of life to the delightfull cheare his imagination fed vpon.

And that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing effected with al the sweet mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s his wits could deuise, though his highest hopes were by this vnexpected downfall sunke deeper the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any degree of dispaire: yet lest the appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his inward grief might occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her further disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, hauing racked <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> his face to a more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable sembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he sought some shew of reason, to shew shee had no reason, either for him, or for her selfe so to be aflicted. Which in the sweete minded <hi>Philoclea,</hi> whose consideration was limited by his wordes, and whose
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:12151:191"/>
conceite pearced no deeper then his outwarde countenaunce, wrought within a while such quietnesse of mind, and that quietnesse againe such repose of bodie, that slepe by his harbingers weakenesse, wearines, and watchfulnes, had quickly taken vp his lodging in all her senses. Then indeed had <hi>Pyrocles</hi> leasure to sit in iudgement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> on himselfe, and to heare his reason accuse his rashnes, who, without forecaste of doubte, without knowledge of his friende, without acquainting <hi>Philoclea</hi> with his purpose or being made acquainted with her present estate, had falne headlong into that attempt, the successe whereof hee had long since set downe to himselfe as the measure of all his other fortunes. But calling to minde howe weakely they do that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> rather finde faulte with what cannot be amended, then seek to amend wherein they haue beene faultie: he soone turned him from remembring what might haue beene done to considering what was now to be done, and when that consideration fayled what was now to be expected. Wherein hauing runne ouer all the thoughts, his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son called to the strictest accountes could bring before him, at length he lighted on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> this: That as long as <hi>Gynecia</hi> bewraied not the matter (which he thought she woulde not doe, aswell for her owne honour and safetie, as for the hope she might stil haue of him, which is loth to die in a louers hart) all the rest might turne to a preatie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryment, and enflame his louer <hi>Basilius,</hi> againe to cast aboute for the missed fauour. And as naturally the harte stuffed vp with wofulnes is glad greedelie to sucke the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> thinnest aire of comforte: so did hee, at the first, embrace this conceite as offeringe great hope, if not assurance of well doing. Till looking more neerely into it, and not able to answere the doubts and difficulties he sawe therein more and more arising the night being also farre spent, his thoughtes euen wearie of their owne burthens, fell to a straying kind of vncertaintie: and his minde standing onely vpon the nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> of inward intelligences lefte his bodie to giue a sleeping respite to his vitall spirites, which he, according to the qualitie of Sorrow, receiued with greater greedines then euer in his life before. According to the nature of sorrow, I say, which is past cares remedie. For care sturring the braines, and making thinne the spirites breaketh rest: but those griefes wherein one is determined there is no preuenting, do brede a dull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> heauinesse which easely clothes it selfe in sleepe. So as laid downe so neare the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the worlde <hi>Philoclea,</hi> that their neckes were subiect each to others chaste em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements, it seemed loue had come thither to laye a plott in that picture of death how gladly, if death came, their soules would goe together.</p>

               <p>THE almightie wisedome euermore delighting to shewe the world, that by vnlikeliest meanes greatest matters may come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> to conclusion: that humane reason may be the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and more willinglie geue place to diuine prouidence: as at the first it brought in <hi>Damaetas</hi> to play a part in this royall pageant, so hauing continued him still an actor, now that all things were growne ripe for an end, made his folly the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> of reuealing that, which far greater cunning had sought to conceale. For so it fell out that <hi>Damaetas</hi> hauing spent the whole day in breaking vp the cumbersome worke of the pastor <hi>Dorus,</hi> and feeling in all his labour no paine so much, as that his hungrie hopes receiued any stay, hauing with the price of much sweate and wearinesse gotten vp the huge stone, which he thought should haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> such a golden lining, the good man in the great bed that stone had made, founde nothing but these two verses, written vpon a broad piece of velume:
<q>
                     <l>Who hath his hire, hath well his labour plast:</l>
                     <l>Earth thou didst seeke, and store of earth thou has<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>What an inward discountenance it was to maister <hi>Damaetas,</hi> to finde his hope of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> wealth turned to poore verses, for which he neuer cared much, nothing can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, but either the feeling in ones selfe the state of such a minde <hi>Damaetas</hi> had, or at least the bethinking what was <hi>Midas</hi> fancie, when after the great pride he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to be made Iudge betweene Gods, he was rewarded with the ornament of an Asses eares. Yet the deepe apprehension he had receiued of such riches, could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> not so sodainlie loose the coullor that had so throughlie died his thicke braine, but that he turned and tossed the poore bowels of the innocent earth, till the comming on of the night, and the tediousnes of his frutelesse labor made him content rather to exercise his discontentation at home then there. But forced he was (his horse being otherwise burthened with digging instruments) to returne, as he came, most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> part of the way on foote: with such grudging lamentations as a nobler minde would (but more noblie) make for the losse of his mistresse. For so farre had he fed his foolish soule with the expectation of that which he reputed felicitie, that he no lesse accompted himselfe miserable, then if he had falne from such an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state his fancie had embraced. So then home againe went <hi>Damaetas,</hi> punished <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> in conceite, as in conceite he had erred, till he founde himselfe there from a fancied losse falne to essentiall miserie. For entring into his house three houres

within night, in steede of the lightsome countenance of <hi>Pamela,</hi> which gaue such an inwarde decking to that lodge, as prowdest pallaces might haue cause to enuie it; and of the gratefull conuersation of <hi>Dorus,</hi> whose wittie behauiour made that lonelines to seeme ful of good company: in steed of the loude scolding of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                  <hi>Miso,</hi> and the busie rumbling vp and downe of <hi>Mopsa,</hi> which though they were so shorte, as quite contrarie to the others praise-worthines, yet were they farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in filling of a house: he founde nothing but a solitarie darkenesse; which as naturally it breedes a kinde of irksome gastfulnes, so it was to him a most present terror, remembring the charge he had left behinde, which hee well knew imported <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> no lesse then his life vnto him. Therefore lighting a candle, there was no place a mouse could haue dwelled in, but that he with quaking diligence sought into. But when he saw hee could see nothing of that hee most cared for, then became hee the right patterne of a wretch deiected with feare: for crying and howling, knockinge his head to the wall hee began to make pittifull complaintes where no body coulde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> heare him: and with too much dread he should not recouer her, leaue all considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how to recouer her. But at length looking like a she goate, when she casts her kidd, for verie sorrow he tooke in his owne behalfe, out of the lodge hee went run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as hard as he could; hauing now receiued the verie forme of hanging into his consideration. Thus running as a man would gladly haue runne from himselfe, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> was his foolish fortune to espie, by the glim'ring light of the moone did then yeelde him, one standing aloft among the bowes of a faire ashe. He that would haue asked counsell at that time of a dogg, cast vp his face, as if his tooth had bene drawing: and with much bending his sight perceiued it was mistres <hi>Mopsa,</hi> fitly seated there for wit and dignitie: There (I will not say with ioye, for how could he tast of ioy, whose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> imagination was falne from a pallace, to a gallowes?) But yet with some refreshing of comfort, in hope he should learne better tidings: of her, he began to crie out: O <hi>Mopsa</hi> my beloued chicken, here am I thine owne father <hi>Damaetas,</hi> neuer in such a towardnes of hanging, if thou canst not helpe me. But neuer a word coulde his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence procure of <hi>Mopsa,</hi> who indeed was there attending for greater matters. This <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> was yet a newe burthen to poore <hi>Damaetas,</hi> who thought all the worlde was conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red against him: and therefore with a seely choler he began another tune. Thou vile <hi>Mopsa,</hi> saide he, now the vengeance of my fatherly curse light ouerthwart thee, if thou doe not streight answere me. But neither blessing nor cursing coulde preuaile <hi>Mopsa,</hi> who was now great with childe, with the expectation of her may-game <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> hopes, and did long to be deliuered with the thirde time being named. Which by and by followed. For <hi>Damaetas</hi> rubbing his elbowe, stamping and whining, seing neither of these take place, began to throwe stones at her, and withall to coniure her by the name of hellish <hi>Mopsa.</hi> But when he had named her the third time, no chime can more sodainly follow the striking of a Clocke, then shee, verily thinking it was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the God, that vsed her fathers voice, throwing our armes abroade, and not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing she was muffled vpon so high a tree, came fluttering down, like a hooded hawke; like enough to haue broken her neck, but that the tree full of bowes tossed her from one bow to another, and lastly well brused brought her to receiue an vnfrindly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation of the earth. <hi>Damaetas,</hi> as soone as she was downe, came running to her: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> finding her so close wrapt, pulled of the scarlet cloake: in good time for her, for with the sorenesse of the fall, if she had not had breath giuen her, she had deliuered a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish soule to <hi>Pluto.</hi> But then <hi>Damaetas</hi> began a fresh to desire his daughter not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb facs="tcp:12151:202"/>
the paines he had taken for her in her childhoode (which he was sure she could not remember) and to tell him where <hi>Pamela</hi> was. O good <hi>Apollo,</hi> saide <hi>Mopsa,</hi> if euer thou didest beare loue to <hi>Phaethons</hi> mother, let me haue a King to my husband Alas, what speakest thou of <hi>Phaethon</hi>? Saide <hi>Damaetas</hi>: If by thy circumspect meanes I finde not out <hi>Pamela,</hi> thy father will be hanged to morrow. It is no matter though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> he be hanged, answered <hi>Mopsa:</hi> doe but thou make <hi>Dorus</hi> a King, and let him bee my husband, good <hi>Apollo</hi>: for my courage doth much pricke mee towarde him. Ah <hi>Mopsa,</hi> cryed out <hi>Damaetas,</hi> where is thy witt? Doest thou not know thy father? How hast thou forgotten thy selfe? I do not aske witt of thee mine owne God, said shee: but I see thou wouldest haue me remember my father, and indeede forget <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> my selfe. No, no, a good husband, thou shalt haue thy fill of husbandes saide <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maetas,</hi> and doe but answere me my question. O I thanke thee saide <hi>Mopsa,</hi> withall my harte hartely: but let them bee all Kinges. <hi>Damaetas</hi> seing no other way preuaile fel downe on his knees, <hi>Mopsa Mopsa,</hi> saide he, doe not thus cruelly torment me: I am already wretched enough, alas either helpe me or tell me thou canst not. She <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> that woulde not bee behinde <hi>Apollo</hi> in curtesie, kneeled downe on thother side, I wil neuer leaue tormenting thee said <hi>Mopsa,</hi> vntill thou hast satisfied my longing, but I will proclaime thee a promise breaker, that euen <hi>Iupiter</hi> shall heare it. Now by the fostring thou hast receaued in this place saue my life saide <hi>Damaetas,</hi> now by the faire Ash aunswered <hi>Mopsa,</hi> where thou didest receaue so great a good turne, graunt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> post haste to my burning fancie. O where is <hi>Pamela</hi> saide <hi>Damaetas</hi>? O a lustie hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, saide <hi>Mopsa; Damaetas</hi> that nowe verely assured himselfe, his daughter was madd, beganne vtterly to dispaire of his life, and therefore amazedly catching her in his armes, to see whether hee coulde bring her to her selfe, hee might feele the weight of of a greate cudgell light vpon his shoulders, and for the first greeting hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> knew his wife <hi>Misos</hi> voice, by the calling him ribaulde villaine, &amp; asking him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she coulde not serue his turne as well as <hi>Charita</hi>? For <hi>Miso</hi> hauing according to <hi>Dorus</hi> counsaile, gone to <hi>Mantinea,</hi> and there harboured her selfe in an olde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaunce house of hers, as soone as tenne of the clocke was striken (where shee had remayned closely all that while, I thinke with such an amiable cheare, as when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> iealous <hi>Iuno</hi> sate crosse-legged, to hinder the child-birth of her husbands loue) with open mouth shee went to the Magistrate appointed ouer such matters, and there with the most scolding inuectiue, her rage rather then eloquence could bring forth, she required his ayde to take <hi>Damaetas,</hi> who had lefte his dutie to the Kinge and his daughter, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit adultery in the house of <hi>Charitas</hi> vncle, in the Ondemian streete.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> But neither was the name of <hi>Charita</hi> remembred, nor any such streete knowne. Yet such was the generall mislike all men had of <hi>Damaetas</hi> vnworthy aduancement, that euery man was glad to make himselfe a minister of that, which might redounde to his shame, and therfore with <hi>Panike</hi> cries and laughters, there was no suspected place in all the cittie but was searched for vnder the title of <hi>Damaetas; Miso</hi> euer formost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cowraging <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> them withall the shamefull blasings of his demeanoure, encreasing the sporte of hunting her husband, with her diligent barking, till at length hauing alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done both him and her selfe, as much infamous shame, as such a tonge in such an action might performe, in the end not being, able to find a thing that was not, to her mare again she we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hauing neither suspition nor rage any thing mitigated. But (lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> behinde her a sufficient comedie of her tragicall fancies) away homewarde she
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:12151:202"/>
came, imputing the not finding her husband, to any chaunce, rather then to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie. For her harte being apt to receaue and nourish a bitter thought it had so swallowed vp a determinate condemnation, that in the verie anotomie of her spirits one should haue found nothing but diuelish disdaine, and hatefull iealousie. In this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> sorte grunting out her mischeuous spite, shee came by the tree, euen as <hi>Damaetas</hi> was making that ill vnderstoode intercession, to his foolish <hi>Mopsa.</hi> As soone as she harde her husbands voice, she verily thought she had her playe: and therefore stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from her mare as softely as she coulde, shee came creeping and halting behinde him, euen as he thinking his daughters little witts had quite lefte her great nowle; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> beganne to take her in his armes; thinking perchaunce her feeling sence might call her mind partes vnto her. But <hi>Miso</hi> who sawe nothing but thorowe the coulloure of reuenge-full anger, established vpon the fore-iudgement of his trespasse, vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly resoluing that <hi>Mopsa</hi> was <hi>Charita, Dorus</hi> had tolde her of, mumping out her hoarse chafe, she gaue him the wooden salutation you hearde of. <hi>Damaetas</hi> that was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> not so sensible in any thing as in blows, turned vp his blubbred face like a great lowt newe whipte: Alas thou woman, said hee, what hath thy poore husband deserued to haue his owne ill lucke loaden with thy displeasure? <hi>Pamela</hi> is lost, <hi>Pamela</hi> is lost. <hi>Miso</hi> still holding on the course of her former fancie, what tellest thou mee naughtie varlet of <hi>Pamela,</hi> doest thou thinke that doth aunswere me, for abusing the lawes of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> marriage? Haue I brought thee children, haue I bene a true wife vnto thee, to bee dispised in mine olde age? And euer among shee woulde sawce her speeches with such Bastonados, that poore <hi>Damaetas</hi> beganne now to thinke, that either a generall madding was falne, or else that all this was but a vision. But as for visions the smarte of the cudgell put out of his fancie: and therefore againe turning to his wife, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> knowing in the world what she ment, <hi>Miso</hi> said hee, hereafter thou maiest examine me, doe but now tell me what is become of <hi>Pamela.</hi> I will first examine this drabbe said she, and withall let fall her stafe as hard as she could vpon <hi>Mopsa,</hi> still taking her for <hi>Charita.</hi> But <hi>Mopsa</hi> that was alredy angry, thinking that she had hindred her from <hi>Apollo,</hi> lepte vp and caught her by the throte, like to haue strangled her, but that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
                  <hi>Damaetas</hi> from a condemned man was faine to become a iudge and part this fayre, such a picture of a rude discord, where each was out with the other two. And then getting the opportunitie of their falling out, to holde himselfe in suretie, who was indeede, the veriest coward of the three, he renewed his earnest demaund of them. But it was a sporte to see, how the former conceites <hi>Dorus</hi> had printed in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> kept still such dominion in them, that <hi>Miso</hi> though now shee founde and felte it was her daughter <hi>Mopsa,</hi> yet did <hi>Charita</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually passe through her thoughts which she vttered with such crabbed questions to <hi>Damaetas,</hi> that hee not possiblie conceauing any parte of her doubt, remained astonished, and the astonishment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased her doubt. And as for <hi>Mopsa,</hi> as first she did assuredly take him to be <hi>Apollo</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and thought her mothers comming did marre the bargaine: So now much talkinge to and fro, had deliuered so much light, into the mistie mould of her capacitie, as to know him to be her father: Yet remayned there such foote-steppes of the foretaken opinion, that shee thought verily her father and mother were hasted thether to gett the first wishe. And therefore to whatsoeuer they asked of her, she would neuer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> but embracing the tree, as if she feared it had bene running awaye, nay sayes shee I will haue the first wish for I was here first; which they vnderstoode no more, then <hi>Damaetas</hi> did what <hi>Miso</hi> ment by <hi>Charita</hi>: till at length with much vrging them,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:203"/>
being indeede better able to perswade both, then to meete hande to hand with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he preuailed so much with them, as to bring them into the lodge to see what losse their necligence had suffered. Then indeed the nere neighborhood they bare to themselues, made them leaue other toyes, and look into what dangerous plight they were all faln, assone as the King should know his daughters escape. And as for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the wemen they beganne a fresh to enter into their brawling, whether were in the faulte. But <hi>Damaetas</hi> who did feare that among his other euills, the thunderbolt of that storme would fall vpon his shoulders, slipte away from them, but with so mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre a cheare as might much sooner engender laughter then pittie. O true <hi>Arcadia</hi> would he say (tearinge his haire and bearde, &amp; somtime for too much woe, making <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> vnweldie somerfaults) how darest thou beare vpon thee such a felonious traytor as I am? And you false harted trees, why woulde you make no noyse, to make her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratious departure known? Ah <hi>Pamela Pamela,</hi> how often whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I brought thee in fine posies of all coulored flowers wouldest thou clappe me on the cheek, and say thou wouldst be on day euen with me? Was this thy meaning to bring me to an eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> of gallows? Ah il taught <hi>Dorus</hi> that camest hither to learne good maners of me? Did I euer teach thee to make thy maister sweate out his hart for nothing, &amp; in the meane time to run away thy mistres? O my dun cow, I did think so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e euil was towards me, euer since the last day thou didst run away from me, &amp; held vp thy taile so piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: did not I se an eagle kil a Cuckoe, which was plain fore token vnto me <hi>Pamela</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> should be my destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? O wife <hi>Miso</hi> (if I durst say it to thy face) why didst thou suspect thy husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that loueth a peece of chese better then a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? And thou litle <hi>Mopsa</hi> that shalt inherite the shame of thy fathers death, was it time for thee to clime trees, which should so shortly be my best buriall? ô that I could liue without death, or die before I were aware. O hart why hast thou no hands at commaundement to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> dispatch thee? O hands why want you a hart to kill this villanie? In this sorte did he inuey against euery thing, sometimes thinking to haue away, while it was yet night: but he that had included all the world within his shepecote, thought that worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any death sometime for dread of hanging hee ment to hange himselfe: finding as in deede it is, that feare is farre more paynfull to cowardise, then death to a true cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> But his fingers were nothing nimble in that action; &amp; any thing was let inough thereto, he being a true louer of himselfe without any ryuall. But lastly guided by a farre greater constellacion then his owne, he remembred to search the other lodge where it might be <hi>Pamela</hi> that night had retired her selfe. So thether with trembling hammes hee carried himselfe, but employinge his double keye which the Kinge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> for speciall credit had vnworthylie bestowed vpon him, hee found all the gates so barred, that his key could not preuaile, sauing onely one trapt doore which went down into a vault by the seller which as it was vnknowen of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> so had he lefte it vnregarded. But <hi>Damaetas</hi> that euer know the buttery better then any other place, got in that way and pasing softly to <hi>Philocleas</hi> chamber, where he thought most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to finde <hi>Pamela,</hi> the doore being left open hee entred in, and by the light of the lampe, he might discerne on in bed with her: which he although hee tooke to bee <hi>Pamela,</hi> yet thinking no suretie enough in a matter touchinge his necke, hee went heard to the bedside of these vnfortunate louers, whoe at that time being not much before the breake of day (whether it were they were so diuinely surprised, to bring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> this whole matter to be destinied conclusion, or that the vnresistable force of their sorrowes, had ouerthrowne the wakefull vse of their senses) were as then possessed,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:12151:203"/>
with a mutuall sleep) yet not forgetting with viny embracements, to giue any eye a perfect modell of affection. But <hi>Damaetas</hi> looking with the lampe in his hande but neither with such a face nor mind) vpon these excellent creatures, as <hi>Psyche</hi> did vpon her vnknowen louer, and giuing euery way freedome to his fearefull eyes, did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> not onely perceaue it was <hi>Zelmane</hi> and therefore much different from the Lady hee sought: but that this same <hi>Zelmane</hi> did more differ from the <hi>Zelmane</hi> hee and others had euer taken her for, wherein the chaunge of her apparell chiefely confirmed his opinion satisfied with that, and not thinking it good to awake the sleeping Lyon, he went downe againe, taking with him <hi>Pyrocles</hi> sworde, (wherewith vpon his sleight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> vndersute <hi>Pyrocles</hi> came onely apparelled thether) being sure to leaue no weapon in the chamber, and so making the doore as fast as hee coulde on the outside, hopinge with the reuealing of this, (as hee thought greater fault) to make his owne the lesse, or at least that this iniurie would so fill the Kinges head, that he should not haue ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to chastice his necligence (like a fool not considering that the more rage breeds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the crueller punishment) he went first into the Kings chamber, and not finding him there, he ranne downe crying with open mouth, the Kinge was betrayde, and that <hi>Zelmane</hi> did abuse his daughter. The noise he made being a man of no few wordes ioyned to the yelping sound of <hi>Miso,</hi> and his vnpleasant enheritrix brought together some number of the shepheards, to whom he without any regard of reseruing it for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the Kinges knowledge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Turning therefore all their minds and eyes that way, they ranne to the Caue where they said he lay dead, the Sunne beginning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> now to send some promise of comming light, making hast I thinke to bee spectator of the folowing tragedies. For <hi>Basilius</hi> hauing past ouer the night more happie in contemplation then action, hauing had his spirits sublymed with the sweete ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of embrasing the most desired <hi>Zelmane,</hi> doubting least me Caues darknes might deceaue him in the dayes approch, thought it nowe season to returne to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> wedlocke bed, remembring the promise he had made <hi>Zelmane,</hi> to obserue due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders towards <hi>Gynecia.</hi> Therefore departing but not departing without bequeathing by a will of wordes, sealed with many kisses, a full guifte of all his loue and life to his misconceaued bedfellowe, he went to the mouth of the Caue, there to apparel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in which doing the motion of his ioye coulde not bee bridled from vttering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> such like wordes.

But because of the one side (finding the King did thinke her to be <hi>Zelmane</hi> she had libertie to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it might rather be the Kings owne vnbridled enterprise, which had barred <hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> then <hi>Zelmanes</hi> cunning deceiuing of her, and that of the other if shee shoulde heddilie seeke a violent reuenge her owne honour might bee as much interessed, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>

Alas, hath my faithfull obseruing my parte of duety made you thinke your selfe euer a whit the more exempted? Hath that which should claime gratefulnes, bene a cause of contempt? Is the being the mother of <hi>Pamela,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an odious name vnto you? If my life hetherto ledde haue not auoyded suspicion? If my violated truth to you be deseruing of any punishment, I refuse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> not to be chastised with the most cruell torment of your displeasure, I refuse not misery, purchased by mine owne merite. Hard I must needes saye, (although till now I neuer thought I should haue had cause to saye) is the destinie of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mankinde, the tryall of whose vertue must stande vpon the louing of them, that employe all theyr industrie not to be beloued. If <hi>Zelmanes</hi> young yeares had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> not had so much grauitie hidden vnder a youthfull face, as your graye heares haue bene but the visar of vnfitting youthfulnes, your vicious minde had brought some fruites of repentance, and <hi>Gynaecia</hi> might then haue bene with much more right so basely despised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Basilius</hi> that was more ashamed to see himselfe so ouertaken, then <hi>Vulcan</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> was, when with much cunning hee proued himselfe a Cuckolde, beganne to make certayne extrauagant excuses: but the matter in it selfe hardly brooking any purgacion, with the suddainnes of the time, which barred any good conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned inuention, made him sometimes alledge one thing, to which by and by he would bring in a contrarye, one time with flat denyall, another time with miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> the fault, now braue, then humble, vse such a stammering defensiue, that <hi>Gynaecia,</hi> the violence of whose sore in deede ranne another waye, was content thus to fasten vp the last stitch of her anger. Well, well my Lorde, sayde she, it shall well become you so to gouerne your selfe, as you may be fit rather to direct me, then to be iudged of me; and rather to be a wise maister of me, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> an vnskilfull pleader before me. Remember the wrong you haue done is not onely to me, but to your children, whome you had of mee: to your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, when they shall finde they are commaunded by him, that can not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund his owne vndecent appetites: lastly to your selfe, since with these paynes you do but build vp a house of shame to dwell in: if from those moueable goods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> of nature (wherewith, in my fyrst youth my royall parents bestowed me vppon you) bearing you children, and encrease of yeares haue withdrawen me, consider I pray you, that as you are cause of the one, so in the other, time hath not left to worke his neuer-fayling effectes in you. Truly, truly Sir, very vntimely are these fyres in you: it is time for vs both to let reason enioye his due soueraigntie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Let vs not plant anewe those weedes, which by natures course are content to fade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Basilius</hi> that would rather then his life the matter had bene ended, the best retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike he had, was flat demanding pardon of her, swearing it was the very force of <hi>Apollos</hi> destenye which had caryed him thus from his owne bias; but that nowe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> like as farre trauellers were taught to loue their owne countrie, he had such a lesson without booke, of affection vnto her, as he would repay the debt of this error with the interest of a great deale more true honour then euer before he had done her:
<pb facs="tcp:12151:205"/>
neyther am I to geue pardon to you my Lord, sayd she, nor you to beare honour to me. I haue taken this boldnes for the vnfayned loue I owe vnto you, to deliuer my sorrowe vnto you; much more for the care I haue of your well doing, then for any other selfe fancie. For well I knowe that by your good estate my life is mayntayned, neyther, if I would, can I separate my selfe from your fortune. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> my parte therefore I clayme nothing but that which may be safest for your selfe; my life, will, honor, and what soeuer else, shall be but a shadow of that bodie. How much <hi>Basilius</hi> owne shame had found him culpable, and had alreadie euen in soule read his owne condemnacion, so much did this vnexpected mildnes of <hi>Gynaecia</hi> captiue his harte vnto her, which otherwise perchaunce would haue growne to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a desperat carelesnes. Therefore embracing her, and confessing that her vertue shined in his vice, he did euen with a true resolued minde vowe vnto her, that as long as he vnworthie of her did liue, she should be the furthest and onlie limit of his affection. He thanked the destenies, that had wrought her honour out of his shame, and that had made his owne striuing to goe amisse, to be the best meane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> euer after to hold him in the right pathe. Thus reconciled to <hi>Basilius</hi> great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion, who began something to marke himselfe in his owne doings, his hard hap guided his eye to the cuppe of golde, wherein <hi>Gynaecia</hi> had put the lickour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>Zelmane,</hi> and hauing fayled of that guest, was now carrying it home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne. But he whome perchaunce sorrowe, perchaunce some long disaccustomed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> paynes, had made extremely thirstie, tooke it out of her handes, although she di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tolde him, both of whome she had it, what the effect of it was, and the little proofe she had seene thereof; hiding nothing from him, but that she ment to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister it to another pacient. But the Duke whose belly had no eares, and much drouthe kept from the desiring a taster, finding it not vnpleasant to his pallate,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> dranke it almost off, leauing very little to couer the cuppes bottome. But within a while that from his stomacke the drincke had deliuered to his principall vaynes his noysome vapours, first with a painefull stretching, and forced yawning, then with a darke yellownes dyeng his skinne, and a colde deadlie sweate principally about his temples, his bodie by naturall course longing to deliuer his heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> to his earthly damme, wanting force in his knees, which vtterly abandoned him, with heauie fall gaue some proofe whether the operation of that vnknowne potion tended. For with pang-like grones, and gastly turning of his eyes, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlie all his limmes stiffened, and his eyes fixed, he hauing had time to declare his case only in these wordes. O <hi>Gynaecia</hi> I dye. Haue care: of what or how much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> he would haue spoken, no man can tell. For <hi>Gynaecia</hi> hauing well perceyued the changing of his cullour, and those other euill signes, yet had not looked for such a sodaine ouerthrowe, but rather had bethought her selfe what was best for him, when she sodainely sawe the matter come to that periode, comming to him, and neyther with any cryes getting a worde of him, nor with any other possible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> meanes, able to bring any liuing action from him, the height of all ouglie sorrowes did so horrible appeare before her amazed minde, that at the first, it did not only distract all power of speech from her, but almost wit to consider, remayning as it were quicke buried in a graue of miseries. Her paynefull memorie had streight filled her with the true shapes of all the fore-past mischiefes, her reason began to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> crye out against the filthye rebellion of sinfull sense, and to teare it selfe with anguish, for hauing made so weake resistance, her conscience a terrible witnes
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:12151:205"/>
of the inwarde wickednes, still nourishing this debatefull fyre; her complaynte nowe not hauing an ende to be directed vnto something to disburden sorrowe, but a necessary downefall of inwarde wretchednes. She sawe the rigour of the lawes was like to lay a shamefull death vpon her, which being for that action vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserued, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> made it the more insupportable, and yet in deapth of her soule most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, made it more miserable. At length letting her tong goe as her dolorous thoughts guided it, she thus with lamentable demeanour spake.</p>
               <p>O bottomles pit of sorrowe, in which I cannot conteyne my selfe, hauing the fyrebrands of all furyes within me, still falling, and yet by the infinitenes of it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> neuer falne. Neyther can I ridde myselfe, being fettred with the euerlasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideracion of it. For whether should I recommend the protection of my disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored fall? to the earth? it hath no life, and waites to be encreased by the reliques of my shamed carcasse: to men? who are alwayes cruell in their neighboures faultes, and make others ouerthrowe become the badge of their ill masked ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> to the heauens? ô vnspeakeable torment of conscience, which dare not looke vnto them. No sinne can enter there, oh there is no receipt for polluted mindes. Whether then wilt thou leade this captiue of thine, ô snakye despayre? Alas, alas, was this the free-holding power that accursed poyson hath graunted vnto me, that to be held the surer it should depriue life? was this the folding in mine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> armes promised, that I should fould nothing but a dead body? O mother of mine, what a deathfull sucke haue you geuen me? O <hi>Philoclea, Philoclea,</hi> well hath my mother reuenged vppon me my vnmotherly hating of thee. O <hi>Zelmane,</hi> to whome yet (least any miserye should fayle me) remayne some sparkes of my detestable loue, if thou hast (as now alas! now my minde assures me thou hast) deceaued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> me, there is a fayre stage prepared for thee, to see the tragicall ende of thy hated loues. With that worde there flowed out two riuers of teares out of her fayre eyes, which before were drye, the remembraunce of her other mischiefes being dryed vp in furious fyre of selfe detestation, loue only according to the temper of it melting it selfe into those briny tokens of passion. Then turning her eyes agayne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> vpon the body, she remembred a dreame she had had some nights before, wherein thinking herselfe called by <hi>Zelmane,</hi> passing a troublesome passage, she found a dead body which tolde her there should be her only rest. This no sooner caught holde of her remembraunce, then that she determining with her selfe, it was a directe vision of her fore-appoynted ende, tooke a certayne resolucion to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> death, assoone as it should be offred vnto her, and no way to seeke the prolonging of her annoyed life. And therefore kissing the cold face of <hi>Basilius</hi>; And euen so will I rest sayd she, and ioyne this faultye soule of mine to thee, if so much the angry gods will graunt mee.</p>
               <p>As shee was in this plight, the Sunne nowe climing ouer our Horizon, the first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Shepherds came by, who seeing the King in that case, and hearing the noyse <hi>Damae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> made of the Lady <hi>Philoclea,</hi> ranne with the dolefull tidings of <hi>Basilius</hi> death vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, who presently with all his company came to the Caues entrye where the Kings body lay. <hi>Damaetas</hi> for his parte more glad for the hope he had of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate escape, then sorye for the publike losse his Countrie receaued for a Prince <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> not to be misliked. But in <hi>Gynaecia</hi> nature preuayled aboue iudgement; and the shame shee conceaued to be taken in that order, ouercame for that instant the former resolucion, so that assoone as she sawe the formost of the pastorall
<pb facs="tcp:12151:206"/>
troupe, the wretched Princesse ranne to haue hid her face in the next woods, but with such a minde, that she knewe not almost her selfe what she could wish to be the grounde of her safetie. <hi>Damaetas</hi> that sawe her runne awaye in <hi>Zelmanes</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rayment, and iudging her to be so, thought certaynely all the spirits in hell were come to play a Tragedie in these woods, such strange change he sawe euery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> way. The King dead at the Caues mouth; the Queene as hee thought absent; <hi>Pamela</hi> fledde away with <hi>Dorus</hi>; his wife and <hi>Mopsa</hi> in diuers franzies. But of all other things <hi>Zelmane</hi> conquered his capacitie, sodainly from a woman growne to a man; and from a lockt chamber gotten before him into the fieldes, which hee gaue the rest quicklie to vnderstande; for in steede of doing any thing as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> exigent required, he beganne to make circles, and all those fantasticall defences that hee had euer hearde were fortifications against Diuells. But the other Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards who had both better wittes, and more faith, forthwith deuided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, some of them running after <hi>Gynecia,</hi> and esteeming her running away, a great condemnation of her owne guiltinesse; others going to their Prince, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> see what seruice was left for them eyther in recouerie of his life, or honoring his death. They that went after the Queene, had soone ouertaken her, in whome nowe the fyrst feares were stayde, and the resolucion to dye had repossessed his place in her minde. But when they sawe it was the Queene, to whome besides the obedient dutie they ow'de to her state, they had alwayes carried a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> singuler loue, for her courteous liberalities, and other wise and vertuous partes, which had filled all that people with affection and admiracion. They were all sodainely stopped, beginning to aske pardon for their followinge her in that sorte, and desiring her to be their good Ladie, as she had euer bene. But the Queene who nowe thirsted to be ridde of her selfe, whome she hated aboue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> all thinges with such an assured countenance as they haue, who alreadie haue dispensed with shame, and digested the sorrowes of death, she thus sayde vnto them. Continue, continue, my friends: your doing is better then your excusing, the one argues assured faith, the other want of assurance. If you loued your Prince, when he was able and willing to doo you much good, which you could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> not then requite to him; doo you now publish your gratefulnes, when it shall be seene to the world, there are no hopes left to leade you vnto it. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, remember you haue lost <hi>Basilius</hi> a Prince to defend you, a Father to care for you, a companyon in your ioyes, a friend in your wants. And if you loued him, shew you hate the author of his losse. It is I, faithfull <hi>Arcadians,</hi> that haue spoyled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> the Countrie of their protector. I, none but I, was the minister of his vnnaturall end. Cary therfore my blood in your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, to testifie your own innocencie, neither spare for my titles sake, but consider it was he that so entituled me. And if you think of any benefits by my meanes, thinke with it that I was but the instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and he the spring. What stay ye Shepheards whose great Shepheard is gone? you neede not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> feare a woman, reuerence your Lords murtherer, nor haue pittie of her, who hath not pittie of herself. With this she presented her faire neck; some by name, others by signes, desired them to do iustice to the world, dutie to their good king, honor to themselues, and fauour to her. The poore men looked one vpon the other, vnused to be arbiters in Princes matters, and being now falne into a great perplexitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> a Prince dead and a Princesse aliue. But once for them she might haue gone whether she would, thinking it a sacriledge to touch her person, when she finding

Whatsoeuer (would they say) comes out of despaire, cannot beare the title of valure, which should bee lifted vp to such a hight, that holding al things vnder it selfe, it should be able to maintaine his greatnes euen in the middest of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Lastly they would saye, God had appointed vs Captaines of these our bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dylie fortes, which without treason to that Maiestie, were neuer to be deliuered ouer till they were redemaunded. <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> who had that for a lawe vnto him, not to leaue <hi>Philoclea</hi> in any thing vnsatisfied, although hee still remained in his former purpose, and knew that time would grow short for it, yet hearing no noyse (the shepheardes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> being as then run to <hi>Basilius</hi>) with setled and humbled countenaunce, as a man that should haue spoken of a thing that did not concerne himself, bearing eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his eyes
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:12151:209"/>
sufficient showes, that it was nothing but <hi>Philocleas</hi> danger, which did any thinge burden his harte, farre stronger then fortune, hauing with vehement embracinges of her, got yet some fruite of his delayed end, he thus aunswered the wise innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Philoclea.</hi> Lady most worthy not only of life, but to be the verie life of al things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the more notable demonstrations you make of the loue, so farre beyond my deserte, with which it pleaseth you to ouercome fortune, in making mee happye; the more am I euen in course of humanitie (to leaue that loues force, which I neither can nor will leaue) bound, to seeke requitals witnes, that I am not vngratefull, to do which the infinitnes of your goodnes being such as it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not reach vnto it, yet doing al I can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and paying my life, which is all I haue, though it be farre (without measure) shorte of your desarte, yet shall I not die in debt, to mine owne dutie. And truly the more excellent arguments you made, to keep me from this passage, imagined farre more terrible then it is; the more plainely it makes mee see what reason I haue, to preuent the losse not only of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> but all the face of the earth should receaue, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore, ô most truely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Lady, to whom I desire for both our goods, that these may bee my last wordes, geue me your consent euen out of that wisedome which must needes see, that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sids your vnmatched betternesse, which perchaunce you will not see) it is fitter one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> diethe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both.

                  </gap>e content rather to let me die contentedly, then wretchedly: ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a cleare and ioyfull conscience, then with desperate condemnation in my selfe, that I accursed villaine, shoulde bee the meane of banishing from the sight of men the true example of vertue. And because there is nothing lefte me to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> which I so much desire, as that the memory of <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> may euer haue an allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place in your wise iudgement, I am content to drawe so much breath longer, as by aunswearing the sweete obiections you alledged, maye bequath (as I thinke) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right conceate vnto you, that this my doinge is out of iudgement, and not sprong of passion. Your father you say, was wont to say, that this like action doth more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of feare, of furder euil or shame, then of a true courage, Truly first, they put a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gessing case, speaking of them who can euer after come to tell, with what minde they did it. And as for my parte, I call the immortall truth to witnes, that no feare of torment can appall me: who know it is but diuerse manners of apparelling death: and haue long learned, to set bodely paine but in the second fourme of my being. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> as for shame, how can I be ashamed of that, for which my well meaning conscience wil answeare for me to God, and your vnresistable beautie to the world? But to take that argument in his owne force, and graunt it done for auoyding of further paine or dishonour, (for as for the name of feare, it is but an odious title of a passion, giuen to that which true iudgement performeth) graunt, I say, it is, to shun a worse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> case, &amp; truly I do not see, but that true fortitude, loking into al humaine things with a persisting resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, carried away neither with wonder of pleasing things, nor asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the vnpleasaunt, doth not yet depriue it selfe, of the discerning the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of euill, but rather is the onely vertue, which with an assured tranquillitye shunnes the greater by the valiant entring into the lesse. Thus for his countries safety <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> he wil spend his life, for the sauing of a lym, he will not niggardly spare his goods; for the sauing of all his body, hee will not spare the cutting of a lym, where indeed the weake harted man will rather dye, then see the face of a surgeon: who mightwith as
<pb facs="tcp:12151:210"/>
good reason saye, that the constant man abides the painefull surgery, for feare of a further euill: but he is content to waite for death it selfe, but neither is true; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath the one any feare, but a well choosing iudgement; nor the other hath any contentment, but onely feare; and not hauing a harte actiuely to performe a matter of paine, is forced passiuely to abide a greater damage. For to doe, requires a whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> harte; to suffer falleth easeliest in the broken minds. And if in bodely torment thus, much more in shame; wherein since vallure is a vertue, and vertue is euer limited, we must not runne so infinitely, as to thinke the valiant man is willinglie to suffer any thing, since the very suffering of some things is a certaine proofe of want of courage. And if any thing vnwillinglie among the chiefest may shame goe: for if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> honour be to be held deere, his contrarye is to be abhorred, and that not for feare, but of a true election. For which is the lesse inconuenient, either the losse of some yeares more or lesse (for once we knowe our liues be not immortall) or the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our selues to each vnworthy misery, which the foolish world may lay vpon vs? As for their reason, that feare is contrary to hope, neither do I defend feare,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> nor much yeeld to the aucthoritye of hope; to eyther of which great enclining shewes but a feeble reason, which must be guided by his seruaunts; and who builds not vppon hope, shall feare no earthquake of despaire. Their last alleadging of the heauenly powers, as it beares the greatest name, so it is the only thing, that at all bred any combate in my minde. And yet I do not see, but that if God hath made vs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> maisters of any thing, it is of our owne liues; out of which without doing wrong to any body, we are to issue at our owne pleasure. And the same Argument would asmuch preuayle to say we should for no necessitie lay away from vs, any of our ioyntes, since they being made of him, without his warrant we should not depart from them; or if that may be, for a greater cause we may passe to a greater degree.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> And if we be Lieutenants of God, in this little Castle, do you not thinke we must take warning of him to geue ouer our charge when he leaues vs vnprouided, of good meanes to tarrye in it? No certainelie do I not answered the sorrowfull <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea,</hi> since it is not for vs to appoint that mightie Maiestie, what time he will helpe vs: the vttermost instant is scope enough for him, to reuoke euery thing to ones <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> owne desire. And therefore to preiudicate his determinacion, is but a doubt of goodnes in him, who is nothing but goodnes. But when in deede he doth either by sicknes, or outward force lay death vpon vs, then are we to take knowledge, that such is his pleasure, and to knowe that all is well that he doth. That we should be maisters of our selues, we can shewe at all no title, nor clayme; since neyther we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> made our selues, nor bought our selues, we can stand vpon no other right but his guift, which he must limit as it pleaseth him. Neyther is there any proporcion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the losse of any other limme and that, since the one bends to the preseruing all, the other to the destruction of all; the one takes not away the minde from the actions for which it is placed in the world, the other cuts off all possibilitie of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> working. And truly my most deere <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> I must needes protest vnto you, that I can not thinke your defence euen in rules of vertue sufficient. Sufficient and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent it were, if the question were of two outward things, wherein a man might by natures freedome determine, whether he would preferre shame to payne; present smaller torment, to greater following, or no. But to this (besides the comparison of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> the matters vallewes) there is added of the one part a direct euill doing, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ballance of that side too much vnequall. Since a vertuous man without
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:12151:210"/>
any respect, whether the griefe be lesse or more, is neuer to do that which he can not assure himselfe is allowable before the euerliuing rightfulnes. But rather is to thinke honoures or shames, which stande in other mens true or false iudgements, paynes or not paynes, which yet neuer approach our soules, to be nothing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of an vnspotted conscience. And these reasons do I remember, I haue heard good men bring in, that since it hath not his ground in an assured vertue, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes rather of some other disguised passion. <hi>Pyrocles</hi> was not so much perswaded as delighted, by her well conceaued and sweetely pronounced speaches; but when she had cloased her pittiful discourse, and as it were sealed vp her delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> lippes, with the moistnes of her teares, which followed still one another like a precious rope of pearle, now thinking it hye time. Be it as you saye (sayde hee most vertuous beawtye) in all the rest, but neuer can God himselfe perswade me, that <hi>Pyrocles</hi> life is not well lost, for to preserue the most admirable <hi>Philoclea.</hi> Let that be if it be possible written on my Tombe, and I will not enuye <hi>Codrus</hi> honour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> With that he would agayne haue vsed the barre, meaning if that failde, to leaue his braynes vppon the wall. When <hi>Philoclea</hi> now brought to that she most feared, kneeled downe vnto him, and embracing so his legges, that without hurting her, (which for nothing he would haue done) he could not ridde himselfe from her, she did with all the coniuring wordes, which the authoritye of loue may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> laye, beseeche him, he would not nowe so cruelly abandon her, he woulde not leaue her comfortlesse in that miserye, to which he had brought her. That then in deede she woulde euen in her soule accuse him, to haue most fouly betrayed her; that then she should haue cause, to curse the time that euer the name of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles</hi> came to her eares, which otherwise no death could make her do. Will you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> leaue me, sayde she, not onely dishonoured as supposed vnchaste with you, but as a murderer of you? Will you geue mine eyes such a picture of hell, before my neere approaching death, as to see the murdred bodie of him, I loue more then all the liues that nature can geue? With that she sware by the hyest cause of all deuocions, that if he did perseuer in that cruell resolucion, she would (though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> not onely confesse to her father, that with her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent this acte had bene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but if that would not serue (after she had puld out her owne eyes, made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed by such a sight) she would geue her selfe so terrible a death, as she might think the paine of it would counteruaile the neuer dying paine of her minde. Now therefore kill your selfe, to crowne this vertuous action with infamy: kill your selfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> to make me (whome you say you loue) as long as I after liue, change my louing admiracion of you, to a detestable abhorring your name. And so indeede you shall haue the ende you shoote at, for in steede of one death, you shall geue me a thousand, and yet in the meane time, depriue me of the helpe God may sende me. <hi>Pyrocles</hi> euen ouerwayed with her so wisely vttred affection, finding her deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> so fixed, that his ende should but depriue them both of a present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and not auoyde a comming euill (as a man that ranne not vnto it, by a sodayne qualme of passion, but by a true vse of reason, preferring her life to his owne) nowe that wisedome did manifest vnto him, that waye woulde not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle, he retired himselfe, with as much tranquillitie from it, as before he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> gone vnto it. Like a man, that had set the keeping or leauing of the bodye, as a thing without himselfe, and so had thereof a freed and vntroubled consideracion. Therefore throwing away the barre from him, and taking her vp from the place,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:211"/>
where he thought the consummating of all beawties, very vnworthely lay, suffring all his sences to deuoure vp their chiefest foode, which he assured himselfe they should shortly after for euer be depriued of: well, said he, most deere Lady, whose contentment I preferre before mine own, and iudgement esteeme more then mine owne, I yeeld vnto your pleasure. The gods send you haue not woon your owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> losse. For my part they are my witnesses, that I thinke I do more at your commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, in delayeng my death, then another would in bestowing his life. But now, sayd he, as thus farre I haue yeelded vnto you, so graunt me in recompence thus much againe, that I may finde your loue in graunting, as you haue sound your authoritye in obteyning. My humble suite is, you will say I came in by force into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> your Chamber, for so am I resolued now to affirme, and that will be the best for vs both; but in no case name my name, that whtsoeuer come of me my house be not dishonored. <hi>Philoclea</hi> fearing least refusall would turne him backe againe, to his violent refuge, gaue him a certayne countenance, that might shewe she did yeeld to his request, the latter part whereof indeed she meant for his sake to performe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Neyther could they spend more wordes together, for <hi>Philanax,</hi> with twentie of the noblest personages of <hi>Arcadia</hi> after him, were come into the Lodge, <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax</hi> making the rest stay belowe, for the reuerence he bare to womanhood, as stillie as he could came to the dore, and opening it, drewe the eyes of these two dolefull louers vpon him. <hi>Philoclea</hi> cloasing againe for modestie sake, within her bed the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ritchesse of her beawties, but <hi>Pyrocles</hi> tooke holde of his barre, minding at least to dye, before the excellent <hi>Philoclea</hi> should receyue any outrage. But <hi>Philanax</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted awhile vppon himselfe, stricken with admiracion at the goodlie shape of <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> whome before he had neuer seene, and withall remembring besides others the notable acte he had done (when with his courage and eloquence, he had saued <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> perchaunce the whole state from vtter ruyne) he felte a kinde of relenting minde towardes him. But when that same thought, came waighted on, with the remembraunce of his maisters death, which he by all probabilities thought he had bene of Councell vnto with the Queene, compassion turned to hatefull passion, and lefte in <hi>Philanax</hi> a straunge medley, betwixt pittie and reuenge, betwixt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> lyking and abhorring. O Lorde, sayde hee to himselfe, what wonders doth nature in our tyme, to set wickednesse so beawtifully garnished? and that which is straungest, out of one spring to make wonderfull effectes both of vertue and vice to issue? <hi>Pyrocles</hi> seeing him in such a muse, neyther knowing the man, nor the cause of his comming, but assuring himselfe, it was for no good, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> thought best to begin with him in this sort. Gentleman sayde hee, what is the cause of your comming to my Lady <hi>Philocleas</hi> chamber? is it to defende her from such violence, as I might goe about to offer vnto her? if it be so, truly your comming is vayne, for her owne vertue hath bene a sufficient resistaunce, there needes no strength to be added to so inuiolate chastetie, the excellencie of her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> mind, makes her bodie impregnable. Which for mine own part I had soone yelded to confesse, with going out of this place (where I found but little comfort being so disdainefully receiued) had I not bene, I know not by whom presently vpon my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming hether, so locked into this chamber, that I could neuer escape hence: where I was fettred in the most gilty shame, that euer ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was, seing what a paradise of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> goodnes, my filthy thoughts sought to defile. If for that therfore you come, alredy I assure you, your arra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is performed; but if it be to bring me to any punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:12151:211"/>
whatsouer, for hauing vndertaken so vnexcusable presumption. Truly I beare such an accuser about me of mine own conscience, that I willingly submit my selfe vnto it. Only this much let me demaund of you, that you will be a witnesse vnto the King what you heare me say, &amp; oppose your selfe, that neither his sodaine fury, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> any other occasion may offer any hurt to this Lady; in whome you see nature hath accomplished so much, that I am faine to lay mine owne faultines, as a foile of her purest excellency. I can say no more, but looke vppon her beawtie, remember her bloud, consider her yeares, and iudge rightly of her vertues, and I doubt not a gentlemans mind, will then be a sufficient enstructer vnto you, in this I may tearme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> it miserable chaunce, happened vnto her by my vnbridled audacitie. <hi>Philanax</hi> was content to heare him out, not for any fauour he owed him, but to see whether he would reueale any thing of the originall cause, and purpose of the kings death. But finding it so farre from that, that he named <hi>Basilius</hi> vnto him, as supposing him aliue, thinking it rather cunning then ignorance: Yong man, said he, whome I haue cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> to hate before I haue meane to know, you vse but a point of skill, by confessing the manifest smaller fault, to be beleeued hereafter in the deniall of the greater. But for that matter, all passeth to one end, and hereafter we shal haue leisure by torments to seke the truth, if the loue of truth it selfe will not bring you vnto it. As for my Lady <hi>Philoclea,</hi> if it so fall out as you say, it shall be the more fit for her yeares, &amp; comedy for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the great house she is come of, that an ill gouerned beawtie hath not cancelled the rules of vertue. But howsoeuer it be, it is not for you to teach an <hi>Arcadian,</hi> what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent duty we owe to any of that progeny. But, said he, come you with me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out resistance, for the one cannot auaile, and the other may procure pitie. Pitie? said <hi>Pyrocles</hi> with a bitter smiling, disdained, with so currish an answere: no, no, <hi>Arcadian,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> I can quickly haue pitie of my selfe, and I would think my life most miserable, which should be a gift of thine. Only I demaund this innocent Ladies securitie, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till thou hast co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed vnto me by an oath, assure thy selfe, the first that layes hands vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, shall leaue his life for a testimony of his sacriledge. <hi>Philanax</hi> with an inward storme, thinking it most manifest they were both, he at least, of counsell with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> kings death: well, said he, you speake much to me of the king: I do here sweare vnto you, by the loue I haue euer borne him, she shal haue no worse, howsoeuer it fal out, then her own parents. And vpon that word of yours I yeld, said the poore <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> deceiued by him that ment not to deceiue him. Then did <hi>Philanax</hi> deliuer him into the hands of a noble man in the company, euery one desirous to haue him in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> charge, so much did his goodly presence (wherin true valure shined) breede a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull admiration in all the beholders. <hi>Philanax</hi> himselfe stayed with <hi>Philoclea,</hi> to see whether of her he might learne some disclosing of this former conclusion. But she sweet Lady whom first a kindly shamefastnes had separated from <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene left in a more open view then her modesty would well beare) then the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> attending her fathers comming, and studying how to behaue her selfe towards him for both their safeties, had called her spirits all within her: now that vpon a sodaine <hi>Pyrocles</hi> was deliuered out of the chamber from her, at the first she was so surprized with the extreame stroke of the wofull sight, that, like those that in their dreames are taken with some ougly vision, they would fain cry for help, but haue no force, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> she awhile quite depriued not only of speach, but almost of any other liuely actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indeed <hi>Pyrocles</hi> was quite drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her eys, &amp; that her vital stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to return vnto her, now not knowing what they did to <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> but (according to
<pb facs="tcp:12151:212"/>
the nature of loue) fearing the worst, wringing her hands, and letting abundance of teares be the first part of her eloquence, bending her Amber-crowned head ouer her bed side to the hard-hearted <hi>Philanax:</hi> O <hi>Philanax, Philanax,</hi> sayd she, I knowe how much authoritye you haue with my father: there is no man whose wisedome he so much esteemes, nor whose faith so much he reposeth vpon. Remember how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> oft you haue promised your seruice vnto me, how oft you haue geuen me occasion to beleeue that there was no Lady in whose fauor you more desired to remayne: and, if the remembrance be not vnpleasant to your mind, or the rehearsall vnfitting for my fortune, remember there was a time when I could deserue it. Now my chaunce is turned, let not your truth turne. I present my selfe vnto you, the most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> humble and miserable suppliant liuing, neither shall my desire be great: I seeke for no more life then I shall be found worthy of. If my bloud may wash away the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> spare it not, although through me it hath in deede neuer bene dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored. My only sute is you wil be a meane for me, that while I am suffered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy this life, I may not be separated from him, to whom the Gods haue ioyned me,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> and that you determine nothing of him more cruelly then you do of me. If you rightly iudge of what hath past, wherein the Gods (that should haue bene of our mariage) are witnesses of our innocencies: then procure, we may liue together. But if my father will not so conceiue of vs, as the fault (if any were) was vnited, so let the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be vnited also. There was no man that euer loued either his Prince,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> or any thing pertaining to him with a truer zeale then <hi>Philanax</hi> did. This made him euen to the depth of his heart receiue a most veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t griefe, to see his master made as it were more miserable after death. And for himselfe, calling to mind in what sort his life had bene preserued by <hi>Philoclea,</hi> what time taken by <hi>Amphialus</hi> he was like to suffer a cruell death, there was nothing could haue kept him from falling to all ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> pittie, but the perfect perswasion he had, that all this was ioyned to the packe of his maisters death, which the misconceiued speech of marriage made him the more beleeue. Therefore first muttering to himselfe such like words: The violence the gentleman spake of, is now turned to mariage: he alledged <hi>Mars,</hi> but she speakes of <hi>Venus.</hi> O vnfortunate maister. This hath bene that faire diuell <hi>Gynaecia:</hi> sent away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> one of her daughters, prostituted the other, empoysoned thee, to ouerthrowe the diademe of <hi>Arcadia.</hi> But at length thus vnto her selfe he sayde: If your father, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, were now to speake vnto, truly there should no body be found a more ready aduocate for you, then my selfe. For I would suffer this fault, though very great to be blotted out of my minde, by your former led life, your benefit towards my selfe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> and being daughter to such a father. But since among your selues you haue taken him away, in whome was the only power to haue mercy, you must now be clothed in your owne working: and looke for none other, then that which dead pittilesse lawes may allot vnto you. For my part, I loued you for your vertue, but now where is that? I loued you in respect of a priuate benefit, what is that in comparison of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> publike losse? I loued you for your father, vnhappy folks you haue robbed the world of him. These words of her father were so little vnderstood by the only well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>Philoclea,</hi> that she desired him to tell her, what he meant to speake in such darke sort vnto her of her lord and father, whose displeasure was more dreadfull vnto her, then her punishment: that she was free in her owne conscience, she had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> neuer deserued euill of him, no not in this last fact: wherein if it pleased him to proceed with patience, he should finde her choise had not bene vnfortunate. He

that saw her words written in the plaine table of her faire face, thought it impossible there should therin be contained deceite: and therfore so much the more abashed: Why, said he, Madame, would you haue me thinke, you are not of conspiracy with the Princesse <hi>Pamelas</hi> flight, and your fathers death? with that word the sweet Lady <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> gaue a pittifull cry, hauing streight in her face &amp; breast abundance of witnesses, that her hart was far from any such abhominable consent. Ah of all sides vtterly ruined <hi>Philoclea,</hi> said she, now in deed I may well suffer all conceite of hope to dye in mee. Deare father where was I, that might not do you my last seruice before soone after miserably following you? <hi>Philanax</hi> perceiued the demonstracion so liuely &amp; true in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> her, that he easily acquited her in his heart of that fact, and the more was moued to ioyne with her in most heartie lamentation.

In this sorte vagabonding in those vntroden places, they were guided by the euerlasting Iustice, vsing themselues to bee punishers of theyr faultes, and making theyr owne actions the beginning of their chastizements, (vnhappely both for him and themselues) to light on <hi>Musidorus.</hi> Whom as soone

The villaines that now had a second proofe, how ill wordes they had for such a sword, turned all the course of their violence into thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> dartes and stones, in deede the only way to ouermaister the valure of <hi>Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus.</hi> Who finding them some already touch, some fall so neere his chiefest life <hi>Pamela,</hi> that in the ende some one or other might happe to doo an vnsuccourable mischiefe, setting all his hope in despaire, ranne out from his Lady among them.

But the first he ouertooke, as he ranne away, carying his head as farre before him, as those maner of runnings are wont to doo, with one blowe strake it so cleane off, that it falling betwixt the handes, and the body falling vppon it, it made a shewe as though the fellow had had great haste to gather vp his head agayne.

A third finding his feete too slowe, aswell as his handes too weake, sodaynely turned backe, beginning to open his lippes for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> mercye. But before hee had well entred a rudely compilde oration, <hi>Musidorus</hi> blade was come betweene his iawes into his throate, and so the poore man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted there for euer with a very euill mouthfull of an answere. <hi>Musidorus</hi> in this furious chafe would haue followed some other of these hatefull wretches, but that he heard his Lady cry for helpe, whome three of this villanous crue, had (whiles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>

But she that was resolued, no worse thing could fall vnto her, then the being depriued of him, on whome she had established all her comfort, with a pittifull cry fetched his eyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> her: who then thinking so many weapons thrust into his eyes, as with his eyes he sawe bent against her, made all hartie speede to her succour. But one of them wiser then his companions, set his dagger to her Alablaster throate, swearing if hee threwe not away his sword, he would presently kill her. There was neuer poore scholler, that hauing in stede of his booke some playing toy about him, did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> more sodainly cast it from him, at the child-feared presence of a cruell Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister.

whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saw it stood vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t point of his Ladies life.

And then began these sauage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Senators to make a consultation, what they should do: some wishing to spoile them of their Iewels and let them go on their iourney, (for that if they carried them back they were sure they should haue least parte of their pray) others preferring their old homes to any thing, desired to bring them to <hi>Basilius</hi> as pledges of their surety: and ther wanted not which cried the safest way was to kill them both; to such an vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> thraldom were these great and excellent personages brought. But the most part resisted to the killing of the Princesse, fore-seing their liues would neuer bee safe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such a fact committed: and beganne to wish rather the spoyle then death of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidorus</hi>: when the villaine that had his legge cut off, came scrawling towardes them, and being helped to them by one of the companie, began with a growning voice, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and a disfigured face, to demaunde the reuenge of his blood: which since hee had spent with them in their defence, it were no reason he should be suffered by them to die discontented. The onely contentment he required was that by their helpe with his own hands he might put his murderer to some cruel death, he would faine haue cried more against <hi>Musidorus,</hi> but that the much losse of bloud helped on with this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> vehemencie, choked vp the spirits of his life, leauing him to make betwixt his body and soule an ill fauoured partition. But they seing their fellow in that sorte die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their faces, did swell in newe mortall rages: All resolued to kill him, but nowe onely considering what manner of terrible death they should inuent for him. Thus was a while the agrement of his slaying, broken by the disagrement of the manner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of it; &amp; extremitie of cruelty grew for a time, to be the stop of crueltie. At length they were resolued, euery one to haue a pece of him and to become all aswell hangmen as iudges: when <hi>Pamela</hi> tearing her heare, and falling downe among them, somtimes with al the sorte of humble praiers, mixt with promises of great good turnes, (which they knew her state was able to performe) sometimes threatning them, that if they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> kild him and not her, she would not onely reuenge it vpon them, but vpon all their wiues and children; bidding them consider that though they might thinke shee was come away in her fathers displeasure, yet they might be sure hee would euer shewe himselfe a father, that the Gods woulde neuer if shee liued, put her in so base estate, but that she should haue abilitie to plague such as they were returning a fresh to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and promises, and mixing the same againe with threatninges, brought them (who were now growne colder in their fellowes cause, who was past aggrauating the matter, with his cryes) to determine with themselues there was no way, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to kil them both or saue them both. As for the killing, already they hauing aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweared themselues that that was a way to make them Cittezens of the woodes for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> euer; they did in fine conclude they would retourne them backe againe to the King which they did not doubt, would bee cause of a greate reward, besides their safetie from their fore-deserued punishment. Thus hauing either by fortune, or the force of

So that <hi>Musidorus</hi> was forced to repaire her good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> counsailes, with sweete consolations, which continued betwixt them vntill it was about midnight, that sleep hauing stolne into their heauie sences and now absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commaunding in their vitall powers, lefte them delicately wound on in anothers armes quietly to waite for the comming of the morning. Which as soone as shee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to play her parte, laden (as you haue heard) with so many well occasioned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> lamentations. Their lobbish garde (who all night had kept themselues awake, with prating how valiant deedes they had done when they ranne away: and how faire a death their felowe had died, who at his last gaspe sued to bee a hangman) awaked them, and set them vpon their horses, to whom the very shining force of excellent vertue, though in a very harrish subiect, had wrought a kinde of reuerence in them; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> 
                  <hi>Musidorus</hi> as he rid among them, (of whom they had no other holde but of <hi>Pame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>) thinking it want of a well squared iudgement, to leaue any meane vnassayed of sauing their liues, to this purpose spake to his vnseemly gardians, vsing a plaine kind of phrase to make his speach the more credible. My maisters said he, there is no man that is wise but hath in what soeuer hee doth some purpose whereto hee directes his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> doinges, which so long he followes, till he see that either that purpose is not worth the paines, or that another doinge caries with it a better purpose. That you are wise in what you take in hand I haue to my cost learned: that makes me desire you to tell me, what is your ende in carying the Princesse and me backe to her father. Pardon, saide one, rewarde cried another, well saide he take both; although I know you are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> so wise to remember, that hardly they both will goe togeather, being of so contrary a making, for the ground of pardon is an euill, neither any man pardons but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers an euill done, the cause of rewarde is the opinion of some good acte, and who so rewardeth that, holdes the chief place of his fancie. Now one man of one compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, to haue the same consideration both of good and euill, but that the conceite of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> pardoning, if it bee pardoned, will take away the minde of rewarding, is very hard, if not impossible. For either euen in iustice will he punish the fault as well as reward the desert, or els in mercie ballance the one by the other: so that the not chastising shalbe a sufficient satisfiing. Thus then you may see that in your owne purpose, rests greate vncertaintie. But I will graunt that by this your deede you shall obtaine your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> double purpose. Yet consider I pray you whether by another meane, that may not better be obtained, &amp; then I doubt not your wisdomes wil teach you to take hold of the better. I am sure you knowe, any body were better haue no neede of a pardon then enioy a pardon; for as it carries with it the suretie of a preserued life, so beares it a continuall note of a deserued death. This therefore (besides the daunger you may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> runne into, my Lady <hi>Pamela</hi> being the vndoubted enheritrixe of this state, if shee shall hereafter seeke to reuenge your wrong done her) shall bee continually cast in your teeth, as men dead by the lawe; the honester sorte will disdaine your company &amp; your children shalbe the more basely reputed of, &amp; you yourselues in euery slight fault hereafter, as men once condemned, aptest to bee ouerthrowne. Now if you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> will, (I doubt not you will, for you are wise) turne your course, and garde my Lady <hi>Pamela</hi> thither ward, whether shee was going: first you neede not doubt to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

your fortunes where shee goes, and there shall you be assured in a countrie as good and rich as this, of the same manners and language, to bee so farre from the conceate of a pardon, as we both shall be forced to acknowledge, we haue receaued by your meanes what soeuer we holde deere in this life. And so for rewarde iudge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> you whether it be not more likely, you shall there receaue it where you haue done no euill, but singuler and vndeserued goodnes; or here where this seruice of yours shalbe diminished by your dutie, and blemished by your former fault. Yes I protest and sweare vnto you, by the faire eyes of that Lady, there shall no Gentlemen in all that country bee preferred. You shall haue riches, ease, pleasure, and that which is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> best to such worthy mindes, you shall not bee forced to crie mercy for a good facte. You onely of all the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> shall haue the prayse in continuing in your late va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt attempte, and not basely bee brought vnder a halter for seeking the libertie of <hi>Arcadia.</hi> These wordes in their mindes, who did nothing for any loue of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but onely as their senses presented greater showes of proffit, beganne to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> them wauer, and some to clappe their hands and scratch their heades, and sweare it was the best way. Others that would seeme wiser then the rest to capitulate what tenements they should haue, what subsidies they should pay, others to talke of their wiues, in doubt whether it were best to send for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to take new wher they went, most, (like fooles) not reddely thinking what was next to bee done, but imagining <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> what cheere they woulde make when they came there, one or two of the least dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>courses beginning to turne their faces towards the woods which they had lefte. But being nowe come within the plaine neere to the lodges, vnhappily they espied a troupe of horsmen. But then their false harts had quickly for the present feare, forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their last hopes, and therfore keeping on the way toward the lodge, with songes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> of cries and ioye, the horsemen who were some of them. <hi>Philanax</hi> had sent out to the search of <hi>Pamela</hi> came gallowping vnto them; marueyling who they were that in such a generall mourning, durst singe ioyfull tunes, and in so publicke a ruine were the lawrell tokens of victorie. And that which seemed straungest, they might see two among them vnarmed like prisoners, but riding like captaines. But when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> they came neerer, they perceaued the one was a Lady, and the Lady <hi>Pamela.</hi> Then glad they had by happ found that which they so litle hoped to meete withall, taking these clownes (who first resisted them, for the desire they had to be the deliuerers of the two excellent prisoners, learning that they were of those rebells, which had made the daungerous vprore, aswell vnder cullour to punish that, as this their last <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> withstanding them, but indeed their principal cause being, because they themselues would haue the onely praise of their owne quest, they suffered not one of them to liue. Marry three of the stubbernest of them they lefte their bodies hanging vppon the trees, because their doing might carry the likelier forme of iudgement. Such an vnlooked for end did the life of iustice worke, for the naughtie minded wretches, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> subiects to be executed, that would haue executed Princes: and to suffer that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lawe, which by lawe they had deserued. And thus these yonge folkes twise prisoners, before any due arrest, deliuered of their iayloures but not of their iayle, had rather change then respit of misery, these souldiers that tooke them with verie fewe wordes of entertainement, hasting to carrie them to their Lorde <hi>Philanax</hi>: to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> whom they came, euen as he going out of the Lady <hi>Philocleas</hi> chamber, had ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> whom before hee had deliuered to the custody of a noble man of that countrie. When <hi>Pyrocles</hi> led towardes his prison sawe his friend <hi>Musidorus,</hi> with the
<pb facs="tcp:12151:216"/>
noble Lady <hi>Pamela</hi> in that in expected sorte returned, his griefe, (if any griefe were in a minde which had placed euery thing according to his naturall worthe) was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much augmented, for besides some small hope hee had, if <hi>Musidorus</hi> had once bene cleere of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> by his dealing and aucthoritie to haue brought his onely gladsome desires to a good issue: The hard estate of his friend did no lesse nay rather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> more vexe him, then his owne. For so indeede it is euer founde, where valure and friendshipp are perfectly coopled in one hart, the reason being, that the resolute man, hauing once disgested in his iudgement the worst extremitie of his owne case, and hauing either quiet expelled, or at least repelled, all passion, which ordinarilie followes an ouerthrowne fortune, not knowing his friendes minde so well as his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> owne, nor with what pacience he brookes his case, (which is as it were the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cause of making a man happie or vnhappie) doubts whether his friend accomptes not him selfe more miserable, and so indeede bee more lamentable. But assoone as <hi>Musidorus</hi> was brought by the souldiers neere vnto <hi>Philanax, Pyrocles</hi> not knowing whether euer after hee should bee suffered to see his friende, and determining there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> could be no aduauntage by dissembling a not knowing of him leapt sodainelie from their hands that helde him, and passing with a strength strengthened with a true af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, thorowe them that encompassed <hi>Musidorus,</hi> he embrased him as fast as hee coulde in his armes. And kissing his cheekes, O my <hi>Palladius</hi> saide he, let not our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue now abandon vs; let vs proue our mindes are no slaues to fortune, but in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> can tryumph ouer aduersitie. Deere <hi>Daiphantus</hi> aunsweared <hi>Musidorus</hi> (seing by his apparell his being a man was reuealed) I thanke you for this best care of my best parte. But feare not, I haue kept too long company with you to want nowe a thorowe determination of these things, I well know there is nothing euill but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs, the rest is either naturall or accidentall. <hi>Philanax</hi> finding them of so neare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaunce,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> be ganne presently to examine them a parte: but such resolution hee mett within them, that by no such meanes hee coulde learne furder, then it pleased them to deliuer. So that he thought best to put them both in one place, with espiall of there wordes and behauiour, that waye to sifte out the more of these fore passed mischeifes. And for that purpose gaue them both vnto the nobleman, whoe before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> had the custodie of <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> by name <hi>Simpathus,</hi> leauing a trustie seruant of his owne to geue dilligent watch to what might passe betwixte them.

But waying with her self, it was fit for her honour,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> till her doing were clearely manifested, that they shoulde remaine seperate: kept downe the rising tokens of greefe; shewing passion in nothing but her eyes, which accompanied <hi>Musidorus</hi> euen vnto the tent, whether he and <hi>Pyrocles</hi> were ledde. Then with a countenaunce more princely then she was woont, according to the woont of hiest hartes (like the Palme tree striuing most vpwarde, when he is most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> burdened) she commaunded <hi>Philanax</hi> to bring her to her father and mother, that she might render them accompte of her doings. <hi>Philanax</hi> shewing a sullaine kinde of reuerence vnto her, as a man that honoured her as his, Maisters heire, but much misliked her for her, in his conceite, dishonorable proceedings, tolde her what was past, rather to answere her, then that hee thought shee was ignoraunt of it. But her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> good spirite did presently suffer a true compassionate affliction of those hard aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: which crossing her armes, looking a greate while on the grounde, with those

eyes which let fall many teares, she well declared. But in the ende remembring howe necessarye it was for her, not to loose her selfe in such an extremitye, she strengthened her well created hearte, and stoutely demaunded <hi>Philanax,</hi> what aucthoritye then they had to laye handes of her person, who being the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> heyre, was then the lawfull Princesse of that Kingdome. <hi>Philanax</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, her Grace knewe the auncient lawes of <hi>Arcadia</hi> bare, she was to haue no swaye of gouernment till she came to one and twentye yeares of age, or were marryed.

After that past, she shoulde haue such obedience, as by the Lawes was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> due vnto her, desyring God she woulde showe her selfe better in publicke gouernment, then she had done in priuate. She woulde haue spoken to the Gentlemen and people gathered about her: but <hi>Philanax</hi> fearing least there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by some commotion mighte arise, or at least a hinderaunce of executing hys maisters murderers, which hee longed after more then any thing, hasted her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> vp to the Lodge, where her Sister was, and there with a chosen companye of Souldyers to garde the place, lefte her with <hi>Philoclea, Pamela</hi> protesting they layde violent handes of her, and that they entred into rebellious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptes agaynst her. But hye tyme it was for <hi>Philanax</hi> so to doo, for alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye was all the whole multitude fallne into confused and daungerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions.</p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>
               <p>There was a notable example, how great dissipations, Monarchall gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are subiect vnto. For nowe theyr Prince and guide had lefte them, they had not experience to rule, and had not whome to obaye. Publicke matters had euer bene priuately gouerned, so that they had no liuely taste what was good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> for themselues. But euery thing was eyther vehemently desirefull, or extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terrible. Neighbours inuasions, ciuill dissention, crueltye of the comming Prince, and whatsoeuer in common sence carries a dreadfull shewe, was in all mens heads, but in fewe how to preuent: harkening on euery rumor, suspecting euery thing, condemning them whome before they had honoured, making <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> strange and impossible tales of the Kings death, while they thought themselues in daunger, wishing nothing but safetye, assoone as perswasion of safetie tooke them, desiring further benefitts, as amendment of forepassed faultes, (which faultes notwithstanding none could tell eyther the groundes or effectes of) all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in the vniuersall names of liking or misliking, but of what in especiall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> poyntes, infinitely disagreeing. Altogether like a falling steeple, the partes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as windowes, stones, and pinnacles, were well, but the whole masse ruinous. And this was the generall case of all, wherein notwithstanding was an extreame medly of diuersified thoughts; the great men looking to make themselues strong by factions, the gentlemen some bending to them, some standing vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> some desirous to ouerthrowe those few which they thought were ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the souldiers desirous of trouble, as the nurse of spoile, and not much vnlike to them, though in another way, were all the needy sorte, the riche fearefull,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:217"/>
the wise carefull. This composicion of conceytes, brought foorth a daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tumulte, which yet woulde haue bene more daungerous, but that it had so many partes, that no body well knewe against whome chiefely to oppose themselues. For some there were that cried to haue the state altred, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no more by a Prince; marry in the alteration, many would haue the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> gouernment of fewe chosen Senatours; others the <hi>Athenian,</hi> where the peoples voyce helde the chiefe aucthoritye. But these were rather the discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing sorte of men, then the actiue, being a matter more in imaginacion then practise. But they that went neerest to the present case, (as in a countrie that knewe no gouernment, without a Prince) were they that stroue, whome they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> should make. Whereof a great number there were, that would haue the Princesse <hi>Pamela</hi> presently to enioy it: some disdayning that she had as it were abandoned her owne Countrie, enclining more to <hi>Philoclea</hi>; and there wanted not of them, which wished <hi>Gynaecia</hi> were deliuered, and made Regent till <hi>Pamela</hi> were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely marryed. But great multitudes there were, which hauing bene acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> with the iust gouernment of <hi>Philanax,</hi> meant to establish him as Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the state: and these were the most populer sorte, who iudged by the commodities they felte. But the principall men in honor and might, who had long before enuyed his greatnes with <hi>Basilius,</hi> did much more spurne against any such preferment of him. For yet before theyr enuye had some kinde of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> out his rancour, by layeng his greatnes as a fault to the Princes iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who shewde in <hi>Damaetas</hi> he might easely be deceyued in mens valewe. But nowe if the Princes choice, by so many mouthes should be confyrmed, what coulde they obiect to so rightly esteemed an excellencye? They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were disposed, sooner to yeeld to any thing, then to his raysing: and were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> content (for to crosse <hi>Philanax</hi>) to stoppe those actions, which otherwise they could not but thinke good. <hi>Philanax</hi> himselfe, as much hindred by those, that did immoderatly honour him, (which brought both more enuye, and suspicion vppon him) as by them that did manifestly resist him, (but standing onely vppon a constant desire of iustice, and a cleere conscience) went forwarde stoutly in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the action of his maisters reuenge, which he thought himselfe particularly bound to. For the rest, as the ordering of the gouernment, he accompted himselfe but as one, wherein notwithstanding he would imploy all hys loyall indeauour.</p>
               <p>But among the Noble men, hee that most openly set himselfe against him, was named <hi>Timantus,</hi> a man of middle age, but of extreame ambition, as one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> that had placed his vttermost good in greatnes, thinking small difference by what meanes he came by it. Of commendable wit, if he had not made it a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt to vnbrideled desires. Cunning to creepe into mens fauours, which hee prized onely as they were seruiceable vnto him. He had bene brought vp in some souldiery, which he knewe how to set out, with more then deserued ostentacion.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Seruile (though enuious) to his betters: and no lesse tirannycallie minded to them hee had aduauntage of. Counted reuengefull, but in deede measuring both reuenge and rewarde, as the partye might eyther helpe or hurt him. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shamelesse then bolde, and yet more bolde in practises, then in personall aduentures. In summe, a man that could be as euill as he listed, and listed as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> much, as any aduancement might thereby be gotten. As for vertue, hee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it but a schoole name. Hee euen at the fyrst assembling together, finding
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:12151:217"/>
the great stroke <hi>Philanax</hi> carried among the people, thought it his readyest way of ambition, to ioyne with him: which though his pride did hardly brooke, yet the other vice carrying with it a more apparant obiect, preuayled ouer the weaker, so that with those liberall protestacions of friendship, which men that care not for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> their word are wont to bestowe, he offred vnto him the choice in marriage, of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the sisters, so he would likewise helpe him to the other, and make such a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticion of the <hi>Arcadian</hi> estate. Wishing him, that since he loued his maister, because he was his maister, which shewed the loue began in himselfe, he should rather now occasion was presented, seeke his owne good substancially, then affect the smoke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> of a glory, by shewing an vntimely fidelitie to him, that could not reward it; and haue all the fruite he should get in mens opinions, which would be as diuers, as many; fewe agreeing to yeeld him due prayse of his true heart. But <hi>Philanax,</hi> who had limitted his thoughtes in that he esteemed good, (to which he was neyther carryed by the vayne tickling of vncertayne fame, nor from which he would be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> transported by enioying any thing, whereto the ignorant world geues the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent name of goodes) with great mislike of his offer, he made him so perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye an answere, not without threatning, if he found him foster any such fancie, that <hi>Timantus</hi> went with an inward spite from him, whome before he had neuer loued; and measuring all mens marches by his owne pace, rather thought it some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> further fetch of <hi>Philanax,</hi> (as that he would haue all to himselfe alone) then was any way taken with the lou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore going amongst the chiefest Lordes, whome he knewe principally to repine at <hi>Philanax,</hi> and making a kinde of conuocation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> them, he inueighed against his proceedings, drawing euery thing to the most malicious interpretacion, that malice itselfe could instruct him to doe. He sayde, it was season for them to looke to such a weede, that else would ouergrowe them all. It was not nowe time to consult of the dead, but of the liuing: since such a slye wolfe was entred among them, that could make iustice the cloake of tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> and loue of his late maister the destruction of his now being children. Do you not see, sayde hee, howe farre his corruption hath stretched, that hee hath such a number of rascalls voyces, to declare him Lieutenant, readye to make him Prince, but that he instructs them, matters are not yet ripe for it?

O single minded modestie to aspire to no lesse then to the princely Diademe! No, no, he hath vired all this while, but to come the sooner to his affected ende. But let vs remember what we be, in quallitie his equalls, in number farre before him, let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> vs deliuer the Queene, and our naturall Princesses, and leaue them no longer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his authoritye; whose proceedings would rather shewe, that he himselfe, had bene the murderer of the King, then a fit Gardien of his posteritye. These wordes pearst much into the mindes, already enclined that way. Insomuch that most part of the nobilitye, confirmed <hi>Timantus</hi> speech, and were readye to execute it: when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
                  <hi>Philanax</hi> came among them, and with a constant but reuerent behauiour, desired them they would not exercise priuate grudges, in so common a necessitye. Hee acknowledged himselfe a man, and a faultye man, to the cleering or satisfyeng of which, he would at all times submit himselfe, since his ende was to bring all things to an vpright iudgement, it should euill fitt him to flye the iudgement. But sayde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> he, my Lordes, let not <hi>Timantus</hi> rayling speech (who whatsoeuer he findes euill in his owne soule, can with ease lay it vppon another) make me loose your good fauour. Consider that all well doing, stands so in the middle betwixt his two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye euils, that it is a readye matter to cast a slaunderous shade vpon the most approued vertues. Who hath an euill toong, can call seueritie, crueltie, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> dilligence, dilligent ambition. But my ende is not to excuse my selfe, nor to accuse him: for both those, hereafter will be time enough. There is neyther of vs, whose purging or punishing may so much import to <hi>Arcadia.</hi> Now I request you, for your owne honours sake, and require you by the duety you owe to this estate, that you doo presently (according to the lawes) take in hande, the chastize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> of our maisters murderers, and laying order for the gouernment: by whom soeuer it be done, so it be done, and iustly done, I am satisfyed. My labour hath bene to frame things so, as you might determine: now it is in you to determine. For my part, I call the heauens to witnesse, the care of my heart stands to repaye that, wherein both I, and most of you were tyed to that Prince; with whome, all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> my loue of worldly action is dead.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Philanax</hi> was speaking his last wordes, there came one running to him, with open mouth, and fearefull eyes, telling him, that there were a great number of the people, which were bent to take the young men out of <hi>Sympathus</hi> hands, and as it should seeme by their acclamacions, were like inough to proclayme them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Princes. Nay, sayde <hi>Philanax</hi> (speaking alowde, and looking with a iust anger vppon the other noble men) it is nowe season to heare <hi>Timantus</hi> idle slanders, while strangers become our Lordes, and <hi>Basilius</hi> murderers sit in his throne. But who soeuer is a true <hi>Arcadian,</hi> let him followe me. With that he went towarde the place he heard of, followed by those that had euer loued him, and some of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> noble men. Some other remayning with <hi>Timantus,</hi> who in the meane time was conspiring by strong hand to deliuer <hi>Gynaecia,</hi> of whome the weakest guard was had. But <hi>Philanax</hi> where he went, found them all in an vprore, which thus was fallne out. The greatest multitude of people, that were come to the death of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius,</hi> were the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> as being the nearest Citie to the lodges. Among these,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> the chiefe man both in authoritye and loue was <hi>Kalander,</hi> he that not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had bene hoste to the two Princes, whome though he knewe not so much as
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:12151:218"/>
by name, yet besides the obligacion he stood bound to them in, for preseruing the liues of his sonne or nephewe, theyr noble behauiour had bred such loue in his heart towardes them, as both with teares he parted from them, when they left him (vnder promise to returne) and did keepe their iewells and apparrell as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the relicks of two demy gods. Among others, he had entred the prison, and seene them, which forthwith so inuested his soule, both with sorrowe and desire to helpe them (whome he tendred as his children) that calling his neighbours the <hi>Mantineans</hi> vnto him, he tould them, all the prayses of those two young men, swearing he thought the gods had prouided for them better, then they themselues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> could haue imagined. He willed them to consider, that when all was done, <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> children must enioy the state; who since they had chosen, and chosen so as all the world could not mende their choise, why should they resist Gods doing, and theyr Princesses pleasure? This was the only way to purchase quietnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood, where otherwise they should at one instant, crowne <hi>Pamela</hi> with a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Crowne of golde, and a dishonoured title. Which whether euer she would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, he thought it fit for them to way: such said he, heroicall greatnes shines in their eyes, such an extraordinary maiestie in all their actions, as surely either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune by parentage, or nature in creation, hath made them Princes. And yet a state already we haue, we neede but a man, who since he is presented vnto you by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> heauenly prouidence, embraced by your vndoubted Princesse, worthy for their youth of compassion, for their beawtie of admiracion, for their excellent vertue to be monarkes of the world, shall we not be content with our owne blisse? Shall we put out our eyes, because another man cannot see? or rather like some men, when too much good happens vnto them, they thinke themselues in a dreame, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> and haue not spirits to taste their owne goods? No no my friends, beleeue me, I am so vnpartiall, that I knowe not their names, but so ouercome with their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that I shall then thinke, the destenyes haue ordayned a perpetuall florishing to <hi>Arcadia,</hi> when they shall allot such a gouernor vnto it. This spoken by a man graue in yeares, great in authoritie, neere allyed to the Prince, and knowen ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> preuayled so with all the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> that with one voyce they ranne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the two Princes. But <hi>Philanax</hi> came in time to withstand them, both sides yet standing in armes, and rather wanting a beginning, then mindes to enter into a bloudy conflict. Which <hi>Philanax</hi> foreseeing, thought best to remoue the prisoners secretly, and if neede were, rather without forme of iustice to kill them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> then against iustice (as hee thought) to haue them vsurpe the state. But there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne arose a new trouble. For <hi>Sympathus</hi> (the noble man that kept them) was so stricken in compassion, with their excellent presence, that as he would not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifye his promise to <hi>Philanax,</hi> to geue them libertye, so yet would he not yeeld them to himselfe, fearing he would do them violence. Thus tumult vppon tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> arising, the Sunne I thinke aweary to see theyr discords, had alreadye gone downe to his Westerne lodging. But yet to knowe what the poore Shepherds did, who were the fyrst descryers of these matters, will not to some eares perchance be a tedious digression.</p>

               <p>THE Shepheards finding no place for them in these garboyles, to which their quiet hearts (whose highest ambition was in keeping themselues vp in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> had at all no aptnes, retired themselues from among the clamorous mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: and as sorowe desires company, went vp together to the Westerne side of a hill, whose prospect extended it so farre, as they might well discerne many of <hi>Arcadias</hi> beawtyes. And there looking vpon the Sunnes as then declining race, the poore men sate pensiue of their present miseries, as if they founde a wearines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> of theyr wofull wordes: till at last good olde <hi>Geron</hi> (who as he had longest tasted the benefites of <hi>Basilius</hi> gouernment, so seemed to haue a speciall feeling of the present losse) wiping his eyes and long white bearde bedeawed with greate dropps of teares, began in this sorte to complayne. Alas poore sheepe, sayde hee, which hitherto haue enioyed your fruitefull pasture, in such quietnes, as your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> wooll amongst other things hath made this Countrie famous, your best dayes are now past: now you must become the vittaile of an armye, and perchaunce an armye of foraine enemyes: you are now not onely to feare home Wolues, but alien Lions; now, I say now, that our right <hi>Basilius</hi> is deceased. Alas sweete pastures! Shall souldiours that knowe not how to vse you, possesse you? Shall they that can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> not speake <hi>Arcadian</hi> language be Lordes ouer your Shepheards? For alas with good cause may we looke for any euill, since <hi>Basilius</hi> our only strength is taken from vs. To that all the other Shepheards present vttered pittifull voyces, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the very borne <hi>Arcadians.</hi> For as for the other, though humanitie moued them to pittie humane cases, especially in a Prince, vnder whome they had founde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> a refuge of their miseries, and iustice equally administred: yet could they not so naturally feele the liuely touch of sorrowe.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> THE daungerous diuision of mens mindes, the ruinous ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all estates, had nowe brought <hi>Arcadia</hi> to feele the pangs of vttermost perill (such convulsions neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, but that the life of that gouernment drawes neere his necessarye periode) when to the honest and wife <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanax,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> equally distracted betwixt desire of his maisters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge and care of the states establishment, there came (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for) a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Gentleman, who in short, but pithye maner deliuered vnto him, that the renowmed <hi>Euarchus,</hi> King of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> purposing to haue visited his olde friend and confederate the King <hi>Basilius,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> was nowe come within halfe a mile of the Lodges, where hauing vnderstoode be certayne Shepheards, the sodayne death of theyr Prince, had sent vnto him, (of whose authoritye and faith he had good knowledge) desiring him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise him, in what securitie hee might rest there for that night, where wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglye hee woulde (if safely hee might) helpe to celebrate the funeralls of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> auncient companion and alye, adding hee neede not doubt, since hee had brought but twentye in his companye, hee woulde be so vnwise as to enter into any forcible attempte with so small force. <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nax</hi> hauing entertayned the Gentleman, aswell as in the middest of so many tumultes hee coulde, pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing awhile with himselfe, considering howe it shoulde not onely be vniust, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> against the lawe of Nations, not well to receyue a Prince whome good will had brought among them, but (in respecte of the greatnes of his might) very daungerous to geue him any cause of due offence; remembring withall the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent tryalls of his equitie, which made him more famous then his victoryes, hee thought hee might bee the fittest instrumente to redresse the ruynes they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> were in, since his goodnes put hym without suspicion, and hys greatnesse beyonde enuye. Yet weighing with himselfe howe harde many heads were to be brideled, and that in this monstrous confusion such mischiefe mighte
<pb facs="tcp:12151:223"/>
be attempted, of which late repentance should after be but a simple remedie: he iudged best first to knowe how the peoples mindes would sway to this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion. Therefore desiring the Gentleman to returne to the King his maister, and to beseech him (though with his paynes) to stay for an houre or two, where he was, till he had set things in better order to receiue him: he himselfe went fyrst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to the Noble men, then to <hi>Kalander</hi> and the principall <hi>Mantineans,</hi> who were most opposite vnto him; desiring them, that as the night had most blessedly stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from entring into ciuill bloud, so they would be content in the night to assemble the people together, to heare some newes, which he was to deliuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. There is nothing more desirous of nouelties, then a man that feares his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> present fortune. Therefore they, whome mutuall diffidence made doubtfull of their vtter destruction, were quickly perswaded to heare of any newe matter, which might alter at least, if not helpe the nature of their feare. Namely the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest men, who as they had most to lose, so were most iealous of their owne case, and were alreadye growne as wearye to be followers of <hi>Timantus</hi> ambition, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> before they were enuyers of <hi>Philanax</hi> worthinesse. As for <hi>Kalander</hi> and <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathus,</hi> as in the one a vertuous friendship had made him seeke to aduaunce, in the other a naturall commiseration had made him willing to protect the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent (though vnfortunate) prisoners, so were they not against this conuocation. For hauing nothing but iust desires in them, they did not mistrust the iustifyeng <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> of them. Only <hi>Timantus</hi> laboured to haue withdrawne them from this assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye, sayeng, it was time to stop their eares from the ambitious charmes of <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax.</hi> Let them fyrst deliuer <hi>Gynaecia,</hi> and her daughters, which were fit persons to heare, and then they might begin to speake. That this was but <hi>Philanax</hi> comming, to li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke broyle vpon broyle, because he might auoyd the answering of his tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> which as he had long intended, so had he prepared coullored speeches to disguise them. But as his words expressed rather a violence of rancour, then any iust ground of accusation, so pierced they no further, then to some partiall eares, the multitude yeelding good attention to what <hi>Philanax</hi> would propose vnto them: Who, like a man whose best building was a well-framed conscience, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> with plausible words, nor fawning countenance, but euen with the graue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of a wise father, whome nothing but loue makes to chide, thus sayd vnto them. I haue, said he, a great matter to deliuer vnto you, and thereout am I to make a greater demaund of you: But truly such hath this late proceeding bene of yours, that I knowe not what is not to be demaunded of you. Me thinkes I may haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> reason to require of you, as men are woont among Pirates, that the life of him that neuer hurt you, may be safe. Me thinkes I am not without apparence of cause, as if you were <hi>Cyclopes</hi> or <hi>Cannibals,</hi> to desire that our Princes body, which hath thirtie yeares maintained vs in a flourishing peace, be not torne in pieces, or deuoured among you, but may be suffred to yeeld it selfe, which neuer was defiled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> with any of your blouds, to the naturall rest of the earth. Me thinkes, not as to <hi>Arcadians,</hi> renowmed for your faith to Prince, and loue of Country, but as to sworne enemyes of this sweete soyle, I am to desire you, that at least, if you will haue straungers to your Princes, yet you will not deliuer the seignory of this goodly Kingdome to your noble Kings murtherers. Lastly, I haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> as if I had to speake to mad men, to desire you to be good to your selues: For before God, what either barbarous violence, or vnnaturall follie, hath not
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:12151:223"/>
this day had his seate in your mindes, and left his footsteps in your actions? But in troth I loue you too well, to stand long displayeng your faults: I would you your selues did forget them, so you did not fall againe into them. For my part, I had much rather be an orator of your prayses. But now (if you will suffer attentiue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> iudgement, and not foreiudging passion, to be the waigher of my wordes) I will deliuer vnto you what a blessed meane the Gods haue sent vnto you, if you list to embrace it. I thinke there is none among you so young, either in yeares, or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, but hath heard the true fame of that iust Prince <hi>Euarchus</hi> King of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> A Prince with whom our late maister did euer holde most perfit alliance. He, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> euen he, is this day come, hauing but twenty horse with him, within two miles of this place, hoping to haue found the vertuous <hi>Basilius</hi> aliue, but now willing to do honor to his death. Surely, surely the heauenly powers haue in so full a time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed him on vs, to vnite our diuisions. For my part therefore I wish, that since a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our selues we can not agree in so manifold partialities, we do put the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> of all these things into his hands, aswell touching the obsequies of the King, the punishment of his death, as the mariage and crowning of our Princesse. He is both by experience and wisedome taught how to direct: his greatnesse such, as no man can disdaine to obey him: his equitie such, as no man neede to feare him. Lastly, as he hath all these qualities to helpe, so hath he (though he would) no force <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> to hurt. If therfore you so thinke good, since our lawes beare that our Princes mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be chastized before his murthered bodie be buried, we may inuite him to sit to morowe in the iudgement seate; which done, you may after proceede to the buriall. When <hi>Philanax</hi> first named <hi>Euarchus</hi> landing, there was a muttring murmur among the people, as though in that euil ordered weaknes of theirs he had come to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> conquer their country. But when they vnderstood he had so small a retinue, whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pring one with another, and looking who should begin to confirme <hi>Philanax</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, at length <hi>Sympathus</hi> was the first that allowed it, then the rest of the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, neither did <hi>Kalander</hi> striue, hoping so excellent a Prince could not but deale graciously with two such young men, whose authoritie ioyned to <hi>Philanax,</hi> all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> popular sort followed. <hi>Timantus</hi> still blinded with his owne ambitious haste (not remembring factions are no longer to be trusted, then the factious may be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it is for their owne good) would needes striue against the streame, exclaiming against <hi>Philanax,</hi> that now he shewed who it was, that would betray his country to straungers. But well he found, that who is too busie in the foundation of an house, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> may pull the building about his eares. For the people alreadie tyred with their owne diuisions, (of which his clampring had bene a principall nurse) and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning now to espye a hauen of rest, hated any thing that should hinder them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it: asked one another whether this were not he, whose euill toong no man could es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape? whether it were not <hi>Timantus</hi> that made the first mutinous oration, to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the troubles? whether <hi>Timantus,</hi> without their consent, had not gone about to deliuer <hi>Gynaecia?</hi> And thus enflaming one another against him, they threwe him out of the assembly, and after pursued him with stones and staues, so that with losse of one of his eyes, sore wounded &amp; beaten, he was faine to flye to <hi>Philanax</hi> feete, for succour of his life: geuing a true lesson, that vice it selfe is forced to seeke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> the sanctuarie of vertue. For <hi>Philanax</hi> who hated his euill, but not his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and knewe that a iust punishment might by the maner be vniustly done; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring withall, that al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

yet if it were nourished in this, no man knewe to what extremities it might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it selfe: with earnest dealing, and employeng the vttermost of his authority, he did protect the trembling <hi>Timantus.</hi> And then hauing taken a generall oth, that they should in the noneage of the Princesse, or till these things were settled, yeeld full obedience to <hi>Euarchus,</hi> so farre as were not preiudiciall to the lawes, customes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and liberties of <hi>Arcadia:</hi> and hauing taken a particular bonde of <hi>Sympathus</hi> (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whome he had a seruaunt of his owne) that the prisoners should be kept close, without conference with any man: he himselfe honorablie accompanyed, with a great number of torches went to the king <hi>Euarchus,</hi> whose comming in this sort into <hi>Arcadia</hi> had thus falne out.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>The wofull Prince <hi>Plangus</hi> receyuing of <hi>Basilius</hi> no other succours but only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to conduct him to <hi>Euarchus,</hi> made all possible speede towards <hi>Byzantium,</hi> where he vnderstood the King, hauing concluded all his warres with the winning of that towne, had now for some good space made his abode. But being farre gone on his way, he receyued certayne intelligence, that <hi>Euarchus</hi> was not only some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> dayes before returned into <hi>Macedon,</hi> but since was gone with some haste to visit that coast of his country that lay towards <hi>Italy.</hi> The occasion geuen by the <hi>Latines,</hi> who hauing already gotten into their hands, partly by conquest, and partly by confederacie, the greatest part of <hi>Italie,</hi> and long gaped to deuoure <hi>Greece</hi> also (obseruing the present oportunitie of <hi>Euarchus</hi> absence, and <hi>Basilius</hi> solitarines,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> which two Princes they knewe to be in effect the whole strength of <hi>Greece</hi>) were euen readye to lay an vniust gripe vpon it, which after they might beawtifie with the noble name of conquest. Which purpose though they made not knowne by any solemne denouncing of warre, but contrarywise gaue many tokens of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing still their former amitie: yet the stayeng of his subiects shippes, traffiquing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> as Merchants into those partes, together with the dayly preparation of shipping, and other warlike prouisions in Portes, most conuenient for the transporting of souldyers, occasioned <hi>Euarchus</hi> (not vnacquainted with such practizes) first to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, then to discerne, lastly, to seeke to preuent the intended mischiefe. Yet thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king warre neuer to be accepted, vntill it be offred by the hand of necessitie, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> so long openly to hold them his friends, as open hostilitie bewraied them not his enemies; not ceasing in the meane time by letters &amp; messages to moue the States of <hi>Greece</hi> by vniting their strength, to make timely prouision against this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill: by many reasons making them see, that, though in respect of place some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might seeme further remoued from the first violence of the storme, yet being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> in the same ship, the finall wrack must needs be common to them all. And knowing the mighty force of example, with the weake effect of faire discourses not waited on with agreeable actions, what he perswaded them, himselfe performed, leauing in his owne realme nothing either vndone or vnprouided, which might be thought necessary for withstanding an inuasion. His first care was to put his people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> in a readinesse for warre, and by his experienced souldiers to traine the vnskilfull to martiall exercises. For the better effecting whereof, as also for meeting with other inconueniences in such doubtful times incident to the most setled states, making of the diuers regions of his whole kingdome so many diuisions as he thought conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, he appointed the charge of them to the greatest, and of greatest trust he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> about him: arming them with sufficient authoritie to leauie forces within their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall gouernments, both for resisting the inuading enemy, and punishing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:12151:224"/>
subiect. Hauing thus prepared the body, and assured the heart of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey against any mischiefe that might attaint it, he then tooke into his carefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration the externall parts, geuing order both for the repairing and encreasing his nauy, and for the fortifying of such places, especially on the sea coast, as either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> commoditie of landing, weakenes of the countrey, or any other respect of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage was likelyest to drawe the enemy vnto. But being none of them who thinke all things done, for which they haue once geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> direction, he folowed euery where his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement with his presence: which witnes of euery mans slacknes or dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, chastizing the one, &amp; encouraging the other, suffred not the frute of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> counsaile for want of timely taking to be lost. And thus making one place succede another in the progresse of wisedome &amp; vertue, he was now come to <hi>Aulon</hi> a principall porte of his realme, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poore <hi>Plangus</hi> extremely wearied with his long iourney (desire of succouring <hi>Erona</hi> no more relieuing, then feare of not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring her in time aggrauating his trauaile) by a lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table narratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> death, called home his cares fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tring foraine enemies, to suppresse the insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of inward passions. The matter so hainous, the maner so villanous, the losse of such persons, in so vnripe yeares, in a time so daungerous to the whole state of <hi>Greece,</hi> how veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly it moued to griefe &amp; compassio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, only not blind to the light of vertue, nor deafe to the voice of their country, might perchance by a more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> cunning workman in liuely cullors be deliuered. But the face of <hi>Euarchus</hi> sorow, to the one in nature, to both in affection, a father, and iudging the world so much the more vnworthely depriued of those excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies, as himselfe was better iudge of so excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t worthines, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no otherwise be shadowed out by the skilfullest pencel, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by couering it ouer with the vaile of sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And in deed that way himself took, with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> so pacient a quietnes receiuing this pitifull relation, that all words of weakenes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, magnanimity seemed to triumph ouer misery. Only receiuing of <hi>Plangus</hi> perfit instruction of all things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning <hi>Plexirtus</hi> &amp; <hi>Artaxia,</hi> with promise not only to aid him in deliuering <hi>Erona,</hi> but also with veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t protestation, neuer to returne into <hi>Macedon,</hi> til he had pursued the murtherers to death: he dispatched with speed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> a ship for <hi>Byzantium,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding the gouernor to prouide all necessaries for the war against his owne comming, which he purposed should be very shortly. In this ship <hi>Plangus</hi> would needs go, impacient of stay, for that in many days before he had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood nothing of his Ladies estate.

For besides the vniuersall case of <hi>Greece</hi> depriued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> by this meanes of a principall piller, he weighed and pitied the pittyfull state of the <hi>Arcadian</hi> people, who were in worse case then if death had taken away their Prince. For so yet their necessitie would haue placed some one to the helme: now, a Prince being, and not doing like a Prince, keeping and not exercising the place, they were in so much more euill case, as they coulde not prouide for their euill. These rightly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> wise &amp; vertuous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s especially moued <hi>Euarchus</hi> to take his iourny towards the desert, where arriuing within night, and vnderstanding to his great griefe the newes of the Princes death, hee wayted for his safe conduct from <hi>Philanax</hi>: in the meane time taking his rest vnder a tree, with no more affected pompes, then as a man that knew, how soeuer he was exalted, the beginning and end of his body was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> earth. But <hi>Philanax</hi> as soone as he was in sight of him, lighting from his horse, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented himselfe vnto him in all those humble behauiours, which not only the great reuerence of the partie but the conceit of ones owne miserie, is woont to frame. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarchus</hi> rase vp vnto him with so gratious a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenaunce, as the goodnes of his mind had long exercised him vnto: carefull so much more to descend in all curtesies, as he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> sawe him beare a lowe representation of his afflicted state. But to <hi>Philanax,</hi> assoone as by neere looking on him, he might perfectly behold him, the grauitie of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, and yeares, not much vnlike to his late deceassed, but euer beloued mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brought his forme so liuely vnto his memorie, and reuiued so all the thoughtes of his wonted ioyes within him, that in steede of speaking to <hi>Euarchus,</hi> hee stoode a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> while like a man gone a farre iorney from himselfe, calling as it were with his minde an account of his losses: imagining that this paine needed not, if nature had not ben violently stopped of her owne course: and casting more louing then wise conceites, what a world this woulde haue bene, if this sodaine accident had not interrupted it. And so farre strayed hee, into this rauing melancholy, that his eyes nimbler then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> his tounge let fall a floud of teares, his voice being stopped with extremitie of sob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, so much had his friendshippe caried him to <hi>Basilius,</hi> that hee thought no age

was timely for his death. But at length taking the occasion of his owne weeping, he thus did speake to <hi>Euarchus.</hi> Let not my teares most worthely renowmed Prince make my presence vnpleasant, or my speach vnmarked of you. For the iustnes of the cause, takes away the blame of any weakenes in me; and the affinitie that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> same beareth to your greatnes, seemes euen lawfully to clayme pitty in you: A Prince of a Princes fall, a louer of iustice, of a most vniust violence. And geue me leaue excellent <hi>Euarchus</hi> to say, I am but the representer of all the late florishing <hi>Arcadia,</hi> which now with mine eyes doth weepe, with my toong doth complaine, with my knees doth lay it selfe at your feete, which neuer haue bene vnreadie to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> carie you, to the vertuous protecting of innocents. Imagine, vouchsafe to imagine most wise and good King, that heere is before your eyes, the pittifull spectacle of a most dolorously ending tragedie: wherein I do but play the part, of all the newe miserable prouince, which being spoiled of their guide, doth lye like a ship without a Pilot, tumbling vp and downe in the vncertaine waues, till it either runne it selfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> vpon the rockes of selfe-diuision, or be ouerthrowne by the stormie winde of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine force. <hi>Arcadia</hi> finding her selfe in these desolate tearmes, doth speake, and I speake for her, to thee not vainly puissant Prince, that since now she is not only robbed of the naturall support of her Lord, but so sodainly robbed, that she hath not breathing time to stande for her safetie: so vnfortunately, that it doth appall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> their mindes, though they had leisure: and so mischeuously, that it doth exceede both the sodainnes and infortunatenes of it: thou wilt lend thine arme vnto her, and as a man, take compassion of mankinde, as a vertuous man chastice most abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable vice, and as a Prince protect a people, which all haue with one voyce cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for thy goodnes: thinking that as thou art only able, so thou art fullie able, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> redresse their imminent ruines. They do therefore with as much confidence as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, flie vnto you for succour, they lay themselues open to you: to you, I meane your selfe, such as you haue euer bene: that is to say one, that hath alwayes had his determinacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s bounded with equitie. They only reserue the right to <hi>Basilius</hi> blood; the maner to the auncient prescribing of their lawes. For the rest without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> they yeld ouer vnto you, as to the elected protectour of this kingdome, which name and office they beseech you till you haue layde a sufficient foundacion of tranquilitie, to take vpon you the particularitie both of their statutes and demands, you shal presently after vnderstand. Now only I am to say vnto you, that this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie falls to be a faire field, to prooue whether the goodlie tree of your vertue, will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> liue in all soiles. Heere I say will be seene, whether either feare can make you short, or the likorousnes of dominion make you beyond iustice. And I can for conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion say no more but this, you must thinke vpon my words and your answere, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not only the quiet, but the liues of so many thousands, which for their aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent confederacie in this extreame necessity, desire neither the expence of your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> treasure, nor hazard of your subiects, but only the benefit of your wisedome, whose both glory and encrease stands in the exercising of it. The summe of this request was vtterly vnlooked for of <hi>Euarchus,</hi> which made him the more diligent in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his speach, and after his speach take the greater pause for a perfect resolucion. For as of the one side, he thought nature required nothing more of him then that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> he should be a helpe, to them of like creation, and had his heart no whit comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with feare, thinking his life well passed, hauing satisfyed the tyrannie of time which the course of many yeares, the expectation of the world with more then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

honour, lastly the tribute due to his own mind with the daily offring of most vertuous actions: so of the other hee wayed the iust reproach that followed those, who easely enter into other folkes busines, with the opinion might be conceaued, loue of seignorie rather then of iustice, had made him embarke himselfe, into a matter nothing pertaining to him, especially in a time when ernest occasion of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> owne busines so greatly required his presence: But in the ende wisedome being an assentiall and not an opinionate thing, made him rather to bend to what was in it selfe good, then what by euill mindes might bee iudged not good. And therein did see, that though that people did not belong vnto him, yet doing good which is not enclosed within any tearmes of people did belong vnto him, and if necessitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> forced him for some time to abide in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> the necessitie of <hi>Arcadia</hi> might iustly demaund some fruite of abiding. To this secreat assurance of his owne worthines (which although it bee neuer so well cloathed in modestie, yet alwaies liues in the worthyest mindes) did much push him forward saying vnto himselfe, the treasure of those inward guifts he had, were bestowed by the heauens vpon him, to be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> and not idle. On which determination resting and yet willing before hee wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any further, to examine well the depth of the others proffer, hee thus with that well appeased gesture, vnpassionate nature bestoweth vpon mankind, made answere to <hi>Philanax</hi> most vrgent peticion. Although long experience hath made me knowe, all men (&amp; so Princes which be but men) to be subiect to infinite casualties, the verie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> constitution of our liues remaining in continuall change: yet the affaires of this countrie, or at least my meeting so iumply with them, mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With much paine I am come hither to see my long approued friend and now I finde if I will see him, I must see him dead: after, for mine owne securitie, I seeke to be waranted mine owne life: And their sodainely am I appointed to be a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> iudge of other mens liues, though a friend to him, yet am I a stranger to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and now of a stranger you would sodainely make a director. I might obiect to your desire my weakenes, which age perhaps hath wrought in mind and body: and iustly I may pretend the necessitie of mine owne affaires, which as I am by all true rules most neerely tyed so can they not long beare the delaye of my absence. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> though I woulde and coulde dispence with these difficulties, what assurance can I haue of the peoples will? Which hauing so many circles of imaginations can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be enclosed in one pointe. Who knowes a people, that knowes not sodaine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion makes them hope, which hope if it be not answered, they fall in hate? Choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and refusing, erecting, and ouerthrowing, according as the presentnes of any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> fancie caries them. Euen this their hastie drawing to me, makes me thinke they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be as hastiely withdrawen form me, for it is but one ground of inconstancie, soone to take or soone to leaue. It may be they haue hard of <hi>Euarchus</hi> more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cause: their own eies wilbe perhaps more curious iudges, out of hearesay they may haue builded many conceites, which I can not perchaunce wil not performe, then wil vndeserued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> repentance be a greater shame and iniurie vnto me, then their vndeserued proffer, is honour. And to conclude I must be fully enformed, how the pacient is minded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can promise to vndertake the cure. <hi>Philanax</hi> was not of the moderne mindes, who make suiters magistrates: but did euer thinke the vnwilling worthy man, was fitter then the vndeseruing desirer. Therefore the more <hi>Euarchus</hi> drewe backe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> the more hee founde in him that the cunningest pilot, doth most dread the rockes, the more earnestly hee pursued his publique request vnto him. Hee desired him
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:12151:226"/>
not to make anye weake excuses of his weakenesse, since so manye examples had well proued his minde, was stronge to ouerpasse the greatest troubles, and his body strong enough to obey his minde; and that so long as they were ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he knew <hi>Euarchus</hi> would thinke it no wearisome exercise, to make them ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of vertuous actions. The dutie to his countrie, he acknowledged, which as hee had so setled, as it was not to feare any soddaine alteration, so since it did want him, as well it might endure a fruictfull as an idle absence. As for the doubt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued of the peoples constancie in this their election, hee saide it was such a doubt as al humane actions are subiect vnto: yet as much as in politique matters, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> not geometricall certainties, a man may assure himselfe there was euident likelyhoode to bee conceaued, of the continuance, both in their vnanimitie, and his worthynes: wherof the on was apt to be held, &amp; the other to hold, ioyned to the present necessitie, the firmest band of mortall mindes. In sum hee alledged, so many reasons to <hi>Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore mounting on their horses they hasted to the lodges, where they found though late in the night, the people wakefully watching, for the issue of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanax</hi> embassage. No man thinking the matter would be well done, without he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> his voice in it, and each deeming his owne eyes the best gardiens of his throte in that vnaccustomed tumult. But when they saw <hi>Philanax</hi> returne, hauing on his right hande the King <hi>Euarchus</hi> on whome they had nowe placed the greatest burthen of their feares, with ioyfull shoutes and applawding acclamations, they made him and the world quickly know that one mans sufficiencie is more auailable then ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands multitude. So euill ballanced be the extremities of popular mindes: and so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> much naturall imperiousnes there rests in a well formed spirit. For as if <hi>Euarchus</hi> had ben borne of the princely bloud of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> or that long and well acquainted proofe had engrafted him in their countrie, so flocked they about this straunger, most of them alredie, from deiected feares, rising to ambitious considerations, who should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> catch the first hold of his fauour. And then from those crying welcomes to babling one with the other, some praysing <hi>Philanax</hi> for his succeeding paine, others likinge <hi>Euarchus</hi> aspect, &amp; as they iudged his age by his face, so iudging his wisedome by his age, <hi>Euarchus</hi> passed thorow them like a man that did neither disdaine a people nor yet was any thing tickled with their flatteries. But alwayes holding his owne, a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> might reade a constant determination in his eyes. And in that sorte dismounting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, he forthwith demaunded the conuocation to bee made, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly was done, with as much order and silence: as it might appeare. <hi>Neptune</hi> had not more force to appease the rebellious winde, then the admiration of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary vertue hath, to temper a disordered multitude. He being raysed vp vppon a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> place more hie then the rest, where he might be best vnderstoode, in this sorte spake vnto them. I vnderstande saide hee, faithfull <hi>Arcadians,</hi> by my L. <hi>Philanax,</hi> that you haue with one consent, chosen me to be the iudge of the late euills hapned: orderer of the present disorders: and finally protector of this countrie, til therein it be seene what the customes of <hi>Arcadia</hi> require. He could saye no further, being stopped with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> a generall crie, that so it was; geuing him all the honourable titles, and happie wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, they could imagin.

you, the proofe in me. But because it many times falls out, we are much deceaued in others, we being the first to deceaue ourselues, I am to require you, not to haue an ouershooting expectation of mee: the most cruell aduersary of all honourable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Nor promise yourselues wonders, out of a sodaine lyking: but remember I am a man, that is to say a creature, whose reason is often darkned with error. Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that you will laye your hearts voyde of foretaken opinions: els whatsoeuer I doe or say, will be measured by a wronge rule, like them that the haue yellow Iaundise, euery thing seeming yellowe vnto them. Thirdly, whatsoeuer debates haue rysen among you, may be vtterly extinguished, knowing that euen among the best men are diuersities of opinions, which are no more in true reason to breed hatred, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> one that loues black, should be angrie with him that is clothed in white, for thoughts &amp; conceits are the verie apparel of the mind. Lastly, that you do not easely iudge of your iudge, but since you will haue me to command, thinke it is your part to obay. And in rewarde of this, I will promise and protest vnto you, that to the vttermost of my skill; but in the generall lawes of nature, especially of <hi>Greece,</hi> and particular of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> 
               <hi>Arcadia</hi> (wherein I must confesse I am not vnacquainted) I will not onely see the passed euills duly punished, and your weale here after established; but for your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in it, if need shall requeir, I wil imploy the forces and treasures of mine owne country. In the meane time, this shalbe the first order I will take, that no man vnder paine of greeuous punishment, name me by any other name but protector of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> For I will not leaue any possible culloure, to any of my naturall successors, to make claime to this, which by free election you haue bestowed vpon me. And so I vowe vnto you, to depose my self of it assoone as the iudgement is passed, the King buried, and his lawfull successor appointed. For the first whereof (I meane the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which be guiltie of the Kings death, and these other haynous trespasses, because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> your customes require such haste I will no longer delay it, then till to morrowe as soone as the Sunne shall giue vs fit opportunitie. You may therefore retire your selues to your rest, that you may be reddier to be present, at these so great important matters. Which many allowing tokens, was <hi>Euarchus</hi> speech heard, who nowe by <hi>Philanax</hi> (that tooke the principall care, of doing all due seruices vnto him) was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> a lodging made ready for him, (the rest of the people aswell as the small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of that place, would suffer yeelding their weery heads to sleepe) when loe the night thorowly spent, in these mixed matters, was for that time banished the face of the earth, and <hi>Euarchus,</hi> seing the daye beginne to discloase his comfortable beauties, desiring nothing more, then to ioyne speede with iustice, willed <hi>Philanax,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> presently to make the iudgement place bee put in order: and assoone as the people (who yet were not fully dispersed) might be brought together, to bring foorth the prisoners and the Kings body. Which the manner was, should in such cases be held in sight, though couered with blacke veluet, vntill they that were accused to be the murderers were quitted or condemned, whether the reason of the law were to shew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the more gratefull loue to their Prince, or by that spectacle, the more to remember the iudge of his dutie. <hi>Philanax</hi> who now thought in himself, he approached by the iust reuenge he so much desired, went withall care and diligence to performe his charge. But first it shalbe well to knowe, how the poore and princely prisoners, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this tedious night. There was neuer tyrante exercised his rage with more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> torments, vpon any he most hated; then afflicted <hi>Gynecia</hi> did crusifie her owne soule, after the guiltines of her harte, was surcharged with the sodainenes of her

husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds death, for although that effect came not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her minde yet her mind being euil, &amp; the effect euill, she thought the iustice of God, had for the beginning of her paines copled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together. This incessantly boyled in her brest, but most of al, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Philanax</hi> hauing cloasely imprisoned her, she was lefte more freely to suffer, the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of her owne thoughts, especially when it grewe darke, and had nothing left by her, but a little lampe, whose small light to a perplexed mind, might rather yeld feareful shadowes, then any assured sight. Then beganne the heapes of her miseries, to waye downe the platforme of her iudgement, then beganne despaire to laye his ougly clawes vpon her, shee beganne then, to feare the heauenly powers (shee was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> woont to reuerence) not like a childe, but like an enemie, neither kept she herselfe, from blasphemous repyning against her creation. O Gods would she crye out, why did you make me to destruction? If you loue goodnes, why did you not geue me a good minde? Or if I cannot haue it without your gifte, why doe you plague mee? Is it in me to resist the mightines of your power? Then would she imagine she sawe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> strange sights, and that she heard the cries of hellish ghostes, then would she skritch out for succour, but no man comming vnto her shee woulde faine haue killed her helfe, but knewe not how. At sometimes againe, the very heauines of her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, would cloase vp her senses to a little sleepe: but then did her dreames be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her tormentors. One time it would seeme vnto her, <hi>Philanax</hi> was haling her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> by the heare of the head, and hauing put out her eyes, was redy to throw her into a burning fornace. Another time she would thinke she sawe her husband making the complainte of his death to <hi>Pluto,</hi> and the magistrates of that infernall region, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending in great debate, to what eternal punishment they should allot her. But long her dreaming would not hold, but that it woulde fall vpon <hi>Zelmane</hi>: to whom shee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> would think she was crying for mercy, and that she did passe away by her in silence without any shew of pittying her mischief. Then waking out of a broken sleep, and yet wishing she might euer haue slept, new formes but of the same miseries, would seaze her minde, shee feared death, and yet desired death, shee had passed the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of shame, and yet shame was one of her cruellest assaulters, she hated <hi>Pyrocles</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> as the originall of her mortall ouerthrowe: and yet the loue shee had conceaued to him, had still a hie authoritie of her passions. O <hi>Zelmane,</hi> would she say (not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how neere he himselfe was to as great a daunger) now shalt thou glut thy eyes, with the dishonoured death of thy enemie! Enemie alas enemie, since so thou haste wel shewed, thou wilt haue me accompt thee, couldest thou not aswel haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> a determinate deniall, as to disguise thy first diguising, with a doble dissembling? Perchaunce if I had bene vtterly hopelesse, the vertue was once in me, might haue called together his forces, and not haue beene led captiue to this monstrous thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of punished wickednes. Then would her owne knowing of good enflame a new the rage of despaire: which becomming an vnresisted Lorde in her brest, shee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> had no other comforte but in death, which yet she had in horror, when she thought of. But the wearisome detesting of her selfe, made her long for the dayes approach, at which time shee determined to continue her former course in acknowledginge any thing, which might hasten her ende: Wherein although shee did not hope for the end of her torments, feeling alreadye the beginning of hell agonies; yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> to the nature of paine, the presente being most intollerable, shee desired to change that, and put to aduenture the ensuing. And thus rested the restlesse <hi>Gynecia,</hi> no lesse sorrowfull, though lesse ragefull were the mindes of the Princesse <hi>Pamela,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:12151:228"/>
and the Lady <hi>Philoclea,</hi> whose only aduantages were, that they had not consented to so much euill, and so were at greater peace with themselues: and that they were not lefte alone, but might mutually beare parte of each others woes. For when <hi>Philanax</hi> not regarding <hi>Pamelas</hi> princely protestations, had by force left her vnder garde with her sister, and that the two sisters were matched, aswell in the disgraces of fortune, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> they had beene in the best beauties of nature: those thinges that till then, bashfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and mistrust had made them holde reserued, one from the other, now feare the vnderminer of all determinations, and necessitie the victorious rebell of all lawes, forced them enterchaungeably to lay open. There passions then so swelling in them, as they woulde haue made Auditors of stones, rather then haue swallowed vp in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> silence, the choking aduentures were falne vnto them. Truely the hardest hartes, which haue at any time thought womans teares to be a matter of sleight compassion (imagining that faire weather, will quickly after followe) would now haue beene mollyfied: and bene compelled to confesse, that the fayrer a diamond is, the more pittie it is it shoulde receaue a bleamish. Although no doubte their faces, did rather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> beautifie sorrow, then sorrow coulde darken that, which euen in darkenes did shine. But after they had so long, as their other afflictions would suffer them, with doleful ceremonies bemoned their fathers death: they sate downe together apparrelled as their misaduentures had founde them. <hi>Pamela</hi> in her iournying weedes nowe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to another vse: <hi>Philoclea</hi> onely in her night gowne, which she thought should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> bee the rayment of her funeralls. But when the excellent creatures, had after much panting (with their inwarde trauell) gotten so much breathing power, as to make a pittifull discourse one to the other, what had befallne them; and that by the plaine comparing the case they were in, they thorowlye founde, that their greiues, were not more like in regarde of themselues, then like in respecte of the subiecte (the two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Princes (as <hi>Pamela</hi> had learned of <hi>Musidorus</hi>) being so minded, as they woulde euer make both their fortunes one) it did more vnite, and so strengthen their lamentation: seing the one coulde not bee miserable, but that it must necessarilie make the other miserable also. That, therfore was the first matter their sweet mouths deliuered, the declaring the passionate beginning, troblesome proceeding, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> daungerous ending, their neuer ending loues had passed. And when at any time they entred into the prayses of the young Princes, to long it woulde haue exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their tonges, but that their memory foorthwith warned them, the more prayse worthy they were the more at that time they were worthy of lamentation. Then againe to crying and wringing of handes; and then a newe, as vnquiet greefe sought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> each corner, to newe discourses, from discourses to wishes, from wishes to prayers. Especially the tender <hi>Philoclea,</hi> who as she was in yeares yonger, and had neuer lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp her minde to any opinion of souereignetie, so was she the apter to yeelde to her misfortune; hauing no stronger debates in her minde, then a man maye saye a most wittie childehoode is woont to nourish: as to imagine with her selfe, why <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 
               <hi>Philanax</hi> and the other noble men, shoulde deale so cruelly by her, that had neuer deserued euill of any of them? And howe they could finde in their hartes, to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son such a personage, as she did figure <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> whome shee thought all the worlde was bounde to loue, as well as shee did? But <hi>Pamela,</hi> although endewed with a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous mildenes, yet the knowledge of her selfe, and what was due vnto her, made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> her hart full of a stronger disdaine, against her aduersitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:12151:228"/>So that she ioyned the vexacion for her friend, with the spite to see her selfe as she thought rebelliously detayned, and mixed desirous thoughts to helpe, with reuengefull thoughts if she could not helpe. And as in pangs of death, the stronger hart feeles the greater torment, because it doth the more resist to his oppressour; so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> her minde, the nobler it was set, and had already embraced the hyer thoughtes, so much more it did repine; and the more it repined, the more helplesse wounds it gaue vnto it selfe. But when great part of the night was passed ouer the dolefull musicke of these sweete Ladies complaints, and that leasure though with some strife, had brought <hi>Pamela</hi> to know, that an Eagle when she is in a Cage, must not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> thinke to do like an Eagle, remembring with themselues, that it was likely the next day, the Lords would proceed against those they had imprisoned. They imployed the rest of the night, in writing vnto them, with such earnestnes as the matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, but in such stiles as the state of their thoughts was apt to fashion. In the meane time, <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Musidorus,</hi> were recommended to so strong a guard, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> they might well see it was meant, they should pay no lesse prise then their liues, for the getting out of that place, which they like men in deede, (fortifying cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage with the true Rampier of patience) did so endure, as they did rather appeare gouernours of necessitie, then seruaunts to fortune. The whole summe of their thoughts resting vpon the safetie of their Ladyes, and their care one for the other: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Wherein (if at all) their harts did seeme to receyue some softnes. For sometimes <hi>Musidorus</hi> would feele such a motion to his friend, and his vnworthy case, that he would fall into such kinde speeches. My <hi>Pyrocles</hi> would he say, how vnhappy may I thinke <hi>Thessalia,</hi> that hath bene as it were, the middle way to this euill estate of yours? For if you had not bene there brought vp, the Sea should not haue had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> this power, thus to seuer you from your deere father. I haue therefore, (if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playntes do at any time become a mans hart) most cause to complayne, since my Countrie, which receyued the honor of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> educacion, should be a step to his ouerthrowe, if humane chances can be compted an ouerthrowe to him, that stands vppon vertue. Oh excellent <hi>Musidorus</hi> aunswered <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> howe do you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> teache me rather, to fall out with my selfe, and my fortune, since by you I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued all good, you only by me this affliction? to you and your vertuous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I in my tendrest yeares, and fathers greatest troubles, was sent for succour. There did I learne the sweete mysteries of Phylosophy; there had I your liuely example, to confirme that which I learned; there lastly had I your friendship, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> which no vnhappines can euer make me saye, but that hath made me happy. Now see how my desteny (the gods knowe) not my will, hath rewarded you: my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sends for you away out of your land, whence but for me you had not come: what after followed, you knowe. It was my loue not yours, which first stayed you heere; and therefore if the heauens euer held a iust proportion, it were I and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> you, that should feele the smart. O blame not the heauens, sweete <hi>Pyrocles</hi> sayde <hi>Musidorus,</hi> as their course neuer alters, so is there nothing done by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reacheable ruler of them, but hath an euerlasting reason for it. And to saye the truth of these things, we should deale vngratefully with nature, if we should be forgetfull receyuers of her giftes, and so diligent Auditors of the chaunces we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> like not. We haue liued, and haue liued to be good to our selues, and others: our soules which are put into the sturring earth of our bodyes, haue atchieued the causes of their hether co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming: They haue knowne, &amp; honoured with knowledge,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:229"/>
the cause of their creation, and to many men (for in this time, place, and fortune, it is lawfull for vs to speake gloriously) it hath bene behouefull, that we should liue. Since then eternitie is not to be had in this coniunction, what is to be lost by the separation, but time? which since it hath his ende, when that is once come, all what is past is nothing: and by the protracting nothing gotten, but labour and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> care. Do not me therefore that wrong, (who something in yeares, but much in all other deserts, am fitter to dye then you) as to say you haue brought me to any euill: since the loue of you, doth ouerballance all bodely mischiefes, and those mischiefes be but mischiefes to the basermindes, too much delighted with the kennell of this life. Neither will I any more yeeld to my passion of lamenting you,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> which howsoeuer it might agree to my exceeding friendship, surely it would no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to your exceeding vertue. Add this to your noble speech my deere Cozen said <hi>Pirocles,</hi> that if we complaine of this our fortune, or seeme to our selues faultie, in hauing one hurt the other, we showe a repentance of the loue we beare to these matchlesse creatures, or at least a doubt, it should be ouerdeerely bought, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> for my part (and so dare I aunswere for you) I call all the gods to witnesse, I am so farre from, that no shame, no torment, no death, would make me forgoe the least part, of the inward honor, essentiall pleasure, and liuing life, I haue enioyed in the presence of the faultlesse <hi>Philoclea.</hi> Take the preheminence in all things, but in true louing, aunswered <hi>Musidorus,</hi> for the confession of that no death shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> get of me. Of that aunswered <hi>Pirocles</hi> soberly smiling, I perceiue wee shall haue a debate in the other world, if at least there remayne any thing of remembrance in that place. I do not thinke the contrarye sayde <hi>Musidorus,</hi> although you knowe, it is greately helde, that with the death of bodye and sences (whiche are not onely the beginning, but dwelling and nourishing of passions, thoughts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> and immaginations) they fayling, memorye likewise fayles, which riseth onely out of them: and then is there left nothing, but the intellectuall parte or intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, which voide of all morall vertues, which stande in the meane of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbacions, doth onely liue in the contemplatiue vertue, and power of the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent good, the soule of soules, and vniuersall life of this great worke, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> is vtterly voide, from the possibilitie of drawing to it selfe, these sensible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations. Certenly answered <hi>Pirocles,</hi> I easely yeeld, that we shall not knowe one another, and much lesse these passed things, with a sensible or passionate knowledge. For the cause being taken away, the effect followes. Neither do I thinke, we shall haue such a memorye, as nowe we haue, which is but a relicke of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> the senses, or rather a print the senses haue left of things passed, in our thoughtes, but it shall be a vitall power of that very intelligence; which as while it was heere, it helde the chiefe seate of our life, and was as it were the last resorte, to which of all our knowledges, the hyest appeale came, and so by that meanes was neuer ignorant of our actions, though many times rebelliously resisted, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> with this prison darkened: so, much more being free of that prison, and returning to the life of all things, where all infinite knowledge is, it cannot but be a right intelligence, which is both his name and being, of things both present and passed, though voyde of imagining to it selfe any thing, but euen growen like to his Creator, hath all things, with a spirituall knowledge before it. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> of which is as hard for vs to conceaue, as it had for vs, when wee were in our mothers wombes, to comprehende (if any body would haue tould vs)
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:12151:229"/>
what kinde of light we nowe in this life see. What kinde of knowledge we nowe haue, yet nowe we do not only feele our present being, but we conceaue what we were before we were borne, though remembrance make vs not do it, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and though we are vtterly without any remorse of any misery, we might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> then suffer. Euen such and much more odds, shall there be at that second deliuery of ours; when voyde of sensible memorye, or memoratiue passion, wee shall not see the cullours, but lifes of all things that haue bene or can be: and shall as I hope knowe our friendship, though exempt from the earthlie cares of friendship, hauing both vnited it, and our selues, in that hye and heauenly loue of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> light.

            <p>Thus did they like quiet Swannes, sing their owne obsequies, and vertuously enhable theyr mindes against all extremities, which they did thinke woulde fall vppon them, especially resoluing, that the fyrst care they would haue, should be by taking the faulte vpon themselues, to cleere the two Ladyes, of whose case (as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> of nothing else that had happened) they had not any knowledge. Although their friendly hoste, the honest Gentleman <hi>Kalander,</hi> seeking all meanes how to helpe them, had endeuored to speake with them, and to make them knowe who should be their iudge. But the curious seruaunt of <hi>Philanax</hi> forbad him the entrye, vppon paine of death. For so it was agreed vppon, that no man should haue any confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> with them, for feare of newe tumults. Insomuch that <hi>Kalander</hi> was constray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to retire himselfe, hauing yet obtayned thus much, that he would deliuer vnto the two Princes, their apparell and iewells, which being left with him at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinea,</hi> (wisely considering that theyr disguised weedes, which were all as then they had, would make them more odious in the sight of the iudges) he had that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> night sent for, and now brought vnto them. They accepted their owne, with great thankefulnes, knowing from whence it came, and attired themselues in it against the nexte daye, which being in deede ritch and princely, they accordinglye
<pb facs="tcp:12151:230"/>
determined to maintaine the names of <hi>Palladius</hi> and <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> as before it is mencioned. Then gaue they themselues to consider, in what sort they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende their causes, for they thought it no lesse vaine to wish death, then coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feare it, till something before morning, a small slumber taking them, they were by and by after callde vp to come to the aunswere, of no lesse then theyr <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> liues imported. But in this sort was the iudgement ordred. As soone as the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had taken a full possession of the Element, <hi>Euarchus</hi> called vnto him <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax,</hi> and willed him to draw out into the middest of the greene (before the chiefe lodge) the throne of iudgement seate, in which <hi>Basilius</hi> was woont to sit, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their customes, was euer carried with the Prince. For <hi>Euarchus</hi> did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> wisely consider, the people to be naturally taken with exterior shewes, farre more then with inward consideracion, of the materiall pointes. And therefore in this newe entrie into so entangled a matter, he would leaue nothing which might be eyther an armour or ornament vnto him, and in these pompous ceremonyes he well knewe a secreat of gouernment much to consist. That was performed by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> diligent <hi>Philanax,</hi> and therein <hi>Euarchus</hi> did set himselfe all cloathed in blacke, with the principall men, who could in that sodainenes prouide themselues of such mourning rayments. The whole people commaunded to keepe an orderly silence of each side, which was duly obserued of them, partly for the desire they had to see a good conclusion of these matters, and partly striken with admiracion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> aswell at the graue and princely presence of <hi>Euarchus,</hi> as at the greatnes of the cause, which was then to come in question. As for <hi>Philanax, Euarchus</hi> woulde haue done him the honour to sit by him, but he excused himselfe, desiring to be the accuser of the prisoners in his maisters behalfe; and therefore since he made himselfe a partie, it was not conuenient for him to sit in the iudiciall place. Then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> was it awhile deliberated, whether the two young Ladies, should be brought forth in open presence, but that was stopped by <hi>Philanax,</hi> whose loue and faith, did des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from his maister to his children, and only desired, the smart should light vpon the others, whome he thought guiltie of his death and dishonour, alleaging for this, that neyther wisedome would, they should be brought in presence of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> people, which might herevpon growe to new vprores: nor iustice required, they should be drawen to any shame, till some body accused them. And as for <hi>Pamela,</hi> he protested the lawes of <hi>Arcadia</hi> would not allowe any iudgement of her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she her selfe, were to determine nothing, till age or marriage enabled her. Then the Kings body being layde vppon a Table, iust before <hi>Euarchus,</hi> and all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> couered ouer with blacke, the prisoners, namely the Queene, and two young Princes, were sent for to appeare in the Protectors name: which name was the cause, they came not to knowledge, how neere a kinseman was to iudge of them, but thought him to be some Noble man, chosen by the Country, in this extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye. So extraordinary course, had the order of the heauens produced at this time,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> that both nephewe and sonne, were not only prisoners, but vnknowen, to their vncle and father, who of many yeares had not seene them. And <hi>Pyrocles</hi> was to pleade for his life before that throne, in which throne lately before he had saued the Kings life.

her face, most part of her goodly heare (on which her hands had layd many a spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full holde) so lying vpon her shoulders, as a man might well see, had no artificiall carelesnes. Her eyes downe on the ground, of purpose not to looke on <hi>Pyrocles</hi> face, which she did not so much shunne, for the vnkindnes she conceaued of her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> owne ouerthrow, as for the feare, those motions in this short time of her life, should be reuiued, which she had with the passage of infinite sorrowes mortified. Great was the compassion the people felt, to see their Princesse state, and beawtie, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by fortune and her owne desert, whome they had euer found a Lady most worthy of all honour. But by and by the sight of the other two prisoners, drewe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> most of the eyes to that spectacle. <hi>Pyrocles</hi> came out led by <hi>Sympathus,</hi> cloathed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Greeke manner, in a long coate of white veluet, reaching to the small of his legge, with great buttons of Diamonds all along vppon it: His neck without any coller, not so much as hidden with a ruffe, did passe the whitenes of his garments, which was not much in fashion vnlike to the crimson rayment, our Knightes of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the order first put on. On his feete he had nothing but slippers, which after the auncient manner, were tyed vp with certayne laces, which were fastened vnder his knee, hauing wrapped about (with many pretty knots) his naked legs. His fayre auberne heare (which he ware in great length, and gaue at that time a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull shew, with being sturd vp and downe with the breath of a gentle winde) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> had nothing vppon it, but a white Ribbin, in those dayes vsed for a Diademe. Which rolled once or twise about the vppermost parte of his forehead, fell downe vppon his backe, cloased vp at each ende with the richest pearle were to be seene in the world. After him followed an other Noble man, guiding the noble <hi>Musidorus.</hi> Who had vpon him, a long cloake, after the fashion of that, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> which we call the Apostles mantle, made of purple Satten; not that purple which we now haue, and is but a counterfet of the <hi>Getulian</hi> purple (which yet was farre the meaner in price and estimacion) but of the right <hi>Tyrian</hi> purple, which was nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to a cullour betwixt our murrey and skarlet. On his head, which was blacke and curled, he ware a <hi>Persian Tiara,</hi> all set downe with rowes of so rich Rubies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> as they were inough to speake for him, that they had to iudge of no meane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage.</p>
            <p>In this sorte with erected countenaunces, did these vnfortunate Princes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themselues to be ledd, shewing aright by the comparison of them and <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necia,</hi> how to diuers persons, compassion is diuersly to be sturred. For as to <hi>Gine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> a Ladie knowne of great estate, and greatly esteemed, the more miserable representation was made of her sodaine ruyne, the more mens heartes were forced to bewayle such an euident witnesse of weake humanitie: so to these men, not regarded because vnknowne, but rather (besides the detestacion of their facte) hated as straungers, the more they shoulde haue falne downe in an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> abiecte semblance, the more in steed of compassion they shoulde haue gotten contempt: but therefore, were to vse (as I may tearme it) the more violence of magnanimitye, and so to conquer the expectation of the lookers, with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarye vertue. And such effecte in deede it wrought in the whole assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye, theyr eyes yet standing as it were in ballance, to whether of them they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> should most directe theyr sight. <hi>Musidorus</hi> was in stature so much higher then <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> as commonly is gotten by one yeares growth. His face now beginning to haue some tokens of a beard, was composed to a kinde of manlike beawtie.
<pb facs="tcp:12151:231"/>
His cullour was of a well pleasing brownenes, &amp; the features of it such, as they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried both delight and maiestie: his countenance seuere, and promising a minde much giuen to thinking. <hi>Pyrocles</hi> of a pure complexion, and of such a cheerefull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, as might seeme either a womans face on a boy, or an excellent boyes face in a woman. His looke gentle and bashfull, which bred the more admiracion, hauing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> shewed such notable proofes of courage. Lastly, though both had both, if there were any ods, <hi>Musidorus</hi> was the more goodly, and <hi>Pyrocles</hi> the more louely. But assoone as <hi>Musidorus</hi> saw himselfe so farre forth led among the people, that he knew to a great number of them his voyce should be heard, misdoubting their intention to the Princesse <hi>Pamela,</hi> (of which he was more carefull then of his owne life,)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> euen as he went (though his leader sought to interrupt him) he thus with a lowde voyce spake vnto them. And is it possible ô <hi>Arcadians,</hi> sayd he, that you can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the naturall dutie you owe to your Princesse <hi>Pamela?</hi> hath this soyle bene so little beholding to her noble Auncesters? hath so long a time rooted no surer loue in your hearts to that line? Where is that faith to your Princes blood, which hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> not only preserued you from all daungers heretofore, but hath spred your fame to all the nations in the world? Where is the iustice, the <hi>Arcadians</hi> were wont to flourish in, whose nature is to render to euery one his owne? Will you now keepe the right from your Prince, who is the only geuer of iudgement, the keye of iustice, and life of your lawes? Do you hope in a fewe yeares, to set vp such another race,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> which nothing but length of time can establish? Will you reward <hi>Basilius</hi> children with vngratefulnes, the very poyson of manhood? Will you betray your long set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led reputation, with the fowle name of traytors? Is this your mourning for your Kings death, to encrease his losse with his daughters misery? Imagin your Prince do looke out of the heauens vnto you, what do you thinke he could wish more at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> your hands then that you do well by his children? And what more honor I pray you can you do to his obsequies, then to satisfie his soule with a louing memorie, as you do his body with an vnfelt solemnitie? What haue you done with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <hi>Pamela? Pamela</hi> the iust enheretrix of this Countrey, <hi>Pamela</hi> whom this earth may be happy, that it shall be hereafter sayde she was borne in <hi>Arcadia. Pamela</hi> in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> her selfe your ornament, in her education your foster childe, and euery way your only Princesse, what accompt can you render to your selues of her? Truly I do not thinke that you all knowe what is become of her: so soone may a Diamond be lost? so soone may the fayrest light in the world be put out. But looke, looke vnto it, O <hi>Arcadians,</hi> be not so wilfully robbed of your greatest treasure, make not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> your selues ministers to priuate ambitions, who do but vse your selues to put on your owne yokes. Whatsoeuer you determine of vs (who I must confesse are but strangers) yet let not <hi>Basilius</hi> daughters be straungers vnto you. Lastly, howsoeuer you barre her from her publicke souereigntie, (which if you do, little may we hope of equitie where rebellion raignes) yet deny not that childs right vnto her, that she <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> may come and do the last duties to her fathers body. Deny not that happines (if in such a case there be any happines) to your late King, that his body may haue his last touch of his deerest child. With such like broken maner of questions and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, was <hi>Musidorus</hi> desirous as much as in passing by them he could, to moue the people to tender <hi>Pamelas</hi> fortune. But at length by that they came to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> place, both <hi>Sympathus</hi> and his guider had greatly satisfied him, with the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they gaue him, this assemblie of people had neyther meaning nor power, to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:12151:231"/>
do any hurt to the Princesse, whome they all acknowledged as their souereigne Lady. But that the custome of <hi>Arcadia</hi> was such, till she had more yeares, the state of the country to be guided by a Protector, vnder whome, he and his fellow were to receiue their iudgement. That eased <hi>Musidorus</hi> hart of his most vehement care, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> when he found his beloued Lady to be out of daunger. But <hi>Pyrocles</hi> assoone as the Queene of the one side, he and <hi>Musidorus</hi> of the other, were stayed before the face of their iudge, (hauing only for their barre the Table on which the Kings body lay) being nothing lesse vexed with the doubt of <hi>Philoclea,</hi> then <hi>Musidorus</hi> was for <hi>Pamela,</hi> in this sort with a lowlie behauiour, and only then like a suppliant, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> he spake to the Protector. Pardon me most honoured Iudge, said he, that vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded I begin my speech vnto you, since both to you and me, these wordes of mine shall be most necessary. To you hauing the sacred exercise of iustice in your hand, nothing appertaines more properly then truth nakedly &amp; freely set downe. To me, being enuironed round about with many daungerous calamities, what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> can be more conuenient, then at least, to be at peace with my selfe, in hauing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged my conscience, in a most behouefull veritie. Vnderstand therefore, and truly vnderstand, that the Lady <hi>Philoclea</hi> (to whose vnstayned vertue it hath bene my vnspeakeable miserye, that my name should become a blot) if she be accused, is most vniustly accused of any dishonorable fact, which by my meanes she may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> be thought to haue yelded vnto. Whatsoeuer hath bene done, hath bene my only attempt, which notwithstanding was neuer intended against her chastetye. But whatsoeuer hath bene enformed, was my fault. And I attest the heauens, to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheame which I am not now in fit tune, that so much as my comming into her chamber, was wholie vnwitting vnto her. This your wisdome may withall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> if I would lye, I would lye for mine owne behoofe, I am not so olde, as to be weary of my selfe; But the very sting of my inward knowledge ioyned with the consideracion I must needes haue, what an infinite losse it should be to all those whose loue goodnes in good folkes, if so pure a child of vertue should wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be destroyed, compells me to vse my toong against my selfe, and receiue the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> burden of what euill was, vppon my owne doing. Looke therefore with pittifull eyes vppon so fayre beames, and that misfortune which by me hath fallen vppon her, helpe to repaier it with your publicke iudgement, since whosoeuer deales cruelly with such a creature, shewes himselfe a hater of mankinde, and an enuier of the worlds blisse. And this peticion I make, euen in the name of iustice, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> you proceed further against vs, I may knowe how you conceiue of her noble, though vnfortunate action, and what iudgement you will make of it. He had not spoken his last word, when all the whole people both of great and low estate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with an vnited murmur <hi>Pyrocles</hi> demaund, longing (for the loue generally was borne <hi>Philoclea</hi>) to knowe what they might hope of her. <hi>Euarchus</hi> though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> regarding a prisoners passionate prayer, nor bearing ouerplausible eares to a many hedded motion, yet well enough content, to winne their liking with things in themselues indifferent, he was content: first, to seeke asmuch as might be of <hi>Philocleas</hi> behauior, in this matter: which being cleered by <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> &amp; but weakely gaynesayd by <hi>Philanax</hi> (who had framed both his owne &amp; <hi>Damaetas</hi> euidence most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> for her fauour and in truth could haue gone no further then coniecture,) yet fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by his wisedome, that she was not altogether faultlesse, he pronounced, she should all her life long, be kept prisoner among certaine women of religion like
<pb facs="tcp:12151:232"/>
the <hi>vestall</hi> nonnes, so to repaye their touched honour of her house, with well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a stryctt profession of chastitie. Although this were a greate preiudicating of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> case, yet was hee exceedingly ioyous of it, being assured of his Ladies life; and in the depth of his minde not sorry, that what ende soeuer he had, none should obtaine the after enioying that Iewell, whereon he had set his liues happines. After <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> it was by publicque sentence deliuered, what should be done with the sweete <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea,</hi> (the lawes of <hi>Arcadia</hi> bearing, that what was appointed by the magistrates in the noneage of the Prince, coulde not afterwards be repealed) <hi>Euarchus</hi> still vsing to himselfe no other name but protector of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> commaunded those that had to say against the Queene <hi>Gynecia</hi> to proceede, because both her estate required shee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> shoulde bee first heard, and also for that shee was taken to bee the principall, in the greatest matter they were to iudge of. <hi>Philanax</hi> incontinently stepped foorth, and shewing in his greedy eyes, that he did thirst for her bloud, beganne a well thought on discourse of her (in his iudgement) execrable wickednes. But <hi>Gynecia</hi> standing vp before the iudge, casting abroad her armes, with her eyes hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the bredth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> of her vnseemely hart, laying open in all her gestures the despairefull affliction, to which all the might of her reason was conuerted, with such like words stopped <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanax,</hi> as hee was entring into his inuectiue oration. Staye staie <hi>Philanax</hi> saide shee, do not defile thy honest mouth, with those dishonourable speeches thou arte about to vtter, against a woman, now most wretched, lately thy mistresse. Let either the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> remembraunce how great she was, moue thy harte to some reuerence; or the seing how lowe she is, sturre in thee some pittie. It may be truth doth make thee deale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely; and loue of iustice frames vniustice in thee, doe not therefore (neither shalt thou neede treade vpon my desolate ruines. Thou shalt haue that thou seekest; and yet shalt not be oppressoure of her, who cannot choose but loue thee, for thy singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> faith to thy master. I doe not speake this to procure mercie, or to prolong my life, no no I say vnto you I will not liue, but I am onely loth, my death shoulde bee engreeued with any wronge thou shouldest doe vnto me. I haue beene to painefull a iudge ouer my selfe, to desire pardon in others iudgement. I haue beene to cruell an executioner of mine owne soule, to desire that execution of iustice shoulde bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> stayed for me. Alas they that know, how sorrow can rent the spirits, they that know what fiery hells are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiened in a self condemning mind, need not feare that feare can keepe such a one, from desiring to be seperated from that, which nothing but death can seperate. I therefore say to thee (O iust iudge) that I and only I, was the worker of <hi>Basilius</hi> death. They were these handes that gaue vnto him that poysonous poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> that hath brought death to him, and losse to <hi>Arcadia,</hi> it was I and none but I, that hastened his aged yeares, to an vnnaturall end, and that haue made all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple orphans, of their royall father. I am the subiect that haue killed my Prince, I am the wife that haue murdred my husband, I am a degenerate woman, an vndoer of this countrie, a shame of my children. What wouldest thou haue saide more Oh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 
               <hi>Philanax</hi>? and all this I graunt, there resteth then nothing els to say, but that I desire you, you will appointe quicklie somme to ridd mee of my life, rather then these handes, which ells are destenied vnto it, and that indeede it maye bee doone with such speede as I may not long dye in this life, which I haue in so greate horrour: with that shee crossed her armes, and sate downe vppon the grounde, attending <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> the iudges aunswere. But a greate while it was, before anye boddye coulde bee heard speake, the whole people concurring in a lamentable crye, so much had <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necias</hi>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:12151:232"/>
wordes and behauiour sturred their hartes to a dolefull compassion, neither in troath coulde most of them in their iudgements tell, whether they shoulde bee more sorrie for her faulte or her miserie: for the losse of her estate, or losse of her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. But most were most moued, with that which was vnder there eyes: the sense <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> most subiecte to pittie. But at length the reuerent awe they stoode in of <hi>Euarchus,</hi> brought them to a silent wayting his determination, who hauing well considered the abhomination of the facte, attending more the manifest proofe of so horrible a trespasse; confessed by her selfe, and proued by others; then any thing relenting to those tragicall phrases of hers (apter to sturre a vulgare pittie, then his minde, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> hated euill, in what culloures so euer he founde it) hauing considered a while with the principall men of the country, and demaunded there allowance, he definitiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gaue this sentence. That where as both in priuate and publike respectes, this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had most haynously offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, (in priuate, because marriage being the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coniunction that falls to mankinde, out of which all families and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> all societies doe proceede, which not onely by communitie goods, but commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie children, is to knit the mindes in a most perfet vnion, which who so breakes dissolues al humanitie, no man liuing free from the danger of so neere a neighbour, she had not onely broken it, but broken it with death, and the most pretended death that might be: In publike respect, the Princes persons; being in all monarchall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernmentes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the very knot of the peoples welfare, and light of all their doinges to which they are not onely in conscience, but in necessitie bounde to be loyall, she had trayterously empoysoned him, neither regarding her contries profit, her owne dutie, nor the rigor of the lawes.) That therefore, as well for the due satisfaction to eternall iustice, and accomplishment of the <hi>Arcadian</hi> statutes, as for the euerlasting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> example to all wiues and subiectes, she should presently be conueyed to cloase pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and there be kept with such foode as might serue to sustaine her aliue, vntill the day of her husbands buryall, at which time, shee shoulde bee buried quicke, in the same tombe with hime. That so his murder might bee a murder to her selfe, and she forced to keepe company with the body from which she had made so detestable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> a seuerance; And lastly death might redresse their disioyned coniunction of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. His iudgement was receaued of the whole assemblie, as not with disliking, so with great astonishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the greatnes of the matter and person as it were ouerpressing the might of their conceites. But when they did set it to the beame, with the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strousnes of her ouglye misdeede, they coulde not but yeeld in their hartes, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> was no ouerbalancing. As for <hi>Gynecia,</hi> who had already setled her thoughts, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to look but long for this euent, hauing in this time of her vexation, found a sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the rest she hoped by death, (with a countenaunce witnessing she had before hand so passed thorowe all the degrees of sorrowe, that shee had no new looke to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure forth any more) rase vp and offred forth her faite handes to bee bounde or led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> as they would, being indeed troubled with no parte of this iudgement, but that her death was as she thought long delayed. They that were appointed for it conueyed her to the place she was in before, where the guarde was relieued, and the number encreased to keepe her more sure for the time of her execution: None of them all that led her, though most of them were such, whose harts had beene long hardned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> with the often exercising such offices, being able to barre teares from their eyes, and others manifest tokens of compassionate sorrow. So goodly a vertue is a resolute constancie, that euen in euill deseruers, it seemes that partie might haue beene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
<pb facs="tcp:12151:233"/>
well deseruing. Thus the excellent Lady <hi>Gynecia,</hi> hauing passed fiue and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares of her age, euen to admiration of her beautifull minde and body, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not in her owne knowledge, euer spotted her soule with any wilfull vice, but her imoderate loue of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> was brought, first by the violence of that ill answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red passion, and then by the dispayring conceite, she took of the iudgement of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in her husbandes death and her owne fortune, purposely to ouerthrowe her selfe, and confirme by a wronge confession, that abhominable shame, which with her wisdome, ioynde to the truth, perhappes shee might haue refelled. Then did <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> aske <hi>Philanax,</hi> whether it were he that would charge the two yonge prisoners, or that some other shoulde doe it, and hee sit according to his estate, as an assistant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in the iudgement. <hi>Philanax</hi> tolde him as before hee had done, that hee thought no man coulde laye manifest the naughtines of those two yong men, with so much ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truth or zeale as himselfe, and therefore he desired he might do this last seruice to his faithfully beloued master, as to prosecute the traiterous causers of his death and dishonour; which being done, for his parte hee ment to geue vp all dealing in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> publicke affaires, since that man was gone who had made him loue them. <hi>Philanax</hi> thus being redye to speake, the two Princes were commaunded to tell their names who aunswered according to their agreements, that they were <hi>Daiphantus</hi> of <hi>Lycia,</hi> and <hi>Palladius</hi> Prince of <hi>Iberia.</hi> Which when they had said, they demaunded to know by what aucthoritie, they coulde iudge of them, since they were not only forryners <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and so not borne vnder their lawes, but absolute Princes and therefore not to bee touched by lawes. But aunswere was presently made them, that <hi>Arcadia</hi> lawes, were to haue their force vpon any were founde in <hi>Arcadia</hi>: since strangers haue scope to know the customes of a country, before they put them selues in it: and when they once are entred, they must knowe, that what by many was made, must not for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> one bee broken. And so much lesse for a straunger, as hee is to looke for no priue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in that place, to which in time of neede, his seruice is not to be expected. As for their being Princes, whether they were so orno, the beleefe stood in their own wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>des, which they had so diuersly falsifyed, as they did not deserue beleefe. But what soeuer they were, <hi>Arcadia,</hi> was to acknowledge them but as priuate men,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> since they were neither by magistracy nor alliance to the princely bloud, to claime any thing in that region. Therefore if they had offended, (which now by the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife and there defence was to bee iudged) against the lawes of nations; by the lawes of nations they were to be chastised: if against the peculiare ordinaunces of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince those peculiare ordinaunces were to laye hold of them. The Princes stoode a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> while vpon that demaunding leasure to giue perfecte knowledge of their greatnes; but when they were aunswered, that in a case of a Princes death, the lawe of that contrie had euer beene, that imediate tryall shoulde bee had: they were forced to yeelde, resolued that in those names, they woulde as much as they could, couer the shame of their royall parentage, and keepe as long as might be (if euill were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> against them) the euill newes from their carefull kinsfolke, wherein the chiefe man they considered was <hi>Euarchus</hi>: whom the strange and secreate working of iustice, had brought to be the iudge ouer them, in such a shadowe, or rather pit of darkenes, the wormish mankinde liues, that neither they knowe how to foresee, nor what to feare: and are but like tenisballs, tossed by the racket of the hyer pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> Thus both sides reddie, it was determined, because their cases were separated. First <hi>Philanax</hi> shoulde be hard against <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> whome they termed <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> and

But <hi>Philanax</hi> that was euen shorte breathed at the first, with the extreame vehemencie he had to speake against them, stroking once or twise his forehead, and wiping his eyes, (which either wepte, or he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> woulde at that time haue them seeme to weepe,) looking first vpon <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> as if he had proclaymed all hatefullnes against him, humblie turning to <hi>Euarchus,</hi> (who with quiet grauitie, shewed great attention) he thus began his oration. That which all men, who take vpon them to accuse an other, are woont to desire (most worthy protector) to haue many proofes of my faultes in them they seeke to haue condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that is to me in this present action, my greatest comber, and anoyaunce. For the number is so great, and the quallitie so monstrous, of the enormities this wretched young man hath committed, that neither I in my selfe, can tell where to begin (my thoughts being confused with the horrible multitude of them) neither doe I thinke your vertuous eares will be able to endure the reporte: But will rather imagine, you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> heare some tragedie inuented of the extremitie of wickednes, then a iust resitall of a wickednes indeed committed, for such is the disposition of the most sincere iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that as they can belieue meane faultes, and such as mans nature may slide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, so when they passe to a certaine degree, nay when they passe all degrees of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable naughtines, then finde they in themselues a hardenes to geue credit, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> humane creatures, can so from all humanitie bee transformed. But in my selfe, the strength of my faith to my deade master wil helpe the weakenes of my memory; in you, your excellent loue of iustice will force you to vouchsafe attention: And as for the matter, it is so manifest, so pittifull euidences lie before your eyes of it, that I shall neede to bee but a breife recounter, and no rhetoricall enlarger of this most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> harmefull mischiefe. I will therefore, in as fewe wordes as so huge a trespasse can bee conteyned, deliuer vnto you the sum of this miserable fact: leauing out a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of particular tokens, of his naughtines, and only touching the essentiall pointes, of this dolefull case. This man, whome to beginne withall I know not how to name, since being come into this contrie, vnaccompanied like a loste pilgrime, from a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> grewe a woman, from a woman a rauisher of wemen, thence a prisoner, and now a Prince. But this <hi>Zelmane,</hi> this <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> this what you will, (for any shape or title he can take vpon him, that hath no restrainte of shame) hauing vnderstoode the solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie life my late master liued, and considering how open he had layde himselfe to any trayterous attempte, for the first maske of his falsehoode, disguised himselfe like a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> woman: which being the more simple and hurtelesse sexe, might easier hide his subtle harmefullnes. And presenting himselfe to my master, the most curteous Prince that liued, was receaued of him with so greate gratiousnes, as might haue bounde not only any gratefull minde, but might haue mollified any enemies ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coure. But this venemous serpent, admitted thus into his bosome, as contagion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> will easily finde a fit body for it, so had he quickly falne into so neere acquaintaunce with this naughtie woman, whom euen now you haue most iustly condemned, that this was her right hand, shee sawe with no eyes but his, nor seemed to haue any life but in him, so glad shee was to finde one more cunning then her selfe, in couering wickednes with a modest vaile.

vp, fayned certaine rites she had to performe, so furious an impietie had caried him, from all remembrance of goodnes, that hee did not onely not feare the Gods, as the beholders and punishers of so vngodly a villany, but did blasphemously vse their sacred holly name, as a minister vnto it. And forsooth a Caue hereby was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, for the temple of his deuotions, a Caue of such darkenes, as did prognosticate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> he ment to please the infernall powers, for there this accurssed catife, vpon the alter of falshood, sacrificed the life of the vertuous <hi>Basilius.</hi> By what meanes he trayned him thether, alas I knowe not, for if I might haue knowen it, either my life had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied my master, or this fellowes death had preserued him. But this may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fise, that in the mouth of this Caue, where this traytor had his lodginge and chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> when already master sheepeheard his companion, had conueyed away the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted enheritrix of this cuntrie, was <hi>Gynecia</hi> founde by the dead corps of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, newly empoysoned, apparelled in the garments of the young Lady, and red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy no question to haue fled to some place, according to their consorte, but that she was by certaine honest-shepeheards arrested: while in the meane time, because their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> should be lefte no reuenger of this bloudy mischief, This noble <hi>Amazon,</hi> was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently gotten into the chamber of the Lady <hi>Philoclea,</hi> wherby the mingling as much as in him lay) of her shame, with his misdeede, he might enforce her to be the acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to her fathers death, and vnder the countenaunce of her and her sister (against whom they knew wee woulde not rebell) seaze as it were with one gripe into their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> treacherous hands, the regiment of the mightie prouince. But the almightie eye preuented him of the end of his mischiefe, by vsing a villaine <hi>Damaetas</hi> hand, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close him in there, where with as much fortification as in a house could be made, he thought himselfe in most securitie. Thus see you most iust iudge, a shorte and simple story of the infamous misery, falne vpon this contrie. In deed infamous, since <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> by an effeminate man, we should suffer a greater ouerthrow, then our mightiest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies haue ben euer able to lay vpon vs. And that all this, which I haue said is most manifest, aswell of the murdering of <hi>Basilius,</hi> as the rauishing of <hi>Philoclea,</hi> (for those two partes I establish of my accusation) who is of so incredulous a minde, or rather who will so stoppe his eyes from seing a thing cleerer then the light, as not to holde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> for assured so palpable a matter.

For to those persons who haue vomited out of their soules all remnants of goodnes, there restes a certaine pride in euill, and hauing ells no shadowe of glorye lefte them, they glorye to bee constante in iniquitye, and that God knowes must bee helde out to the laste gaspe, without reuealing their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> accomplices. As thinking greate courage is declared, in being neither affeard of the heauens nor ashamed of the worlde. But let <hi>Gynecias</hi> action dye with her selfe, what

can all the earth answere for his comming hether? Why alone, if hee bee a Prince? How so richly Iewelled if he be not a prince? Why then a woman if nowe a man? Why now <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> if then <hi>Zelmane</hi>? Was all this play for nothing, or if it had an ende, what ende but the ende of my deere master? Shall we doubte so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> many secret conferences with <hi>Gynecia,</hi> such fained fauour to the ouer soone begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Basilius,</hi> a Caue made a lodging, and the same lodging made a temple of his religion, lastly such changes and trauerses, as a quiet Poet coulde scarse fill a poeme withal, were directed to any lesse scope, then to this monstrous murder? O snakie ambition, which can winde thy selfe in so many figures, to slyde thether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> thou desirest to come! O corrupted reason of mankinde, that can yeelde to deforme thy selfe with so filthie desires! And O hopelesse bee those mindes, whom so vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall desires doe not, with their owne ouglinesse sufficiently terrefie! But yet euen of fauour let vs graunt him thus much more, as to fancie that in these fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde thinges, fortune might be a greate Actor, perchaunce to an euill ende yet to a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> lesse euill end all these entangled deuises were entended. But I beseech your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe, my Lady <hi>Daiphantus</hi> tell me, what excuse can you finde for the chaunging your lodging, with the Queene that verie instant shee was to finish her execrable practise? How can you cloake the lending of your cloake vnto her, was all that by chance too? Had the starres sent such an influence vnto you, as you should bee iuste <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> weary of your lodging, and garments, when our Prince was destenied to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? What say you to this, O shamefull and shamelesse creature? Fit indeede to bee the dishonour of both sexes. But alas, I spend too many words in so manifest and so miserable a matter. They must be foure wilde horses (which according to our lawes are the executioners of men which murdre our Prince) which must decide this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> question with you. Yet see so farre had my zeale to my beloued Prince transported me, that I had almost forgotten my second parte, and his seconde abhomination, I meane his violence offred to the Lady <hi>Philoclea:</hi> wherewith as if it had wel become his womanhoode, he came brauing to the iudgement seate, indeede our lawes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointe not so cruell a death (although death too) for this sacte as for the other. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> whosoeuer well wayes it, shall finde it spronge out of the same fountaine of mische<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous naughtines, the killing of the father, dishonouring the mother, and rauishing the child. Alas could not so many benifites receaued of my Prince, the iustice of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the right of hospitalitie, be a bridle to thy lust, if not to thy crueltie? Or if thou hadest (as surely thou haste) a harte recompensing goodnes with hatred, could not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> his death, which is the last of reuenges, satisfie thy mallice, but thou must heape vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it the shame of his daughter? Were thy eyes so stonie, thy brest so tygreshe, as the sweete and beautifull shewes of <hi>Philocleas</hi> vertue, did not astonish thee? O wofull <hi>Arcadia,</hi> to whom the name of this mankinde curtisan, shall euer be remembred as a procurer of thy greatest losse! But too farre I finde my passion, yet honest passion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> hath guided mee; the case is euerie way too too much vnanswearable. It resteth in you O excellent protector to pronounce iudgement, which if their bee hope, that such a yonge man may proue proffitable to the world, who in the first exercise of his owne determination, farre passed the arrantest strumpet in luxuriousnesse, the conningest forger in falsehoode, a player in disguising, a Tygre in crueltie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> a Dragon in ingratefulnes; let him be preserued like a iewell, to doe greater mischeefe. Yf his youth bee not more defiled with trecherie, then the eldest
<pb facs="tcp:12151:236"/>
mans age, let I say his youth, be some cause of compassion. If hee haue not euery way sought the ouerthrowe of humaine societie, if hee haue done any thing like a Prince, let his naming himselfe a Prince, breede a reuerence of his base wickednesse. If hee haue not broken all lawes of hospitalitie, and broken them in the most detestable degree that can be, let his being a guest, be a sacred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> protection of his more then sauage doings: or if his whorish beawtye, haue not bene as the hye waye of his wickednesse, let the picture drawne vppon so poysonous a wood, be reserued to shewe howe greatly coulours can please vs. But if it is as it is, what should I saye more, a very spirit of hellish naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, if his acte be to be punished, and his defiled person not to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> then restore vnto vs our Prince, by duly punishing his murderers, for then wee shall thinke him and his name to liue, when wee shall see his kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to dye. Restore to the excellent <hi>Philoclea</hi> her honour, by taking out of the world her dishonour, and thinke that at this daye, in this matter are the eyes of the worlde vppon you, whether any thing can sway your minde from a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> true administracion of iustice. Alas though I haue much more to saye, I can saye no more, for my teares and sighes interrupt my speeche, and force me to geue my selfe ouer to my priuate sorrowe. Thus when <hi>Philanax</hi> had vttered the vttermost of his mallice, he made sorrowe the cause of his conclusion. But while <hi>Philanax</hi> was in the course of his speeche, and did with such bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> defame the princely <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> it was well to be seene, his heart was vnused to beare such iniuries, and his thoughtes such, as could arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues better against any thing then shame. For sometimes blushing, his bloud with diuers motions comming and going, sometimes cloasing his eyes, and laying his hande ouer them, sometime geuing such a looke to <hi>Philanax,</hi> as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> might shewe hee assured himselfe, hee durst not so haue spoken if they had bene in indifferent place: with some impaciencie he bare the length of his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: which being ended, with as much modest humblenes to the Iudge, as despitefull skorne to the accuser, with words to this purpose, he defended his honour.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
            </p>
            <p>My accusors tale, may well beare witnes with me, most rightfull Iudge, in how hard a case, and inuironed with how many troubles, I may esteeme my selfe. For if hee, who shewes his toong, is not vnaquainted with rayling, was in an agonye in the beginning of his speech, with the multitude of matters he had to lay vnto me, wherein notwithstanding the most euill could fall vnto him,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> was, that hee should not do so much euill as hee would; howe combred do you thinke may I acknowledge my selfe, who in things no lesse importing then my life, must be mine owne aduocate, without leasure to aunswere, or foreknowledge what shoulde be obiected? in things I say promoted with so cunning a confusion, as hauing mingled truthes with falsehoodes, surmises with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> certaintyes, causes of no moment with matters cappitall, scolding with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning, I can absolute neyther graunt nor denye, neyther can I tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I come hether to be iudged, or before iudgement to be punished, being compelled to beare such vnworthye woordes, farre more grieuous then any death vnto me. But since the forme of this gouernment, allowes such toong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> libertye vnto him, I will picke aswell as I can out of his inuectiue those fewe poyntes, whiche may seeme of some purpose in the touching of mee,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:12151:236"/>
hoping that by your easye hearing of me, you will shewe, that though you hate euill, yet you wishe men may proue themselues not euill; so in that hee hath sayde, you will not waye so much what hee hath sayde, as what hee hath proued, remembring, that truth is simple and naked, and that if hee had gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> himselfe vnder that banner, hee needed not out of the way haue sought so vilde and false disgracings of mee, enough to make the vntruest accusation beleeued. I will therefore, vsing truth as my best eloquence, repeate vnto you as much as I knowe in this matter, and then by the only cleerenes of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, your wisedome I knowe will finde, the difference betwixt cauilling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> supposition, and directe declaration. This Prince <hi>Palladius</hi> and I, being enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with loue, (a passion farre more easely reprehended, then refrayned) to the two peerelesse daughters of <hi>Basilius,</hi> and vnderstanding, howe hee had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded himselfe from the worlde, that like Princes, there was no accesse vnto him, wee disguised our selues, in such formes, as might soonest bring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> vs to the reuealing of our affections. The Prince <hi>Palladius,</hi> had such euent of his doings, that with <hi>Pamelas</hi> consent hee was to conuey her out of the thraldome she liued in, to receaue the subiection of a greater people then her owne, vntill her fathers consent might be obteyned. My fortune was more hard, for I bare no more loue to the chaste <hi>Philoclea,</hi> then <hi>Basilius</hi> deceaued in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> my sexe, shewed to me, insomuch that by his importunacy, I could haue no time to obtayne the like fauour of the pure <hi>Philoclea:</hi> till this pollicye I founde, taking, vnder cullour of some deuotions, my lodging, to drawe <hi>Basilius</hi> the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with hope to enioye me, which likewise I reuealed to the Queene, that she might keepe my place, and so make her husband see his error. While I in the meane time, being deliuered of them both, and hauing lockt so the dores, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> as I hoped if the immaculate <hi>Philoclea</hi> would condescend to goe with me, there should be none to hinder our going. I was made prisoner there, I knowe not by what meanes when being repelled by her deuine vertue, I would faynest haue escaped. Heere haue you the thread to guide you in the Labyrinth, this man of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> his toong, had made so monstrous. Heere see you the true discourse, which hee mountbanke fashion, doth make so wide a mouth ouer. Heere may you conceaue the reason, why the Queene had my garment, because in her going to the caue, in the Moone-shine night, she might be taken for me, which he vseth as the knot of all his wise assertions: so that as this double minded fellowes accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> was double, double likewise my aunswere must perforce be, to the murder of <hi>Basilius,</hi> and violence offred to the inuiolate <hi>Philoclea.</hi> For the fyrst, O heauenly gods, who would haue thought any mouth could haue bene founde so mercenary, as to haue opened so slight proofes of so horrible matters? his fyrst Argument is a question who would imagine that <hi>Ginecia</hi> would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> such an Acte, without some accessaries? and if any, who but I? truly I, and so farre from imagining any thing, that till I sawe these mourning tokens, and heard <hi>Ginecias</hi> confession, I neuer imagined the King was dead. And for my part so vehemently, and more like the manner of passionate, then giltie folkes, I see, the Queene persecute her selfe, that I thinke condemnation may goe too <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> hastely ouer her, considering the vnlikelyhood, if not impossibilitie, her wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and vertue so long nourished, should in one moment throw downe it selfe, to the vttermost ende of wickednes. But whatsoeuer she hath done (which as I say,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:237"/>
I neuer beleeued) yet how vniustly should that aggrauate my fault. She founde abroade I within dores (for as for the wearing my garment I haue tolde you the cause) she seeking as you saye to escape, I locking my selfe in a house: without perchaunce the conspiracie of one poore straunger, might greatly enable her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or the fortification of the Lodge (as the trimme man alleadged) might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> make me hope to resist all <hi>Arcadia.</hi> And see how treacherously he seekes to drawe from me, my chiefest cleering, by preuenting the credit of her words, wherewith she had wholie taken the fault vpon her selfe. A honest and vnpartiall examiner, her words may condemne her, but may not absolue me. Thus voide of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable allegacion, the crauen crowes vppon my affliction, not leauing out any euill,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that euer he hath felt in his owne soule, to charge my youth withall. But who can looke for a sweeter breath out of such a stomacke? or for honny from so filthye a Spyder? What should I say more? if, in so inhumane a matter, which he himselfe confesseth, sincerest iudgements are lothest to beleeue, and in the seuerest lawes proofes clerer then the Sunne are required, his reasons are only the skumme of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> a base malice, my answeres most manifest, shining in their owne truth, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne any doubt of it, because it stands betwixt his affirming and my denyall, I offer, nay I desire, and humblie desire I may be graunted the tryall by combat, wherein let him be armed and me in my shirt, I doubt not Iustice will be my shield, and his hart will shew it selfe as faint as it is false.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>Now come I to the second part of my offence, towards the young Lady, which howsoeuer you tearme it, so farre forth as I haue tolde you, I confesse, and for her sake hartely lament. But if herein I offred force to her, loue offred more force to me. Let her beawtie be compared to my yeares, and such effectes will be found no miracles. But since it is thus as it is, and that iustice teacheth vs not to loue pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> but to flye to it for necessitye: the salue of her honour (I meane as the world will take it, for else in truth it is most vntouched) must be my marriage, and not my death, since the one shops all mouthes, the other becommes a doubtfull fable. This matter requires no more words, and your experience I hope in these cases shall neede no more, for my selfe me thinkes I haue shewed already, too much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> loue of my life to bestowe so many. But certainely, it hath bene loue of truth, which could not beare so vnworthy falsehood, and loue of iustice, that would brooke no wrong to my selfe nor other, and makes me now, euen in that respect to desire you, to be moued rather with pittie at a iust cause of teares, then with the bloudy teares this Crocodile spends, who weepes to procure death, and not to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> lament death. It will be no honour to <hi>Basilius</hi> tombe, to haue guiltlesse bloud sprinckled vpon it, and much more may a Iudge ouerway himselfe in crueltie, then in clemencie. It is hard, but it is excellent, where it is found, a right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when correction is necessary, when grace doth more auaile.

to write? What to write is as hard for me to saye, as what I may not write, so little hope haue I of any successe, and so much hath no iniury bene left vndone to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. To whom to write, where may I learne, since yet I wot not how to entitle you? Shall I call you my Souereignes? set downe your lawes that I may do you homage.

But whatsoeuer I be, or whatsoeuer you be, ô all you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of these dolefull lines, this do I signifye vnto you, and signifye it with a hart, that shall euer remayne in that opinion.

Am I so childish, as not to see, wherein you touch him you condemne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> me? Can his shame be without my reproach? no nor shall be, since nothing he hath done, that I will not auowe. Is this the comfort you bring me in my fathers death, to make me fuller of shame then sorrowe? would you do this, if it were not with full intention to preuent my power, with slaughter? And so do I pray you, it is hye time for me, to be weary of my life too long ledd, since you are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> weery of me, before you haue me? I say againe, I say it infinitely vnto you, I will not liue without him, if it be not to reuenge him: eyther do iustly in sauing both, or wisely in killing both. If I be your Princesse, I commaund his preseruation; if but a priuate person, then are we both to suffer. I take all truth to witnes he hath done no faulte but in going with me. Therefore to conclude, in iudging him you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> iudge me, neither conceaue with your selues, the matter you treate, is the life of a stranger, though euen in that name he deserued pittie, nor of a shepheard, to which estate loue of me made such a Prince descend, but determined most assuredly, the life that is in question is of <hi>Pamela, Basilius</hi> daughter.</q>

            <p>Many blots, had the teares of the sweet Ladyes made in their letters, which many times they had altred, many times torne, and written anewe, euer thinking some thing eyther wanted, or were too much, or would offende, or which was worst, would breede denyall: but at last, the day warned them to dispatch, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did, and calling one of their guard (for no body else was suffred to come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> neere them) with great entreaty, they requested him, that hee woulde present them, to the principall Noblemen and Gentlemen together. For they had more confidence in the numbers fauour, then in any one, vppon whome they would not laye the liues they helde so precious. But the fellowe trustie to <hi>Philanax,</hi> who had placed him there, deliuered them both to him, (what time <hi>Pyrocles</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> began to speake) which he sodaynly opened, and seeing to what they tended, by the first wordes, was so farre from publishing them (whereby he feared in <hi>Euarchus</hi> iust minde, eyther the Princesses might be endaungered, or the prisoners preserued, of which choyse he knewe not which to thinke the worst) that hee would not himselfe reede them ouer, doubting his owne hart might be mollified,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> so bent vpon reuenge. Therefore vtterly suppressing them, he lent a spitefull eare to <hi>Pirocles,</hi> and assoone as he had ended, with a very willing hart desired <hi>Euarchus</hi>

he might accept the combat: although it woulde haue framed but euill with him, <hi>Pyrocles</hi> hauing neuer founde any match neere him, besides <hi>Musidorus.</hi> But <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> made aunswere, since bodyly strength is but a seruant to the minde, it were very barbarous and preposterous, that force shoulde bee made iudge ouer reason. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Then woulde hee also haue replied in wordes vnto him, but <hi>Euarchus</hi> who knewe what they coulde saye, was already saide, taking their arguments into his minde, cammaunded him to proceede against the other prisoner, and that then he woulde sentence them both together. <hi>Philanax</hi> nothing the milder for <hi>Pyrocles</hi> purging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but rather (according to the nature of arguing, especially when it is bitter) so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> much the more vehement entred thus into his speech against <hi>Musidorus,</hi> being so ouergone with rage that hee forgate in this oration his precise methode of ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Behold most noble protector, to what a state <hi>Arcadia</hi> is come, since such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, may challenge in combat the faithfullest of the nobilitie, and hauing merited the shamefullest of all deathes, dare name in marriage the Princesses of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> this cuntrie. Certainely my masters, I must saye, you were much out of taste, if you had not rather enioy such Ladies, then be hangd. But the one you haue as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, as you haue dishonoured the other. But now my speech must be directed to you good master <hi>Dorus,</hi> who with <hi>Pallas</hi> helpe pardie, are lately growne <hi>Palladius.</hi> Too much this sacred seate of iustice, grauntes vnto such a fugitiue bondslaue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> who in steede of these examinations, shoulde be made confesse, with a whippe, that which a halter shoulde punish. Are not you he Sir, whose sheepehooke was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be our Scepter? In whom lay the knot of all this tradgedy? or els perchaunce, they that shoulde gaine little by it were dealers in the murder, you onely that had prouided the fruites for your selfe, knewe nothing of it, knewe nothinge: hath thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here infected thee with such impudency as euen in the face of the world to deny that which al the world perceaueth? The other pleades ignorance, and you I doubt not will alleage absence. But he was ignoraunt, when he was hard by, and you had framed your absence, iust againe the time the acte shoulde bee committed, so fit a liuetenante he knew he had lefte of his wickednes, that for himselfe his safest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> meane, was to conuey away the Lady of vs all, who once out of the contrie, he knew wee woulde come with oliue branches of intercession vnto her, and fall at his feete to beseech him to leaue keeping of sheepe, and vouchesafe the tirannising ouer vs, for to think they are Princes, as they say (although in our lawes it behooues them nothing) I see at all no reason. These iewells certainly with their disguisinge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> sleightes, they haue pilfred in their vagabonding race. And think you such Princes should be so long without some followers after them? Truely if they be Princes, it manifestly shewes their vertues such, as all their subiectes are glad to be rid of them. But be they as they are, for we are to consider the matter, and not the men. <hi>Basilius</hi> murder hath beene the cause of their comming, <hi>Basilius</hi> murder, they haue most tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> brought to passe; yet that I doubte not, you will denie as well as your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe. But howe will you denie the stealinge awaie the Princesse of this Prouince, which is no lesse then treason? So notably hath the iustice of the gods prouided, for the punishing of these malefactors, as if it were possible, men would not beleue the certaine euidences of their principall mischiefe, yet haue they discouered them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> sufficiently for their most iust ouerthrowe. I saye therefore (to omit my cheefe matter of the Kings death) This wooluish sheepheard, this counterfeite Prince,
<pb facs="tcp:12151:239"/>
hath trayterously contrary to his alleageaunce (hauing made himselfe a seruant and subiecte) attempted the depriuing this contry of our naturall Princesse: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by all right must receaue the punishment of traytors. This matter is so assured as he himselfe will not deny it, being taken and brought backe in the fact. This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is so odious in nature, so shamefull to the worlde, so contrarye to all lawes, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> hurtefull to vs, so false in him, as if I should stande further in declaring or defacing it, I shoulde either shewe great doubts in your wisedome, or in your iustice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will transferre my care vpon you, and attend to my learning and comfort, the eternall example you will leaue to al mankinde of disguisers, falsefiers, adulterers, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uishers, murderers, and traytors. <hi>Musidorus</hi> while <hi>Philanax</hi> was speaking against his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> cosin and him, had looked rounde about him, to see whether by any meanes hee might come to haue caught him in his armes, and haue killed him; so much had his disgracing wordes filled his breste with rage. But perceauing himselfe so guarded as hee shoulde rather showe a passionate acte, then performe his reuenge, his hande trembling with desire to strike, and all the vaines in his face swelling; casting his eyes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> ouer the iudgement seate. O Gods saide hee, and haue you spared my life to beare these iniuries of such a driule? Is this the iustice of this place, to haue such men as we are, submitted not onely to apparent falsehood, but most shameful reuiling? But marke I pray you the vngratefulnes of the wretch, how vtterly hee hath forgotten, the benefits both he and all this contry hath receaued of vs. For if euer men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> their owne noble deedes, it is then when their iuste defence, and other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust vnkindenes doth require it. I omit our seruices done to <hi>Basilius</hi> in the late warre with <hi>Amphialus</hi> importing no lesse then his daughters liues, and his states preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: were not we the men that killed the wilde beastes which otherwise had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Princesses, if wee had not succourd them? Consider if it please you, where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> had bene <hi>Daiphantus</hi> rape, or my treason, if the sweete beauties of the earth, had then bene deuoured? Either thinke them nowe dead, or remember they liue by vs. And yet full often this telltale can acknowledge the losse they shoulde haue by their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away, while maliciously he ouer passeth who were their preseruers, neither let this be spoken of mee, as if I ment to ballance this euill with that good, for I must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> confesse, that sauing of such creatures was rewarded in the acte it selfe: but onely to manifest the partial iangling of this vile pickthanke. But if we be the traytors, where was your fidelitie, O onely tonge-valliant Gentleman, when not onely the yonge Princesse, but the King himselfe was defended from vttermost perill, partely by me but principally by this excellent yonge mans both wisdome and valure? Were wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> that made our selues against hundreds of armed men, openly the shieldes of his life, like secretly to bee his impoysoners? Did wee then shewe his life to bee dearer to vs then our owne, because wee might after robbe him of his life, to dye shamefully? Truely truely master orator, whosoeuer hath hired you to be so busie in their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who keepe honester seruauntes then your selfe, hee shoulde haue bid you in so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> manie raylings, bring some excuse for your selfe, why in the greatest neede of your Prince, to whome you pretend a miraculous good will, you were not then as forewarde to do like a man your selfe, or at leaste to accuse them that were slacke in that seruice, but commonlye the vse their feete for there defence whose tounge is their weapon. Certaynelye a verye simple subtiltie it had beene in vs, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:12151:239"/>
repose our liues in the daughters, when we had killed the father. But as this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thinkes to winne the reputation of a copious talker by leauing nothing vnsaide which a filthy minde can imagine, so thinke I (or els all wordes are vaine) that to wise mens iudgement, our cleerenes in the Kings death is sufficiently notorious. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> at length when the marchaunt hath set out his guilded baggage, lastly he comes to some stuffe of importance, and saith I conueied away the Princesse of this contrie. And is she indeede your Princesse? I pray you then whom should I waite of els, but her that was my mistres by my professed vow, &amp; Princesse ouer me while I liued in this soile? Aske her why she went; aske not me why I serued her. Since accounting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> me as a Prince, you haue not to do with me, taking me as her seruant, then take with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that I must obay her. But you will say I perswaded her to flie awaye, certainely I will for no death deny it, knowing to what honour I shoulde bring her from the thraldome by such fellowes councell as you, shee was kept in. Shall perswasion to a Prince growe treason to a Prince? It might be error in me but falsehoode it coulde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> not be, since I made my selfe partaker of whatsoeuer I wished her vnto, who will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer counsaill his King, if his counsaill be iudged by the euent, and if it be not found wise, shall therefore be thought wicked? But if I be a traytor, I hope you will graunt me a correlatiue, to whom I shall be the traytor. For the Princesse against whom the treasons are considered, I am sure will avowe my faithfulnes, without you will saye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> that I am a traytor to her, because I left the contrie: and a traytor to the contrie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I went with her. Heere do I leaue out my iust excuses of loues force, which as thy narrow hart hath neuer had noble roome inough in it to receaue, so yet to those manlike courages, that by experience know how subiect the vertuous mindes are to loue a most vertuous creature, (witnessed to be such by the most excellent guiftes of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> nature) will deeme it a veniall trespasse, to seeke the satisfaction of honourable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. Honourable euen in the curiousest pointes of honour, whereout there can no disgrace nor disperagement come vnto her. Therfore O iudge, who I hope doest know what it is to be a iudge, that your ende is to preserue, and not to destroy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, that lawes are not made like limetwigges, or nets, to catch euery thing that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> toucheth them, but rather like sea markes to auoide the shipwracke of ignoraunt pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singers, since that our doinge in the extremest interpretation is but a humaine error, and that of it you may make a proffitable euent (we being of such estate, as their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents would not haue misliked the affinitie) you will not I trust at the perswasion of this brabler, burne your house to make it cleane, but like a wise father, turne euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> the fault of your children to any good that may come of it: since that is the fruite of wisdome, and ende of all iudgements. While this matter was thus handling, a silent and as it were astonished attention, possest all the people. A kindely compssion mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the noble Gentleman <hi>Simpathus,</hi> but as for <hi>Kalander,</hi> euery thing was spoken ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by or for his own deere guestes, moued an affect in him: somtimes teares, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> hopefull lookes, sometimes whispering perswasions in their eares, that stoode by him, to seeke the sauing the two yong Princes. But the generall multitude way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Euarchus,</hi> who shewed in his face no motions, either at the ones or other speeche, letting passe the flowers of rhetoricke, and onely marking whether their reasons tended, hauing made the question to be asked of <hi>Gynecia,</hi> who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> continued to take the whole faulte vpon her selfe, and hauing caused <hi>Damaetas,</hi> with <hi>Miso</hi> and <hi>Mopsa</hi> (who by <hi>Philanax</hi> order had bene helde in most cruell prison) to make a full declaration, howe much they knewe of these passed matters, and then
<pb facs="tcp:12151:240"/>
gathering as assured satisfaction to his owne minde as in that case he could; not nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to take leasure for that, whereof a long practise had bred a well grounded ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit in him, with a voice of gesture directed to the vniuersall assemblie, in this forme pronounced sentence. This weightie matter, wherof presently we are to determine, doth at the first consideration yeeld two important doubtes. The first whether these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> men be to be iudged. The second how they are to be iudged. The first doubt ariseth because they geue themselues out for Princes absolute, a sacred name, and to which any violence semes to be an impietie. For how can any lawes, which are the bonds of all humane societie be obserued if the lawe giuers, and lawe rulers, bee not helde in an vntouched admiration? But heereto although alredy they haue beene suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> aunswered, yet thus much againe I will repeate vnto you. That what soeuer they be or be not, heere they be no Princes, since betwixt Prince and subiect there is as necessarie a relation, as betweene father and sonne, and as there is no man a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to his childe, so is not a Prince, a Prince but to his owne subiects. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not this place to acknowledge in them any principallitie, without it should at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> the same time, by a secreate consent confesse subiection. Yet hereto may be obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the vniuersall ciuillitie, the lawe of nations (all mankinde being as it were coinhabitors or worlde-citizens together) hath euer required publicke persons, shoulde be of all parties especially regarded since not onely in peace, but in warre, not only Princes, but herauldes and trumpets, are with great reason exempted from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> iniuryes. This pointe is true, but yet so true, as they that will receaue the benefit of a custome, must not be the first to breake it. For then can they not complaine, if they be not helpt by that which they themselues hurte. Yf a Prince do actes of hostilitie, without denouncing warre, if he breake his oath of amitie, or innumerable such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges contrary to the lawe of armes, he must take heede how he fall into their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> hands whom he so wrongeth, for then is courtesie the best custome he can claime, much more these men, who haue not onely lefte to doe like Princes, but to be like Princes, not onely entred into <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and so into the <hi>Arcadian</hi> orders, but into domesticall seruices, and so by making them selues priuate, depriued themselues of respecte due to their publicke calling. For no proportion it were of iustice, that a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> man might make himselfe no Prince when he woulde doe euill, and might a newe create himselfe a Prince, when he would not suffer euill. Thus therefore by al lawes of nature and nations, and especially by their owne putting themselues out of the sanctuary of them, these yong men can not in iustice auoide the iudgement: but like priuate men, must haue their doinges either cleared, excused, or condemned. There <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> resteth then the second point, howe to iudge well. And that must vndoubtedly bee done, not by a free discourse of reason, and skill of philosophy: but must be tied to the lawes of <hi>Greece,</hi> and municipall statutes of this kingedome. For although out of them, these came, and to them muste indeede referre their offspringe, yet because philosophicall discourses, stande in the generall consideration of thinges, they leaue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to euery man a scope of his owne interpretation. Where the lawes applyinge them selues to the necessary vse, folde vs within assured boundes, which once broken ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s nature infinitly ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth. Iudged therfore they must be, &amp; by your lawes iudged. Nowe the action offereth it selfe to dewe ballance, betwixte the accusers two-folde accusation, and their aunsweare accordingly applied. The questions beeinge the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> one of a facte simplie, the other of the quallity of a fact. To the first vse direct deniall, to the second quallification and excuse. They deny the murder of the king;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:12151:240"/>
&amp; mightie against presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s bring forth some probable answers, which they do principally fortefie with the Queenes acknowledging her selfe only culpable. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely as in equallitie of coniectures, we are not to take holde of the worse, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be glad we may finde any hope that mankind is not growen monstrous, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> vndoubtedly lesse euill a guiltie man shoulde escape, then a guiltlesse perish) so if in the rest they be spotlesse, then is no farther to be remembred. But if they haue aggrauated these suspitions, with newe euills then are those suspitions so farre to showe themselues, as to cause the other pointes to be thorowly examined, and with lesse fauour wayed since this no man can deny they haue beene accidentall, if not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> principall causes of the Kinges death. Now then we are to determine of the other matters, which are laide to them, wherein they doe not deny the facte, but deny or at leaste diminish the faulte, but first I may remember (though it were not first al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged by them) the seruices they had before done, truely honourable and worthy of greate rewarde, but not worthy to counteruaile with a following wickednes. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> is proper to well doing, punishment to euill doing, which must bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, no more then good and euill are to be mingled. Therefore hath bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in all wisedomes, that no man because he hath done well before, should haue his present euils spared, but rather so much the more punished, as hauing shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he knew how to be good, woulde against his knowledge bee naught. The facte <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> then is nakedly without passion, or partialitie to bee viewed: wherein without all question they are equallie culpable. For though he that termes himselfe <hi>Daiphantus</hi> were sooner disapointed of his purpose of conueying away the Lady <hi>Philoclea,</hi> then he that perswaded the Princesse <hi>Pamela</hi> to flie her countrie, and accompanied her in it: yet seing in causes of this nature, the wil by the rules of iustice standeth for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> deed, they are both alike to bee founde guiltie, and guiltie of hainous rauishment. For though they rauished them not from themselues, yet they rauished them from him that owed them, which was their father. An acte punished by all the <hi>Graecian</hi> lawes, by the losse of the head, as a most execrable thefte. For if they must dye, who steale from vs our goodes, how much more they, who steale from vs that, for which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> we gather our goodes, and if our lawes haue it so in the priuate persons, much more forcible are they to bee in Princes children, where one steales as it were the whole state, and well being of that people, being tyed by the secret of a long vse, to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by none but the next of that bloud. Neither let any man maruaile, our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours haue bene so seuere in these cases, since the example of the <hi>Phenician Europa</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> but especially of the Grecian <hi>Helene,</hi> hath taught them, what destroying fires haue growen of such sparckles. And although <hi>Helene</hi> was a wife, and this but a child, that booteth not since the principall cause of marrying wiues is, that we may haue chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of our owne. But now let vs see how these yong men (truely for their persons worthy of pittie, if they haue rightly pittied themselues) do goe about to mittigate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the vehemencie of their errors. Some of their excuses are common to both, some peculiar onely to him that was the sheepeheard. Both remember the force of loue, and as it were the mending vp of the matter by their marriage, if that vnbrideled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire which is intituled loue, might purge such a sickenes as this, surely wee shoulde haue, many louing excuses of hatefull mischiefe. Nay rather no mischiefe shoulde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> be committed, that should not be vailed vnder the name of loue. For as well he that steales, might alleage the loue of mony, he that murders the loue of reuenge, he that rebells the loue of greatnesse, as the adulterer the loue of a woman. Since they do in
<pb facs="tcp:12151:241"/>
all speeches affirme they loue that, which an ill gouerned passion maketh them to follow. But loue may haue no such priuiledge. That sweete and heauenly vniting of the mindes, which properly is called loue, hath no other knot but vertue, and therefore if it be a right loue, it can neuer slide into any action that is not vertuous. The other and indeed more effectuall reason is that they may be married vnto them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and so honourably redresse the dishonour of them, whom this matter seemeth most to touch. Surely if the question were, what were conuenient for the parties, and not what is iuste in the neuer changing iustice, there might much bee saide in it. But herein we must consider, that the lawes look how to preuent by due examples, that such thinges be not done: and not how to salue such things, when they are doone.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> For if the gouernors of iustice, shall take such a scope, as to measure the foote of the lawe, by a show of conueniencie, and measure that conueniencie not by the publike societie, but by that which is fittest for them which offende: young men, stronge men, and rich men, shall euer finde priuate conueniences, howe to palliate such committed disorders, as to the publike shall not onely bee inconuenient but pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> The marriage perchaunce might be fit for them, but verie vnfit were it to the state, to allowe a patterne of such procurations of marriage. And thus much doe they both alleage. Further goes he that went with the Princesse <hi>Pamela,</hi> &amp; requireth the benefit of a councellor, who hath place of free perswasion; and the reasonable excuse of a seruant, that did but waite of his mistres. Without all question, as coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> haue great cause to take heede how they aduise any thing, directly opposite to the forme of that present gouernement, especially when they doe it singly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out publike alowaunce, so yet is the case much more apparant: since neither she was an effectuall Princesse, her father being then aliue, &amp; though he had bene deade, she not come to the yeares of aucthoritie, nor hee her seruant, in such manner to obey <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> her, but by his owne preferment first belonging to <hi>Dametas,</hi> and then to the Kinge, and therefore if not by <hi>Arcadia</hi> lawes, yet by housholde orders, bounde to haue done nothing without his agreement. Thus therefore since the deedes accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by these two, are both abhominable and inexcuseable. I doe in the behalfe of iustice, &amp; by the force of <hi>Arcadia</hi> lawes pronounce, that <hi>Daiphantus</hi> shalbe throwne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> out of a hie tower to receaue his death by his fall. <hi>Palladius</hi> shall bee behedded the time before the sunne set: the place in <hi>Mantinea</hi>: the executioner <hi>Dametas:</hi> which office he shall execute all the dayes of his life, for his beastly forgetting the carefull dutie he owed to his charge. This saide he turned himselfe to <hi>Philanax,</hi> and two of the other noble men, commaunding them to see the iudgement presently perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/>

Yet if at all there were any shewe of change in them, it was that <hi>Pyrocles</hi> was somthing neerer to bashfulnes, and <hi>Musidorus</hi> to anger; both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ouer ruled by reason and resolution. But as with great number of armed men, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanax</hi> was descending vnto them, and that <hi>Musidorus</hi> was beginning to saye some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in <hi>Pyrocles</hi> behalfe.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:12151:241"/>
the Princes, vntill it were heard what new matters these men did bring. So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine mounting to the Tribunall, they hearkened to the straungers vehement speach, or rather appassionate exclayming. It was in deede <hi>Kalodulus,</hi> the faithfull seruaunt of <hi>Musidorus,</hi> to whome his maister, when in despite of his best groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> determinations he first became a slaue to affection, had sent the sheaphearde <hi>Menalcas</hi> to be arrested: by the helpe of whose rayment in the meane time he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced himselfe to that estate, which he accompted most high, because it might be seruiceable to that fancy, which he had placed most high in his minde. For <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalcas</hi> hauing faithfully performed his errand, was as faithfully imprisoned by <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodulus.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> But as <hi>Kalodulus</hi> perfourmed the first part of his duety in doing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of his Prince: so was he with abundance of sincere loyalty extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplexed, when he vnderstood of <hi>Menalcas</hi> the straunge disguising of his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Maister. For as the actes he and his Cosen <hi>Pyrocles</hi> had done in <hi>Asia,</hi> had fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the eares of the <hi>Thessalians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians</hi> with no lesse ioy then admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> so was the feare of their losse no lesse grieuous vnto them, when by the noise of report they vnderstood of theyr lonely committing themselues to the Sea, the issue of which they had no way learned. But now that by <hi>Menalcas</hi> hee perceyued where he was, gessing the like of <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> comparing the vnusednes of this act with the vnripenesse of theyr age, seeing in generall coniecture they could doe it for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> that might not fall out dangerous: he was somewhile troubled with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, what to doe, betwixt doubt of theyr hurt, and doubt of theyr displeasure. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten he was minded (as his safest and honestest way) to reueale it to the king <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>: that both his authority might preuent any domage to them, and vnder his winges he himselfe might remaine safe. But considering a iourney to <hi>Byzantium</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/>(where as yet he supposed <hi>Euarchus</hi> lay) would require more time, then hee was willing to remaine doubtfull of his Princes estate, he resolued at length to write the matter to <hi>Euarchus,</hi> and himselfe the while to goe into <hi>Arcadia:</hi> vncertayne what to doe when he came thither, but determined to doe his best seruice to hys deare Maister, if by any good fortune he might finde him. And so it happened that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> being euen this day come to <hi>Mantinea,</hi> and as warely and attentiuely as he coulde giuing eare to al reports, in hope to hear some thing of them he sought, he straight receyued a straunge rumor of these thinges: but so vncertainely as popular reports cary so rare accidents. But this by all men he was willed, to seek out <hi>Kalander</hi> a great Gentleman of that Countrey, who would soonest satisfie him of all these occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Thus enstructed he came euen about the midst of <hi>Euarchus</hi> iudgement to the desert. Where seeing great multitudes, and hearing vnknowen names of <hi>Palladius,</hi> and <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> and not able to presse to the place where <hi>Euarchus</hi> sate, he enquired for <hi>Kalander,</hi> and was soone brought vnto him: partly because he was generallye knowen vnto all men, and partly because he had withdrawen himselfe from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> presse, when he perceiued by <hi>Euarchus</hi> words whether they tended, being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure his guests condemnation. Hee enquired forthwith of <hi>Kalander</hi> the cause of the assembly: and whither the fame were true of <hi>Euarchus</hi> presence: who with manye teares, made a dolefull recitall vnto him, both of the <hi>Amazon</hi> and sheepheard, setting forth their naturall graces, and lamenting their pittifull vndo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> But his description made <hi>Kalodulus</hi> immediatly knowe the sheepheard was his Duke, and so iudging the other to be <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> and speedely communicating it to <hi>Kalander,</hi> who he saw did fauour their case, they brake the presse with astonishing
<pb facs="tcp:12151:242"/>
euery man with their cryes. And being come to <hi>Euarchus, Kalodulus</hi> fell at his feete telling him those he had iudged were his owne Sunne and Nephewe; the one the comforte of Macedon, the other the onely stay of <hi>Thessalia.</hi> With many such like words, but as from a man that assured himselfe in that matter he shoulde neede smal speeche. While <hi>Kalander</hi> made it knowen to all men, what the prisoners were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to whom he cried they should salute their father, and ioy in the good hap the gods had sent them; who were no lesse glad, then all the people amazed at the strange euent of these matters. Euen <hi>Philanax</hi> owne reuengefull hart was mollified, when he saw from diuerse partes of the world so neere kinsemen should meete in such a necessitie. And with all the fame of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Musidorus,</hi> greatly drewe him to a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> compassionate conceite, and had already vncloathed his face of all shew of mallice. But <hi>Euarchus</hi> staide a good while vpon himselfe, like a valliant man that should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue a notable encounter, being vehemently stricken with the fatherly loue of so excellent children, and studying with his best reason, what his office required. At length with such a kind of grauitie, as was neere to sorrow, he thus vttred his mind.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> I take witnes of the immortall gods (saide he) O <hi>Arcadians,</hi> that what this daye I haue saide, hath be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e out of my assured perswasion, what iustice it selfe and your iuste lawes require. Though straungers then to me, I had no desire to hurt them, but leauing a side all considerations of the persons, I wayed the matter which you committed into my hands, with most vnpartiall and farthest reach of reason. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> thereout haue condemned them to loose their liues, contaminated with so manye foule breaches of hospitalitie, ciuilitie and vertue. Now contrarye to all expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I finde them to be my onely sonne and Nephew, such vpon whom you see, what guiftes nature hath bestowed. Such who haue so to the wonder of the worlde heretofore behaued themselues, as might geue iuste cause to the greatest hopes, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> in an excellent youth may be conceaued. Lastly in fewe wordes such, in whome I placed all my mortall ioyes, and thought my selfe now neere my graue, to recouer a newe life. But alas shall iustice halte? Or shall she winke in ones cause which had <hi>Lynces</hi> eyes in anothers? Or rather shall all priuate respectes geue place to that holy name? Bee it so, bee it so, let my graye heares bee layde in the dust with sorrow, let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the small remnant of my life, bee to mean inward and outward desolation, and to the world a gazing stock of wretched misery: But neuer neuer, let sacred rightfulnes fall. It is immortal and immortally ought to be preserued. If rightly I haue iudged, then rightly I haue iudged myne own children. Vnlesse the name of a child, should haue force to change the neuer changing iustice. No no <hi>Pyrocles</hi> &amp; <hi>Musidorus</hi> I prefer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> you much before my life, but I prefer Iustice as far before you, while you did like your selues, my body should willingly haue ben your shield, but I cannot keep you from the effects of your own doing. Nay I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not in this case acknowledge you for mine. For neuer had I sheapheard to my nephew, nor euer had woman to my son, your vices haue degraded you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being princes, &amp; haue disanulde your birthright.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore if there be anie thing left in you, of Princely vertue, shew it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant suffering, that your vnprincely dealing hath purchased vnto you. For my part I must tell you, you haue forced a father to rob himselfe of his children. Do you therefore, O <hi>Philanax,</hi> and you my other Lordes of this countrie, see the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be rightly performed in time, place and maner, as before appointed. With <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> that though he would haue refrained them; a man might perceiue the teares drop downe his long white beard. Which moued not onely <hi>Kalodulus</hi> and <hi>Kerxenus</hi> to

roating lamentations, but al the assembly dolefully to record that pittiful spectacle. <hi>Philanax</hi> himselfe could not abstaine from great shewes of pittying sorrow, and manifest withdrawing from performing the kinges commaundement. But <hi>Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> hauing the hope of his safety, and recouering of the princesse <hi>Pamela</hi>: which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> made him most desirous to liue, so sodainly dashed: but especialy moued for hys deare <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> for whom he was euer resolued his last should be, and stirred vp with rage of vnkindnesse, he thus spake. Enioy thy bloudie conquest tyrannicall <hi>Euarchus,</hi> said he; for neither is conuenient the title of a king, to a murderer, nor the remembrance of kindred, to a destroyer of his kindred. Go home and glorie that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> hath been in thy power, shamefully to kill <hi>Musidorus.</hi> Let thy flattering Orators dedicate Crownes of Laurell vnto thee, that the first of thy race, thou hast ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne a Prince of <hi>Thessalia.</hi> But for me I hope the <hi>Thessalians</hi> are not so degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from their auncestors, but that they will reuenge my iniurie; and their losse vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee.

But if thy crueltie hath not so blinded thine eyes, that thou canst not see thine own heart, if thy heart be not so diuelish, as thou hast no power but to torment thy self: then look vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this yong <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> with a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like eie; if not with a pittifull: Giue not occasion to the whole earth to say, see how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the gods haue made the Tyrant teare his owne bowels! Examine the eies and voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all this people, and what all men see, be not blinde in thine owne case. Looke I say looke vpon him, in whom the most curious searcher is able to finde no fault: but that he is thy sonne. Beleeue it, thy owne subiectes will detest thee, for robbing them of such a Prince, in whome they haue right as well as thy selfe. Some more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> wordes to that purpose he would haue spoken, but <hi>Pyrocles</hi> who often had cald to him, did nowe fully interrupt him, desiring him not to do him the wrong to geue his father ill wordes before him, willing him to consider it was their owne fault, and not his vniustice, and withall to remember their resolution of well suffering all accidents, which this impaciencie did seeme to varry fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and then kneeling down <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> with all humblenesse, hee tooke the speach in this order to <hi>Euarchus.</hi> If my dayly praiers to the Almightie Gods, had so farre preuayled, as to haue graunted me the end whereto I haue directed my actions; I should rather haue beene nowe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to your minde, then an example of your iustice, rather a preseruer of your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie by my life, then a monument of your iudgement by my death. But since it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> hath pleased their vnsearchable wisedomes, to ouerthrow all the desires I had to serue you, and make me become a shame vnto you; since the last obedience I can shew you, is to die: vouchsafe yet O father (if my fault haue not made me altogether vnworthy, so to terme you) vouchsafe I say to let the few &amp; last words your sonne shall euen speake, not be tedious vnto you. And if the remembrance of my vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> mother, who once was deare vnto you, may beare any sway with you, if the name of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> haue at any time bene pleasant, let one request of mine which shall not be for mine owne life, be graciously accepted of you. What you owe to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is performed in my death. A father to haue executed his onely sonne, wil leaue a sufficient example for a greater crime then this. My bloud will satisfie the highest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> point of equitie, my bloud will satisfie the hardest hearted in this countrie. O saue the life of this Prince, that is the onely all I will with my last breath demaund of you. With what face will you looke vpon your sister, when in reward of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
<pb facs="tcp:12151:243"/>
me in your greatest neede, you take away and in such sort take away that which is more deare to her then all the world, and is the onely comfort, wherewith she nourisheth her olde age? O giue not such an occasion to the noble. <hi>Thessalians,</hi> for euer to curse the match that their Prince did make with the <hi>Macedon</hi> bloud.

Let these dying wordes of him, that was once your sonne, pearce your eares. Let <hi>Musidorus</hi> liue, and <hi>Pirocles</hi> shall liue in him, and you shall not want a childe. A childe cried out <hi>Musidorus,</hi> to him, that killes <hi>Pyrocles</hi>? with that againe he fell to intreate for <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> and <hi>Pyrocles</hi> as fast for <hi>Musidorus,</hi> each employing his wit how to shew himselfe most worthy to die, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> such an admiration of all the beholders, that most of them examining the matter by their owne passions, thought <hi>Euarchus</hi> (as often extraordinarie excellencies, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly conceiued, do rather offend then please) an obstinate hearted man, and such a one, who being pittilesse, his dominion must needes be insupportable. But <hi>Euarchus</hi> that felt his owne miserie more then they, and yet loued goodnesse more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> then himselfe, with such a sad assured behauiour as <hi>Cato</hi> killed himselfe withall, when he had heard the vttermost of that their speach tended vnto: he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againe they should be carried away, rising vp from the seate (which he would much rather haue wished, should haue been his graue) and looking who would take the charge, whereto euerie one was exceeding backward. But as this pittifull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> matter was entring into, those that were next the Dukes bodie, might heare from vnder the veluet, wherewith he was couered, a great voice of groning. Whereat euerie man astonished, (and their spirites appalled with these former miseries, apt to take anie strange conceite) when they might perfitly perceiue the bodie stirre, Then some beganne to feare spirits, some to looke for a myracle, most to imagine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> they knew not what. But <hi>Philanax</hi> and <hi>Kerxenus,</hi> whose eies, honest loue (though to diuerse parties) held most attentiue, leapt to the table, and putting of the veluet couer, might plainly discerne, with as much wonder as gladnesse, that the Duke liued. For so it was, that the drinke he had receiued, was neither as <hi>Gynecia</hi> first ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, a loue potion, nor as it was after thought, a deadly poyson, but a drinke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> made, by notable Arte, and as it was thought not without naturall magicke to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for thirtie houres, such a deadly sleepe, as should oppresse all shew of life. The
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:12151:243"/>
cause of the making of this drinke had first been, that a Princesse of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> graund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother to <hi>Gynecia,</hi> being notably learned, (and yet not able with al her learning, to answere the obiections of <hi>Cupid</hi>) did furiously loue a yoong noble man of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Court. Who fearing the kinges rage, and not once daring either to attempt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> or accept so high a place, shee made that sleeping drinke, and found meanes by a trustie seruaunt of hers, (who of purpose inuited him to his chamber) to procure him, that suspected no such thing, to receiue it. Which done, he no way able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, was secretly carried by him into a pleasant chamber, in the midst of a garden, she had of purpose prouided for this enterprise: where that space of time, pleasing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> her selfe with seeing and cherishing of him, when the time came of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e drinks end of working, and he more astonished then if he had falne from the cloudes, she bad him choose either then to marrie her, and to promise to flie away with her in a bark she had made readie, or else she would presently crie out, and shewe in what place he was, with othe hee was come thither to rauish her. The noble man in these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> straightes, her beautie preuailed, he married her, and escaped the Realme with her. And after many strange aduentures, were reconciled to the king her father, after whose death they raigned. But she gratefully remembring the seruice, that drinke had done her, preserued in a bottle (made by singular Arte long to keepe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perishing) great quantitie of it, with the foretold inscription, which wrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> by her daughter in law the Queene of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> was giuen by her to <hi>Gynecia</hi> at the time of her marriage, and the drinke finding an old body of <hi>Basilius,</hi> had kept him some houres longer in the trance, then it would haue done a yoonger. But a good while it was, before good <hi>Basilius</hi> could come again to himself: in which time <hi>Euarchus</hi> more glad then of the whole worldes Monarchie, to be rid of his misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> magistracie, which euen in iustice he was now to surrender to the lawful Prince of that countrie; came from the Throne vnto him, and there with much adoe made him vnderstand, how these intricate matters had fallen out. Many garboiles passed through his fancie before he could be perswaded, <hi>Cleofila</hi> was other then a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. At length remembring the Oracle, which now indeede was accomplished <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>(not as before he had imagined) considering all had fallen out by the highest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, and withall waying in all these matters his owne fault had been the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test. The first thing he did, was with all honorable pompe, to send for <hi>Gynecia</hi>: who poore Ladie thought she was leading forth to her liuing buriall: and (when she came) to recount before all the people, the excellent vertue was in her, which she <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> had not onely maintained all her life most vnspotted: but nowe was contented so miserably to die, to follow her husband. He told them how she had warned him to take heede of that drinke, and so withall the exal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inges of her that might be, he publikely desired her pardon, for those errours he had committed. And so kyssing her, left her to receiue the most honourable fame of anie Princesse throughout the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> world, all men thinking (sauing onely <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Philoclea</hi> who neuer bewraied her) that she was the perfit mirrour of all wifely loue. Which though in that point vndeserued, she did in the remnant of her life daily purchase, with obseruing al du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie &amp; faith to the example &amp; glorie of <hi>Greece.</hi> So vncertain are mortall iudgments, the same person most infamous, and most famous, and neither iustly. Then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> with Princely entertainment to <hi>Euarchus,</hi> and many kinde words to <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> whom still he dearely loued though in a more vertuous kinde, the marriage was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to the inestimable ioy of <hi>Euarchus,</hi> (towardes whom now <hi>Musidorus</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
