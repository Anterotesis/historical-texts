         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as of all the reſt of the proteſtant Bishops and miniſters in England. And thoughe hitherto I haue receiued no notice of anie Sentences geuen by you in this Controuerſie (becauſe for ſeeinge as I ſuppoſe, that you cannot paſſe your Sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thereupon, without preiudice either of your owne interest, or reputation, you willinglie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the matter) yett am I moued to demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de your iudgment in another difference, betwixt another miniſter of yours, Mr. Richarde Pilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and my ſelfe. For where as I ſett forth fiue yeeres a goe a briefe Manuall of Controuerſies, contayninge onlie ſeauen sheetes of Paper, proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge all the cheefest heades of controuerſie by Scriptures only; he, this last yeare, to croſſe the ſame, hath printed a fowle great booke of fifty sheetes, callinge it, <hi>Parallela.</hi> Which booke he dedicateth to you. In whoſe Epistle Dedicatorie, thoughe there be as manie falſities and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, as there are in ſo manies lines of the rest of his booke; yet shall they paſſe without other touch in particular, then this generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion (as either refutinge themſelues, or not worthy refutinge of purpoſe) only I cannot omitte theſe brauinge wordes of his which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe. <hi>This popiſh agent (he meaneth the author of the Manual) I haue vndertaken, and ſtripped him of his armour, which he hath vſurped, ſhewinge his proofes to be as weake, as his poſitions are wicked, that his blinde religion may appeare vnto all to be nothinge but an heape of vntruthes</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:18096:3"/>
               <hi>without patronage of holy Scriptures.

Therefore haue I made free choice of you for vmpiere betwixt him and me, to iudge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath indeede stryped me of myne Armour, as he braggeth, &amp; whether his proofes or myne be ſtronger, and more pertinent to the purpoſe for which they are produced. I ſay of the proofes onlie, for of the poſitions themſelues, I houlde you not a fitt or competent iudge. And were it not, that I am verie confident in the clearenes of my cauſe, and am alſo perſuaded that you will not preiudice your reputation with the world ſo farre, as to giue your iudgment againſt a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt truth, I would not be ſo vnaduiſed as to put my cauſe into ſo vnequall and partiall a iudge his handes, as all men knowe you to be, betweene me and myne aduerſarie.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the yeare 1614. (good reader) I put forth in print at the requeſt of a friend, a briefe Enchiridion or Manuall of controuerſies, proouinge the Catholike faith in 38. ſeuerall heades of controuerſie by the text of holy Scripture it ſelfe; which contayninge but onlie ſeauen ſheetes of paper, Mr. Richarde Pilkinton, who ſtileth himſelfe doctor of Diuinitie, after fower whole yeeres, pretendeth to anſwre, and for that purpoſe hath ſett forth a booke of fiftie ſheetes thinkinge to couer by multitude of wordes, that which with force of argument he could not impeache nor make obſcure. His booke came but to my handes the laſt of Februarie this preſent yeere, when I was both indiſpoſed in my health, &amp; had newlie receiued a command from thoſe who could commaunde me, to tranſporte myſelfe from Paris, where then I liued, to Douay. So that vntill the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of May, I could not begin to thinke ſeriouſly of any reply to him, thoughe I had in the meane while runne ouer ſome parte of his booke, and alſoe noted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge therein to that purpoſe.

Neither doth Mr. Pilkinton neede much to bragge of his dexteritie and expedition in this kinde; ſeeinge he hath beſtowed fower whole yeeres or verie neere in anſwereinge only ſeauen ſheetes of paper, and that alſo ſo ſhallowly and ſeelily, that there is much leſſe difficultie to refute his aunſwere, then to Coppie out or tranſcribe his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. I haue replyed to all he ſaith as it lyeth in his booke ſo farr as I goe with him, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge his owne wordes, leaſt he ſhoulde complayne of ill dealinge, as if ſomethinge of moment were lefte vntouched; And both he and the reader may likewiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, that I might with as much faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie haue refuted the reſt of his booke, had it been either neceſſarie or proffitable to haue beſtowed the labour in tranſcribinge it, and coſt in printinge it. I would wiſhe thee good reader to take ſpeciall notice of the preface, which may ſerue thee as a key not only to this ſmall treatiſe, but alſo to

other workes of greater moment, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to all controuerſies. In the anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reinge whereof as Mr. Pilkinton hath been more laborious, ſo hath he alſo ſhewed himſelfe more impertinent and peruerſe. Reade the whole with attention if thy lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure will permitte thee, and compare dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlie his proofes and myne together, &amp; after doe not ſpare to giue thy Cenſure thereon as thou ſhalt thinke good in gods name. And if thou receiueſt anie proffit by my ſmall labour, I ſhall thinke it well beſtowed, and as fullie recompenſed as I expect or deſire in this worlde. God euer keepe thee and me alſo.

And further that he that will impugne this treatiſe, may ſee, what he hath to prooue if hee wil prooue any thinge to purpoſe.</hi> That is if he will prooue anie thinge againſt the Catholike Faith, which onlie I vndertake in the Manuall to prooue, and not to impugne or diſprooue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, further then the proofe of one contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, is the diſproofe of the other.

                  <p>If therefore there be anie of the catholique poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſett downe by me, admitted and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as true and orthodoxe, then is not the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorie poſition inforced or impoſed vppon them to prooue.

Firſt is it not a cheefe article of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleefe that the ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of God is of equall or one ſubſtance and glorie with his father? and ſecondlie is not this article as clearlie and as often ſett downe in the ſcripture, as anie other articles of our beliefe? And thirdlie did not the Arrians delude by falſe interpretation all the proofes of the ſayde article, ſo that they remained not conuinced by anie of them, nor all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? which of all theſe three propoſitions will you denie? you will not as I ſuppoſe finde anie probable ground to denie anie of them. And yett if you graunt them all (as they are all moſt manifeſtlie true) that is clearlie concluded which I affirme, and you denie; to witt that noe teſtimonie of holy ſcripture can be ſo direct, and conuincinge, but that it may be elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by falſe interpretation.

Noe one of all the teſtimonies alleaged by you doth ſay, that where ſcriptures are produced by both partes, they are ſufficient to decide the controuerſie. Thoughe I doe not denie, but for the moſte part the inequallity is ſo greate in the catholike partie (as it alſo falleth out in the cauſe betweene the proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and catholikes at this day) that anie man of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent witt, iudgment and deſire to find out the truth, may ſee on whether ſide the ſcripture ſtandeth. But that they are not abſolutelie ſufficient where there is obſtinacie on anie ſide, I ſhall make your ſelfe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe (thoughe peruerſe enoughe) or elſe I ſhall much marueill; &amp; that by the verie example vſed by S. Optatus and S. Aug: and approoued here by your ſelfe. Put therefore the caſe, that the children of a deceaſed father contend aboute the inheritance, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of them challenginge it as appertayninge to himſelfe, &amp; in proofe or confirmation of his clayme alleageth the teſtament and will of his father, which he proteſteth to be cleare for him, and againſt his competitours, beinge rightlie vnderſtoode, perſiſting moſt ſtifly in his opinion and in deffence of his right clayme, as he is perſwaded. The caſe beinge putt thus (which is the verie ſame with ours in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy of religion) will you ſay in the ſinceritie of your hearte, that the ſole will or teſtament of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a ſufficient iudge to decide this difference and to bringe the parties to an accorde? And that there needeth not anie other iudge or arbiter to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18096:44"/>
vppon the true ſence and meaninge of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, whereby they all pretende to make theire clayme, and to grounde theire title? you will not I thinke ſay, yea, to this queſtion. And well I wote that were the caſe your owne betwixte your ſelfe &amp; your bretheren concerninge a temporall inheritance, experience (which though ſhee be the miſtres of fooles, is not for all that a fooliſh miſtres) woulde teach you that it is a meere Paradoxe to maintayne that the ſole teſtament of your deceaſed father, could in this caſe decide the controuerſie amongſt you his diſagreeinge children. So that the example brought by your ſelfe out of the fathers, is prooued to make manifeſtlie againſt you.</p>
                  <p>Which will yet be much more cleare, if the caſe be putt as it is indeede with vs, that theſe brethren doe not only contend aboute the true ſence and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of theire fathers teſtament, but alſo aboute the teſtament it ſelfe; the one conteſtinge the whole writinge contayned in the booke vnder the title of his will to be his true teſtament, another not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge the whole, contendeth diuers partes and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells not to belonge therunto. And another yett re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectinge more; as it falleth out betweene vs and the proteſtants, Caluin caſtinge out of the teſtament of God, fiue whole bookes beſides ſome large partes of other bookes, which the catholikes belieue to appertayn to his true teſtament. Luther reiectinge beſides theſe, diuerſe other whole bookes. The caſe therefore beinge thus, howe is it poſſible that the ſole written teſtament of God ſhoulde decide the controuerſie betweene theſe competitors, and bring them to an accorde? who doe not agree ſo much as in what bookes or writinges the teſtament is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, ſo farre are they from beinge at accorde of the true ſence and meaninge thereof.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore no other thinge to ſay in this caſe, that the ſcriptures muſt iudge all controuerſies, then to ſay that the controuerſie it ſelfe, muſt be iudge of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18096:45"/>
the controuerſie, which is more then madnes to thinke. For the controuerſie beinge not onlie what the ſcripture ſaith, or meaneth, but alſo what is ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is all one to ſay, that ſcriptures muſt iudge and decide all controuerſies, and to ſay the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies themſelues muſt decide all controuerſies. Againe ſeeinge you Mr. Pilkinton, ſeeme to geue ſo much to holy ſcripture as to be able and ſufficient to decide all doubtes and determine all differences in matter of faith, Why doe you not hearken vnto them when they ſend you to the churche and to the paſtours, and doctours thereof, as to liuelie iudges, hauinge the keyes of knowledge to vnderſtande the ſcriptures? But you deſiringe nothinge leſſe then to come to a iuſt and competent tryall of your cauſe, holde your ſelues cloſe to that principle, by which the moſt deteſtable, vile, and contemptible heretike that euer was may maintaine his hereſie, without beinge conuinced thereof; as I toulde you before of Legat, which inſtance you can neuer anſwere not ſatisfy, and which onlie is ſufficient if you were not obſtinatly peruerſe) to make you aſhamed to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſo ſenceles a Paradox, and ſo euidentlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by perpetuall experience in all ages.</p>
                  <p>Your laſt ſhifte or euaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of interpretinge ſcripture by ſcripture, vnles there be ſome agreement, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of the ſcripture interpretinge, more then of the ſcripture interpreted, which abſtractinge from the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the churche cannot be had, is a meere mockerie, and like as if a man would meaſure one peece of veluett the meaſure whereof is as vncertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne as that of the former.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude this ſection, it beinge in queſtion betweene the catholikes and proteſtants who is to be iudge of controuerſies in faith (yea the roote and key of all controuerſies, which beinge ended or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided all the reſt would haue eaſie deciſion) you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firminge the ſcriptures to be this iudge and pretend to prooue this by ſcripture, as al other thinges to be

For if you take from the ſcripture which you trulie teache to be a rule of our faith, the authoritie to propoſe, manifeſt, and teſtify articles of beleefe, ſee howe you will make it a rule of faith. Seeinge therefore you geue to the churche theſe thinges without which the ſcriptures are not a rule of faith, why ſhould you deny it to be alſo a rule of faith? But the churche (you ſay) is not the foundation or reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith (I ſpeake in your owne phraſe thoughe improperlie that you may vnderſtande) and therfore is it not anie rule thereof. If this argument conclude anie thinge, it will alſo prooue the ſcriptures to be noe rule of faith. For it is neither foundation, nor reſolution of faith, if you vnderſtande the firſt and chiefe foundation, or laſt reſolution (as I tould you before) vnles you will make it to be God himſelfe.

you what you eſteeme of your father in reformation Martin Luther, whome ſome of his diſciples as you knowe ſtile the ſeconde Elias, the fifte Euangeliſt, the ſecond or thirde perſon in heauen after Chriſte, who with a greate troope of his ſchollers, doth not onlie open his mouth to call into queſtion diuers of the Apoſtles writinges, but abſolutelie caſteth them out of the Canon? will you cenſure him to be noe chriſtian? if you doe you ſhall be a curſed childe of a more curſed father. Yea what will you thinke of your ſelfe and all the reſt of your crewe, who caſt out of the Canon ſo manie of thoſe bookes which S. Aug. whoſe authoritie you cite, alwayes eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be canonicall ſcripture? See whether you haue not pronounced ſentence with your owne mouth againſt your ſelfe, and condemned your ſelfe to be noe Chriſtian? If you ſhoulde eate noe bread till you quitt your ſelfe of this indictment, I dare vndertake to finde you bread for ſixe pence ſo longe as you liue. Howſoeuer, hereby at leaſt it is cleare that the ſcriptures are not ſuch principles of our faith as beinge not prooued to be written by the holy Ghoſt, may be doubted of, and therefore neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie require to be ſufficientlie prooued before they can be groundes of other articles of our faith.

                  <p>S. Aug. hath good reaſon to ſay that no Chriſtian dare to open his mouth againſt the ſcriptures recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the catholicke churche.

Secondlie there be manie thinges imbarked in them which Apostolicall rule of faith and ſound doctrine doth contradict, both theſe are verified of, the Apocripha. For neither the churche of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ receiued them, to whom were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the oracles of God. Rom. 3. 2.

And beſides in the bookes them ſelues: there are certaine brandes, whereby they may be diſcerned from the canonicall.

The true Hester the kinge looked gratiouſlie vppon her: the conterfeit, he looked angerlie. The booke of Baruch ſaith that the cittie of Hieruſalem was taken and burnt at the ſame tyme: Ieremie tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the contrarie &amp; the bookes of the kinges. The additions vnto Daniell ſay that when Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyell deliuered Suſanna he was a childe: the true

Daniell ſaith that he with two others made by<note place="margin">ca. 13. 45. cap. 2. 48.</note> the kinge were chiefe ouer 120. princes, that they might take all the accompts of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the kinge might not be troubled. But children vſe not to be ſett ouer ſuch affaires. Commentitiues Daniell ſaith in the storie of Bell, that he was fed by Abacucke. 14. 36. whereas Abacucke propheſied longe before the captiuitie 1. 6. In the booke of Tobie cap. 12. 15: the Angell calleth himſelfe Raphaell the Angell of the Lorde; but chapter the 5. 12. he is of the kinred of Ananias and Azarias the greate, if he be the Angell of the Lorde, he cannot be the ſonne of a man. As true is that medecine wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the deuill is driuen away: but corporall creatures vſe not to make anie impreſsion into a ſubſtance ſimply intellectuall as deuills be.

I and the conſubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the ſonne, becauſe the Arrians inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted it of vnitie of concorde and will. But if

the mist of poperie had not blinded your eyes, you might eaſily haue ſeen vnanswerable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of the text to prooue the ſonne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiall to the father, and ſo to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode of the vnitie of ſubſtance. For the Iewes require him to tell them plainely whether he be that Christ, he answereth directlie he is, there fore the naturall and conſubstantiall ſonne of God, as he prooueth. Matt. 22. 45. out of the Pſalme. 100. If then Dauid called him Lorde, howe is he then his ſonne?</p>
               <p>Secondlie he that geueth eternall life to his sheepe, ſo that none can take them out of his hande, is of the ſame power, and conſequentlie of the ſame nature with God; For what is it to be God, but to be of the highest and greateſt power, then which none greater? but the ſonne doth ſoe; ver. 28. &amp; 29. And I geue vnto them eternall life, and they shall neuer perish, neither shall anie plucke them out of myne hande. Thirdlie the Iewes tooke vppe stones to stone him, as a blaſphemer as one that made himſelfe God, this cauſe they ſett downe in plaine ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. verſe 33. Becauſe thou makeſt thy ſelfe God, beinge man; but it is no blaſphemie to be of the like will, deſire and affection with God: playne therefore it is by Chriſts argument, that he did preache God ſo to be his Father, as the Iewes vnderstoode he would haue himſelfe the naturall ſonne of God.

                  <p>Your ſecond anſwere is as much to the purpoſe, as your firſt. Neither the old teſtament proouing the newe, nor contrariwiſe; vnles the one be beleeued before.

                  <p>The arguments vſed by Bellarmine are not chaffie but ſubſtantially good, becauſe they are taken from the ſcripture interpreted by the authoritie of the churche, and the canonicall practiſe thereof, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the Apoſtles, which is ſufficient to prooue the Anabaptiſts to be heretike denyinge the Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of infants to be lawfull.

When then he ſaith of this as of other thinges, that they are not founde in the Apostles writinges, nor in lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter councells &amp;c.

Thus Aquinas inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth this place, theſe thinges which thou hast hearde of me and of Christe, I ſay not of one onlie, but confirmed by manie witneſſes vid. the Lawe and the Prophetts.
