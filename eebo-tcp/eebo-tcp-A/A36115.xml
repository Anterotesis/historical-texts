            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And the rather for that (his Majesties Protestations to govern by the laws, and his late answer to the petition of right notwithstanding) the exaction of loane money immediately following, the erection of Monopolies, and the forcible taking of the Subsidie of Tunnage and Poundage, begat an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall diffidence in the people of his Majesties personall promises, and an opinion, that his best resolutions were easily overthrowne by the counsell of others, and so consequently that his actions were not his owne: which opinion true or false when ever it got beliefe, hath proved fatall to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or to the people of this Kingdome: For the Nation hath hated to be governed by many Viceroyes, and resents to insolencies in their Princes so much as defects, rapes, murthers, and particular depredations, being more tollerable, when the vertues of the Kingly Office have a happy influence and latitude upon the whole bodie of the Common-wealth And yet to speake a truth, the same argument that aggravates the violations in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be a reasonable excuse for his Majestie (and the same that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of the English nation to their Princes hath ever uses) those acts of injustice were not the kings but his Ministers: for what other opinion could the king retaine, then what the Judges delivered for law, and the Divines for Gospell: for these had made a generall definition of a king, and applyed it to all Princes, and those had made a generall day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon all the laws, and subdued them to the will and pleasure of those Princes: and being mindfull of their owne interest, and how much it concerned them to make the king absolute, whom they had hope abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to rule: they would needs make a king by the standard out of Gods Word, that his subjects might be slaves for conscience sake: And by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples taken from the kingdome of the Iewes, they invested him with power essentiall to his office, to use at pleasure the persons or estates of his subjects; of a divine institution, incomprehensible by lawes, if necessitie require a variation and under heaven no other Iudge of that necessitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides himselfe: And having placed him in the ranke of God<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Therefore if his Majestie will have those promises believed, let him not apparantly go about to place himselfe in such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he may breake them at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>I know the Allegations for the manner of his Majesties present procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings are, first the just vindication of his royall Prerogative (whereof it is pretended violation h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For the Prerogative of Princes (so much talked of and so little known) it may in briefe be said, That all Princes have gaind Dominion by force or by bargaine, For to say that Adam, if he had lived to this time had beene king of the whole world, and therefore the king is first in order before the people, his naturall vassals; and production is an Assertion invented to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Princes, for all men know that the multiplication of Colonies in Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons far distant from the first rules of Nations, must impell the necessitie of erecting many independent governments, and the necessitie will bee as great in the independency, as for the multiplicitie) therefore by force or by contract they must commence: Dominion got by force, is kept by force and stiled Tyranny, or else it dissolves into Government by contract, and so takes a lawfull forme. Therefore of the nature and latitude of the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that rests in the hands of a Prince, that comes in by agreement with the people; is the now dispute. It may be defined thus: A power to see the Lawes put in execution, and to doe that which is good for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in cases to which the Lawes have not yet extended; if there were no Lawes (as perhaps there are not many in the first erection of a Monarchy) but that all were trusted to the wisedome and goodnesse of the Prince, yet by all the reason in the world the intendment of that trust was to enable him to doe good, not to doe every thing. Now, where the Lawes are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive the Prerogative claimes no jurisdiction. The corruptions of Princes, and the extravagancies of the people occasioned Lawes, for bounds and limits to both: and it is a thing out of all question, that the first contract would have left no prerogative at all; if all future needs and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the government could at one intire view have beene presented to the people; but that being impossible, the discretion of all common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths meeting in their representative bodyes, have given a stop by lawes to the progresse of any inconvenience as it hath beene emergent.</p>
            <p>His Majestie complaines that he is divested of his legall prerogative. That is, hee is denyed the power to execute the Lawes, with his owne sence and exposition upon them: And the Lords and Commons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pray to have reduced into a Law that Arbitrary power which hee hath of Custome exercised, in things to which the Lawes doe not fully extend: or to speake shorter, they are not willing to trust him any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with a power undefined, which they have imployed to their harme byt desire to have it defined and limited; that for the time to come it may bee so no more; And this they expect from his Majestie as a duty of his office to the people, who if they are incapable of reason of state, yet are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent Iudges of what is good for themselvs; unlesse we shall maintain
<pb facs="tcp:111732:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Aruments of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and to the same end; That the people are altogether ignorant of their own welfare, that the King only knowes it; That is best with an implicite faith to trust him, and his Army, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, with the safety of the Common-wealth, and every mans life and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, That when <hi>France</hi> is free from feare of forraigne enemies, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects shall bee discharged of the oppressions; In the meane time to make himselfe and his <hi>Mamalukes</hi> formidable to his neighbour Princes he hath transformed millions of Christ an soules into beasts, reducing them back to the Elements whereof they were made, yet they must not complaine nor defend their Lawes and liberties, lest they seeme to resist Authority: Nor supplicate the supreame Magestrate to governe according to right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the Lawes of the Kingdom, least they seeme wiser than their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, to be short, I hope it will never be so in England. And if the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Parliament be at sometime mistaken (as it is not to bee presum'd that they will bee) yet they are not so much hurt by the inconvenience of that mistake, untill the next Parliament rectifie, as they are, if they shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from al competency to judg in matters tending to their own welfare.</p>
            <p>For the other branch of His Maiesties Allegation that the streightning on his Prerogative is prejudiciall to the people: It is true a Prince of high and magnanimious endowments cannot dispense with that liberty and the influen<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of his excellent personall vertues, if he be too much bound up by the dead letter of the Law; for the actions of some have beene transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all Lawes or examples; and pittie it had been that they should have beene confined. And (indeed) the people doe lose willingly of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to such good Princes which proves unhappie to them, when worse make a title to the same liberty, by such Examples; And there is no surer a signe of a weake Prince, than to contest with the people upon these Presidents, rather seeking examples for his purpose amongst the actions of his predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, than desirous to be himselfe an example to posterity. How ever those Princes that have surmounted all Lawes in their glorious actions have been very rare, a festivall that comes but once a yeare; which if it came every quarter, yet a good constant diet were much better.</p>
            <p>It is strange to finde how defective some are in the right understanding of the Mysteries they professe, what is it that a Prince would have, (that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects not glorious vindications and conquests upon forraigne enemies) to live safely, plentifully, and beloved of his people, to dye lamented, rich, and of a blessed memory; this is all that can accrue to the best of the sonnes of men; And if Princes did not proferre their wills before their profit; if they did not shame lesse to picke lockes, pockets, and their subjects pursues, than to say, I thanke you; if they did not chuse rather by force to justifie injustice, rapine and oppression, then to have any actions of themselves, or ministers called by such names, doubtlesse in a short time they could not

And tis out of question, if his Majesty had been clearely concurrent with this Parliament for the punishment of Delinquents, and conservation of the peace, and Liberty of the Subject, they had never risen up into so high requests; but take the Argument at the best, it followes not that the Parliament intends to assume Soveragne Authority, because when Ireland is in Rebellion.

               </gap> it was never heard of: And it must follow thereupon (as hath been answered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

reasonable soul, have no latitude of operation, the state may be left without means to preserve it self, which is a great obsurditie to think. But if by the Kings absence be undestood the want of his voluntary concurrence in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Acts and Ordinances of both houses, and that in such cases they are no Parliament, it may well be doubted if they have bin any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during this Session: For the acts that have passed his Royall ascent (so much amplified in his late declarations to the people) are shrodely sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be with no great good liking of his Majestie. I am sure if they were voluntary, they were not exhibited with due circumstances, for through that opinion, his Majestie hath lost much of the thanks due for such transcendent graces, which no Prince, or inferior person, ought in discretion to loose. However that both houses legally convened and authorised to sit, do not by the Kings absence loose the essence and denomination of a Parliament, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by presidents of former times, when in the absence of a Prince (fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther distant in body then his Majestie is in minde I hope) the estates have assembled themselves (which is a little higher then was yet in dispute) have administred oathes of fealtie to the subject, have named officers for publique services, and as well to superintend the peace of the Kingdom as the revenue of the King. And though there was not nor is any law authorising the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of a parliament in such a case, yet was the legallity of that parliament never questioned, nor will, of any other upon the same or the like occasion, when the matter to be treated on is the peace and safety of the Kingdome, whether the King be absent in body or minde, it changes not the question much.</p>
            <p>But which is a short answer to all that can be said is: that by an Act of all the estates, this Parliament is not disolveable, but by an Act of all the estates, therefore a Parliament untill that Act be passed.</p>
            <p>To the other part of the allegation that Major part of both Houses have left the rest, and are gone over to the King. It may be demanded why doth not then his Majesty send them up to adjourn the Parliament to <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge,</hi> are they so fearfull of the Aprentizes of London, that they dare not appear to do his Majestie so great a service by shouting a yea or no in the house of Commons, how willingly would they adventure a battell that refuse to speak a word in a croud. Truly it were the way to put an end to all the controversie, to reverse with ease the acts that have given so great cause of repentance, to reduce the Parliament to termes of due obedience; to save a multitude of offenders to weede out of both houses those factious members that insist so obstinately upon a trust reposed in them; to distill out of the delinquent City of London much cordiall water to save the labour, charge,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:111732:7"/>
and hazards of warre, to save the purses, persons, and horses of the willing Gentry, who labour for those fetters (such is the understanding of this time) that their Fathers swet to be rid from; For if armes be raised onely against a smal malignant party, a faction of a few Parliament men: The Major num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber would quickly deliver them up and what place could afford safety for them against the Ire of his Majesty and both Houses of Parliament.</p>
            <p>To such as put these Questions, What is the power and priviledge of Parliament, by what Law doe they impose Orders upon the people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kings Assent? they seeme to me like them that dispute how le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally the next houses are pulled downe, when the flame and windes make cruell vastation in the beautifull buildings of a populous Citie.
