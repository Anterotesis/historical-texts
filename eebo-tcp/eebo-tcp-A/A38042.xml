            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE following Discourse
(which was finish'd above
two months ago, but by
reason of some Intervening Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
found not its way to the
Press) is design'd against the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of a late Author in his book
which bears the Title of <hi>the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. But
the Writer himself is wonderfully
pleased with his Lying hid, and
being No Body. I grant there
may be Reasons why a man may
sometimes conceal his Name, and
not prefix it to the Book he is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb facs="tcp:49159:3"/>
of. But there are some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that are proper and peculiar to
this Writer's circumstances, for
this is perfectly after the Mode of
our late <hi>English Racovian</hi> Writers,
who constantly appear <hi>Nameless,</hi>
and accordingly herein he shews
himself to be of the right <hi>Racovian</hi>
breed. And another good reason
is this (which indeed argues some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Modesty) he would not
set a <hi>Christian Name</hi> before that
book wherein he so grosly abuses
<hi>Christianity,</hi> and renounces the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of it.</p>
            <p>I will not wast time, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Reader and my self about
guessing who this Writer is. Out
of Christian good will and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
I am backward to believe that
he who is vogued to be the Father
of these Extravagant Conceits, is
really so. I will still perswade my
<pb facs="tcp:49159:3"/>
self that there is <hi>an Error of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
upon which account I shall
be more free than otherwise I
should have been.</p>
            <p>But to come to the Book it self;
there was (to express it in the
most Learned and Rhetorical Stile
of our Author himself) a <hi>great
flutter, noise and buz</hi> raised about
it, even while it was yet under the
Printers hands. There were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Factors and Emissaries who
extravagantly extolled it, and it
was observ'd this Applause came
from the <hi>Racovian</hi> quarter. Those
of that way knew before it came
out that it was in favour of their
Cause: whence it was that they
so mightily raised the Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of those they convers'd with,
and highly magnified this Piece be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world had seen it. And
as soon as it was blessed with the
<pb facs="tcp:49159:4"/>
sight of it, their language ran to
an exorbitant heighth: as if <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
had been never known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time of the compiling of
this book. All that went before
this Author were deluded Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and were perfect Strangers
to the Articles of the Christian
Faith, and to Christianity it self.
Now is risen up an Infallible
Teacher: all must obsequiously
repair to this Great Oracle. Now
the <hi>Socinians</hi> have another Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
now they look brisk upon it,
and the day is their own. Now
Converts come in apace, and the
Youth begin to have a <hi>Polonian</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect:
and in a short time we shall
have a Brood of <hi>Socinians,</hi> we shall
be stock'd with Young <hi>Racovians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to let you into the whole
Project, this is the short account
of it, <hi>Socinianism</hi> was to be erected
<pb facs="tcp:49159:4"/>
at this time (they can stay no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)
and in order to that all hands
are to be employed, <hi>i. e.</hi> all that
they can get. Among others they
thought and made choice of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
who they knew would be
extraordinarily useful to them;
and he it is probable was as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to be made use of by
them, and presently accepted of
the Office which was assigned him.
Now, thinks he, I had best to
make use of this opportunity, and
to set up for a <hi>Divine.</hi> Not only
<hi>the Illiterate bulk of mankind, but
their Reverences and Right Reverences</hi>
(to use the words of <hi>a</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The Exceptions of Mr. <hi>E.</hi> against the <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> 
               <hi>Writer of
our own Brotherhood</hi>) shall come to
Me to have their understandings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
<pb facs="tcp:49159:5"/>
for we have but a sorry
unthinking sort of <hi>Teachers</hi> now a-days,
whether they be Conformists
or otherwise: I could never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of their <hi>Systematick</hi> genius,
their doating upon <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,</hi>
and rendring our Faith
cumbersom and burdensom. It
may be even these men will give ear
to what a <hi>Thoughtful Musing</hi> Man
dictates to them, though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>think</hi> themselves, but take all
upon trust, and swallow <hi>Epistles</hi>
and <hi>Gospel</hi> together. I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to such a heighth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of knowledg that I am able
to instruct these people after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
rate. I must tell them
(which I know they will look ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
strangely upon) that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
when they wrote the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
to their Christian Converts,
designed not to trouble their heads
<pb facs="tcp:49159:5"/>
with any <hi>Articles</hi> or <hi>Truths</hi> that
were necessarily to be believed,
they only dropt a few <hi>Occasional</hi>
Documents. And it may be now
and then that <hi>One Article</hi> which I
have propounded to the world
may be hook'd in by the by: but
that is no place to look for any Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and Fundamental Truth of
Christianity, which is absolutely to
be believ'd by us.</p>
            <p>This seems to be Novel Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and so indeed it is, for I have
the honour to be the first famous
Inventer of it; but I doubt not
but in a short time I shall not only
propagate this, but the <hi>Cause</hi> to
which it is subservient, in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
manner. To this purpose I
will carry it cunningly: whilest
the <hi>Double-Column'd Prints</hi> are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and in a down-right way advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Cause, I will do as much
<pb facs="tcp:49159:6"/>
service under-hand. They look di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
towards <hi>Poland</hi> or <hi>Transyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi>
they publickly profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Followers, but
I'll be upon the Reserve, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
my self that it shall be very
difficult to discover me. I will
make the world believe that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of such a man as <hi>Socinus:</hi>
and if they tell me that I speak his
very language as perfectly as if I
were a Native of <hi>Sienna,</hi> I'll face
them down that I had it not by
fingring of any Socinian Authors,
but by a kind of <hi>Natural Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, this cause must be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on, and I can do it as well as
any man by maintaining that there
is but <hi>One Article of Christian Faith
necessarily to be believ'd to make a man
a Christian,</hi> necessarily to be believ'd
in order to salvation. For if there
<pb facs="tcp:49159:6"/>
be but One Point necessary to be
believ'd, then the doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Trinity,</hi> concerning the
<hi>Incarnation</hi> and <hi>Divinity of Christ,</hi>
concerning his <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> &amp;c. are
rendred unnecessary as to the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us Christians. And this I will
shove on under the colour of being
serviceable to <hi>the bulk of Mankind,</hi> of
being obliging and merciful to the
<hi>Multitude</hi> and <hi>Rabble,</hi> and <hi>Poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi>
though (to say the Truth) I
shew my self to be so far from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
the Multitude that I do them
an infinite deal of Mischief. Yet
if I compass my End, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and I care for no more.
And my End is this, to hale in
<hi>Socinianism</hi> after a new man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>You see what the <hi>Musing</hi> of this
Gentleman comes to: and I was
so unhappy a man as to find it out,
<pb facs="tcp:49159:7"/>
to take notice of it, and to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it to the world in a late <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
which I publish'd: and
thereby I have extremely exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
this New Undertaker and
his Adherents. I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at it, for now their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
are laid open, their
<hi>Racovian</hi> Plot is detected, and
all their Measures are thereby
broken.</p>
            <p>But to keep up their hearts, a <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
(as it is call'd) of this Treachery
is publish'd by him who was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be the Chief Tool in this
work. Here he makes it his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to defend his New Paradox,
and to shore his Notion up again
with some crazy props. Through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole he is pleas'd to
Criticize with some Magisteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alness
and Pertness on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
which I made on his
<pb facs="tcp:49159:7"/>
book. And now it is my turn
again to be Critick, and I shall
discharge the Task with all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality
and integrity. It is true,
there is nothing of any Moment,
nothing Weighty and Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
in what he hath offered,
and therefore some in whose
Judgment I could confide, would
have prevailed with me to add
no more on this Subject, which
they were perswaded I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sufficiently cleared: but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to shew somewhat further
the great Danger and Mischief
of this Writer's Opinion, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to prevent the Seduction of
some well-meaning persons who
may be apt to be led away by
his smooth Pretences, (for though
his Cavils and Evasions be weak,
yet they may chance to light
into the Hands of some Weak
<pb facs="tcp:49159:8"/>
Readers, such as are not well
establish'd in their notions:
Wherefore not on the account
of his Petty Objections, but for
the sake of these persons I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assume
this Argument) and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to lay open the Wilful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
and Gross Dissimulation
(as I take it) of this Writer,
and partly to gratifie those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
expectations who with some
impatience seem to long for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
I have once again undertaken
to employ the Press upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
But the Chief and Principal
Design, as well as Motive, of my
appearing again in this Cause is to
assert and defend the <hi>Christian Faith</hi>
which this Author hath misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
maim'd and abused. To
which purpose I will set before
the Reader the Heads of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Vindication,</hi> and in the face
<pb facs="tcp:49159:8"/>
of the world make it appear how
falsly and perfidiously he hath act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Cause of Religion. And

Unreasonable Opinions
CONFUTED.</head>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>The first General Charge against the Late
Writer, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>he unwarrantably
crowds all the Necessary Articles of
Faith into One,</hi> with a design of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<hi>Socinianism.</hi> He endeavours
to shift off the Enditement, but is cast
by his own words. His wilful mistake
about the Article of the <hi>Deity.</hi> He
labours in vain to split One Article
into Two. It is shew'd that besides the
bare believing of <hi>Jesus to be the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi>
it is necessary to know and believe
the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby Sin and
Death entred into the World, and were
derived to his posterity. It is necessary
to know and believe <hi>Who</hi> the <hi>Messias</hi> is;
whether he be God or Man, or both: on
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49159:10"/>
which will follow the necessary belief of
the Holy <hi>Trinity.</hi> It is requisite to have
a right conception concerning our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery</hi>
and <hi>Restauration</hi> by the <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
i. e. to know what he undertook and
did for us, and to be acquainted with
the Great <hi>Privileges</hi> bestow'd upon us
by him. It is of necessity to believe what
the <hi>Messias</hi> requires of Vs. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
matter of our belief, that our
Salvation springs from the mere Favour
and Grace of God through <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi>
and not from any works or merits of
ours. It is indispensably requisite, that
we believe the Doctrin of the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
of the <hi>Final Judgment,</hi> and of
<hi>Eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Will now betake my self to the
Task which is before me, after I
have told the Reader, that I intend
not to imitate our Nameless Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
in his Childish Flourishes, in his
Spruce and Starched Sentences, and in
his Impotent Jestings, which are sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up and down his <hi>Vindication.</hi> Nor
will I follow him in his Impertinencies
and Incoherencies, in his trifling Excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
to eke out his two sheets and a
half. I will not resemble him in his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49159:10"/>
Little Artifices of evading, in his weak
and feeble Struglings with a Strong
Truth. I will not personate him in the
Confusion and Disorder of his Reply,
for it seems he had forgot, that it is one
sign of a <hi>Well-bred, a Well-taught Man,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Mishn. Tract. Avoth. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>to answer to the first in the first place,</hi>
and so in order. I will not imitate him
in his Dry Common Places, in his Set
of Words and Phrases, of Sayings and
Apothegms, which would have serv'd
on any other occasion, as the Intelligent
Reader cannot but take notice. Much
less will I comply with him in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
fits and Passionate Ferments, which,
tho he strives to palliate, are easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible,
for he feels himself Wounded,
and is not able to disguise it. I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
my self, I say, to the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
with great application and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
fully making good my <hi>Former
Charges</hi> against his Book, and clearing
my own from those sorry Objections
and Cavils which he hath since rais'd
against it. In the whole management
I will sincerely acquaint the Reader first
with <hi>his own words,</hi> and then offer my
Refutation of them: and all along I will
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49159:11"/>
be careful to banish all Indecent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections;
unless those shall be counted
such which are purely grounded on his
own expressions, and which his Freedom
of Language necessarily and unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
administers to me.</p>
               <p>The Main <hi>Charges</hi> are these. 1. That
he unwarrantably crowded all the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Articles of Faith into <hi>One,</hi> with
a design of favouring <hi>Socinianism.</hi>
2. That he shew'd his good will to
this Cause by interpreting those Texts
which respect the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> after
the Antitrinitarian mode. 3. That he
gave proof of his being <hi>Socinianiz'd</hi> by
his utter silence about <hi>Christ's satisfying
for us,</hi> and purchasing Salvation by
vertue of his Death, when he designed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
undertook to enumerate the <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages</hi>
and <hi>Benefits</hi> which accrue to
mankind by Christ's coming into the
World. And in the making good of
these Particular Charges, I shall (as I
did before) evidence to the World that
this Writer hath not only a design to
cherish <hi>Socinianism,</hi> but at the same
time to make way for <hi>Atheism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I begin with the First, on which I
will enlarge more than on any of the
rest; because it comprehends in it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49159:11"/>
other Particulars, and because in
discussing of this, I shall have opportunity
to lay open the Sophistry and Dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of this <hi>Vindicator,</hi> and likewise to
discover to the Reader how Mischievous
and Pernicious his Design is. First, it
is observable that this Guilty Man
would be shifting off the Enditement
by excepting against the <hi>formality of the
Words,</hi> as if such were not to be found
in his Book. But when doth he do
this? In the close of it, when his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was exhausted, and he had nothing
else to say, <hi>Vindic.</hi> p. 38. Then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
himself of this Salvo, whereas he
had generally before pleaded to the
formal Enditement, and had thereby
owned it to be True. And indeed he
can do no other, for it was the main
work he set himself about to find but
<hi>One Article</hi> of Faith in all the Chapters
of the four <hi>Gospels</hi> and the <hi>Acts of the
Apostles:</hi> and accordingly he over and
over again declares, that there is but
that One Truth (viz. <hi>Iesus is the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>)
<hi>necessarily to be assented to by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
or (as he sometimes words it) <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
required to make a man a Christian,
or a member of Christ. This is the SOLE
Doctrin press'd and requir'd to be believ'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49159:12"/>
in the whole tenour of our Saviour's and his
Apostles preaching.</hi> p. 192. of his <hi>Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of Christianity.</hi> And again in
the same place. <hi>This was the ONLY
Gospel Article of Faith which was Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them.</hi> This he often inculcates,
having left out several considerable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
in the very <hi>Gospels,</hi> and having
thrown aside the <hi>Epistles,</hi> as if they
were no part of the New Testament,
hoping that some of his Readers would
be bubbled by this means.</p>
               <p>And when I told him of his <hi>One Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi>
he knew well enough that I did
not exclude the Article of the <hi>Deity,</hi>
for that is a Principle of <hi>Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
whereas, I only took notice of
his passing by and wholly omitting
those points which are <hi>Evangelical.</hi> Yet
he willfully mistakes me in this, p. 27. of
his <hi>Vindication,</hi> and saith he doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the necessary belief of a <hi>Deity,</hi> or <hi>One
only True God;</hi> and so the belief of the
<hi>Messias</hi> with that makes Two Articles.
Thus he would perswade the Reader,
that I misunderstood him, and that I
tax'd him with setting up One Article,
when he acknowledges two. But the
Reader sees his Shuffling; for my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
did not treat (neither doth his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49159:12"/>
Book run that way) of Principles of
<hi>Natural Religion,</hi> but of the <hi>Revealed
one,</hi> and Particularly the <hi>Christian.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
this was it which I taxed him
with, that of all the Principles and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Christianity he chose out but
<hi>One</hi> as necessarily to be believed to make
a Man a Christian.</p>
               <p>And though since he hath tried to
split this One into two, p. 28. yet he
labours in vain, for <hi>to believe Iesus to be
the Messias</hi> amounts to the same, with
<hi>believing him to be a King or Ruler,</hi> his
being <hi>Anointed (i. e.</hi> being the <hi>Messias</hi>)
including that in it. Yet he hath the
Vanity to add in great Characters,
THESE ARE ARTICLES, as if
the putting them into these <hi>Great Letters</hi>
would make one Article two. Such is
the fond fancy and conceitedness of the
Gentleman, whereas in other places he
hath formally declared, that there is
but <hi>One Article</hi> that is the necessary
Matter of Faith. This I had just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to except against; and now I will
give a farther account of my doing so,
by shewing that, besides that One Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Principle or Article which he
so often mentions, there are <hi>Others</hi> that
are as necessarily to be believed to make a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49159:13"/>
Man a <hi>Christian,</hi> yea to give him the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
of a <hi>Believer,</hi> in the sense of
the Gospel. Several of these I particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
but barely enumerated in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Discourse,</hi> and now I will distinctly
insist on the most of them, and let the
Reader see, that it is as necessary for a
Convert to Christianity to give assent to
<hi>them,</hi> as to that other he so frequently
specifies.</p>
               <p>This Proposition, that <hi>by one man sin
entred into the World, and death by sin:</hi>
and this which follows, <hi>Death passed
upon all men, for as much as all men have
sinned,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. and that other,
that even <hi>the Regenerate</hi> (for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
speaks of himself and the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Ephesians) <hi>are by nature the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of wrath, as well as others,</hi> Eph. 2. 3.
these, I say, are as absolutely necessary
to be known, assented to, and believed,
in order to our being <hi>Christians</hi> as this
Proposition, <hi>Iesus is the Messias, or Sent
of God.</hi> For I ask, what was the end
of his being sent? Was it not to Help
Mankind, to rescue and deliver them
from some Evil? And where can we be
inform'd concerning the Rise and Nature
of this Evil, but in the Sacred and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Writings? And do not these
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49159:13"/>
foresaid Texts, which we find in St.
<hi>Paul's Epistles,</hi> acquaint us with the
true Source and Quality of our condition
by nature? Do they not discover the
Root of Mans Misery, <hi>viz.</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy
of <hi>Adam</hi> (for he is that <hi>one Man</hi>)
and the dreadful Consequences of it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Wrath?</hi> And is
this set down to no purpose in these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
<hi>Epistles?</hi> Is it not requisite that
we should know it and believe it?
Yea, is not this absolutely requisite? For
it is impossible any one should firmly
imbrace, or so much as seriously attend
to the Doctrin of the <hi>Messias,</hi> unless he
be persuaded that <hi>He stands in need of
him.</hi> And can he be persuaded of this
unless he be acquainted with his Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
and Miserable State, his univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Depravity and innate Proness to what
is Vitious, and with the true Original of
it? <hi>viz.</hi> The voluntary Defection and
Fall of our First Parents, and with that
the loss of our Happiness. The word
<hi>Messias</hi> is an insignificant term till we
have a belief of this: Why then is there
a Treatise published to tell the World,
that the bare belief of a <hi>Messias</hi> is all
that is required of a Christian?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49159:14"/>
Again, it is not only necessary to
know that <hi>Iesus is the Messias,</hi> but also
to know and believe <hi>who</hi> this <hi>Iesus,</hi> this
<hi>Messias</hi> is, <hi>viz.</hi> whether he be <hi>God</hi> or
<hi>Man,</hi> or both. For every one will grant
that there is a Vast Difference between
the one and the other, as much as there
is betwixt Infinite and Finite; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that we may have a due apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
concerning the <hi>Messias,</hi> it is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary, that we should believe him
to be what he is declared to be in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Writings, <hi>viz. God,</hi> as well as
<hi>Man. The Word was God,</hi> John 1. 1.
<hi>The Word was made Flesh,</hi> v. 14. And
this <hi>Word</hi> is <hi>the Only begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
in the same Verse. <hi>God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in the Flesh,</hi> 1. Tim. 3. 16. He is
called not only <hi>God</hi> in these places, and
in several others, but he is stil'd <hi>the
True God,</hi> 1 John 5. 20. and <hi>the Great
God,</hi> Tit. 2. 13. <hi>The Lord of all,</hi> Acts
10. 36. <hi>God blessed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9. 5.
Hence we must conclude, that there is
a necessity of believing the <hi>Messias</hi> to be
<hi>the very God,</hi> of the same Essence with
the Father and the Holy Ghost, for these
are the two other <hi>Persons</hi> included in the
Deity. So that hence it will follow, that
it is requisite to believe the Holy <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49159:14"/>
i. e. that there are in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
Three Persons, Father, Son and
Holy Ghost; which is the Doctrin that
our Saviour himself taught (and he
taught it, that it might be <hi>believed</hi>)
<hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. where the Celebration of
<hi>Baptism,</hi> which is a solemn part of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship, is commanded to be <hi>in
the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> who are <hi>One God,</hi>
1 John 5. 7. <hi>These Three are One,</hi> one
Essence or Being, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> imports.
Those words of the Apostle are obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
1 <hi>Cor. 1. 13. Were ye baptised in
the name of Paul?</hi> As much as to say,
<hi>Baptism</hi> is in the name of <hi>God,</hi> and not
of a Man: Therefore when it is said,
<hi>Go and Baptize in the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> it is included, that
these Three are <hi>God, i. e.</hi> Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of one and the same Deity. Thus
it is manifest, that the believing of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>'s
being the <hi>Messias,</hi> or <hi>Anointed</hi> is
not sufficient to make a Man a Christian
Believer, but he must further believe
these Propositions or Articles, <hi>viz.</hi> that
the Son of God was made flesh, <hi>i. e.</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
our Human Nature; that Christ
is True God; that He with the Father
and the Spirit are One God; for these
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49159:15"/>
are not only expressed in the <hi>Gospels</hi>
and <hi>Epistles</hi> (out of both which we are
to gather the Fundamental Articles of
Faith) and consequently are to be assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to by all Christians, but the very
Nature of the thing it self dictates that
we ought to have a firm belief of these
Truths; for otherwise when a Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
his belief in the <hi>Messias,</hi> he is yet
ignorant of the <hi>Person</hi> he pretends to
believe in. He doth not know whether
he believes in a <hi>God</hi> or in a <hi>Man,</hi> or to
which of these he is beholding, for the
Good he looks for by the Messias's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Now, Sir, you with your <hi>Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness
of Christianity,</hi> what do you
think of this? Is it not reasonable that
a Christian should (as the Apostle speaks
of himself) <hi>know whom he hath believed?</hi>
2 Tim. 1. 12. Nay, is it not indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
necessary, that he should know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be a <hi>Divine,</hi> or <hi>Human,</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi>
Power that he is obliged to, that
so he may accordingly proportion his
Affections and Service? for (what ever
the late Set of Socinians hold) there
must be a <hi>difference</hi> made between the
Homage which is paid to a Creature
(such as they declare Christ to be) and
that which is due only to the Creator.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49159:15"/>
I will refer the Reader to the Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Bishop <hi>Pearson</hi> on the Second Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the <hi>Creed,</hi> where he shews, <q>the
<hi>Necessity of our believing Christ to be the
Eternal Son of God, and God himself,</hi>
1. For the directing and confirming of
our Faith concerning the <hi>Redemption</hi> of
Mankind. 2. For the right informing
of us about that <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi>
which are due to him. 3. For giving us
a right apprehension, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a due value of the <hi>Infinite Love</hi> of
God the Father in sending his Only-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Son into the World to die for
us.</q> Thus this Judicious Writer. But
our Nameless Author would persuade us,
that there is no necessity of believing
any such thing.</p>
               <p>Then in the next place, we are to
have a right conception concerning our
<hi>Recovery</hi> and <hi>Restauration</hi> by this <hi>Messias,</hi>
who is God-Man. And here those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Scriptures will furnish us with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
<hi>As by the offence of one, judgment
came upon all men to condemnation, even
so by the righteonsness of one the free gift
came upon all men unto justification of life.
For as by one mans disobedience many were
made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall
many be made righteous,</hi> Rom. 5. 18, 19.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49159:16"/>
                  <hi>He appeared to put away sin by the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of himself,</hi> Heb. 9. 26. <hi>Christ was once
offered to bear the sins of many,</hi> Heb. 9. 28.
<hi>Christ hath once suffered for sins, the just
for the unjust,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18. <hi>He gave
himself a Ransom for all men,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 6.
<hi>Ye are redeemed with the precious blood of
Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. And to it is
prefix'd <hi>ye know,</hi> to let us understand
that this Article is to be known and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to. <hi>We are bought with a price,</hi>
1 Cor. 6. 20. and 7. 23. <hi>We are reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
unto God by the death of his Son,</hi>
Rom. 5. 10. <hi>By him now we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Atonement,</hi> v. 11. <hi>By one offering he
hath perfected for ever them that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
Heb. 10. 14. <hi>It behoved Christ to
suffer, and to rise from the dead the third
day,</hi> Luk. 24. 46. <hi>Christ must needs have
suffered, and risen again from the dead,</hi>
Acts 17. 3. <hi>He was taken up into heaven,
and sat on the right hand of God,</hi> Mark
16. 19. These and the like places afford
us such Fundamental and Necessary
Doctrins as these are, that by and for
the Meritorious Righteousness and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Christ (the Second <hi>Adam</hi>) we
are accounted Righteous and Obedient
in the sight of God: That Christ was
a Sacrifice for us, and suffered in our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49159:16"/>
stead: That he satisfied Divine Justice
by paying an Infinite Price for us; That
by vertue of that Payment all the Debts,
<hi>i. e.</hi> all the Sins of Believers are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
absolved: That hereby the anger
of the Incensed Deity is pacified, and
that we are entirely Reconciled to him:
That we have an assurance of all this
by Christ's rising from the dead, and
ascending triumphantly into Heaven.
These are <hi>Principles of the Oracles of
God,</hi> Heb. 5. 12. These are part of the
<hi>Form of sound words,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 13. which
are indispensable Ingredients in the
<hi>Christian Faith,</hi> which you may know
by this, that if a man be obliged to the
belief of the Messias's Coming, it is
undeniably requisite that he should know
<hi>what</hi> the Messias came to do for him,
and that he should firmly yield assent to
it. This I think no Man of Reason
will deny: and then it will follow that
these Articles which I have last mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
are the Necessary and Unexceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
object or matter of the Faith of a
Christian Man. And here likewise it
were easie to shew, that <hi>Adoption, Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
Pardon of Sins,</hi> &amp;c. which are
Privileges and Benefits bestowed upon us
by the <hi>Messias,</hi> are necessary matters of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49159:17"/>
our Belief, for we can't duly acknowledge
him for our Benefactor and Saviour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we believe, that these Great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
are confer'd upon us.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is of undoubted necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in order to our being <hi>Christians,</hi> that
we know and believe what the <hi>Messias
requires of us;</hi> which is contained in such
general Texts as these, <hi>That ye being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
out of the hands of your enemies
may serve him</hi> (Christ our Deliverer)
<hi>without fear, in holiness and righteousness
before him all the days of our life,</hi> Luke
1. 75. <hi>The grace of God which bringeth sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
teacheth us, to deny ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and worldly lusts,</hi> &amp;c. Tit. 2. 11, 12.
<hi>He gave himself for us, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redeem
us from all iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. Tit. 2. 14.
<hi>This is the will of God, even your sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
1 Thess. 4. 3. <hi>Without Faith it
is impossible to please God,</hi> Heb. 11. 6.
<hi>Without holiness no man shall see the
Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. Which places yield
us such Propositions as these, that the
<hi>Messias</hi> who vouchsafed to come into the
world to redeem lost Man, requires of
him universal Holiness and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the abandoning of all sin and
ungodliness: That it was one grand
end and design of Christ's visiting the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49159:17"/>
would to redeem men from their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to sanctifie their Natures, and to
make them entirely godly, sober and
righteous in their Lives: That without
these there is no Salvation, no Seeing of
God in the regions of Glory, no hopes
of Everlasting Happiness. The disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
of these <hi>Articles</hi> hath made so
many Sorry <hi>Christians</hi> as we see every
where, such as lay claim to that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<hi>Title,</hi> but are regardless of that
Holiness which should accompany it.
We must not only believe that <hi>Iesus is
the Messias,</hi> but we must believe this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that we can have no Benefit by this
Messias unless we by Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
adhere to him.</p>
               <p>Neither is this enough, it is further
matter of our Belief, as we are <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
that our Salvation springs from the
mere Favour and Bounty of God through
his Son <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and that this is the
only source of that Happiness which we
expect. <hi>By grace we are saved, through
faith, and that not of our selves: it is the
gift of God, Eph. 2. 8. Not by works of
righteousness which we have done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Mercy he saveth us, Tit.</hi> 3. 5.
Where there is not this perswasion and
belief, the true notion of <hi>Christianity</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49159:18"/>
and the conceit of <hi>Merit</hi> comes in
its room: Wherefore there is a Necessity
that we believe and be perswaded aright
as to this matter. We are Worthless
Creatures of our selves, but there is a
Worthiness derived to us from the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted
and Meritorious Righteousness of
him that is the Eternal Son of God. He
that knows not this, he that believes
not this deserves not the Name of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi>
I should have been glad to have
found something of this nature in this
<hi>Gentleman's Christianity.</hi> But he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to seduce his Readers by other
apprehensions, he tells them that the
bare assenting to this, that <hi>Iesus is the
Messias,</hi> is the Summ Total of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, and the Gospel requires no
more.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The doctrines of the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
of the <hi>Final Iudgment,</hi> and of
<hi>Eternal Glory in heaven</hi> are contained in
such passages of the New Testament as
these, <hi>Christ will raise up his at the last day,
Iohn 6. 44. The Lord Iesus Christ shall
judge the quick and the dead at his appearing,
2 Tim. 4. 1. Father, I will that they
whom thou hast given me, be with me where
I am, that they may behold my glory,
Iohn</hi> 17. 24. And are not these
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49159:18"/>
Truths the proper Object of our <hi>Faith</hi>
now under the Gospel, they so peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
belonging to the doctrine and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the <hi>Messias?</hi> Can we believe in
him, and yet not believe these Great
things which are brought to light by his
preaching the Gospel? For though they
were in some measure discovered and
revealed before (<hi>i. e.</hi> the General Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
concerning a Future State, and
the Endless Happiness accompanying it
was not unknown) yet <hi>Christ's</hi> Words
and those of the <hi>Apostles</hi> do more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
assure us of the truth of them:
especially Christ's Rising from the dead
and ascending into Glory have irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gably
confirmed the reality of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that of St. <hi>Peter, We are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
again unto a lively hope by the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Iesus Christ from the dead, to an
Inheritance incorruptible and undefiled,
and that fadeth not away, reserved in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for us, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Who but the
<hi>Vindicator</hi> could imagine that these
Evangelical Doctrines are <hi>not Necessary
Matter of Faith</hi> to Christian Men? Who
but he could fancy and (which is more)
publickly assert that the belief of the
<hi>Messias's</hi> being sent from God, without
being acquainted with his gracious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49159:19"/>
as to our <hi>Future Rewards,</hi> is
all that is required as necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
a <hi>Christian Believer?</hi> Especially,
when it is said, <hi>He that comes unto God
must believe that he is a Rewarder, Heb.</hi>
11. 6. Observe it, <hi>he must believe:</hi>
then it is not indifferent, but a <hi>Necessary</hi>
Article of faith.</p>

               <p>The foresaid Articles and Doctrines are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be <hi>Necessary</hi> matter of Christian
Faith. Not that a man is supposed
<hi>Actually</hi> to exert his Assent and Belief

Christians, <hi>All</hi> these Fundamental
Truths must be imbraced, and none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.
The late Writer's <hi>forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
It is prov'd that he grounds his
notion of <hi>One Article</hi> upon the Weakness
of Vnderstanding and Capacity in the
Generality of people. Herein he follows
the Steps of the <hi>Racovians,</hi> who submit
the greatest Mysteries to the judgment of
the Vulgar; and, if they will not bear
that Test, reject them. The Doctrine
of the <hi>Trinity</hi> how said to have no <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty</hi>
in it. It contains in it no <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</hi>
This Proposition, <hi>Jesus is
the Messias</hi> is not more intelligible than
any of the Articles before mentioned.</p>
               <p>THUS I have briefly set before the
Reader those <hi>Evangelical Truths,</hi>
those <hi>Christian Principles</hi> which belong
to the very Essence of Christianity. I
have proved them to be such, and I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49159:20"/>
have reduced most of them to certain
<hi>Propositions,</hi> which is a thing the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi>
call'd for, <hi>p.</hi> 16. If what I have
said will not content him, I am sure I
can do nothing that will. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if he should capriciously require
any thing more, it would be as great
Folly in me to comply with it as it is in
him to move it. From what I have
said it is evident that he is grosly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
when he saith, <hi>Whatever doctrines
the Apostles required to be believed to make
a man a Christian, are to be found in those
places of Scripture which he hath quoted in
his book, p.</hi> 11. The places which he
quotes are made use of by him to shew
that there is but <hi>One Article</hi> of Belief,
<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Christ is the Messiah:</hi> but I
think I have sufficiently proved that there
are Other Doctrines besides That which
are requir'd to be believed to make a
man a Christian. Why did the Apostles
<hi>write</hi> these Doctrines? Was it not that
those they writ to might give their <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
to them? Nay, did they not require
Assent to them? Yes, verily, for this is to
be proved from the Nature of the things
contained in those Doctrines, which,
were such as had <hi>immediate</hi> respect to
the Occasion, Author, Way, Means,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49159:20"/>
and Issue of their Redemption and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as any impartial judg by examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the several Particular Articles and
Propositions will readily grant. So that
the sum of all amounts to this. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of those things without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of which a man cannot be saved is
absolutely Necessary: but the belief of
the foregoing Particulars is the belief of
such things without the knowledg of
which a man cannot be saved; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the belief of these Particulars is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary. None will be so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory,
I suppose, as to deny the first
Proposition in this Syllogism; therefore
I am to prove the Second, which is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
effected thus. The belief of those
things which have <hi>Immediate</hi> respect to
the Occasion, Author, Way, Means,
and Issue of our Salvation, and which
are necessary for knowing the True Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Design of it, is the belief of such
things without the knowledg of which
a man cannot be saved: but such is the
belief of the preceding Articles, <hi>Ergò.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not without good reason therefore I
call'd them the <hi>Essential</hi> and <hi>Integral</hi>
Parts of our Christian and Evangelical
Faith: And why the <hi>Vindicator</hi> fleers at
these Terms (<hi>p.</hi> 18.) I know no reason
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49159:21"/>
but this that he can't confute the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of them. Surely none but this
Upstart <hi>Racovian</hi> will have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to deny that These Articles of
Faith are such as are Necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
a <hi>Christian,</hi> as to the intellectual
and doctrinal part of Christianity; such
as must in some measure be known and
assented to by him, such as must be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
receiv'd and imbrac'd by him.
Not that a man is supposed every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to <hi>Actually</hi> exert his Assent and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
for none of the Moral Vertues,
none of the Evangelical Graces are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted
thus always. Wherefore, that
Question, <hi>p.</hi> 16. (though he saith <hi>he
asks it seriously</hi>) might have been spared,
<hi>Whether every one of these Fundamentals
is required to be believed to make a Man a
Christian, and such as without the Actual
belief thereof, he cannot be saved?</hi> Here is
<hi>Seriousness</hi> pretended when there is none,
for the design is only to Cavil, and (if
he can) to expose my Assertion. But he
is not able to do it, for all his Critical
Demands are answered in these few
words, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Intellectual (as
well as the Moral) Endowments are
never supposed to be Always in Act:
they are exerted upon Occasion, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49159:21"/>
not all of them at a time. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he mistakes if he thinks, or rather
as he objects without thinking, that
these Doctrine, if they be Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and Necessary, must be <hi>always actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
believed. No man besides himself
ever started such a thing. And why
should not <hi>every one</hi> of these Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Truths (which is another thing he
puts into his Question) be believed and
imbraced? They are in our Bibles for
that very purpose, as I have proved,
and therefore I need not undertake it
again here. Hence it follows that a
man cannot be a <hi>Christian</hi> without the
knowledg and belief of these Truths
which are the <hi>basis</hi> of Religion, the
Standard of the Christian Faith, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Badges and Characters of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Wherefore for any man to make up
Christianity without the belief of these
is a Ridiculous and absurd attempt, and
consequently we may guess that none
would have ventured upon it but this
Writer. This is he that sets up One
Article <hi>with defiance of the rest,</hi> (though
he is much displeased with me for saying
so, <hi>p.</hi> 31.) for what is excluding them
wholly but <hi>defying</hi> them? Wherefore,
seeing he utterly excludes all the rest by
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49159:22"/>
representing them as <hi>Vseless to the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a man a Christian</hi> (which is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of his whole Undertaking) it is
manifest that he <hi>defies</hi> them.</p>
               <p>But let us hear what this Author
pleads for himself. He founds his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of <hi>One Article</hi> partly upon this, that
a Multitude of doctrines is obscure, and
hard to be understood, and therefore he
trusses all up in One Article, that the
<hi>poor people</hi> and <hi>bulk of mankind</hi> may bear
it. This is the Scope of a great part of
his book. But his Memory doth not
keep pace with his Invention, and
thence he saith <hi>he remembers nothing of
this in his book. Vind. p.</hi> 27. This Worthy
Writer doth not know his own Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he uses, as particularly thus,
that he troubies Christian men with no
more but <hi>One Article,</hi> because that is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,</hi>
and all people high and low
may comprehend it. For he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
out (he thinks) a Plain and Easie Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
whereas the others which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
propounded are not generally
agreed upon (he saith) and are dubious
and uncertain. But the believing that
<hi>Iesus was the Messias</hi> hath nothing of
doubtfulness or obscurity in it. This
the Reader will find to be the drift and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49159:22"/>
design of several of his Pages. And
the reason why I did not quote any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
one of them was because he insists on
this so long together, and spins it out
after his way. In p. 301. of his <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity,</hi> where he sets
down the <hi>short, plain, easie and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Summary</hi> (as he calls it) of Religion,
couch'd in a Single Article, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
adds, <hi>The All-merciful God seems
herein to have consulted the poor of this
world, and the bulk of mankind. These are
Articles</hi> (whereas he had set down but
One) <hi>that the labouring and illiterate man
may comprehend.</hi> He assigns this as a
ground why it was God's pleasure there
should be but One Point of Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hereby Religion may be understood
the better, the generality of people may
comprehend it. This he represents as
a Great Kindness done by God to men,
whereas a Variety of Articles would be
hard to be understood. This he enlarges
upon, and flourishes it over after his
fashion, and yet <hi>he desires to know when he
said so, p. 29. Vindic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Good Sir, let me be permitted to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you that your Memory is as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
as your Judgment; for in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Vindication</hi> you attribute it to <hi>the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49159:23"/>
and condescention of the Allmighty that
he requires nothing as absolutely necessary to
be believed but what is suited to Vulgar capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
and the comprehensions of illiterate men,
p.</hi> 30. It is clear then that you found
your <hi>One Article</hi> on this, that it is suited
to <hi>Vulgar capacities,</hi> whereas the Other
Articles mentioned by me are obscure
and ambiguous, and therefore surpass
the comprehension of the Illiterate.
And yet you pretend that you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
that any such thing was said by you:
which shews that you are Careless of
your Words, and that you forget what
you write. What shall we say to such
an Oblivious Author as this? He takes
no notice of what falls from his own pen,
and therefore within a page or two he
confutes himself, and gives himself the
Lye.</p>
               <p>The plain truth is, he <hi>Socinianizes</hi>
here, but will not own it, which makes
him run into these Contradictions. He
follows the steps of his Good Patron
<hi>Crellius</hi> (one of the stiffest <hi>Racovians</hi> that
we have) who throws aside several Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of faith because they are Dark and
Difficult, and not adapted to the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the Vulgar. This very thing he
alledges to set off his Arguments against
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49159:23"/>
the Holy <hi>Trinity, viz.</hi> that<note n="*" place="bottom">De Uno Deo Patre. l. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. c. 1.</note> the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which he maintains is <hi>according to
the understanding of the Vulgar. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people</hi> (he saith) <hi>among the Iews,
the Fishermen did not apprehend the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Three Persons in the Deity: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do the Vulgar Christians at this day
form any such notion:</hi> therefore away
with the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> And
this is the guise and practice of our <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
at this day: it is known that they
are wont to propound this Sacred Point
to the very School-boys (very great
Judges indeed) and to demand their
Resolution of it, and they pretend that
they give it in the Negative. All the
appeal now is to <hi>Vulgar Capacities,</hi> to
the judgment of the <hi>Multitude.</hi> If these
please to allow of any more Articles of
Belief than One, then our Author will
consent to it that we shall have them:
but he acquaints us that <hi>they</hi> are for no
more but <hi>One,</hi> and therefore we must be
content with That. This is his New
<hi>Divinity.</hi> And a<note n="†" place="bottom">The Exceptions of Mr. <hi>E. &amp;c.</hi> examined.</note> 
                  <hi>Socinian</hi> Brother,
who undertakes the defence of his Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
seconds him in this, telling us that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49159:24"/>
                  <hi>the Articles of faith which are generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by Divines are difficult, obscur,
unintelligible, abstruse, but the One Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Mr.</hi> Lock) <hi>is not so,</hi> but is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
calculated for the Vulgar Meridian,
and therefore is the only Authentick and
Necessary Point in the Christian Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
               <p>I think the Reader will bear me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that I have refuted this wild Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
by giving a distinct account of the
Evangelical Doctrines and Articles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, and at the same time
shewing how Intelligible and Plain they
are, and by letting him see the Absolute
Necessity of their being assented to and
embraced by every Christian. No true
Lover of God and Truth need <hi>doubt</hi>
of any of them, for there is no Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
and Doubtfulness in them.
They shine with their own light, and to
an unprejudiced eye are plain, evident
and illustrious. And they would always
continue so if some Ill-minded men did
not perplex and entangle them, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to render them contemptible, yea,
to exclude them wholly from being the
matter of our belief. And as to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which is the Main
Verity which these men set themselves
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49159:24"/>
against, there is not any Difficulty,
much less any Absurdity or Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as they are wont to cry out) in
that Article of our Christian Belief.
Indeed there is a <hi>Difficulty</hi> in this and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Other Truths of the Gospel as to
the <hi>Exact Manner</hi> of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which we shall never be able to
comprehend, at least not on this side of
Heaven: but there is <hi>no Difficulty</hi> as to
the Reality and Certainty of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we know they are Revealed to us
by God in the Holy Scriptures. Nay,
as to the thing it self, thus far we can
apprehend that it is not impossible or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
that the Three Distinct Persons in
the Deity should be One God, for there
may be a Plurality of Persons in the same
Infinite Essence. Every Person doth not
require a Single Particular Essence, or if
they will call the Three Numerical Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistencies
by the name of <hi>Essences,</hi> yet
they are united in One General <hi>Substance</hi>
or <hi>Essence,</hi> which is common to them all.
And when they say it is a <hi>Contradiction</hi>
that One should be Three, which is as
much as to say, One is not One, this is
soon taken off by replying (and that
most truly) that <hi>One and not One</hi> in the
<hi>same respect</hi> is a Contradiction, but <hi>One and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49159:25"/>
not One</hi> in <hi>different respects</hi> is no Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Any smatterer in Logick know, this.
And this is the case here, for tho the Three
Personalities be distinguish'd, and that
really, yet they agree in One Common
Essence, and so the Divinity is both <hi>One</hi>
and <hi>Three</hi> in different respects, on diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
considerations. And this is that
which is abundantly testified in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in the <hi>Gospels</hi> as well as the
<hi>Epistles</hi> (let our Author remember
th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t:) there we learn that the Divine
Essence or Nature is branch'd out into
Three Distinct Persons,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 28. 19. Iohn 10. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Father, Son</hi> and

                  <hi>these three are One.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then as to the Proposition which
this New Modeller of Christianity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
to the World as the only Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Matter of Faith, although he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it is more Intelligible than any of
those that I have named, yet any Judicious
Man cannot but see the contrary, for
this must be explain'd (as well as those)
before his <hi>Vulgar Capacities</hi> can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it. Here first the name <hi>Iesus,</hi>
which is of Hebrew Extraction, though
since Greciz'd, must be expounded, and
so must the Word <hi>Messias</hi> (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:)
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49159:25"/>
And when this is done they
must be told, even according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of a late<note n="*" place="bottom">The Exceptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> examined.</note> Socinian Writer
(whom afterwards I must discourse with
a little) <hi>the manner of his being the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,
such as being conceived by the Holy
Ghost and Power of the most High, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
anointed with the Holy Ghost, his being
raised from the dead, and exalted to be a
Prince and a Saviour.</hi> And then they
must be told for what End and Purpose
this was (or else they can have no true
belief of the <hi>Messias</hi>) under which seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Weighty Truths are comprehended.
And if he doth not agree to this, <hi>viz.</hi>
that the Words must be thus <hi>Opened</hi> and
<hi>Explained,</hi> and fully understood so that
Christian Souls may have the true sense
of them, then he doth as good as say
that the bare pronouncing of these Words
<hi>Iesus is the Messias</hi> is enough to make a
Christian. And we shall be apt to think
that he intends this for a <hi>Charm</hi> or <hi>Spell,</hi>
and that the very Syllables will suffice to
make one a True Believer, especially if
he be one of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> and <hi>Illiterate.</hi>
But it may be he hath something else to
say to an <hi>Other</hi> Rank of Men: Perhaps
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49159:26"/>
he holds that there is one Christianity
for, the <hi>bulk of mankind,</hi> and another
for the Finer and Better Sort of People:
And then it is likely he will tell us of
two Heavens, one very Spacious to hold
the <hi>Multitude,</hi> and the other of a Lesser

the Absurdities (which I confess I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

that this New Notion may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.

               <p>The late Writer's passing by the <hi>Epistles,</hi>
and not collecting any Articles of Faith
out of them shew his <hi>Contempt</hi> of them.
His Evasion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Epistles
were writ to those who were already
Believers,</hi> is proved to be groundless.
If it were true, it is nothing to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
The <hi>Epistles</hi> teach Fundamentals.
His other Evasion, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Articles in the Epistles are
mixed without distinction with other
Truths</hi> discovered to be of no force, and
Retorted upon him. The true Reason
why he went no further than the <hi>Gospels</hi>
and the <hi>Acts.</hi> His other <hi>Excuses</hi> for
rejecting the doctrines contained in
the <hi>Epistles</hi> examined, and found to
be Sophistical. He travels as far as
<hi>China</hi> for <hi>Prudence,</hi> and there borrows
it of the <hi>Missionary Jesuites.</hi> The
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. which he alledges, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizes
him not to impose upon <hi>Weak
Christians.</hi> His Evasions are inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with themselves, and accordingly
not well approved of by the Party. His
Objection about the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi> fully
answered. <hi>Our Church's</hi> Iudgment
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49159:27"/>
concerning the Articles of this Creed.
This Profession of Faith hath several
Articles in it which <hi>Socinians</hi> will not
subscribe to. Whilest he is censuring,
he commits a great <hi>Blunder.</hi> He mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
and misrepresents the Gospel-Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation.</p>
               <p>BUT the Gentleman is not without
his <hi>Evasions,</hi> and he sees it is high
time to make use of them. This puts
him into some disorder, for when he
comes to speak of my mentioning his ill
treatment of the <hi>Epistles</hi> (which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
omitted when he made his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of Articles, or rather when after
all his search he found but One Article)
you may observe that he begins to grow
Warmer than before. Now this Meek
Man is nettled, and you may perceive
that he is sensible of the Scandal that he
hath given to good people by his slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Epistolary</hi> Writings of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Apostles: yet he is so cunning as to
disguise his Passion as well as he can.
He <hi>requires me to publish to the World those
passages which shew his Contempt of the
Epistles, p.</hi> 19. But what need I, Good
Sir, do this, when you have done it
your self? I appeal to the Reader whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49159:27"/>
(after your tedious Collections out
of the <hi>Four Evangelists</hi>) your passing by
the <hi>Epistles,</hi> and neglecting wholly what
the Apostles say in them be not <hi>publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the World your Contempt of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us hear why he did not attempt
to collect any Articles out of these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:
he assigns this as One Reason,
<hi>The Epistles being writ to those who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Believers, it could not be supposed
that they were writ to them to teach them
Fundamentals, p.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>Vindic.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
no man could have conjectured
that he would have used such an Evasion
as this. I will say that for him, he goes
beyond all Surmises, he is above all
Conjectures: he hath a faculty of Shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which no creature on Earth can
ever fathom. Do we not know that
the <hi>Four Gospels</hi> were Writ to and for
<hi>Believers</hi> as well as <hi>Vnbelievers?</hi> Are
we not particularly and expresly told by
St. <hi>Luke</hi> that <hi>he writ his Gospel to the most
Excellent Theophilus? Luk.</hi> 1. 3. whom
all grant to be a <hi>Believing Christian</hi> of
some eminent rank. Or if this Author
be so singular as to question it, he may
be satisfied in <hi>v.</hi> 4. by the Evangelist
himself. And so the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles
we find are dedicated to the same Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49159:28"/>
Believer, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 1. By the same
Argument then that he would perswade
us that the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> are not to be
sought for in the <hi>Epistles,</hi> we may prove
that they were not to be sought for in
the <hi>Gospels,</hi> and in the <hi>Acts,</hi> for even
these were writ to those that <hi>believed.</hi>
And yet it is clear that this Writer did
not make use of this Argument, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he would not have confined the
Fundamentals to the <hi>Gospels,</hi> and the
<hi>Acts.</hi> Here then is want of Sincerity in
a great measure, which hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
heretofore a good qualification
in a Writer.</p>
               <p>Again, granting that the <hi>Epistles</hi> were
all of them writ to those that <hi>already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi>
yet what can this be to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
Must no <hi>Believers</hi> have any <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals</hi>
taught them? What is the
meaning then of 1 <hi>Iohn 2. 21. I have
not written unto you because you know not
the Truth, but because you know it.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
they have <hi>forgot</hi> the Fundamentals,
or have <hi>corrupted</hi> and perverted them?
as was the case of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who
mixed the Law with the Gospal, Legal
Works with Faith; and of the Disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Hebrews</hi> who had received the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Doctrine, but were falling away
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49159:28"/>
from it. Might not the Apostle, yea
did he not in his <hi>Epistles</hi> to these Persons
remind them of the <hi>Great Articles of the
Christian Faith?</hi> Did he not, when he
writ to the <hi>Galatians</hi> assert the doctrine
of Justification through faith in Christ's
Righteousness, without the Works of
the Law? Did he not in his Epistle to
the Wavering <hi>Hebrews</hi> endeavour to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
them in Christianity by displaying
the Excellency and Transcendency of the
<hi>Priesthood</hi> of Christ, by convincing them
of the Efficacy and Perfection of the <hi>One
Sacrifice</hi> of the Messias on the Cross,
whereby the sins of mankind are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Expiated? So <hi>St. Iohn's first Epistle</hi>
was written on occasion of the Christian
Churches (converted from Judaism)
being endanger'd by certain Seducers
that were crept in among them, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
to unsettle their belief concerning
the <hi>Divinity</hi> as well as the Humanity of
our Saviour. Whereupon this Apostle,
who had clearly delivered the doctrine
of the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> in the beginning of his
<hi>Gospel,</hi> now more especially urges that
Principal Article of their Faith the <hi>Deity</hi>
of Christ, <hi>chap. 2. v.</hi> 22, 23. and also in
express words asserts the <hi>Whole Trinity,
chap. 5. v.</hi> 7. Thus it is manifest that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49159:29"/>
the Apostles in their <hi>Epistles</hi> taught <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,</hi>
which is contrary to what
this Gentleman saith, that such a thing
<hi>could not be supposed:</hi> and he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
That as a reason why he did not
look for any Necessary Articles of Faith
in the <hi>Epistles.</hi> But we see how ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
his pretence is.</p>
               <p>Hear another feigned ground of his
omitting the <hi>Epistles,</hi> viz. <hi>because the
Fundamental Articles are here promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and without distinction mix'd with
other Truth.</hi> p. 14. But who sees not
that this is a mere Elusion? for on the
same account he might have forborn to
search for Fundamental Articles in the
<hi>Gospels,</hi> for they do not lie there toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but are dispersed up and down:
the Doctrinal and Historical part are
mix'd with one another: but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to sever them; why the did he
not make a separation between the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
in the <hi>Epistles</hi> and those Other
Matters that are treated of there? He
hath nothing to reply to this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must again look upon what he
hath suggested as a cast of his Shuffling
faculty. Or if he should excuse himself
by saying that Necessary and Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Principles can't be distinguish'd from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49159:29"/>
those other Truths which occur in the
Epistolary Writings, any one may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the insufficiency of such a plea,
because Necessary Truths may be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
from those that are not such by
the Nature and High Importance of
them, by their Immediate respect to the
Author and Means of our Salvation.</p>
               <p>Besides, I suppose this Flourishing
<hi>Scribler</hi> (he knows very well why I give
him that particular Title) will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that the <hi>Epistles</hi> contain divers Rules
of Holy Living, several Religious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
in order to the practise of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and that these are not so <hi>promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and without distinction mixt with other
Truths</hi> but that they may easily be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
from them. Why then may we
not expect to find <hi>Necessary Doctrines of
Faith</hi> in these Writings as well as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
concerning the practise of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and the regulating of our Lives?
And why may we not distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these and the Occasional Matters
as well as between the Others and them?
Nay, it is certain that those Necessary
doctrines of Faith which were but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touch'd upon in the <hi>Gospels</hi> and the
<hi>Acts</hi> are distinctly and fully explain'd in
these <hi>Epistles.</hi> The truth then is that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49159:30"/>
the Gentleman was loth to go any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the former: these latter affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, for he knew either by reading
them or by hear-say, that there were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Other Divine Truths</hi> in them, which
have been generally thought to be Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believ'd in order to making
a man a Christian; but our Author had
no kindness for them. He commands
his Readers not to stir a jot further than
the <hi>Acts. It is not in the Epistles,</hi> saith
he, <hi>that we are to learn what are the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Articles of faith,</hi> p. 295. <hi>They
were written for resolving of doubts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of mistakes,</hi> (as he saith in the
same place) and therefore I forbid you
to seek for <hi>Fundamental doctrines</hi> there,
you will but lose your labour, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
you will meet in these Writings
with several Points which we approve
not of, and therefore must not admit of,
because <hi>Faustus Socinus</hi> hath given us a
charge to the contrary.</p>
               <p>But let us hear further what this <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator</hi>
saith to excuse his rejection of the
Doctrines contain'd in the <hi>Epistles,</hi> and
his putting us off with One Article of
Faith. <hi>What if the Author</hi> (meaning
himself) <hi>design'd his Treatise, as the Title
shews, chiefly for those who were not yet
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49159:30"/>
throughly or firmly Christians: purposing to
work upon those who either wholly disbeliev'd
or doubted of the Truth of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi>
p. 6. Here he comes with his
<hi>what if's,</hi> and gives another palpable
proof of Counterfeiting, and that in
Religion. Now, seeing his Book is sift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the design of it is laid open, he
would make us believe that he intended
his Piece for <hi>Atheists, Turks, Iews</hi> and
<hi>Pagans,</hi> and a few Weak Christians;
for these he must mean by those that
<hi>wholly disbelieve,</hi> and those that are <hi>not
firmly Christians.</hi> And he would bring
in his <hi>Title</hi> to speak for him, but it saith
not a word in his behalf; for how those
that wholly disregard and <hi>disbelieve the
Scriptures</hi> of the New Testament, (as
Gentiles, Jews, Mahometans and all
Atheists do) are like to attend to the
<hi>Reasonableness of Christianity as deliver'd
in the Scripture</hi> is not to be conceived,
and therefore we look upon all this as
mere Sham and Sophistry. He is put
hard to it, and like one a drowning he
fastens on any thing next at hand. That
is his case, as any man may perceive.
But I ask, Why had we not a hint (one
gentle hint at least) of this in all his
Book? It would have been very useful
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49159:31"/>
to the Reader to have been acquainted
with his Design. No: he thinks other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
for in the same Page he saith,
<hi>Would any one blame his Prudence if he
mention'd only those Advantages,</hi> (viz. of
Christ's Coming) <hi>which all Christians</hi>
(especially <hi>Socinian Christians) are agreed
in?</hi> He hath bethought himself better
since he first publish'd his Notions, and
(as the result of that) he now begins
to resolve what he writ into <hi>Prudence.</hi>
I know whence he had this Method
(and 'tis likely he hath taken more than
this from the same hands) viz. from the
Missionary <hi>Iesuites</hi> that went to preach
the Gospel to the people of <hi>China.</hi> We
are told that they instructed them in some
matters relating to our <hi>Saviour;</hi> they let
them know that <hi>Iesus</hi> was the <hi>Messias,</hi>
the Person promised to be sent into the
World, but they conceal'd his <hi>Sufferings</hi>
and <hi>Death</hi> and they would not let them
know any thing of his <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion.</hi>
So our Author (their humble
Imitator) undertakes to instruct the
World in Christianity with an omission
of its <hi>Principal Articles,</hi> and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that of the <hi>Advantage</hi> we have by
<hi>Christ's Death,</hi> which was the Prime
thing design'd in his Coming into the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49159:31"/>
world. This he calls <hi>Prudence:</hi> so that
to hide from the people the Main Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Christian Religion, to disguise
the Faith of the Gospel, to betray Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
it self, is according to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Writer the Cardinal Vertue of
<hi>Prudence.</hi> May we be deliver'd then,
say I, from a <hi>Prudential Racovian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He would clear himself by quoting
<hi>Rom. 14. 1. Him that is weak in the
faith receive ye, p.</hi> 7. as if that Text au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
him to deceive Novices and
Weak Christians; as if because they are
Infirm, therefore he must Strengthen
them by Imposing upon them. It may
be he will say, <hi>Children</hi> must have but
few Lessons given them: but I answer,
there is difference between <hi>few</hi> and
<hi>only One;</hi> and there is difference between
telling them that there is but One, and
afterwards hinting that there are More.
For that must be the meaning of his
<hi>What if he design'd his Treatise chiefly for
those,</hi> &amp;c. What if he first of all tells
them that nothing is absolutely requisite
to be believed but this that <hi>Iesus is the
Messias,</hi> and what if afterwards he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to let them know that something
else is requir'd of them? And yet at the
same time (such is the unaccountable
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49159:32"/>
humour of the Gentleman) he declares
that Nothing more is requir'd of them.
Here is no bottom for any thing he saith.
He contradicts himself, and imposes fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
upon mens minds. he would in
one place (I remember) fancifully please
himself by thinking that <hi>all his sins which
I espie in his book are sins of Omission, p.</hi> 9.
But if this be not one of <hi>Commission</hi> (and
that a very Great one) it is hard to tell
what is. He pretends a <hi>Design of his
Book</hi> which was never so much as
thought of till he was sollicited by his
brethren to vindicate it. But now, (see
how his <hi>Pious Frauds</hi> prosper) when he
hath attempted it, they are displeased
with the way he hath taken. And no
wonder, because they cannot but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that his <hi>Vindication</hi> is inconsistent
with his <hi>Treatise,</hi> and that by these last
Evasions and Collusions he hath in a great
measure betray'd <hi>their</hi> Cause, as well as
that of <hi>Christianity.</hi> I find that they
have only this to excuse him that he did
not take Time enough to consider of
what he Writ: but for my part, I think
that adds to his Fault.</p>
               <p>But this Author of the <hi>New Christianity</hi>
wisely objects that the <hi>Apostle's Creed</hi>
hath none of these Articles and Doctrines
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49159:32"/>
which I mentioned, <hi>p.</hi> 12, 13. Nor
doth any considerate man wonder at it,
for the <hi>Creed</hi> is a Form of outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
which is <hi>chiefly</hi> to be made in the
Publick Assemblies, when Prayers are
put up by the Church, and the Holy
Scriptures are read. Then this <hi>Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of Faith is properly used, or when
there is not generally time or opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to make any Enlargement. But we
are not to think that it <hi>expresly</hi> contains
in it all the Necessary and Weighty
Points, all the Important Doctrines of
our Belief, it being only design'd to be
an <hi>Abstract.</hi> It is with this <hi>Creed</hi> as 'tis
with the <hi>Commandments</hi> and the <hi>Lord's
Prayer.</hi> If a man <hi>doth</hi> not more than is
expresly enjoyned in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> he
can't be said to <hi>Act</hi> as a Christian. If
he <hi>prays</hi> for no more than is expresly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Petitions of the foresaid
<hi>Prayer</hi> he can't be said to <hi>Pray</hi> as a Good
Christian. So if a man <hi>believe</hi> no more
than is in <hi>express</hi> terms in the <hi>Apostle's
Creed,</hi> his Faith will not be the <hi>Faith</hi> of
a Christian. And yet still it is to be
granted that as all things to be <hi>done</hi> and
all things to be <hi>prayed for</hi> are <hi>reducible</hi> to
the Ten Commandments and the Lord's
Prayer, so All matters of Faith in some
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49159:33"/>
manner may be <hi>reduced</hi> to this Brief Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
of Belief. But when I call it an
<hi>Abstract</hi> or <hi>Abbreviature,</hi> it is implied
that there are more Truths to be known
and assented to by a Christian, in order
to making him really so, than what we
meet with here.</p>
               <p>And yet I must take leave to tell our
<hi>Vindicator</hi> that this <hi>Creed</hi> hath more in it
than he and his brethren will subscribe
to. If he were not above <hi>Catechisms</hi> as
well as <hi>Creeds,</hi> I might remind him of
<hi>Our Church</hi>'s judgment concerning the
Articles of this <hi>Creed. Qu. What dost
thou chiefly learn in these Articles of thy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief?
Answ. First, I learn to believe in
God the Father, who had made me and all
the world: Secondly, in God the Son, who
hath redeemed me and all mankind: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in God the Holy Ghost, who sanctifieth
me and all the Elect People of God?</hi> These
are killing words to a Disciple of <hi>Socinus,</hi>
who acknowledges neither the God-head
of the <hi>Son,</hi> nor of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> nor
the <hi>Redemption</hi> or <hi>Sanctification</hi> by either.
Yet our Church, with all the Christian
Churches in the world, owns these
Truths to be contained in the <hi>Apostles
Creed.</hi> And there are other Articles of
this Symbol (let them palliate it as they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49159:33"/>
please,) which the <hi>Racovian</hi> Gentlemen
are unwilling to give their assent to.
They faulter about Christ's <hi>Iudging the
quick and the dead,</hi> they partly deny the
<hi>Resurrection of the body,</hi> they deny <hi>Life
Everlasting</hi> as it respects wicked men,
for they hold that these shall be Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
of all which I may have occasion
to speak another time. At present I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take notice of their lopping off several
Articles from this <hi>Creed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But was it not judiciously said by this
Writer that <hi>it is well for the Compilers of
the Creed that they lived not in my days?
p.</hi> 12. I tell you, Friend, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
they should, for the Learned
<note n="*" place="bottom">Diatr. de Symbol.</note> 
                  <hi>Usher</hi> and<note n="†" place="bottom">De Trib. Symb.</note> 
                  <hi>Vossius</hi> and others have
proved that that <hi>Symbol</hi> was drawn up
not at once, but that some Articles of it
were adjoyned many years after, far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the extent of any man's life; and
therefore the Compilers of the Creed
could not live in my days, not could I
live in theirs: but I let this pass as one
of the <hi>blunders</hi> of our Thoughtful and
Musing Author. Nor had he reason to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49159:34"/>
think that those that made the Apostles
Creed would have been censured by me,
for I have vindicated and asserted their
<hi>Articles,</hi> whereas he and his friends
have new-modell'd the <hi>Creed,</hi> yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
have presented us with One Article
instead of Twelve, and in order to that
have sunk the <hi>Epistles,</hi> because they
are not <hi>Socinianized, all over Sociniani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this Gentleman had said that the
belief of <hi>Iesus</hi>'s being the <hi>Messias</hi> was one
of the first and leading acts of Christian
Faith, he had said right, and none
would have opposed it. If he had said
that the knowledg of the Gospel, and
consequently of the Doctrines of it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
at first by degrees, and shone
brighter after our Saviour's Ascension
than before, he had spoken truth; but
when he positively and peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
that neither at first nor afterwards
there was any Necessity of believing
more than this that <hi>Iesus is the Messias,</hi>
he misrepresents the Gospel-Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and mistakes the nature of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
To stop here, and go no further
is unsufferable. This is as if a <hi>Breeder up
of Children and Youth</hi> should carry them
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49159:34"/>
no further than the A B C. He is
wholly for <hi>reducing</hi> of Christianity,
whereas he should have given it in its
Full and Ample Extent; especially he
should not have kept back any thing of the <hi>Foundation.</hi>

                  <hi>The Christian Faith</hi> which this Gentleman

The <hi>Devils</hi> are capable of a higher
degree of Faith than that which he saith
makes a <hi>Christian.</hi> A brief Idea of the
<hi>Compleat Faith</hi> of a Christian. <hi>The
Danger</hi> of asserting that there is but
<hi>One Article</hi> of Christian belief necessary
to be assented to. This is the way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
<hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Blindness</hi> into
Christendom; and to promote the designs
of that Church which cherishes <hi>Ignorance</hi>
as the Mother of Devotion and Religion.
How far this Writer is instrumental in
it. What care he hath of mens <hi>Souls,</hi>
and of their <hi>Salvation.</hi> It is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of <hi>Socinian</hi> Writers to curtail Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
and to cut off as many Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Articles from it as they can. This
Writer had his Platform from <hi>Crellius.</hi>
He is approved of and applauded by the
<hi>English Socinians.</hi> Three Reasons as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
why the <hi>Socinians</hi> agree to maim
the Heads of Christianity, and to reduce
all into One Article. The Office of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49159:35"/>
was not instituted for the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>One</hi> Article of Faith only.</p>
               <p>IT is likely I shall further exasperate
this Author when I desire the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to observe that this <hi>Lank Faith</hi> of his
is in a manner on other than the <hi>Faith of
a Turk.</hi> For the<note n="*" place="bottom">Azoar 1.</note>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Azoar 67.</note> Alcoran acknowledges
that the <hi>Spirit of God bore witness to Christ
the Son of</hi> Mary: <hi>a Divine Soul was put
into him. He was the Messenger of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and the Word of God.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place <hi>God</hi> is brought in declaring
that <hi>he had sent Christ the Son of</hi> Mary,
&amp;c. And in other places he is mention'd
as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> as a <hi>Great Man,</hi> one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission'd
by God, and <hi>sent by him</hi> into
the world. This is of the like import
with what our good <hi>Ottoman</hi> Writer the
<hi>Vindicator</hi> saith of our Saviour, and this
he holds is the sum of all that is Necessary
to be believ'd concerning him. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi>
call themselves <hi>Musselmen,</hi> of
rather (according to the true account of
the <hi>Arabick</hi> word)<note n="†" place="bottom">From the Arabick verb <hi>islam, credidit,</hi> whence the Mahometan Religion is call'd <hi>Islamisinus.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Moslemim,</hi> i. e. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;</hi>
and what difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49159:36"/>
one of them and our Author's <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever?</hi>
The former believes that Christ
is a Good Man, and not above the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Man, and sent of God to give
Instructions to the world: and the Faith
of the latter is of the very same scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Thus he confounds <hi>Turky</hi> with
<hi>Christendom;</hi> and those that have been
reckon'd as <hi>Infidels</hi> are with him <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
He seems to have consulted the
<hi>Mahometan Bible,</hi> which saith,<note n="*" place="bottom">Alcor. Azoar. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ
did not suffer on the cross, did not die;</hi> for
he and his Allies speak as meanly of <hi>these
Articles</hi> as if there were no such thing.
The Alcoran often talks (particularly
see the <hi>Last Chapter</hi> of it) against Christ's
being <hi>the Son of God by Generation.</hi> It is
one of the First Principles of <hi>Mahometism</hi>
that there is but <hi>One God neither begetting
nor begot.</hi> See <hi>Sulburgius</hi>'s <hi>Saracenica.</hi>
This is it which our Author drives at
when he labours to prove the <hi>Messias</hi> and
<hi>the Son of God</hi> are terms synony mous, as
you shall hear by and by. This reminds
me of that Affinity and Correspondence
which hath been between the <hi>Turks</hi> and
this Gentleman's Party.<note n="†" place="bottom">De Trin. l. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Servetus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
notes with the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> when he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49159:36"/>
undertook to fetch an Argument out of
it to disprove the <hi>Deity</hi> of our Saviour.
It is observable that those Countreys of
<hi>Europe</hi> which border on the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
as <hi>Hungary, Transilvania,</hi> &amp;c.
abound with <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Antitrinitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
The inhabitants of these places ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate themselves to their Potent
Neighbours, they make some approach
to the <hi>Conquerer's Creed.</hi> Some of these
men have lately got footing in <hi>England,</hi>
and because they and the <hi>Great Turk</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
the <hi>Trinity,</hi> therefore we must
all be Proselytes to their opinion. They
are making way for this by taking away
all the Articles of the Christian Faith
but One. And our late Writer is the
Instrument they make use of for this
purpose. This Great Mufti hath given
us a Hopeful Draught of <hi>Christianity;</hi>
and it was fit the English Reader should
know that a <hi>Turk</hi> according to him is a
<hi>Christian,</hi> for he makes the same Faith
serve them both.</p>
               <p>Nay, in the last place, let us take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that this Gentleman presents the
world with a very Ill notion of <hi>Faith,</hi>
for the very <hi>Devils</hi> are capable of all
that <hi>Faith</hi> which he saith makes a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
man,</hi> yea of more, for we read that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49159:37"/>
they <hi>believed Iesus to be the Son of God,</hi>
Mat. 8. 29. They cried out to him, <hi>Thou
art Christ the Son of God,</hi> Luke 4. 41.
which latter words in both places denote
his <hi>Divinity,</hi> as I shall shew afterwards.
But besides this <hi>Historical Faith</hi> (as it is
generally call'd by Divines) which is
giving credit to Evangelical Truths as
barely reveal'd, there must be something
else added to make up the True Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Faith of a <hi>Christian.</hi> With the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Understanding must be joyn'd
the Consent or Approbation of the Will.
All those Divine Truths which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect
assents to must be allow'd of by
this Elective power of the Soul. True
Evangelical Faith is a hearty Accepting
of the Messias as he is offer'd in the
Gospel. It is a sincere and impartial
submission to all things requir'd by the
<hi>Evangelical Law,</hi> which is contain'd in
the <hi>Epistles</hi> as well as the <hi>other Writings.</hi>
And to this Practical Assent and Choice
there must be added likewise a firm Trust
and Reliance in the Blessed Author of
our Salvation. But this late Undertaker,
who attempted to give us a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
account than ever was before of
<hi>Christianity as it is deliver'd in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
brings us no tidings of any such
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49159:37"/>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> belonging to <hi>Christianity,</hi> or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
to us in the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Which
gives us to understand that he verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
there is no such <hi>Christian Faith,</hi>
for in some of his Numerous Pages (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
191, 192, &amp;c.) where he speaks
so much of <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> he might
have taken occasion to insert <hi>one word</hi>
about this Compleat Faith of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Having thus represented how <hi>Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi>
how <hi>Narrow,</hi> how <hi>Erroneous,</hi> how
<hi>Mistaken</hi> this Unknown Writer's <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi>
and especially his <hi>Faith</hi> is; I will
now proceed to shew how <hi>Dangerous</hi> and
<hi>Pernicious</hi> this sort of Doctrine is. Here
is a Contrivance set up for the bringing
in of <hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Barbarism</hi> into the
Christian world. The only Necessary
Point of Belief that the <hi>Old Testament</hi>
delivers, is, according to these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that <hi>there is One God:</hi> and all the
<hi>New Testament</hi> affords us as matter of
Necessary Faith is this, that <hi>Iesus is the
Messias.</hi> Carry but these Two Articles
along with you, and you are a True
Christian. There is no <hi>Necessity</hi> at all of
being acquainted with the Reveal'd Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
concerning the Cause of Mankinds
Degeneracy and Corruption, which gave
occasion to the <hi>Messias's</hi> Coming into the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49159:38"/>
world. There is no Necessity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether this <hi>Messias</hi> be God or Man,
or both: there is no Necessity of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
whether he came to suffer and
dye in our stead, and to satisfie the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Justice, and to purchase Salvation
for us by his Blood: There is no Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of believing that without Faith and
Evangelical Obedience we cannot have
any Benefit by the Messias: There is no
Necessity of being perswaded that our
Salvation springs from the mere Grace
and Bounty of Heaven: There is no
Necessity of believing the Privileges and
Rewards (both here and hereafter)
which are entail'd on Christianity.
There is but a <hi>Single Article of Belief,</hi>
and this is a very Short one too, <hi>viz.</hi>
that <hi>Iesus is the Messias;</hi> and if you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to This you are as <hi>Sound a Christian</hi>
and as <hi>Good a Believer</hi> as this Gentleman
can make you. One would think that
seeing there are so many Branches of the
Evangelical Faith commended to us and
urged upon us by the Apostles in their
Epistles (some of which our Saviour
himself in the Gospel, had made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of) one would think, I say, that a
man that hath a True Sense of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and is a Lover of Souls should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49159:38"/>
to display before the world
these Several Parts of the <hi>Christian Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi>
and should be earnest with men to
embrace them All, and not to omit or
neglect any of them, seeing they all so
nearly concern their Everlasting Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.
But here comes One that makes it
his great business to beat men off from
taking notice of these Divine Truths,
he represents them as wholly Unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believed, he cries down all
Articles of Christian Faith but One. He
at this time of day, when <hi>Christianity</hi> is
so bright, strives to darken and eclipse it;
he hides it from the faces of mankind,
draws a thick Veil over it, will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to look into it, takes the Holy
and Inspired <hi>Epistles</hi> (which are as much
the Word of God as the <hi>Gospels</hi>) out of
their way, and tells them again and
again that a <hi>Christian man</hi> or <hi>Member of
Christ</hi> need not know or believe any more
than that One Individual Point which
he mentions.</p>
               <p>Hear O ye Heavens, and give ear O
Earth, judg whether this be not the
way to introduce <hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi>
into Christendom, whether this be not
blinding of mens eyes, and depriving
them of that Blessed Light which the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49159:39"/>
Writings of the Evangelists and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
should illuminate mens minds with.
Which makes me think sometimes (and
perhaps the Reader doth so too) that
this Writer and the other Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
are Under-hand-Factors for that
Communion (though they would seem
to be much against it) which cries up
<hi>Ignorance</hi> as the mother of Devotion and
Religion. If they had not some such
design, why do they labour so industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to keep the people in Ignorance,
to tell them that One Article is enough
for them, and that there is no <hi>Necessity</hi>
of knowing any other doctrines of the
Bible? Thus by following their <hi>Italian</hi>
Master <hi>Socinus,</hi> they trade for that <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</hi>
And this <hi>Vindicator</hi> among the rest
trafficks very visibly for it whilest he
blasteth so substantial a part of the New
Testament as the <hi>Epistolary</hi> Writings are.
Would not one be apt to suspect that (as
their <hi>Roman</hi> Masters have done) they
would afterwards not only keep a part,
but the Whole Scripture from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
And so we shall travel to <hi>Rome</hi> by
the way of <hi>Racovia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here you may see now what
his Pretences of Love to <hi>the bulk of
mankind</hi> come to. See how Sincere he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49159:39"/>
is in taking care of the <hi>Salvation of their
Souls,</hi> which is a thing that he more
than once mentions, and with some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
(<hi>p. 9. Vindicat.</hi>) on me as if I
disregarded that Great Concern. But
I hope I have in some measure faithfully
discharged that part, though the <hi>Great
Iudg</hi> of heaven and earth knows my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
desiciencies and failings in it; but
I am well satisfied that this Inferior In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitor
cannot charge me with a noglect
in that Great and Important Work,
which I have made the business of my
life. But behold how this Censorious
Gentleman himself manifests his regard
to the <hi>Salvation of peoples Souls</hi> when he
puts out their Eyes, when he studies
how to nurse them up in Ignorance and
Blindness, and thereby to Ruine their
Souls for ever. He can afford them but
One Article out of the Whole New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.
That must suffice them now,
and perhaps afterwards it will be
thought too much.</p>
               <p>Here, before I proceed any further, I
would take notice that the Project of the
Necessity of but One Article of Christian
Belief is the direct Spawn and Product of
<hi>Socinianism,</hi> but improved by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
He that hath convers'd with the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49159:40"/>
                  <hi>Unitarian</hi> Writers is sensible how they
endeavour to cramp our Belief and
Knowledg, and cut off as many Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Articles of Religion as they can.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Socin. de Cognit. Dei. Ostorod.. Instit. cap. 3, 4. Epifeop. Apol. Remonstr.</note> They insist upon this, that the Points
necessary to be known are but <hi>Few:</hi>
they interpret those places of Scripture
which directly speak of <hi>Knowing of God,
i. e.</hi> of knowing his Nature and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
and other matters in Religion
that are to be believed, concerning a
<hi>Practical Knowledge.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Praelect. cap. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Socinus</hi> leads the
way, undervaluing the former sort of
Knowledge, and interpreting <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27.
<hi>seeking the Lord, if haply they may feel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, and find him,</hi> concerning a Holy
Life; whereas the plain scope of the
place will convince any unprejudiced
man that it is spoken of those who being
ignorant of God, labour to throw off
that Ignorance, and to attain to a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of him, in order to their right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping
and serving him. The rest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
this Ring-leader, and accordingly
you may observe that in their <hi>Definitions</hi>
of <hi>Religion</hi> they seldom (or never) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
<hi>Knowledg</hi> as any part of it, but they
wholly define it to be a Living according
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49159:40"/>
to the Divine Precepts and Promises, or
to be the Way to Eternal Life and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
Some of them seem to restrain
that place, <hi>Iohn 17. 3. that they might know
thee the only true God,</hi> &amp;c. unto a Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Knowledg. And in other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
it might be shewed that they very
much disparage the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> Part of
Christianity, and more especially take
care to abbreviate and cut off the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
of it. <hi>Crellius</hi> is much for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing
and reducing the knowledg
and belief of the Articles of Faith. <hi>The
Sacred Writers</hi> (saith<note n="*" place="bottom">De Uno Deo Patre. Sect. 1. cap. 1.</note> he) <hi>when they
speak of that knowledg in which Religion, or
the way to eternal life consists, speak not of
that knowledg whereby any Attribute that is
Essential to God or Christ is known.</hi> Here
is the Platform of our Gentleman's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and thence let the Reader guess
whose part he takes. <hi>Crellius</hi> hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him his Kue, and he very strictly
observes it: No Attribute that is Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to God the Father (as Father) or
Christ the Second Person in the Deity
must come into his Creed, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be
made a Necessary Article of it. And
that the World may know that this is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49159:41"/>
acceptable to the Party, one of them is
chosen out to vindicate this Attempt of
setting up One Article. A<note n="*" place="bottom">The Exceptions of Mr. E. against the <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity</hi> examin'd.</note> Professed
<hi>Socinian</hi> Writer (and no Alien, but true
<hi>English</hi> Breed) undertakes it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds
the Author, and defends his
Work: that it may publickly appear
that this is the doctrine of the <hi>Racovians</hi>
or <hi>Anti-Trinitarians,</hi> and that it was not
only begun to be entertained by the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
and <hi>Outlandish Socinians,</hi> but that
now, when it is fully improved, it is
vouched by the <hi>Modern</hi> and <hi>Native</hi>
ones.</p>
               <p>But what may be the Reason why
both the <hi>Exotick</hi> and <hi>English Unitarians</hi>
agree to maim the Heads of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to contract its Articles, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it into so small a compass? Seeing
there are <hi>Several</hi> Fundamental Truths
appertaining to the Christian Religion,
why are they not all pronounced Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believed and assented to?
They have several reasons for this; first,
they are compell'd to do it because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they can't maintain that which so
many of them profess to believe, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Salvation of all men, of whasoever
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49159:41"/>
Perswasion they are. This is an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Principle which they have taken
up, and it is the Modish Opinion at this
day, but if they should hold that there
is a <hi>Necessity</hi> of believing a considerable
number of Articles in Christianity,
they could not possibly entertain this
Fashionable Notion. Secondly, they cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
keep up this Conceit of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of but One Article, because it makes
for their own Preservation and Safety,
that neither the Magistrate nor Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Power in any Country may take
occasion to animadvert upon them: for
why should they trouble and molest them
for holding such doctrines as are not of
the Foundation of Religion, as are of no
Necessity to be believed? This makes
them forward to propagate their Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And hence also we see what is the
reason of their talking so warmly for <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:</hi>
This is done to Secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that though they broach never so
Pernicious Opinions they may not fall
under the lash of the Magistrate. In
brief, they would not be Punish'd here,
and they think they have made sure of
hereafter by another Tenent of theirs.
Thirdly, by vertue of this Expedient
they can throw off any Doctrine when
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49159:42"/>
they please, especially those Main Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> of <hi>Christ's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
&amp;c.</hi> for it is but saying that
they are not necessary to be believed,
(there being a Necessity of believing but
One) and the business is done. Thus
you see how it is their Concern to hold
up their One Article.</p>
               <p>But who sees not that hereby they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Christianity, and unspeakably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
the Faith of the Gospel? What is the
meaning of <hi>Catechizing,</hi> which hath been
so universally commended and practised
by the Ancients? There were in the
Primitive Church particular persons that
made it their business to instruct and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the ignorant in a <hi>Catechetical</hi> Way:
yea, it was a Distinct Office among the
Christians of old. Saint <hi>Mark</hi> in the
Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was a <hi>Catechist,
Pantaenus</hi> succeeded him, then <hi>Origen</hi>
had the same Employment there,
and <hi>Heraclius</hi> after him. What! was
this only to teach <hi>One Article</hi> of
Faith? Who but a <hi>Socinian</hi> can believe
this? Is it not enough to rob us of our
<hi>God,</hi> by denying <hi>Christ</hi> to be so, but
must they spoil us of all the Other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Christian Faith but One? Who
would think that the Popular Man,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49159:42"/>
who pretends to take such care of the
<hi>Multitude,</hi> should do them the greatest
Mischief imaginable, whilest he makes
a shew of being extraordinarily kind to
them? for a greater Mischief there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be than to put them off with One
Article of Christian Belief, when there
are Many others of absolute necessity.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>This Writer's doctrine tends to <hi>Irreligion</hi>
and <hi>Atheism.</hi> In what terms we may
suppose the <hi>Atheists</hi> congratulate him.
The clipping of the Articles of the <hi>Creed</hi>
is a preparatory to the diminishing of the
Precepts of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> and the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
of the <hi>Lord's Prayer. Obj.</hi> Doth
not the <hi>frequent</hi> mentioning of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
[<hi>Jesus is the Messias</hi>] in the New
Testament; yea, the <hi>sole</hi> mentioning of
it in some places argue that there is no
other Article of Faith which is <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily</hi>
to be believed but this? <hi>Answ.</hi>
No: because 1. the believing of <hi>Jesus</hi> to
be the promised <hi>Messias</hi> was the first step
to Christianity, and therefore is so often
propounded in the Evangelical Writings.
2. Though this <hi>One</hi> Article be mentioned
alone in some places, it is to be supposed
that <hi>other</hi> matters of Faith were at the
same time proposed, though they are not
recorded. 3. We must supply those places
of Scripture where this <hi>One</hi> Article is set
down alone from others which make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Other</hi> Necessary Points of Belief.
4. The clear discovery of the doctrines of
the Gospel was <hi>gradual;</hi> and therefore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49159:43"/>
we must not think that in the <hi>Four
Evangelists</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> are specified all the
Necessary Articles of Faith, but we must
look for some of them in the <hi>Epistolary</hi>
Writings, when the Spirit of God had
further enlightned the Apostles and other
Christians.</p>
               <p>AND now, to prove yet further the
<hi>Pernicious</hi> Nature of his Writings,
doth any man doubt of their Tendency
to <hi>Irreligion</hi> and <hi>Atheisin?</hi> I charge him
not with any such thing as a formal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
of this. (No: I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
such a thought) but I only take
notice how serviceable his Papers and
Opinions are to this purpose. He hath
mightily gratified the <hi>Atheistical</hi> Rabble
by this his Enterprize, and accordingly
we may suppose them in such Words as
these to express their great Obligations
and Thankfulness to him on this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<q>We are beholding to this Worthy
Adventurer for ridding the world of so
Great an Encumbrance, <hi>viz.</hi> that
huge Mass and unweildy Body of
Christianity which took up so much
room. Now we see that it was this
<hi>Bulk,</hi> and not that of <hi>Mankind</hi> which he
had an eye to when he so often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49159:44"/>
this latter. This is a Physician
for our turn indeed: we like this Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Operator that doth not trouble
us with a parcel of Heavy Drugs of no
value, but contracts all into a Few Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
nay doth his business with a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Drop.</hi> We have been in bondage a
long time to <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Catechisms, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stems</hi>
and <hi>Confessions,</hi> we have been
plagued with a tedious Beadroll of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
which our Reverend Divines
have told us we must make the matter
of our <hi>Faith.</hi> Yea so it is, both Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
and Nonconformists (though
disagreeing in some other things) have
agreed in This to molest and crucifie
us. But this Noble Writer (we thank
him) hath set us free, and eas'd us by
bringing down all the Christian Faith
into One Point. We have heard some
men talk of the <hi>Epistolary</hi> Composures
of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> as if Great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were contain'd in them, as if the
great <hi>Mysteries</hi> of Christianity (as they
call them) were unfolded there: but we
could never make any thing of them;
and now we find that this Writer is
partly of our opinion. He tells us
that these are Letters sent <hi>upon occasion,</hi>
but we are not to look for our <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:49159:44"/>
(for now for this Gentleman's sake we
begin to talk of <hi>Religion</hi>) in these places.
We believe it, and we believe that there
is no Religion but in those very <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
and <hi>Verses</hi> which he hath set down
in his Treatise. What need we have any
other part of the <hi>New Testament?</hi> That
is Bible enough, if not too much.
Happy, thrice happy shall this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
be perpetually esteemed by us,
we will Chronicle him as our Friend
and Benefactor. It is not our way to
<hi>Saint</hi> people: otherwise we would
certainly <hi>Canonize</hi> this Gentleman,
and, when our hand is in, his pair of
Booksellers for their being so benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to the World in Publishing so Rich a
Treasure. It was a Blessed Day when
this hopeful Birth saw the light, for
hereby all the <hi>Orthodox Creed-makers</hi>
and <hi>Systematick Men</hi> are ruined for ever.
In brief, if we be for any <hi>Christianity,</hi>
it shall be this Author's, for that
agrees with us singularly well, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so short, all couch'd in four words,
neither more nor less. It is a very
fine Compendium, and we are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
obliged to this Great Reformer
for it. We are glad at heart that <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
is brought so low by this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49159:45"/>
Pen-man, for this is a good presage
that it will dwindle into Nothing. What!
but <hi>One Article,</hi> and that so <hi>Brief</hi> too!
We like such a Faith, and such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
because it is so near to None.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And is not the Reader satisfied that
such language as this hath real Truth in
it? Doth he not perceive that the discar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of all the Articles but One makes
way for the casting off that too? And
may we not expect that those who deal
thus with the <hi>Creed</hi> will use the same
method in reducing the <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
and the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> abbrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the former into One Precept, and the
latter into One Petition? So that not
only our Faith but our Practice and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
shall be crampt. There is as
much reason to do one as the other: and
they that have done the former will in
time, it is no doubt, use the same disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
towards the latter, <hi>i. e.</hi> lop off
some of the Precepts of the Decalogue,
and diminish that Form and Pattern of
Prayer which our Saviour hath left us.</p>
               <p>Thus this Writer sees how sitly his
book of the <hi>Reasonableness of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>was brought into my Discourse
about the Causes and Occasions of Atheism,</hi>
which he seems to wonder at, <hi>p.</hi> 2. It
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49159:45"/>
appears also that if <hi>I gave his book an Ill
Name</hi> (as he complains,) it doth
deserve it, and that it hath not only a
<hi>Socinian</hi> but an <hi>Atheistick Tang.</hi> I
have proved (and shall yet further do it
in this present Undertaking) that he
hath corrupted mens minds, depraved
the Gospel, and abused Christianity.
And is there no <hi>Atheism</hi> in this? To
conclude, if after all he will stand to his
Proposition, and assert there is but One
Article of Faith (just one and no more,
and it is sure there can be no less) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
to be assented to, he may
enjoy his Confident Humour, but it is to
be hoped that there is not any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
number of men in the world that will
admit of such an Unaccountable Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
and forfeit their Reasons merely
to please their Fancy.</p>
               <p>But because I design'd these Papers for
the satisfying of the Readers <hi>Doubts</hi> about
any thing occurring concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before us, and for the establishing of
his wavering mind, I will here (before
I pass to the Second General Head of my
Discourse) answer a <hi>Query</hi> or <hi>Objection</hi>
which some, and not without some shew
of Ground, may be apt to start. How
comes it to pass, they will say, that this
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49159:46"/>
Article of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Iesus is the
Messias</hi> or <hi>Christ,</hi> is so often repeated in
the <hi>New Testament?</hi> Why is <hi>this</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
urged without the mentioning of
any <hi>other</hi> Article of Belief? Doth not
this plainly shew that this is <hi>All</hi> that is
requir'd to be believ'd as Necessary to
make a man a Christian? May we not
infer from the frequent and sole repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Article in several places of the
<hi>Evangelist</hi> and the <hi>Acts</hi> that there is no
other Point of Faith of absolute necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but that this alone is sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
a man a True Member of Christ?</p>
               <p>To clear this <hi>Objection,</hi> and to give a
full and satisfactory Answer to all doubts
in this affair, I offer these ensuing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
which will lead the Reader to
the right understanding of the whole
case.</p>
               <p>1. It must be consider'd that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
of <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the promised <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>
was the <hi>first step</hi> to Christianity;
and therefore This rather than any other
Article was propounded to be believ'd
by all those whom either our Saviour or
the Apostles invited to imbrace Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
If they would not, if they did
not give credit to This in the first place,
viz. That <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49159:46"/>
Eminent and Extraordinary Person pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied
of long before, and that he was
Sent and Commission'd by God, there
could be no hope that they would attend
unto any other Proposal relating to the
<hi>Christian Religion.</hi> This is the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why that Article was constantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to be believ'd by all that look'd
towards Christianity, and why it is
mention'd so often in the Evangelical
Writings. It was that which <hi>made way</hi>
for the embracing of all the other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
it was the <hi>passage</hi> to all the rest. But
our Anonymous Author not thinking of
this, but observing that this One Article
was usually required to be assented to in
the Gospel-Writings, he thence incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderately
concludes that this is the <hi>Whole</hi>
of the Christian Belief, and that there is
nothing else to be <hi>necessarily</hi> assented to,
to make a man a Christian. I am sorry
to see that a person of some Sense can
have so little a feeling of the True Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Import of <hi>Christianity,</hi> that he
can harbour such a thought as this, that
all the necessary part of our Belief is
summ'd up in a bare giving assent to this
Proposition, <hi>Iesus is the Messias.</hi> He
mistakes a part of Christian Faith for
All, and the Entrance and Beginning
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49159:47"/>
of it for the full Consummation of it.</p>
               <p>2. It is to be remembred that though
this One Proposition or Article be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
alone in some places, yet there is
reason to think and be perswaded that at
the same time <hi>other</hi> Matters of Faith
were proposed. For it is confess'd by all
Intelligent and Observing men that the
History of the Scripture is concise, and
that in relating of matter of Fact many
passages are omitted by the Sacred Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Wherefore though but this One
Article of belief (because it is a Leading
one, and makes way for the rest) be
expresly mention'd in some of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels,</hi>
yet we must not conclude thence
that no other matter of Faith was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
to be admitted of. For things are
briefly set down in the Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
and we must <hi>suppose</hi> many things
which are not in direct terms related.
The not attending to this hath been one
occasion of the present mistake. Hence
it was that this Narrow-minded Writer
shuts up all in belief of <hi>Iesus's</hi> being
the <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. This also must be thought of, that
though there are Several parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Christian Faith, yet they do
not all occur in any <hi>One</hi> place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49159:47"/>
This is well known to those that
are conversant in the Writings of the
New Testament, and therefore when
in some places only <hi>One</hi> single part of
the Christian Faith is made mention of,
as necessarily to be imbrac'd in order to
Salvation, we must be careful not to take
it alone, but to supply it from several
<hi>other</hi> places, which make mention of
other Necessary and Indispensable Points
of Belief. I will give the Reader a plain
Instance of this, <hi>Rom. 10. 9. If thou
shalt believe in thy heart that God hath
rais'd him</hi> (i. e. the Lord Jesus) <hi>from
the dead, thou shalt be saved. Here One
Article of Faith,</hi> viz. the belief of Christ's
Resurrection (because it is of so great
importance in Christianity) is only
mention'd; but all the rest must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
because they are mention'd in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places. And consequently, if we
would give an impartial account of our
Belief, we must consult those places:
and they are not all together, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers'd
here and there: wherefore we
must look them out, and acquaint our
selves with the Several Particulars which
make up our Belief, and render it entire
and consummate. But our hasty Author
took another course, and thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49159:48"/>
himself, and unhappily deceives
others.</p>
               <p>4. This (which is the Main Answer
to the Objection) must be born in our
minds that <hi>Christianity</hi> was erected by
degrees, according to that prediction
and promise of our Saviour, that <hi>the
Spirit should teach them all things,</hi> John
14. 26. and that <hi>he should guide them into
all truth,</hi> John 16. 13. <hi>viz.</hi> after his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
and Ascension, when the Holy
Ghost was to be sent in a special manner
to enlighten mens minds, and to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to them the great Mysteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
This is to be Noted by us, as
that which gives great light in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case. The discovery of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Gospel was <hi>Gradual.</hi> It
was by certain steps that <hi>Christianity</hi>
climb'd to its heighth. We are not to
think then that all the Necessary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Christian Religion were
clearly publish'd to the world in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
time. Not but that all that were
necessary for <hi>that time</hi> were published:
but some which were necessary for the
<hi>succeeding one</hi> were not then discover'd, or
at least not fully. They had ordinarily no
belief before Christ's <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Resurrection</hi>
of those Substantial Articles, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49159:48"/>
should die and rise again: but we read in
the <hi>Acts</hi> and in the <hi>Epistles</hi> that these were
Formal Articles of Faith afterwards, and
are ever since necessary to compleat the
Christian Belief, so as to other Great
Verities, the Gospel increased by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and was not Perfect at once.
Which furnishes us with a reason why
most of the Choicest and Sublimest
Truths of Christianity are to be met
with in the <hi>Epistles</hi> of the Apostles,
they being such doctrines as were not
clearly discover'd and open'd in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels</hi>
and the <hi>Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have, I conceive, amply sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
the foregoing <hi>Objection,</hi> and I
hope the Reader is convinc'd of the
True Grounds why we must not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
all Necessary Points of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Writings of the four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists.
If our present Writer had
thought of this, and had distinguish'd
of <hi>Times,</hi> he had not formed such an
Ill Notion of <hi>Christianity</hi> as we find he
hath done. But it is not only upon
<hi>Mistake</hi> that this Author proceeds: his
fault is much worse. It is too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
that by this Abbreviating of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
and by his voluntary neglecting
what the <hi>Epistolary</hi> Writings deliver, he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49159:49"/>
designs to exclude those Fundamental
Doctrines which have been owned as
such in the Church of Christ. So
much for the <hi>First General Head</hi> which
I propounded to insist upon.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <p>The next General Charge against him is,
that <hi>the Texts of Scripture which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the HOLY TRINITY are disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
by him, or interpreted after
the Anti-Trinitarian Mode.</hi> This is
proved from plain Instances. The latter
more especially is evidenced from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
the <hi>Messias</hi> and the <hi>Son of
God</hi> to be the very same as to significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that no more is denoted by one
term than by the other. The Weakness
of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Arguing on this occasion
fully laid open: and the Texts where
these terms are mentioned plainly cleared.
A Text produced and urged that confutes
the vain surmises of the <hi>Racovians</hi> about
those expressions, and that reduces them to
an unavoidable <hi>Absurdity. The Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
is a Title of Christ's Office: <hi>The
Son of God</hi> is the Title of his Divinity.
The former is founded on his Mission from
the <hi>Father:</hi> The latter on his Peculiar
Property as he is the Second Person in
the Sacred Trinity; and consequently
they are not synonymous terms. The
Gentleman would wind in two Learned
<hi>Prelates,</hi> but his attempt proves inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49159:50"/>
He is given to Shuffling. He
abuses Scripture by quoting it.</p>
               <p>MY <hi>next Charge</hi> against this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was this, that those Texts of
Scripture which respect the Holy <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
were either disregarded by him, or
were interpreted by him after the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinitarian</hi>
Mode. And this he is so far
from denying, that he openly avows it,
<hi>Vindic. p.</hi> 22, 23. By which he hath
made it clear that he espouses that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Socinians.</hi> When I had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
those two plain Texts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.
<hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 1. to prove the doctrine of the
Blessed <hi>Trinity,</hi> he takes no care to give
any Resolution about them, though he
was absolutely oblig'd to do it, because
those Texts are not in the <hi>Epistles,</hi> but
in the <hi>Gospels,</hi> out of which latter he
saith he made his <hi>Collection of Articles,</hi>
but he should rather have said (and that
with Truth) out of which he drew
One Article. Nay, which is more
strange, though he particularly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>p.</hi> 9. my taking notice of his omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
these Texts in his Treatise, nay
though he sets them down at large in his
<hi>Vindication,</hi> yet he hath the confidence
to run presently to another thing, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49159:50"/>
he shifts it off by one impertinent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or other, and faith not one syllable
with reference to those Famous Texts
which are such remarkable testimonies
to the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Who
could do this but a <hi>Socinianiz'd</hi> Writer?
And who could do this but a man that
was wholly careless of his Credit, and
did not care how he acted? And this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing doth moreover shew that this
Author (let him pretend what he will)
is as great a despiser of the <hi>Gospels</hi> (when
any thing in them doth not serve his
turn) as he is of the <hi>Epistles.</hi> This will
perpetually stick upon him, and he will
never be able to wipe it off. If ever he
accounts for this, he must at the same
time make an acknowledgment of his
crazy memory, and of something
worse.</p>
               <p>Again, as it is evident that he rejects
the Doctrine of the Blessed <hi>Trinity,</hi> so
more especially and particularly he
waves that of the <hi>Deity</hi> of our Saviour.
Which appears from this that he justifies
the Charge against him, <hi>viz.</hi> that he
made these terms [<hi>the Messias</hi>] and [<hi>the
Son of God</hi>] the very same as to Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>p. 23. Vindic.</hi> Which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

<note n="†" place="bottom">Socin. cont. Wiek. cap. 5.</note> their Master, who largely pursues this
Argument (for so he reckons it to be,)
<hi>viz.</hi> that there is no difference between
the Name <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>Messias</hi> and that
other <hi>the Son of God.</hi> He alledges the
very same Text that our <hi>Vindicator</hi> doth,
and some others. He argues from <hi>Matt.</hi>
16. 16. compared with <hi>Luk. 9. 20. Thou
art Christ the Son of the living God,</hi> saith
the former place: <hi>Thou art the Christ of
God,</hi> faith the latter: therefore <hi>Christ</hi>
and <hi>the Son of God</hi> are not only the same
person, but these two expressions signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the very same thing and no more.
What a weak and pitiful Consequence is
this? For it is grounded on this absurd
bottom, namely, that when any of the
<hi>Evangelists</hi> speak about the same matter,
if one of them adds some words, yea,
some material Passages which are not in
the other, these must be reckoned to be
the very same with what the other said,
though they were utterly omitted by
him. Then we may argue thus, St.
<hi>Matthew</hi> saith, <hi>Christ began to preach,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49159:54"/>
and to say, Repent, Mat.</hi> 4. 17. St. <hi>Mark</hi>
saith, <hi>He preach'd the Gospel, saying, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
ye, and believe the Gospel, Mark</hi>
1. 14, 15. therefore Repenting and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
are the same, and there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between them. Would not a
Man be hooted at for such Arguing as
this? Yet this is the very Reasoning of
our <hi>Racovian,</hi> and of this late Proselyte
of theirs. In one Evangelist he saith, our
Saviour is called <hi>Christ,</hi> in another the
<hi>Son of God,</hi> therefore the denominations
of the <hi>Son of God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> are identifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Again, they endeavour to prove it
from comparing <hi>Mat. 26. 63. Mark</hi> 14.
61. with <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 67. In the former
places 'tis related that the High Priest
asked our Saviour whether he was <hi>the
Son of God, the Son of the Blessed:</hi> in the
latter, whether he was <hi>the Christ.</hi>
Whence they roundly conclude that
those Names <hi>Christ and the Son of God</hi> are
synonymous. But they do this without
any shew of reason, because they cannot
(as<note n="*" place="bottom">Cont. Meisner. de Trin.</note> 
                  <hi>Slichtingius himself</hi> confestes) sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
from an Omission infer the identity
of the things which are expressed and
which are left out, <hi>viz</hi> in the Writings
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49159:55"/>
of the Evangelist: and consequently
their Arguing is vain and groundless.
The plain and satisfactory Answer to it
is this, that St. <hi>Luke</hi> (guided by the Holy
Ghost in giving the Narrative of what
was done relating to our Lord) omitted
the particular words which the other
Evangelists have: and this is usual
with all the Evangelists at one time or
other. But a man can't infer thence
that the words and expressions which are
used by them are of the same import and
signification. After this rate, when I
read that <hi>Christ fell upon his face, Mat.</hi>
26. 39. and that <hi>he fell on the ground,
Mark</hi> 14. 35. and that <hi>he fell on his kness</hi> for
so 'tis in the Greek) <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 41. I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that <hi>face</hi> and <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>kness</hi> are the
very same thing, and one of them signifies
no more than the other. This is the wild
Logick of these men. Can there be a
more extravagant way of talking than
this? Especially if we remember what
Pretences to Reason and Good Sense
these men make above the rest of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
There are other Texts quoted by
our Author to prove that there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>the Son of God</hi>
as to the signification of the words, but
they may easily be answered from what
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49159:55"/>
I have said concerning the interpretation
of the foregoing Texts.</p>
               <p>There is one place (to name no more)
which confutes all the foresaid surmises
of the <hi>Socinians</hi> about the identity of
those Terms: it is that famous Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Faith which the <hi>Ethiopian Eunuch</hi>
made when <hi>Philip</hi> told him that he
might be baptized if he <hi>believed; Acts
8. 37. I believe,</hi> saith he, <hi>that Iesus
Christ is the Son of God.</hi> This without
doubt was said according to that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
which he had of <hi>Christ</hi> from
<hi>Philip</hi>'s instructing him, for it is said <hi>he
preached unto him Iesus, v.</hi> 35. He had
acquainted him that Jesus was the <hi>Christ,</hi>
the <hi>Anointed</hi> of God, and also that he was
the <hi>Son of God,</hi> which includes in it that
he was <hi>God.</hi> And accordingly this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Proselyte gives this account of his
Faith, in order to his being baptiz'd, in
order to his being admitted a Member
of Christ's Church, <hi>I believe that Iesus is
the Son of God,</hi> or you may read it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Greek, <hi>I believe the Son of
God to be Iesus Christ.</hi> Where there are
these two distinct Propositions, 1. That
<hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Messias,</hi> 2. That he is
not only the <hi>Messias,</hi> but the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
If you do not own these two Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49159:56"/>
included in his words, you must say
that the <hi>Eunuch</hi> (though instructed by
<hi>Philip</hi>) spoke Non-sense, for it <hi>to be
Christ</hi> and <hi>to be the Son of God</hi> are of the
same signification, then his words sound
thus, <hi>I believe that Iesus Christ is Christ,
I believe the Messias is the Messias.</hi> This
absolutely follows from the foresaid No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>the Messias</hi> and <hi>the Son of God</hi> are
synonymous. So then here is an Absurd
Tautology instead of a Sober confession
of Faith from this Eminent Convert:
and <hi>Philip</hi> accepts of it as a good and
right profession of his Belief. This you
must grant, or else you must acknowledg
that the <hi>Messias</hi> and <hi>Son of God</hi> are not of
the same signification, but are distinctly
attributed to <hi>Iesus.</hi> These words will
force you to acknowledg this, for in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he believes <hi>Christ to be the Son of God,</hi>
or that <hi>the Son of God is Christ,</hi> he lets us
know that these two, <hi>viz.</hi> to be the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>
and to be the <hi>Son of God</hi> are different
things (though they meet in the same
Person) and consequently that in all those
places (which are very many) where
<hi>the Son of God</hi> is added to <hi>the Messias,</hi> we
must understand it as an addition to the
Sense: whereas according to this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and his Complices these two are iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49159:56"/>
and consequently here is a <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensical
Reiteration</hi> in the words, for they
amount to no more than this, <hi>I believe
Iesus Christ to be Christ.</hi> This is that
Absurdity which they are reduced to.</p>
               <p>But yet I will subjoyn this, that we
are not unwilling to grant that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
is sometimes call'd <hi>the Son of God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 1. 35.</note> Miraculous Conception,
also because of the Dignity of his<note n="†" place="bottom">John 10. 36.</note> Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and sometimes because of his<note n="‖" place="bottom">Acts 13. 32, 33.</note> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.
But then we say that these
do not exclude another, and higher cause
of this Appellation, <hi>viz.</hi> his<note n="**" place="bottom">John 3. 16. Rom. 5. 8. 2 Cor. 11. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Eternal
Filiation:</hi> he was begotten from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the substance of the Father by an
ineffable Generation. If then we will
speak of these two Denominations distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and properly, we must say that one is
the Name of his <hi>Office,</hi> the other of his
<hi>Divinity,</hi> and consequently that <hi>Christ</hi>
and <hi>the Son of God</hi> are not expressions of
the same latitude and import. And how
indeed can they be? For they have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
foundations, the one hath its rise
from the Divine Mission, <hi>viz.</hi> that of
the <hi>Father,</hi> who sent and anointed him
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49159:57"/>
to be a Saviour: the other is grounded
in the singular and peculiar Property of
the Second Person in the Sacred Trinity,
and so is the Name of his Person. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is most irrationally and absurdly
done of our Late Convert, in a fond Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his Brethren, to confound these
two which are really Distinct. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
this as a proof of his being a <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
and he lets it remain a Proof,
and so do I. But here I would only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that he and they proceed in a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous</hi>
manner when they tell us that
<hi>Christ</hi> is called <hi>the Son of God,</hi> because of
his Office and its Dignity, whereas it is
evident that he had the Office and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
because he was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and
because none could perform the Office
but he that was so. He was not <hi>God</hi> (a
<hi>Metaphorical God,</hi> as the <hi>Socinians</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
make him) because he was <hi>Christ</hi>
or the <hi>Messias:</hi> but he was the <hi>Messias</hi>
because he was <hi>God,</hi> even the <hi>True God.</hi>
He was <hi>the Christ of God</hi> because he was
<hi>the Son of God:</hi> And this <hi>Filiation,</hi> in
its strictest and properest sense, implies
his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and his Coessentiality
with the <hi>Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He would here wind in (<hi>p.</hi> 23.) the
late Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as if he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49159:57"/>
understood the foregoing Terms as the
<hi>Socinians</hi> do. But his words that are
cited do not necessarily import any such
thing, for <hi>Nathanael</hi> might own our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> and call him <hi>the
Son of God,</hi> and yet it doth not follow
thence that the signification of both these
Appellations is the same, or that the
<hi>Archbishop</hi> thought so. And he would
make use of the Authority of an Other
<hi>Prelate,</hi> now living, of extraordinary
Worth and Learning, who speaking on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a <hi>general</hi> way represents these two
as the same thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Iesus is the
Christ,</hi> and that <hi>Iesus is the Son of God,</hi>
because these expressions are applied to
the same Person, and because they are
both comprehended in one general Name,
<hi>viz. Iesus.</hi> Yet it doth not follow
thence but that if we will speak strictly
and closely we must be forced to confess
that they are of different significations;
for we have different Ideas and notions
of them, the one being the Name of our
Saviour's Office, the other of his Person
and Eternal Filiation. But our Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
adheres to his good Patrons and
Friends the <hi>Racovians,</hi> and pronounces
them the very same. And we may, for
this as well as other reasons, pronounce
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49159:58"/>
him the same with those Gentlemen.
Which you may perceive he is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
of, and thinks that this will
be reckon'd a good Evidence of his being
what he denied himself to be before.
<hi>The Point is gain'd,</hi> saith he, <hi>and I am
openly a Socinian.</hi> p. 23. He never utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
truer words in his life, and they are
the Confutation of all his Pretences to the
contrary. This Truth, which unwari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dropt from his pen, confirms what I
have laid to his charge, that he did
read the foresaid Texts with <hi>Socinian</hi>
Spectacles, that he interpreted them
after the <hi>Racovian</hi> Mode, that he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Other Texts, yea, the <hi>Whole
Epistles</hi> themselves, because he was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
how many Illustrious Attestations
to the doctrine of the ever to be Adored
Trinity are contained in them.</p>
               <p>It is true, he tells us that <hi>he never read
the Socinian Writers, p.</hi> 22. but we know
his Shuffling is such that there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on his word. But suppose he
did not <hi>read</hi> those Authors, yet he doth
not deny that he hath <hi>Convers'd</hi> with
some of them, and hath heard their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Arguments: and this indeed
he intimates to us when he lets us know
that the <hi>generality of Divines he more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49159:58"/>
with</hi> are not <hi>Racovians, p.</hi> 22.
which intimates that there are some <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Divines</hi> he <hi>less converses with</hi> that
are of another way. What shall we say?
The Gentleman is a <hi>Racovian,</hi> and yet
pretends he doth not know it. So we
must number him among the <hi>Ignoramus-Socinians</hi>
(as they tell us in their late Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of <hi>Ignoramus Trinitarians</hi>) which is
one sort of those folks it seems.</p>
               <p>I will only further take notice here of
what was truly said, before he was aware,
that <hi>it was a dull work with him to quote
Scripture, p.</hi> 25. He hath sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
the world, in his numerous Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Scripture, that it was so. He
might have added, it is <hi>a diabolical work,</hi>
for in quoting Scripture after that rate
which he is guilty of, he doth but follow
his Pattern in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 6. His handling of
Scripture, and making that use of it
which he doth, is an Abusing of it. Such
treating of the Holy Book is desecrating it;
and whilest he talks Scripture, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes
it. So that <hi>a Socinian begins to
mend when he leaves this work off, (p.</hi> 25.)
in comparison of what he did before.
So much for the Second Charge.</p>

               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:49159:59"/>
               <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
               <p>The last General Charge against him is, that
<hi>when he professedly enumerates the
ADVANTAGES of our Saviour's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he hath not one syllable of his
SATISFYING for us.</hi> Hence it is ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
inferr'd that he favours <hi>Racovia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism.</hi>
He endeavours to evade this by
pretending that in other places he uses such
terms as import <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> Herein he
is refuted. His <hi>Dissimulation</hi> discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Even whilest he proclaims himself a
<hi>Socinian,</hi> he labours to disguise it. Which
argues his <hi>Weakness</hi> and <hi>Insincerity.</hi>
His Book is unworthy of the specious <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
which he prefixes to it. The <hi>Author</hi>'s
Conclusion of the foregoing debates.</p>
               <p>ANother Proof, or rather Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of our Author's being a
Disciple of <hi>Socinus</hi> is this, that when <hi>he
mentions the Advantages and Benefits of
Christ's Coming into the world, he hath not
one syllable of his Satisfying for us, or by his
Death purchasing life and salvation, or any
thing that sounds like it.</hi> He makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the force of this Evidence,
wherefore it will be proper now to set it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49159:59"/>
before the Reader in its true and native
light. He that was giving an Account
of the <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> and
was more particularly making it his <hi>busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
to shew for what <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Purpose</hi>
Christ appear'd in the flesh, and to let
his Readers know what <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi>
were brought to them by the <hi>Messias,</hi>
he (I say) when he was about this work,
and <hi>Designedly</hi> undertook it in this part of
his book, was obliged to declare that one
great Advantage of the <hi>Messias</hi>'s Coming
was to take away our sins by Expiating
them, that one Main End of his Coming
was to make Satisfaction for us, and
thereby to purchase life and glory. But
this New Convert hath not any thing
that sounds like it in this place, where
he <hi>professedly</hi> took upon him to acquaint
us <hi>what are the Advantages</hi> which accrue
to us by the <hi>Messias.</hi> Though he hath the
confidence to struggle with many other
parts of the <hi>Charges</hi> against him, yet here
he submits, and grants (<hi>p. 5. Vind.</hi>) he
hath no such thing in the place where the
<hi>Advantages</hi> of Christ's Coming are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
treated of. And if by his own
acknowledgment he hath no such thing
when he reckons up the <hi>Advantages</hi> and
<hi>Blessings</hi> of Christ's appearing in the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49159:60"/>
world, then every intelligent man knows
what Inference to make, <hi>viz.</hi> that this
Author was of opinion that Christ came
not to Satisfie for us, and to purchase life
for us by vertue of his Death, which is
one of the Grand Points of <hi>Socinianism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The force of this Inference is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and it will attack our Adversary,
be he never so cunning at Evasions, be he
never so closely intrench'd in his Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
For where should we expect
this to be mention'd, if it be not expresly
taken notice of in that part or division
of his Treatise where he Purposely sets
forth the <hi>Benefits</hi> of the Messias's Arrival?
If he doth not make express mention of
it here, it is either because he forgot it,
(but he owns no such thing) or because he
was careless (but he doth not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
whatever others do, to be such a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
or because he wilfully left it out, and
this indeed is the true Reason: for all the
world cannot but see (notwithstanding
his Shifts) that his Subject engag'd him
to reckon This in the number of the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi>
accruing by the Coming of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, if he had thought it to be one.
When he was enumerating of those, this
could not possibly have been omitted,
because by all Writers that are not <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:49159:60"/>
this is always put into the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of those Blessings which we share
in by the Undertakings of our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
Hence it appears how imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and ridiculous that is, <hi>It was not in
the place he</hi> (meaning <hi>me) would have it in,
p.</hi> 5. He should have said, it is not in the
place where every one might reasonably
have look'd for it, it was not in the place
where his matter necessarily oblig'd him
to insert it, so that he was both faithless
to his Subject, and false to the True Cause:
in brief, it was not in that place where, if he
had not been a Pupil of <hi>Socinus,</hi> it would
certainly have been found: for no man but
such a one did ever designedly undertake
the Enumeration of those <hi>Benefits</hi> which
we are partakers of by our Lord's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and yet omit at the same time his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
and Purchasing us by his Blood.</p>
               <p>He pretends indeed, <hi>p.</hi> 5. that in an
other place of his book he mentions
Christ's <hi>restoring all man kind from the state
of death,</hi> and <hi>restoring them to life,</hi> and
<hi>his laying down his life for an other,</hi> as
our Saviour professes he did. These <hi>few</hi>
words this <hi>Vindicator</hi> hath pick'd up in his
book since he wrote it. This is <hi>all</hi> thro'
his whole Treatise that he hath dropt
concerning that Advantage of Christ's
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49159:61"/>
Incarnation which I was speaking of:
and they are general terms too, and such
as every <hi>Racovian</hi> will subscribe to; for
they are not backward to own that Christ
some way or other (but not That before
specified) <hi>restored us to life,</hi> and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
gainsay the express words of Christ
concerning his <hi>laying down his life for his
sheep, Iohn</hi> 10. 15. but it is well known
that (notwithstanding this) they deny the
<hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Christ, and his purchasing
life and salvation by vertue of his Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Passion and Death. There is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that <hi>sounds</hi> like this in that part of
his Discourse where he peculiarly made
it his employment and task to let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
know what Advantages we reap by
our Saviours assuming our humane nature.</p>
               <p>But he deridingly cries out <hi>What will
become of me, that I have not mention'd</hi>
SATISFACTION? <hi>p.</hi> 6. I will tell you,
Sir, (seeing you would know) what
will become of you; you will ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
be reckon'd by all understanding
men an Egregious Whiffler, or in plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms
a Notorious Dissembler. For the
case stands thus, (and I doubt not but
the Reader will perfectly agree with me
in it) you believe Christ's <hi>Satisfaction,</hi>
or you do not: if you believe there is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49159:61"/>
such a thing, and this was one of the
<hi>Advantages</hi> we have by Christ's Coming,
then you were false and treacherous in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
it: if you believe it not, you are as
false and hypocritical in vouching your
self to be no <hi>Socinian,</hi> seeing this is one
known Badg of a person of that Character.</p>
               <p>Let him take which of these ways he will,
he forfeits his Truth and Integrity. Was it
not enough to make use of the Chief <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Arguments, and to expound Texts in
the <hi>Racovian way,</hi> and to leave out plain
and direct places even in the very <hi>Gospels</hi>
that assert the Holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> and moreover
to throw off all the Famous Testimonies
to this doctrine in the <hi>Apostolical Epistles,</hi>
and to balk the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Christ for
us even when he was purposely telling
the Reader what are the <hi>Advantages</hi> which
flow to us from Christ's Coming? Was it
not enough, I say, to do all this (which loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proclaims him a <hi>Socinian</hi>) but must he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
hold the world in hand that he is none?
Can this Writer himself consider this,
and not blush? Who doth not wonder at
his <hi>Weakness,</hi> that he should manifestly
take the part of these Gentlemen and
yet endeavour to perswade us that he is
not of their number? But who doth not
wonder more at his <hi>Insincerity,</hi> that he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49159:62"/>
should act thus? Must not this then be
his Lasting Character that he hath in his
Writings demonstated himself to be not
only a <hi>Socinian,</hi> but a <hi>False hearted</hi> one?</p>
               <p>There are other Passages in his book
which I might produce to confirm this
Character of him, but those may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of at another time. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
let it suffice that I have shew'd that
he hath not said one word in his <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
that clears him of this imputation.
And as for his book it self of the <hi>Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of Christianity,</hi> let it suffice to say
that though there have been many Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises
concerning that Subject, yet none
ever could imagine that this which he
offers could possibly be brought under
that <hi>Title.</hi> He saith some body is good
at Conjecturing, but if a man had the
best faculty in the world that way, it
were impossible to guess and surmise that
such a Title should be prefix'd those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
which are an Unreasonable and False
Representation of Christianity, a Lame
and Shatter'd Account of the Principles
of the Gospel, and, in short, a kind of
Libel against the New Testament. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
let it suffice that I have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
to the Reader that this Gentleman
acts a Part in what he writes; by which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49159:62"/>
he hath gained this, that he must never be
believed for the future. He that is such an
Under-hand dealer can't be trusted: there
is no heed to be given to what he saith.</p>
               <p>Thus I thought my self obliged to set
before the Reader the state of the Case
between this Gentleman and my self,
and to give an impartial account of our
Sentiments. I am satisfied in my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
for (whatever my defects in
it otherwise be) I'm sure I have aimed
aright, at the vindicating the Glory of the
Great Majesty of heaven and earth. I
have faithfully asserted our Holy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Divinity of the Blessed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and Founder of it. I have maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Authority and Honour of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures. To the pursuing of which
Glorious Designs I shall dedicate my
whole life: and I hope from what I have
written, and shall hereafter write, the
World will bear me witness that I do so.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Gentleman insinuates that the</hi> Author
<hi>would represent every one as an</hi> Atheist
<hi>that thinks not as he doth. This Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is baffled. He laughs at</hi> Orthodoxy,
<hi>and cries down</hi> Systems <hi>and</hi> Creeds.
<hi>This Indifferent Writer blames the</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49159:63"/>
                  <hi>for his</hi> Zeal. <hi>Is angry with him for
penetrating into his Thoughts and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The Party inure themselves to</hi>
Sophistry, <hi>and yet make a shew of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and Plainness. The Gentleman's</hi>
Uneven Temper <hi>observ'd. What is
meant by</hi> a known Writer of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood.
<hi>He is himself of an</hi> other
Fraternity. <hi>Though he pretends to be
Grave, he Scosss and Ieers. He cannot
be brought to confess himsef to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer
to</hi> Socinianism, <hi>though he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
such evident proofs of his being one.
The</hi> Author <hi>shuts up all with seasonable</hi>
Advice <hi>to him, giving him some account
of the</hi> Freedom <hi>which he hath used to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him in the preceding Discourse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HAving now dispatch'd my Main
Business, and found the Bill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Criminal, not by <hi>Innuendo's</hi>
but by Plain Express Proof, I am at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to account with him for some Other
Passages in his <hi>Vindication.</hi> He insinuates
that I would represent every one as an
<hi>Atheist,</hi> or a <hi>Promoter of Atheism</hi> that doth
not think as I do, <hi>doth not just say after
me, p.</hi> 1, 2. Which is a groundless Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
and might be confuted from that
<hi>Freedom</hi> which I professed, <hi>p.</hi> 77. even
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49159:63"/>
in that <hi>Discourse</hi> which he excepts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst.
I have always been averse to
<hi>Bigotism,</hi> I never shew'd my self a Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizer,
but always declar'd for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
Liberty, such as doth not auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
encroach upon the Necessary and
Fundamental Points of our Religion.
Therefore this <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s wilful mistak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what I said, thereby to represent
me as extremely Censorious and Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
looks like Spleen. But I need
say no more than this, that the Reader
is convinc'd (I question not) from what
hath been premised that this Writer will
say any thing that comes into his head.
This seems to be natural to him every
where: and he can be no more without
it than a Spaniard without his Guittar.</p>
               <p>To be <hi>Orthodox</hi> is a great Scandal, it
seems, and he often objects it to me:
which, as the Learned know, was the
very language and idiom of the <hi>Arrians</hi>
of old, and of that sort of men who are
since known by the name of <hi>Socinians.</hi>
He speaks in the very Stile of the <hi>Old An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titrinitarians;</hi>
though it may be he will
say he doth not know it. He publickly
prides himself in his <hi>Heterodoxy,</hi> and
hates even with a deadly hatred all <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms</hi>
and <hi>Confessions,</hi> all <hi>Systems</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49159:64"/>
p.</hi> 8. He laughs at <hi>Orthodoxy, p.</hi> 17,
20. and derides <hi>Mysteries,</hi> which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
marks of a <hi>Racovian</hi> Brother.
And O how he grins at the <hi>Spirit of Creed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making?
p. 18. Vindic.</hi> the very thoughts
of which do so haunt him, so plague and
torment him that he cannot rest till it
be conjured down. And here, by the
way, seeing I have mention'd his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
against <hi>Systematick books and writings,</hi>
I might represent the <hi>Misery</hi> that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon all <hi>Booksellers</hi> if this Gentleman
and his Correspondents go on successful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Here is an effectual Plot to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<hi>Stationers Hall;</hi> for all <hi>Systems</hi> and
<hi>Bodies</hi> of Divinity, Philosophy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
must be cashier'd: whatever looks like
<hi>System</hi> must not be bought or sold. This
will fall heavy on the Gentlemen of St.
<hi>Paul's Church-yard,</hi> and other places.</p>
               <p>This Author often finds fault with me
for my <hi>Zeal, p.</hi> 5, 18, 37. It is likely he
hath heard that when the Gospel was
heretofore read in the Churches in <hi>Poland</hi>
(before it was <hi>Socinianized,</hi>) it was usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to draw their Swords, to shew that
they would defend it against all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it. I do but draw my Pen in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> yea and the <hi>Epistles,</hi>
and I am censur'd as a <hi>Zealot</hi> by him.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49159:64"/>
And it is not strange, for he must needs
declare against <hi>Zeal</hi> that is <hi>Indifferent.</hi>
Besides, according to this Judicious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suist
there is but <hi>One</hi> Point of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that a man can be zealous for, if he
would. Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Martyrs foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
threw away their lives, for neither
<hi>Bonner</hi> nor any of their Persecutors did so
much as desire them to renounce this
Article <hi>Iesus is the Messias:</hi> and as for all
the rest, this Gentleman tells us that
they are <hi>not necessarily to be believ'd,</hi> and
consequently not to be acknowledg'd and
profess'd; and then who will shew any
<hi>Zeal</hi> for them, especially such as will
carry a man into the Flames?</p>
               <p>He often talks of <hi>my being in his bosom,
and knowing his heart and thoughts, p.</hi> 14,
15, 24. (which by the by is more than
his Brethren will allow <hi>God himself</hi> to
know, for <hi>Free Acts being uncertain they
can't be certainly understood by God</hi> (as the
Gentleman whom I shall speak a word
with anon tells us.) This sort of Talk
argues that he is much troubled that I
have penetrated into his <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and
have discovered to the world what his
Intention and Design is. And yet he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates
also by this way of speaking that
it is an Impossible thing to do this. How

impossible then is it for himself <hi>to know
his heart?</hi> for this is a certain Maxim,
It is the Punishment of a Dissembler to
deceive himself, for his endeavouring to
do so to others. I wish this Writer would
consider of it, and learn for the future to
be free, open and fair, and then others
(as well as himself) would have a window
into his breast, and see that which they
are sorry they find no appearance of now.</p>
               <p>And I wish this were not too common
a fault of the Party, at least of many of
them. They inure themselves to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry,
Cunning, and Artifice, when
they either interpret Texts, or Argue in
favour of their Darling Opinions. They
then too palpably impose upon other
mens minds, as well as upon their own.
And yet at the same time they pretend to
great Simplicity and honest dealing.
Thus you find them applauding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their late Prints:<note n="*" place="bottom">The Trinitarian Scheme of Religion, <hi>page</hi> 21.</note> 
                  <hi>the Vnitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
(say they of themselves) <hi>are plain
fellows, and have Countrey Consciences, and
do not like juggling.</hi> You Gentlemen of
the <hi>City,</hi> look to it: these <hi>Vnitarians,</hi>
these <hi>Socinians</hi> have a very bad opinion
of you, for here they would have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
that <hi>City-Consciences</hi> are false and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49159:67"/>
perfidious, deceitful and juggling. It is
a course Complement, and Rustick
enough which these <hi>Plain Fellows</hi> put
upon you. It is not the first time they
have struck at you: <hi>London</hi> must be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd
by <hi>Racovia.</hi> And the <hi>Vindicator</hi>
is one of these <hi>Plain Fellows,</hi> for as he
hath shew'd himself an <hi>Vnitarian,</hi> so he
makes it appear that he hath a <hi>Country-Conscience</hi>
in the sense that these men ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately
mean it in, <hi>viz.</hi> a knack of
Cheating in a Rustical plain way, as
when he pretends to make a Religion for
the <hi>Rabble,</hi> an <hi>Easie Plain Religion,</hi> a
<hi>Creed with One Article,</hi> and no more; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
thereby to gratifie <hi>them,</hi> but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hand subverting <hi>Christianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor have I yet done with him. I find
him to be a Man of a very Uneven Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
sometimes he is very Low and
Whining, and will be <hi>asking pardon,</hi> and
<hi>desiring me,</hi> &amp;c at other times he is Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and Magisterial, and <hi>requires me,</hi> &amp;c.
Sometimes he talks very demurely, as
about being <hi>in earnest, p. 9. being serious
and grave, p.</hi> 24, 25. and in a Pedantick
Humour he undertakes to censure and
correct my <hi>Stile, p.</hi> 24. But this fit of
Gravity doth not last long; he every
where shews himself Light and Freakish,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49159:68"/>
Ironical and Abusive as far as he is able,
and nibbles at Wit according to his mean
Talent. He inveighs forsooth against
<hi>Declamatory Rhetorick, Wit and Iest,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>p. 24. Vindic.</hi> and yet at the same time
is Wanton and Frolick, Starting any thing
to sport himself with. In that very place
before mention'd where he seems to put
on his Gravity, he hath not forgot <hi>the
Merry time of Rope-dancing and Puppet-Plays,</hi>
at which he was good in the days
of yore. It is likely he had been a little
before conducting some of his Young
Brood to <hi>Bartholomew Fair,</hi> and thence
this precious idea came into his head.</p>
               <p>Without doubt he thought he was not
a little Ingenious in that waggish expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>p. 6. a Known Writer of the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:</hi>
which is meant of the Brethren
of the Clergy who have writ against the
<hi>Socinian</hi> Cause, the same with the <hi>Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Authorities</hi> and <hi>Frightful Names</hi> which
he speaks of, <hi>p.</hi> 23. The professed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of <hi>England</hi> you must know are but
a pitiful sort of folks with this great <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian
Rabbi.</hi> He tells us plainly that he
is not mindful of what <hi>the Generality of
Divines declare for, p.</hi> 22. He labours so
concernedly to engratiate himself with
the <hi>Mob,</hi> the <hi>Multitude</hi> (which he so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49159:68"/>
talks of) that he hath no regard to
these. <hi>The generality of the Rabble</hi> are
more considerable with him than <hi>the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Divines, the Writers of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood.</hi>
Though truly a Wise Man
that hears any one judg thus, will think
he deserves as well to be rewarded with
a pair of Ears of the largest size as <hi>he</hi> did
who judg'd on <hi>Pan</hi>'s side against <hi>Apollo.</hi>
But there is more yet in this term of <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood</hi>
than this, for here it is implied
(and his thoughts may be suppos'd to
be upon it when he wrote) that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is a Writer of an <hi>Other Fraternity;</hi>
and truly this Stile is very proper, for the
men of that Party (as 'tis well known)
have labour'd to signalize themselves (in
the Writings that they have publish'd)
by the Title of <hi>Brethren.</hi> It is agreed
then; we will for the future take him
for a <hi>Polonian Brother.</hi> And I ask the
Reader whether this <hi>Brother</hi> be not of
kin to the Order of <hi>Friers</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> who
were call'd <hi>Fratres Ignorantiae, viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
they professed to teach the people
as little as possibly they could, as suppose
<hi>One Article of Religion,</hi> and no more.</p>
               <p>I might proceed further, and shew
that this Author, as Demure and Grave
as he would sometimes seem to be, can
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49159:69"/>
scoff at the Matters of Faith contain'd in
the Apostles <hi>Epistles, p. 18. l. 4. &amp;c.</hi>
To coakse the <hi>Mob</hi> he prophanely brings
in that place of Scripture, <hi>Have any of
the Rulers believ'd in him? p.</hi> 33. Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
and Irreligiously he pretends that
<hi>I prefer what he faith to me to what is offer'd
to me from the Word of God, p.</hi> 25. What is
there that this Gentleman will not turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Ridicule or Falsity? What is there
that he will not take hold of to be Spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Gamesome? We may further
see how Counterfeit his <hi>Gravity</hi> is whilst
he condemns <hi>frothy and light discourses,
p. 26. Vindie.</hi> and yet in many pages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
most irreverently treats a great part
of the <hi>Apostolical Writings,</hi> and throws
aside the Main Articles of Religion as
unnecessary. From all which it is clear
that he contradicts and opposes himself.
Whence by the by we may gather that
when he saith he is <hi>no Socinian,</hi> we must
take his meaning to be that <hi>he is one,</hi> for
he is made up of Contradictions. I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
before that the <hi>Dissenting Ministers
consfess'd to him</hi> (if you will believe<note n="*" place="bottom">Reasonableness of Christianity, <hi>p.</hi> 303.</note> him)
<hi>that they understood not the difference in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
among them:</hi> but this Gentleman
can't be brought to <hi>confess</hi> any thing, he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49159:69"/>
will not own that he is <hi>a Writer of the
brotherhood.</hi> No: there is some great
Reason (if it may be call'd so) for this,
that he would not be thought to be of
<hi>Sozzo</hi>'s side: though the Marks and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
are so plain that he may be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
without a Hue and Crie.</p>
               <p>Come, Good Sir, do not act a part
any longer: They have been desirous to
put you upon service, and you were as
willing to be employ'd in it: but now
at last Confess it. Appear no more in
Masquerade: away with this Mumme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and shew your self what you are.
You have let the world see (and so far
we are beholding to you) that <hi>Socinian</hi> is
a Reproachful Title; that any one may
gather from your being so backward to
own it. You would never have taken
so much pains to shift off this Character
if it were not a very Scandalous One.
Throw off your Vizour then, and speak
out like a Man. Be free and ingenuous,
and dissemble not with Heaven as well as
Men. I have, Sir, been very free with
you, which you may impute to your not
being so with your self. You know the
Rule among the Men of Art, The Heart
is known by the Pulse. I have made bold
to usurp upon the Faculty, I have been
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49159:70"/>
feeling your Pulse, and I have found that
it strongly beats after the <hi>Racovian</hi> tone.
This I have told you with some plainess,
and you are obliged to me for represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you to your self. I know you did
not expect an Assault, for it was your
self (however you apply it to me) that
was thought to be one of<note n="*" place="bottom">Vindic <hi>p.</hi> 20.</note> 
                  <hi>the most Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged
sort of men.</hi> But, Sir, in the Reign
of Truth <hi>Protections</hi> are not of any use.
It is a laudable way sometimes to fight
the Enemy in his Trenches. There are
some Criminals that must be snatch'd
from the horns of the Altar, especially
when they injure the Altar it self, when
they abuse that which is Holy, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
upon our Sacred Faith and Religion.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I have said nothing out
of prejudice or disgust, much less out of
bitterness and ill will, for I am in Entire
Charity with you, and the more so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have spoken so freely. If you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
now (as you did before) that you
are <hi>hardly dealt with,</hi> I have only this to
say, A Plain Down-right Adversary
might perhaps have met with another
usage, but such a Stubborn Dissembler
could not expect <hi>fairer quarter.</hi>

Brief REPLY
To another
SOCINIAN Author.</head>
               <p>THERE came lately to my hand
this Writer's Sheets in the true
<hi>Racovian Print:</hi> but I having
been so large upon the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
this <hi>Double-Column'd</hi> Gentleman, who
pretends to be an <hi>Examinator,</hi> cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
I should spend much time about
him. In the first place we are to observe
that he most humbly and reverentially
<hi>dedicates</hi> his Papers to the New Patron
of the Cause, and takes upon him the
Defence of what he hath said in his <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity.</hi> He highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds
him for his being so serviceable
to the <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Antitrinitarian</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.
And it is part of his Panegyrick
that <hi>he hath happily provided for the quiet
and satisfaction of the minds of the honest
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49159:72"/>
multitude, p.</hi> 3. That is, he hath not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and molested them (as some have
done with propounding Several Articles
of Christian Belief) but hath told them
that <hi>One</hi> is enough for them, and bids
them rest contented with that, like good
honest Ignorant Souls. Thus <hi>he hath
provided</hi> (but how <hi>happily</hi> let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
judg) <hi>for their quiet and satisfaction.</hi>
But though the <hi>Examinator</hi> heaps great
Commendations on the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> yet
he professes i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> (you'll believe him, you
may) that <hi>he knows him not, p</hi> 4. Only
at a venture he takes his part, he now
being become one of the <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> and
may prove a very Substantial Tool and
Engine in the great Work they are now
about, <hi>viz.</hi> the subverting of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
<hi>Divinity,</hi> the laying aside the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Epistles,</hi> the shutting out the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Matters of Faith</hi> contain'd in them,
and the setting up and idolizing of <hi>One
Article,</hi> with defiance of all the rest as
any ways Necessary to be believ'd. This
is the New <hi>DIANA</hi> that is set up by
our <hi>Ephesians,</hi> especially by their late <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he hath a fling at my <hi>Booksellers,
p.</hi> 5. wherein he follows the steps of the
<hi>Vindicator, p.</hi> 37. And in this and other
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49159:72"/>
things they jump, which discovers their
Correspondence, though he had but just
before said <hi>he knew him not.</hi> And so this
gives us an account of the truth of what
the <hi>Vindicator</hi> said, that <hi>he knew not that
the Socinians interpreted such and such Texts
after such a manner.</hi> This is said to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon the world, and make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he and the <hi>Racovians</hi> have not
been Confederates. But he confutes this
in another place, where he owns that he
hath particular knowledg of that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and knew the circumstances of his
Life, <hi>p. 13. Col.</hi> 2. for he could not say
of him that <hi>he overcame the prejudices of
Education</hi> unless he had been acquainted
with his Education and manner of life.
And if this is <hi>the Gentleman of no ordinary
judgment,</hi> from whom he saith <hi>he hath
seen a Letter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 17. Here still you
see is Juggling and sleight of hand, and
it is natural and proper it seems to the
Party. And further to shew their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
of Notes together, it might be
observ'd that both agree to say that what
I write was writ in <hi>hast</hi> and in a <hi>fit,
Examin. p. 5. Vindicat. p.</hi> 19. And let
it be so, if they will, for thence it will
appear that a man need not take up
much time to confute either the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
or this Gentleman.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:49159:73"/>
But what is this that he hath to say of
my <hi>Booksellers?</hi> Some great matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt. <hi>He put me upon making Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against that Treatise, that so the sale
of his own Tract might be the more promoted,
p.</hi> 5. The Reader may guess from this
what is their own Trade; they and their
Booksellers joyntly club to cheat the
poor bulk of mankind. That is their
practice we may learn from their fastning
it upon others. Any man may see that
the <hi>Rationalist</hi> went snips with his <hi>Pater-Noster-Men,</hi>
they fully understood one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
as appears from their not denying
him to be the Author of the <hi>Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. all the time it
was in the Press: but when they saw
the Sale of it was not according to
their High Expectations, they, to
buoy up the Gentleman's Credit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to disown him to be the Author.
This was done by the two <hi>Shrine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
that before cried aloud for <hi>Diana.</hi>
Now then, I think it appears at last that
these people are extremely beholding to
<hi>my Booksellers</hi> if they did any such thing
as they surmise, for by this means the
sale of <hi>their Book</hi> was promoted.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Booksellers,</hi> I must be taken
to task by the Reverend <hi>Examinator,</hi> who
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49159:73"/>
having flutter'd a little about the <hi>formal
words</hi> which I had said were to be found
in <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity</hi> (which
no Creature that hath once read it will
once doubt of) he fixes on this (<hi>p.</hi> 5.)
as the <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s true sense, yea his own
words, <hi>that all that was to be believed for
justification, or to make a man a Christian,
by him that did already believe in, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
one True God, maker of heaven and
earth, was no more than this Single Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ
or the Messias.</hi> This man makes a Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Entrance to his work, for though
he saith these are the Vindicator's words
(for thus he brings them in, <hi>It is true he
saith</hi>) yet no man alive can find them in
his book: and he knew this himself, else
he would have set down the page, as we
find him paging it afterwards. What
shall we say then to such men as these
who will vouch any thing? They can
be trusted with no book, no not with
one of their own Tribe, for we see here
that this Writer's stile is, <hi>he saith,</hi> and
yet this Express <hi>Saying</hi> no where occurs
in the book he refers to. And here by
the way, we may observe the bold Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
of this Writer; he (as well as the
<hi>Vindicator, p.</hi> 38.) would charge me
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49159:74"/>
with not quoting the <hi>formal words</hi> which
are in the <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi>
whilest he is not sensible of his plain mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoting
the same Author. Yet here we
may observe this, that it is but a <hi>Single
Proposition</hi> (and no more) which is to
be believ'd, to make a man a Christian.
This is the sense of the <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s friend,
thus he understands him; and so indeed
every one must, and yet it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that the Vindicator himself
would evade this, and pretends that he
means more than a Single Proposition or
Article.</p>
               <p>Now next let us see how this <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator</hi>
licks over the <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s Article,
and tells us that the belief of <hi>Iesus</hi>'s being
the <hi>Messias comprehends</hi> and <hi>implies several
other things, p.</hi> 3. Here he sweats to bring
off his Brother handsomly and with credit
by letting us know that his Bold Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which runs through his whole book is
to be <hi>qualified</hi> after this manner, 1. <hi>All sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous
expressions,</hi> &amp;c. and so he sets
them down one, two and three. But I
ask him this Question (and let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
be pleas'd to observe the issue of it)
Why did not the Gentleman himself make
use of these <hi>Qualifications</hi> when he vented
the Proposition, and insisted upon it in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49159:74"/>
the bulk of his book, yea why did he
not mention these <hi>Qualifications</hi> in his
<hi>Answer</hi> to my Exceptions against his
book? He knew what he had asserted,
and he defends (as well he can) his
doing so, but you will find in no part of
his <hi>Vindication</hi> that he betakes himself to
these <hi>Evasions,</hi> though he hath enough
of Others of a different sort. How then
come you, Mr. <hi>Examinator,</hi> to invent
these things for him? Do you not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
proclaim to the world that you will
put off the Reader with any idle and
groundless Conceit of your own?</p>
               <p>When he repeats my words, <hi>p.</hi> 6, 7.
wherein I took notice of the Gentleman's
<hi>willful omitting of plain and obvious passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in the Evangelists</hi> (out of whose Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
he had drawn a Whole Article)
<hi>which contain the belief of the Holy Trinity,</hi>
he saith not a word to excuse his <hi>Omission,</hi>
but by his silence (for he would have
spoken without doubt if he had had any
thing to say in his Friends defence) he
owns it to be wilful and blameable. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he comes with the Trite and Common
Answer of the Party to those Texts; but
before he enters upon the Second of
them, <hi>viz. Iohn</hi> 1. 1. he declares <hi>there
is no such Text in the whole Bible, p.</hi> 9. He
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49159:75"/>
said rightly that <hi>he was bold to say it,</hi> for a
man shall scarcely hear a more Audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
word, though 'tis true he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to mollifie it with an <hi>if.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to what he saith about my taking
notice of the Gentleman's slighting the
<hi>Epistolary Writings,</hi> I have fully answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in the foregoing Papers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shall add no more here.</p>
               <p>He proceeds next to those <hi>Socinan Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi>
whose undue Notions concerning
<hi>God</hi> I glanc'd upon. The Author of <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,</hi>
&amp;c. in reply to the Right Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Bishop who had from the notion of
<hi>God's Eternity</hi> inferr'd that he was <hi>Self-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent</hi>
or <hi>from himself,</hi> hath these words,
<hi>What makes him (viz.</hi> the Bishop) <hi>say, God
must be from himself, or self-originated? for
then he must be before he was,</hi> which this
Writer concludes to be a Contradiction.
Therefore he would make this Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that God's <hi>Self-existence</hi> is a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
I know it will be pretended
that this is the Consequence only of the
Bishops Notion of <hi>Eternity,</hi> but it is plain
that that Writer makes use of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to shake the belief of the <hi>Eternity</hi> and
<hi>Self-Existence</hi> of the Allmighty, and
that will appear from what he further
adds in way of Exception to what that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49159:75"/>
Reverend Person saith afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
God's Eternity. This <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator</hi>
talks of a <hi>false notion of Self-existence,</hi>
but doth not say what it is. If I have
mistaken the <hi>Considerer,</hi> let him write
plainer another time.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Examinator</hi>'s question. How
the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third Persons</hi> can be <hi>Self-existent?</hi>
I answer, They are Self-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
as they are eternally from the Self-same
Deity. Though according to the
<hi>Nicene</hi> Creed Christ be <hi>God of God,</hi> yet
that doth not infring his <hi>Self-Existence,</hi>
because those words are not spoken of
the <hi>Essence</hi> of Christ which is common
to him with his <hi>Father,</hi> but of his <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality.</hi>
He being the same with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
as to the former hath his Existence
of himself; but differing from the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
as to the latter, he is rightly said to
be <hi>from him,</hi> or <hi>of him</hi> as he is the Second
Person in the Trinity. This is easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
with what he saith an Other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
asserts, if this <hi>Vnitarian</hi> hath not a
mind to quarrel.</p>
               <p>In the next Paragraph he is quite non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus'd,
for I had charg'd the <hi>Sacinian</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
with their denial of <hi>God's foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
future Contingencies,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denying the <hi>Omniscience</hi> of God, which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49159:76"/>
is an inseparable Attribute of the Deity;
and he having nothing to reply to the
purpose, first tells us <hi>he is not concern'd in
it, p.</hi> 18, whereas every one knows that
he being one of the Party is concern'd.
Secondly, assoon as he had as it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the <hi>Socinian</hi> doctrine by saying
he was not Concern'd in it, he presently
owns it for Truth, as those words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
<hi>p. 18.—to deny his foreknowledg of
the certainty of that which is not certain,</hi> &amp;c.
which is as much as to say that there are
some things that are Uncertain and
therefore Unknowable, and these God
can have no knowledg of. And yet
thirdly, he would seem to hint that <hi>it is
a dishonourable thing to God</hi> (those are his
words) that he should not have a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of these things. Thus Confused is
our Author, which shews he is not fit to
be an <hi>Examiner</hi> of other mens Writings,
when he can't write Consistently himself,
but in three or four lines hath as many
Blunders.</p>
               <p>In the next words and what follows
he perfectly gives up the Cause, <hi>p.</hi> 18.
for I had laid this to the charge of the
<hi>Racovians</hi> that they denied the <hi>Immensity</hi>
or <hi>Omnipresence</hi> of God, which is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
or Perfection never to be disjoyn'd
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49159:76"/>
from the Deity; whereupon he tamely
acknowledges that <hi>Crellius</hi> and the rest
of the Fraternity are of this perswasion.
Only, because the Gentleman must be
wagging his tongue, he gives us a scrap
out of a <hi>Latin Poet,</hi> and just names a
<hi>Greek Father,</hi> who never said any thing
to that matter, and so we are rid of them.</p>
               <p>But he comes on again, and goes off
assoon, for he barely mentions the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality</hi>
of God, which I had asserted to be
another Divine Excellency: and it is
such an Attribute of God that we can't
conceive of him without it, and therefore
it is made the short and comprehensive
Definition of him that <hi>he is a Spirit, Iohn</hi>
4. 24. In my Discourse which this <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminator</hi>
calls in question I took notice
that the <hi>Socinians</hi> denied this Property of
the Deity, which I justly tax'd as an
<hi>Atheistick Tang:</hi> and I think it was a
mild term, for it is a Rank Sign of a great
tendency to Atheism to deny that God is
a <hi>Spirit, i. e.</hi> an Immaterial Incorporeal
Being. But our present Author resolves
himself into the opinion of those <hi>modest
Divines</hi> (who by their Blushing can be
no other than <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Scholars) who
determine nothing about the Point;
which is as much as to say, he and they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49159:77"/>
deny it. But you must know they are
now a little upon their Credit: this
Gentleman (who speaks in the name of
the rest) had before given up the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity</hi>
and <hi>Omniscience</hi> of God, and
therefore it is high time now to be upon
the Reserve, and to pause a little, that
the world may not see that they reject
All those Properties of the Deity which
I mention'd. But notwithstanding this
cunning practice of theirs, the world
may see, yea, it cannot but plainly see
that they deny every one of these Divine
Attributes more or less, and this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
which I mention'd last, <hi>viz.</hi>
that <hi>God is a Spirit</hi> properly so call'd.
For whereas I quoted <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Crellius</hi>
(their Grand Patriots) to prove this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
this Writer takes no notice of my
doing so, which lets us see that the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of those Great Masters is humbly
submitted to by all the rest.</p>
               <p>So now I hope the Reader is convinc'd
that I was not <hi>Vnjust</hi> to the <hi>Socinians,</hi>
that I did not <hi>highly injure</hi> them (as they
have cried out) when I charg'd them
with <hi>Atheism</hi> or a <hi>Strong Tendency</hi> to it
in some Points. I tax'd them with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
these four Attributes, the <hi>Self-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,</hi>
the <hi>Omniscience,</hi> the <hi>Omnipotence,</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:49159:77"/>
the <hi>Spirituality of God,</hi> and lo! this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Son of <hi>Socinus</hi> (who was chosen
out with great deliberation and judgment
without doubt from the rest of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to undertake the Cause, to refute
what I had alledg'd against them, and
who questionless hath said all that he
could in the Case) lo! I say, this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
and <hi>known Writer of the Brotherhood</hi>
confirms and ratifies what I have laid to
their charge. For he produces the words
out of their own Author which I referr'd
to, whence it appears that he had a mind
to distort the Right Reverend Bishop of
<hi>Worcester</hi>'s words, and to argue against
the <hi>Self-Existence</hi> of God. This <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator</hi>
without any more ado rejects the
Second and third Attributes, and by his
boggling at the fourth we know what
must be the fate of that. Thus he and
his fellow-Criminals being conscious to
the truth and Justice of the Charge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
themselves <hi>Guilty.</hi> They are so far
from clearing themselves of the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Enditement that they Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
it. I leave the Reader to give the
<hi>Sentence.</hi> They deserve a Severe one at
his hands, but I desire him to be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
for the sake of our Lord JESUS
CHRIST, who forgave and pray'd for
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49159:78"/>
his greatest Opposers. May the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Merciful
God forgive them, and enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
their minds, that they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of their Errors, and heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them. The Lord <hi>give them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
to the acknowledging of the truth,
that they may recover themselves out of the
snare of the devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he runs to their <hi>Common Place,</hi>
which hath help'd to fill up their papers
many a time, and he thinks he doth
great feats. But he only epitomizes <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
de Vno Deo Patre,</hi> and offers a great
many Texts <hi>which have been answered a
hundred times,</hi> as he (but untruly) saith
on another occasion, <hi>p.</hi> 8. This takes
up 18 or 19 whole Pages: and why?
Because this costs him nothing, he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
it all (and he might have borrow'd
a great deal more) from the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
Here he can afford to be very long
and large, but when he undertakes the
<hi>Examination</hi> of what I had <hi>particularly
objected</hi> against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> he is like
the dog at <hi>Nilus,</hi> he is presently gone:
he is not furnish'd with any Answer that
he dares insist upon, or trust to.</p>
               <p>Next, I will observe to the Reader
that this Author meddles not with my
<hi>Argument</hi> which I drew from their own
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49159:78"/>
                  <hi>Professed Principle, viz.</hi> that <hi>nothing is
to be believed but what is exactly adjusted to
Reason,</hi> and thence prov'd that upon
the same account that they reject the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Holy <hi>Trinity</hi> they may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
quit the belief of a <hi>Deity.</hi> This I
enlarg'd upon in seven pages together,
it being (as I then conceiv'd, and am
more confirm'd in it since) an Unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Proof of what I laid to their Charge.
He only grazes on it a little, <hi>p.</hi> 19. but
wheels off presently, and fixes upon that
subject before mentioned, <hi>God's Vnity,</hi>
because he knew where to have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of it, but did not know how
to take off the force of that <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
which I propounded and insisted
upon.</p>
               <p>In the next place he will turn <hi>Critick,</hi>
and see whether he can thrive in this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
seeing he hath so ill success in
his former attempts. His nice palate
disgusts the word <hi>birth,</hi> as applyed to
<hi>Adam, p.</hi> 38. but thereby he only shews
his want of skill in the Denotation of
words. He is so poor a Dabbler in <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
and <hi>Criticism</hi> that he knows not that
by the Hebrew <hi>jalad,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the Latin <hi>nasci,</hi> and
accordingly our English [<hi>to be born</hi>] are
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49159:79"/>
signified in a <hi>general</hi> way the <hi>Origin, Rise,</hi>
or <hi>Beginning</hi> of things or persons, and
consequently <hi>Birth</hi> or <hi>Nativity</hi> is not to
be taken always in the Vulgar Sense.
He might have read in <hi>Genethliack</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that the word is applied even to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
and <hi>Houses.</hi> But I need not go so
far to defend the Expression. The use
of it, and that in the very way that I
have applied it, is to be found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<hi>Art thou the first man that was born?
Iob</hi> 15. 7. Or we may read it, if we
please, more exactly according to the
Original, <hi>Art thou born as the first man, or
Adam, i. e.</hi> (as the Context will shew
it) art thou as understanding as the
man that was <hi>first born, viz.</hi> as our
First Parent <hi>Adam?</hi> By reason of this
<hi>birth Adam</hi> is call'd <hi>the son of God, Luk.</hi>
3. 38. Whence the <hi>Socinians</hi> would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that <hi>Christ</hi> hath that name upon the
like account, because of his Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Original,</hi> because of his Miraculous
<hi>Birth.</hi> Thus we have found that this
Gentleman is ignorant of the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of words in <hi>Common Authors,</hi> that he
doth not know the acception of them in
<hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> nay that he doth not
know what his <hi>own Authors</hi> say, which
evinces him to be triply a <hi>Blunderer,</hi> and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49159:79"/>
that he deserves no more to be call'd an
<hi>Examinator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he thinks he doth mighty things,
<hi>p.</hi> 39. by quoting <hi>Limborch</hi> a very Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Foreigner (a <hi>System-maker,</hi> for he
hath compiled a Large <hi>System</hi> of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
though he gives it another Name;
and why then doth this Gentleman talk
so reproachfully of <hi>Systems? p. 44. &amp;c.</hi>)
but this his Author is a <hi>Second Episcopius;</hi>
and therefore it was wisely done to bring
him in to tell us what are the <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi>
of Religion.</p>
               <p>But it was more cunningly done in the
next Paragraph to fetch in the <hi>Sixth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi>
of the <hi>Church of England</hi> in favour of
the <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s Conceit. Surely this his
Patron, at whose feet he lays his Papers,
will give him little thanks for this, for
he jeers him rather than defends his Cause.
Thus though they are agreed, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
one another so far as to Impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the world, yet they cannot (and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
will) agree to speak Truth. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this Worthy Writer foresignified
something of this nature. He is a <hi>boding</hi>
sort of man, you may perceive, for thus
he speaks in his Humble Dedicatory to
the Vindicator, <hi>If I have mistaken your
sense, or used weak reasonings in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:49159:80"/>
(and behold! here he doth both)
<hi>I crave your pardon.</hi> And so you may,
and I will tell you for your comfort, he
will soon forgive you, for he knows that
your heart is right, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the Good
Cause, and therefore a little Mistaking
of him out of weakness is pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Then he hales in <hi>Mr. Chillingworth</hi> by
head and shoulders, <hi>p.</hi> 40. pronouncing
him very definitively <hi>the ablest defender
of the Religion of Protestants that the
Church ever had;</hi> which is too high a
Character for him, though he was a
person of Great Parts and Learning.
Why must he be said to be <hi>the Ablest
Defender</hi> when we can name so many
Eminent Writers in other Countreys
that have perform'd this task? Or, if
he means the <hi>Church of England,</hi> why
must he have the absolute Preference to
Others that we can name here, especially
that Great Ornament and Glory of our
Church, whom I had occasion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before, who hath so Learnedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
the <hi>Religion of Protestants?</hi> I,
but he writ against <hi>Crellius,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he must not be the <hi>Ablest Defender.</hi>
Again, there is a reason well known to
the world why Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> hath
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49159:80"/>
the <hi>Preheminence</hi> in the opinion of this
Writer and his Confederates, but of that
at some other time perhaps. Let us
now go on, and see what this Gentleman
gets by his producing of Mr. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth;</hi>
and it is no other than this, a plain
confutation of the <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s Project con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the reducing of Religion to a
Point, and no more. For these are that
Worthy Man's words, <hi>The Bible, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
I say the Bible only is the Religion of
Protestants.</hi> And I say so too, but this
Gentleman and the Author of <hi>the Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of Christianity</hi> are of another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
for according to them it is not the
<hi>Bible,</hi> but a very <hi>Small Portion</hi> of it that
is the <hi>Religion of Protestants.</hi> They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
that Some few Verses in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Chapters of the <hi>Four Evangelists</hi> and
the <hi>Acts</hi> are matter of Faith or Religion,
but they do not cry <hi>the Bible, the Bible, the
Bible,</hi> they do not think that All and Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of the Fundamental Truths in the
Whole Scripture are the necessary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of our Belief. Thus I think this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Scribe might have spared the
quoting of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> unless he
delights in confuting himself and his
New Convert.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:49159:81"/>
Afterwards he nibbles at some other
passages in my Discourse, but flies off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Impertinencies. Only one thing I
meet with that is very Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and I request the Reader to attend
to it. <hi>There are</hi> (saith he) <hi>some that-of
Deists have been reconciled to the Christian
faith by the Vnitarian books, and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd much satisfaction therein, p.</hi> 42.
You may perceive that they are making
of <hi>Proselytes</hi> as fast as they can, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest some <hi>Deists</hi> come in to
them, and so (as the Apostle speaks of
Seducers and those that are Seduced,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20.) <hi>the latter end is worse with
them than the beginning:</hi> for whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they owned a <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> now
they become guilty of perverting and
prophaning a <hi>Revealed</hi> one. They are
so far from being <hi>reconciled to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Faith,</hi> that they oppose and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
it, and even defie the <hi>Main Articles</hi>
of this Religion which is owing to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation. Such Converts as
these have no reason to <hi>profess much satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in the Vnitarian books,</hi> unless Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
the Christian saith be to be chosen
before plain <hi>Theism.</hi> To speak the plain
truth (and it is the design of these Papers
to do so) and that which every Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49159:81"/>
and Considering Man cannot but
discern, the <hi>Socinians</hi> are but the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
men of the <hi>Deists,</hi> and they are set
on work by them, for these latter hope
to compass their Design, which is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the Credit of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi>
and of those <hi>Inspired Writings</hi> which give
us an account of it, they hope (I say)
effectually to compass this design by the
help of such Good Instruments as they
find the <hi>Socianiz'd</hi> Men to be. You see
then what ground this Gentleman hath
to think that the <hi>Deists</hi> are Proselytes to
the <hi>Vnitarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he proceeds to make a long ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue
about the <hi>Obscurity of Systematical
Fundamentals, p.</hi> 44. &amp;c. but never was
poor Creature so bewildred as he is.
Only he happily lights upon the <hi>Quakers,
p.</hi> 44, 45. where it is worth observing
that the man doth not know his Friends
from his Foes, nor these from them.
He rails against this sort of men (who
he saith would be counted <hi>the only People
of God</hi>) and yet it is certain that they are
his brethren-<hi>Socinians. They utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
the Scripture as the Rule of Faith,</hi> he
saith: and doth not our late <hi>Socinian</hi>
Writer symbolize with them when he
declares that the Divine Truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49159:82"/>
in the <hi>Epistles</hi> of the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
(which are a considerable part of
<hi>Scripture</hi>) are not the Necessary matter
of Faith? He complains that <hi>the Quakers
turn the Gospel into an Allegory;</hi> but the
foremention'd Author doth much worse,
for he represents the greatest Part of the
Gospel-discoveries as Superfluous and
Needless. In giving us the farther Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he in lively colours
represents the <hi>Socinians,</hi> for these are his
words concerning them, <hi>Retaining still
the words wherein the Christian Faith is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
though in an Equivocal Sense, they
have made a shift to be reputed generally Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>
Certainly there could not be a
better Pourtraiture of the <hi>Racovian</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
for it is known that they are
crafty and sophistical, and quote Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
only to pervert it. They acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<hi>Christ</hi> to be <hi>God,</hi> and an <hi>Expiatory
Sacrifice,</hi> but they mean it <hi>Equivocally;</hi>
they quit the true <hi>sense</hi> of Scripture
though they retain the <hi>words,</hi> and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this latter <hi>have made a shift</hi> (as this
Author speaks) <hi>to pass for Christians.</hi>
These men (whatever some few <hi>English</hi>
Writers of the <hi>Racovian</hi> way hold of
late) exactly side with the <hi>Quakers</hi> in
crying down of <hi>Water-Baptism</hi> (for so
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49159:82"/>
they both call it in derision.) In the
Grand Point of the <hi>Trinity</hi> they both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,
<hi>i. e.</hi> to reject it, witness <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s
<hi>Sandy Foundation,</hi> by which he means
the doctrine of the <hi>Blessed Trinity.</hi> In a
quibbling manner, wherein he shews
both his Ignorance and Blasphemy, he
thus speaks,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>W. Pen</hi>'s Sandy Foundation, <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>If God, as the Scriptures
testifie, hath never been declared or believed
but as the</hi> HOLY ONE, <hi>then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that God is not an</hi> HOLY THREE.
<hi>Neither can this receive the least prejudice
from that frequent, but impertinent distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that he is One in Substance, but
Three in Persons or Subsistencies.</hi> To
which all <hi>Socinus</hi>'s followers say <hi>Amen.</hi>
The same Gentleman derides the doctrine
of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and scoffingly calls the
Asserters of it<note n="†" place="bottom">Sandy Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Satisfactionists:</hi> and
who knows not that <hi>Transylvania</hi> agrees
here with <hi>Pensylvania? The Man that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
at Ierusalem</hi> is the <hi>Socinian</hi> as well
as the <hi>Quakers Stile:</hi> And generally as to
the main things that relate to our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi>
they perfectly accord, <hi>viz.</hi> in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing of them. If <hi>Quakerism</hi> then
<hi>be no Christianity,</hi> as this our Writer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49159:83"/>
it in the same place, then we may
with much more reason conclude that
<hi>Socinianism is none.</hi> By this it appears
that <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Fox</hi> are well met, and
that they are very Loving Friends. But
they must seem to disagree, as here in
this Gentleman's Papers.</p>
               <p>Lastly, let us see the wonderful hand
of God in suffering this Unthoughtful
Writer to produce <hi>a Paper written by a
Iesuite in the late Reign, entituled an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress,</hi>
&amp;c. And in this Address, he saith,
<hi>he goes about to shew that the Scriptures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
alledg'd for the Trinity, admit of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sense. He goes the same way in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Incarnation.</hi> What! had he
not enough of the <hi>Quaker</hi> but he must
bring in the <hi>Iesuite?</hi> And must he tell
the world that the <hi>Iesuitical</hi> Writers take
the part of the <hi>Socinians?</hi> must he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
give notice that they both carry
on the same work, and joyntly conspire
to pervert the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in order to it?
For the credit of the Cause, it had been
better to have placed this under a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
head, and to have told the Reader
that some <hi>Iesuites</hi> (as well as some <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists</hi>)
are <hi>Converts</hi> to <hi>Socinianism.</hi> But
he hath blurted it out that <hi>Ignatius Loyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
and <hi>Faustus Socinus</hi> were of kin. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49159:83"/>
this Author must not be employ'd any
more to write in defence of the Cause.
He must be no longer a <hi>Double-Column'd</hi>
Writer: they must look out for a man
that is not so Open-hearted, one that can
handle his Weapon with more Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
for this man hath stabb'd his own
Cause.</p>
               <p>But because this Writer in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and towards the end of his
Papers is pleas'd to use some words of
Deference and Respect, I will not be
backward to return his Civility in the
same kind by letting him know that I
suppose him to be a <hi>Person of Ingenuity
and Learning</hi> (only I wirh he had <hi>shew'd</hi>
it in his late Undertaking) and that <hi>I
would not have made opposition to him in any
other Points</hi> but These which are the
Foundation, Basis and Ground-work of
<hi>Christianity,</hi> and the very Life and Soul
of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and therefore none is to
be permitted to treat them <hi>irreverently</hi>
and <hi>scoffingly,</hi> as he and his Associates
have lately done. But I entertain some
hope that this Unsavoury <hi>Tang</hi> will wear
off in time.</p>
               <p>And thus I have finished both my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies</hi>
to the Gentlemen's Writings against
me: and I have wholly confined my
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49159:84"/>
self to these, and not ventured to guess
at their Persons, or make any Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of that kind, for that is a thing
which I abhor. Nay, though the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator</hi>
by his reflecting upon my <hi>Degree,
p.</hi> 24. and 36. and <hi>Calling, p.</hi> 36, and
before, <hi>p.</hi> 26, and before that, <hi>p.</hi> 9.
had given me occasion to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Quality and Character, yet I
purposely forbore to meddle with any
such Considerations. And so as to the
<hi>Examinator,</hi> I could easily have traced
his Person and Station, and offer'd some
Remarks upon either, but I made it not
my business to observe Who they were
that wrote, but what they had written.
And it was necessary to do this latter
with some Salt and Keenness, that the
levity of their Arguments might be the
better exposed, and that I might in a
lawful and innocent way retaliate that
Liberty which they had taken. And
indeed the <hi>Socinian</hi> Gentlemen must
shew themselves very Disingenuous
(which I will not presume of them)
if they be dissatisfied with me for my
Freedom of discourse, when in all their
Writings they profess to use it. And
it is plain that they make use of it: for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49159:84"/>
who sees not that<note n="*" place="bottom">Considerations on the Explications of the doctrine of the Trinity.</note> they have been
very sharp upon some of the most
Eminent and Venerable Persons of our
Church? They have handled the late
Archbishop and some of his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Brethren (who in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
shewed their dislike of the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
doctrines) with no excess of
Respect: And they represent them
and the whole Clergy as Mercenary,
Timerous, and False hearted: They
would perswade the world that the
doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> is defended by
them merely because they are bribed
or forced to it. And others of their
Writers have been very severe upon
the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> in their late Prints.
And therefore with good reason some
of These have been free with them
again, especially that Worthy Person
who undertook the Defence of the
<hi>Archbishop</hi> and the <hi>Bishop of Worcester,</hi>
and hath with great Vivacity and
Sharpness reflected on the <hi>Socinian</hi>
Errors, and with as great Solidity
and Composedness establish'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Truths, and hath not spared
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49159:85"/>
that Socinian Author whom he grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
with, no not in the least.
I suppose none will grudg <hi>me</hi> that
Freedom which this Gentleman and
others have taken in their <hi>Replies</hi> to
the <hi>Racovian</hi> Writers, especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I have not (as I conceive) made
ill use of it. But of that let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
