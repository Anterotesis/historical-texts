         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALmighty God, the Sovereign Commander of all the VVorld, in whoſe hand is power and might, which nothing is able to withſtand; To thee alone we owe our Deliverance from thoſe many and great Dangers wherewith we were ſo Iately Encompaſſed. It is thou alone that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt the VVinds and the Seas, and they obey thee: Thou takeſt the crafty in their own Counſels, and turneſt the wiſdom of the wiſe into fooliſhneſs.
<pb facs="tcp:103538:4"/>
And as if this were a ſmall thing with thee, thou didſt not only ſave us from our Enemies, but deliver them into our hands, and give Their Majeſties Fleet a moſt Signal and Glorious Victory over them. Bleſſed be God who hath not turned away our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor his Mercy from us, notwithſtanding our many and great Provocations: Therefore not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name be the Glory. And let this be the bleſſed fruit of all thy wonderful Mercies, that we may turn every one from the evil of his way, and may live as a People that have been, in ſo many remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the peculiar and viſible care of thy Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: That thou mayeſt ſtill delight to do us good, and our Arms by Sea and Land may be ſucceſsful to the Eſtabliſhing of Truth and Pence in theſe and the Neighbouring Nations, to the Glory of thy great Name, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GReat and glorious Lord God, the juſt and wiſe Governour of the VVorld, who loveſt righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hateſt iniquity: VVe Adore that merciful and wonderful Providence which hath given ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable a Check to the Pride and Power of the Enemy, by the great Succeſs of Their Majeſties Fleet in this laſt Summers Expedition. It is thou, O Lord, that haſt been our Defence and Refuge in the Day of our Trouble. Thou haſt ſhewn us won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things in thy righteouſneſs, O God of our ſalvation, thou that art the hope of all the ends of the Earth, and of them that remain in the wide Sea. To thee alone we aſcribe the Glory of all our Deliverances: For it was not our own arm that ſaved us, but thy right Hand, and thine Arm, and the light of thy Countenance, becauſe thou hadſt a favour unto us: Vnto thee therefore, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks,
<pb facs="tcp:103538:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who haſt wrought this mighty ſalvation for us: Stabliſh, O God, that which thou haſt wrought for us: And give us, we beſeech thee, ſuch a dutiful and deep ſence of thy goodneſs to us, that we may live as becomes a People ſaved by the Lord. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, we pray thee, from among us all Infidelity and Profaneneſs; purge us from all our abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; take away all Hatred and Diſſentions: And endue us with a Spirit of true Piety and Holineſs, of Love and Goodneſs, of Vnity and Concord: that the Bleſſings of Peace, together with the Purity of Religion may he ſecured to us, and continued to our Poſterity; for the Merits of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord and Saviour. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ The Collect for Peace.</p>
            <p>O God, who art the author of Peace, and lover of Concord, in knowledge of whom ſtandeth our eternal life, whoſe Service is perfect freedom; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us thy humble ſervants in all Aſſaults of our enemies, that we ſurely truſting in thy defence, may not fear the power of any adverſaries, through the might of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ The Collect for Grace.</p>
            <p>O Lord our heavenly Father, Almighty and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting God, who haſt ſafely brought us to the beginning of this day; defend us in the ſame with thy mighty power, and grant that this day we fall into no ſin, neither run into any kind of danger; but that all our doings may be ordered by thy govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to do always that is righteous in thy ſight, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>BY faith Moſes when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, becauſe they ſaw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the kings commandment. By faith Moſes, when he was come to years, refuſed to be called the ſon of Pharaohs daughter; chuſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a
<pb facs="tcp:103538:9"/>
ſeaſon; eſteeming the reproch of Chriſt greater riches then the treaſures in Egypt: for he had reſpect unto the recompence of the reward. By faith he forſook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured as ſeeing him who is inviſible. Through faith he kept the paſſover, and the ſprinkling of bloud, left he that deſtroyed the firſt-born, ſhould touch them. By faith they paſſed through the Red ſea, as by dry land: which the Egyptians aſſaying to do, were drowned. By faith the walls of Iericho fell down, after they were compaſſed about ſeven days. By faith the harlot Rahab periſhed not with them that believed not, when ſhe had received the ſpies with peace. And what ſhall I more ſay: for the time would fall me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samſon, and of Iephthae, of David alſo and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, and of the prophets: VVho through faith ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued kingdoms, wrought righteouſneſs, obtained promiſes, ſtopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, eſcaped the edge of the ſword, out of weakneſs were made ſtrong, wared valiant in ſight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</p>
            <p>¶ The Goſpel. St. <hi>Matth.</hi> V. verſe 43. to the end.</p>
            <p>YE have heard that it hath been ſaid, Thou ſhall love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy: But I ſay unto you, Love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you: That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven, for he maketh his ſun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt and on the unjuſt. For if ye love them which love you, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward have ye: do not even the publicans the ſame: And if ye ſalute your brethren only, what do you more
<pb facs="tcp:103538:9"/>
then others? do not even the publicans ſo: he ye therefore perſon, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</p>
            <p>¶ Then the Nicene Creen. After that the Sermon.</p>
            <p>¶ After the Prayer [<hi>For the whole State of Chriſts Church,</hi> &amp;c.] this Collect ſhall be uſed.</p>
            <p>MOſt Glorious Lord God, whoſe Throne is in the Heavens, and whoſe Kingdom ruleth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all; VVho doſt whatſoever pleaſeth thee, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and in Earth, and in the Sea: Thou, Lord, haſt been our Refuge from one Generation to another: Our fathers truſted in thee, and thou didſt deliver them; they called upon thee, and were not confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: VVe bleſs thy Name that thou haſt alſo heard the voice of our humble petitions, which we did put up to thee in the day of our Diſtreſs; and haſt not only kept us in peace at home, and graciouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved us from the malicious Deſigns of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies abroad, and from that Deſtruction which they bad prepared for us; but haſt likewiſe been pleaſed to bleſs their Majeſties Fleet with a moſt-won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Succeſs, and haſt triumphed gloriouſly over the powerful Enemy: VVhat ſhall we render unto thee, O Lord, for all theſe benefits: VVe will love the Lord who hath inclined his ear unto us, and call upon him as long as we live: Vnto thee, O God, will we pay our vows, unto thee will we give thanks. And grant, we beſeech thee, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered from the hands of our Enemies, we may ſerve thee without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before thee all the days of our lives: That thou who haſt hitherto been our Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Deliverer, mayeſt be pleaſed to eſtabliſh Truth and Peace in the midſt of us; to the glory
<pb facs="tcp:103538:10"/>
of thy great Name, the comfort and ſupport of the Reformed Churches abroad, the propagation of the Goſpel, and the enlargement of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of thy dear Sou: VVhich we beſeech thee to haſten, that all Nations may fall down and worſhip before thee, ſaying, Bleſſing, and Glory, and VViſdom, and Honour, and Power be unto our God for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Relieve them according to their ſeveral neceſſities; be a ſhelter and defence to them from the fury of the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour: Let the ſighing of the Priſoners come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and according to the greatneſs of thy Power preſerve them that are appointed to die: Let not the poor always be forgotten; let not the patient abiding of the meek periſh for ever.

gracious Promiſe, in the manifold Bleſſings of this and a better Life: Deliver Iſrael, O God, out of all his Troubl;es. And we beſeech thee to enlighten all thoſe who are in Darkneſs and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and to give them Repentance to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the Truth: That all the ends of the Earth may remember themſelves and be turned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord: And we may all become one Flock under the great Shepherd and Biſhop of our ſouls, Ieſus Chriſt, our Bleſſed Saviour and Redeemer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
