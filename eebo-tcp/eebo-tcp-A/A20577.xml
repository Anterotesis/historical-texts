            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Kings of <hi>England</hi> thought
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10307:14"/>
to conferre vpon their Prince and Heire appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant an eſtate of fee ſimple in the lands that they beſtowed vpon him; for a leſſer then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance had not beene anſwerable to ſo greate a dignitie. And yet they were not willing to giue him any larger eſtate, then ſuch as ſhould extinguiſh againe in the Crowne when he came to bee King or dyed; for that hee being King ſhould alſo haue the like power to create the Prince ce of his Heire apparant, and to inueſt him into that dignitie as he being the father was inueſted by his Progenitor. For the wiſdome of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was ſuch, as that they would not depriue them ſelues of that honour but that euery of them might make new Creations and inueſtures of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie to their eldeſt ſonne or next ſucceeding Heire apparant; and that thoſe Lands ſo giuen vnto the Prince, might when he was King be annexed, knit and vnited againe to the Crowne, and out of the Crowne to be of new conferred; which could not ſo haue been, if thoſe Lands had been giuen to the Prince and his Heires generalls, for then the Lands ſo giuen would haue reſted in the natural perſon of the Princes, after they came to the Kingdome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Crown Lands, &amp; might, as the caſe ſhould happen diſcend to others then thoſe which were his Heires apparant to the Crowne. And herein I do obſerue a difference between the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie of <hi>Wales</hi> giuen to the Prince, and the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of <hi>Cornwall</hi> giuen vnto him. For euery Prince needeth and ſoe hath had a new Creation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſture. But he is Duke of <hi>Cornewall</hi> as ſoone as he

               <p>This Territorie was anciently reputed a Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but a little before, and alſo after the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, it was an Earledome, and ſo continued vntill the eleuenth yeere of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, at which time it was of new conſtituted a Dutchie, and the firſt Dutchie that was erected in <hi>England</hi> after the ſaid conqueſt.</p>
               <p>Such as were Earles thereof in ancient time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the erection of the ſaid Dutchie, were for the moſt part of the bloud Royall; amongſt whom, many being memorable, there was as moſt ancient, <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> the elect Emperour, or King of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> brother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third; but his poſterity dying without iſſue, it came againe to the Crowne in the daies of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt; who conferred the ſaid Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vpon <hi>Edward,</hi> the Prince his ſonne, ſirna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of <hi>Carnaruon;</hi> who being King, conferred the ſame vpon his Minion <hi>Pierce de Gaueſton;</hi> but hee being afterwards attainted of Treaſon, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the ſame Earledome was beſtowed vpon <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſirnamed of <hi>Eltam,</hi> becauſe hee was borne there; yonger brother to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; who dying likewiſe without iſſue, it was laſtly erected

into a Dutchy (as hath beene ſaid) and conferred vpon <hi>Edward,</hi> afterward ſurnamed, the black Prince, in the eleuenth yeere of the raigne of the ſaid King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, his father.</p>
               <p>Therefore the ſaid King <hi>Edward</hi> purpoſing to augment the title, of his ſaid ſonne, did in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament holden in the eleuenth yeere of his reigne, create not only the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> then before made Earle of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> to be Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> but alſo to honor that publique proceeding the more, did at the ſame time create diuers and ſundry worthy perſons, and well deſeruing, to ſundry dignities of nobility, as by the records extant thereof, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
               <p>The manner of the firſt creation of the Duke of <hi>Cornwall</hi> was very ſpeciall, for the ſaid dignity was conferred vnto the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> then Earle of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and to the firſt begotten ſonnes and heires apparant of him, and his heires Kings of <hi>England</hi> for euer. So that it ſeemeth that the intention thereof was, firſt that none ſhould bee Dukes of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> but ſuch as were eldeſt ſonnes and heires apparant to the Crowne; and that when there was any faile of ſuch perſon, then the ſaid dignity ſhould remaine inſuſpence, vntill ſuch ſon &amp; heire apparant againe were extant. Secondly, that the ſaid ſonne and heire apparant without any further ſolemnity or creation, ſhould preſently vpon his birth being then heire apparant, to the King, or from the time that hee is heire apparant to the

mettall, and this is alſo of two ſorts, <hi>ſoft Tynne,</hi> which is beſt merchantable, and <hi>hard Tynne,</hi> which is leaſt merchantable; It is not lawfull by the law of Tynners, and it is by the ancient Charters of the priuiledges granted by the Kings of <hi>England</hi> vnto the Tynners, expreſly forbidden vnder for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiture of the Tynne, that no Tynne ſhall be ſold within euery of the ſaid Counties, either blacke or white Tynne, but onely at two ſet times of the yeere, at places appointed; in which places, all the vendable Tynne in the ſaid ſeuerall Counties is brought, and there by the Officers of the Duke, the ſame is weighed by a Beame, and weights thereto appointed, and after the ſame is coyned with a ſtampe, it is thereupon allowed to be ſold, and not before; for which weighing and ſtampe, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the Coynage, there is due to the Lord <hi>Prince,</hi> as Duke of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> the ſumme of 40. s. for euery thouſand weight of Tynne ſo weighed and coyned, which is parcell of the caſuall reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the ſaid Dutchie, and firſt granted by King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, vnto the Duke of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> and annexed vnto the ſaid Dutchie by the name of Coynage of Tynne.</p>
