         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE
Apologetical
To the
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Pretence to ſatisfy
every Reader, were
as ridiculous, as
his attempt, who
ſtudied to make a
garment for the
Moon, that might fit her in every
interchange: and as unlikely to
ſucceed, as his enterpriſe, who with
a diſh of one reliſh, would ſatisfy
every Palate. I am ſo farre from
that imagination, that I thinke it a
deſign elegible, rather to diſpleaſe
ſome (whom I cannot gain) by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the truth, then (for ſome
politick ends) in ſilence to ſhew ſuch
a neutrality and indifferency of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb facs="tcp:170264:5"/>
as might indulge a vitious and
factious world. I deſire ſolemnly in
this caſe to apply St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to my ſelf, <hi>If I yet pleaſed men,
I ſhould not be the ſervant of
Chriſt.</hi> I know I ſhall diſpleaſe
moſt, its enough if I pleaſe the beſt,
<hi>(Principibus placuiſſe viris, &amp;c.)</hi>
and not diſ-ſatisfy any mind, that is
not vitiated with prophaneneſſe,
prejudice, or faction. I account
the acceptance of one good man, of
weight enough to out-ballance the
contempt of a thouſand; and if I
can adminiſter an argument of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
to one ſober mind, it ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate
the ſcorn and diſpleaſure of
ten thouſand. When it was objected
to a Tragedian, that <hi>Plato</hi> onely
was preſent, his anſwer was, <hi>(Et
hic unus Plato plus eſt quam
Athenienſis populus,)</hi> and that
one <hi>Plato</hi> is more then all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Athens</hi> beſides: ſuch an
eſtimation I have of every honeſt
pious perſon, though of the loweſt
order. Nevertheleſſe, leſt I ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:170264:5"/>
ſeem moroſe or Cynical, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to take off the exceptions of
three ſorts of Readers; to whom I
humbly tender this ſatisfaction:
Firſt, to my prudent Friendly-Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
2. To the Learned-Reader.
3. To the piouſly-affected, yet diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in judgement.</p>
            <p>Firſt, my Friendly-Reader will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
queſtion my prudence, in thus
adventuring my ſelf on the publick
ſtage, in this ſad ſcene of Church-affairs.
He tells me, there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in it; for though ſuch truths
be as clear and neceſſary as the Sun,
yet like the Sun I muſt make my
way through a Zodiack of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences:
here the privy and ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinch
of a detracting <hi>Cancer,</hi> there
the poyſonous ſting of a malicious
<hi>Scorpio,</hi> every where the ſharp ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
the bitter invectives of the
worlds <hi>Sagittarii.</hi> For his ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
let him turn his eye on the
foregoing leafe, and that intimates
my deſign, and reaſons for it; which
is to ſecure the beloved ſoules of my
<pb facs="tcp:170264:6"/>
Pariſh, and the tender plants of
my family, from the invaſion of
common errours; which like an
Epidemical diſeaſe, propagate their
infection every where, and do ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably
(without a great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from heaven) ſubject poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to great departures from the
faith of Chriſt. So my full anſwer
will be: It is at all times the beſt
prudence to ſerve God, and in this
caſe it is truer wiſdome to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring
to the ſalvation of ſoules,
then to ſell our duties to God,
for the unſafe hope of a worldly
advantage. If any ſoul fayles for
want of any help, that is in my cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
it falls with its own infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and my ſin. The rule of the
Schoole herein is without diſpute,
<hi>(Cauſa deficiens in neceſſariis,
eſt efficiens)</hi> he pulls down, that
holds not up. And a Chriſtian,
who declines his duty, for fear of
ſuffering, hath in a great meaſure
betrayed his profeſsion of Chriſt.
I cannot deſpaire, but that many
<pb facs="tcp:170264:6"/>
in the Nation; I can hope, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of my Pariſh, and I am almoſt
aſſured, that many of my family
and near relations, may be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the Faith, and directed (in
their judgements at leaſt) to the
right rules of holineſs, by theſe poor
exerciſes. Now ſuppoſe the leaſt;
If God ſhall pleaſe among all theſe
to bring in but one ſoul by them,
and that but to ſome improvement
of his knowledge only: or if I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that, yet if I have done a ſervice
acceptable to God, I am recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for the worſt evils my Prudent-Reader
can object to me. But my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
friend puts me upon another
task: He fears I muſt paſſe under
the juſt cenſure of doing an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and unneceſſary thing; That I
have digged a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t by the river
(<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) when
the ſtreames of the former, and
this preſent age, have run full and
luxuriant in exerciſes of this kind.
To which I anſwer; that ſuch
Catechiſmes, and inſtitutions, as
<pb facs="tcp:170264:7"/>
have ordinarily been diſperſed
among the people, have ſeemed to me
to have purſued too great an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of private opinion, in deciſions of
controverted and notional points of
Divinity; but to have been too looſe &amp;
general in caſes of conſcionable wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with God and man. They have
alſo generally abetted the doctrines
of tranſmarine Churches, againſt
the ſetled doctrine and diſcipline of
their own Mother-Church: ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
undermining the credit of our
own Apoſtolick determinations,
rather then ſerenely driving at
the ſcope of ſtrict and ſevere holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<hi>Hinc illae lachrimae,</hi> Hence
our woe. For the people (through
ſuch writings and other like inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations)
having been corrupted with
falſe principles, and trained up to
ſiding and intereſts, many of them
(I accuſe not all) knew little other
uſe of their zeal but in oppoſition; nor
of conſcience, but in ſcrupling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differents.
And while they were
puzled with an obligation to look
<pb facs="tcp:170264:7"/>
into the inextricable myſteries of
Gods decrees and Counſels, perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the underſtanding of un-edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
controverſies, and cryed upon
to the duties of getting Chriſt, and
getting Faith, were in the interim,
made ſtrangers to the holy practiſes
of humility, meekneſſe, charity, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-heartednes,
deep-chriſtian-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion,
juſtice, peaceableneſſe, and
the like Chriſtian graces: as by
woeful experience it hath been made
too evident to us. Now ſuch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgments
of the doctrines of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which have run in the Channel
of our own ſetled doctrines, as they
have been few, ſo have they been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
long, or above the capacities of
thoſe, whoſe advantage I princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
deſigne. For being long, they
have diſcouraged many (though of
good capacities) who willingly
would have read them, which
might have been comprehended in
ſome few hours, but were eaſily tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
to decline thoſe, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the reading of many days: And
<pb facs="tcp:170264:8"/>
this diſcouragement became an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable
difficulty to young perſons,
poor ſervants, labourers, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others, whoſe callings required
continual attendance. And though
ſome of them were ſhort, yet being
pend above the reach of ordinary
capacities, they became altogether
uſeleſſe to ſuch young and vulgar
intellects. To avoyd therefore the
inconveniences of both: I have
truly troden in the paths of this
Church, as to the firſt; and I
have endeavoured plainneſſe and
brevity, as to the ſecond. Now
to contract my argument to the
force of a ſatisfaction: There being
none of the former ſort, (that I have
ſeen) which are not (in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure)
chargeable with thoſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
defects: nor any of the latter,
which have not been either prolix,
or too ſublime: I preſume I may
beg the kindneſſe to be beleeved, that
I have done a thing both neceſſary
and ſeaſonable.</p>
            <p>2. In the next place, let not the
<pb facs="tcp:170264:8"/>
learned eye deſpiſe me, that I
appear not with the embroydery of
large quotations, or Chymiſtry
of School-diſtinctions, or that I
have not conjured the plain princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Chriſt, into a circle of ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Such dreſſes ſuits them that
pretend to the chayre, and aſpire to
be inſerted in the Catalogue of the
Learned; or them, whoſe deſign is
to court great and generous minds,
to the love of Chriſt and his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
My buſineſſe is of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
I come to treat the loweſt of
Chriſts School; and ſuch, whom you
may as ſoon nouriſh with ſtones, as
edify with learned diſcourſes, with
whom I labour to make Chriſt to be
underſtood, not to ſhew my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
And if after this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of ſatisfaction to ſuch Readers, I
muſt yet purchaſe their contempt:
my compenſation ſhall be, that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it as much more bleſſed, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
one poor ignorant diſciple of
Chriſt, then to pleaſe the learned
of all ages; as to feed one hungry
<pb facs="tcp:170264:9"/>
ſoul, hath more charity in it, then
to feaſt all the Nobles in the world.
This intimation then of my deſign,
I make my only plea againſt the
ſuch allegations of the learned Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to whoſe ingenuity I appeal.</p>
            <p>3. Laſtly, as to my Reader,
that differs from me in judgement;
I beſeech him upon his chriſtian
charity to beleeve me, that I intend
not controverſie: but have made it
my chief buſineſs, (concurrent with
the mayn drift and ſcope of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
Sermons, the Epiſtles of the
Apoſtles, &amp; indeed of the whole Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
it ſelf) to encourage men in, and
to direct men to holy lives, and
juſt, peaceable, and mercifull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations.
And when I have been
neceſsitated to meet any doubtfull
and diſputable doctrines, (as of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
and abſolute, or conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
decrees of election and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation;
of univerſal, or particular
redemption, and ſuch like, tho de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of which, have adminiſtred
nothing but endleſſe diſceptations to
<pb facs="tcp:170264:9"/>
the learned, and terrours to the
weak) I have not at all dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
but only uſed them, as they
have ſerved the intereſt of holy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
Alwayes giving this rule to
my ſelf, in thoſe intricate contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,
that they are then conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and beleeved with moſt ſafety,
and likelihood to truth, as their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
give the beſt reaſon
and encouragement of living well.
In order to which, if I have unavoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably
declared a difference from thy
judgement in any ſuch poynt, have
but ſo much chriſtian civility, to
beleeve my former profeſſion; and
that the argument that led me to it,
was not to differ from thee, but (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my perſwaſion) to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the doctrines of piety in thee,
and all men: and thou canſt not
but count me worthy of chriſtian
peace from thee. I beg of thee not
to cenſure me haſtily, nor litigiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
leaſt thou over-reach a diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to piety it ſelf; which hath
never ſuffered more, then when the
<pb facs="tcp:170264:10"/>
fiery combats, and unneceſſary
quarrels of Chriſtians, and of
Church-men eſpecially, have run
them into heats, and actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
gravity, and againſt chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and upon ſuch occaſions diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
and undervaluing each other,
have taught the people to ſcorn and
contemn them all, and in the end
religion it ſelf, with which they tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
in needleſſe argumentations.
For it is ſadly notorious, ſince one
Clergy have bitterly inveighed
againſt, and heavily oppreſſed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
about differences in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Service: (which every
thing might have reconciled but
paſſion and ſelf-intereſt) they have
purchaſed a ſlite and contempt, not
only to them, to whom they deſigned
it, but to themſelves alſo in the
greateſt portion, and to Miniſtery
in general: and by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
they have ſhaken the very
foundations of this once renowned
National profeſſion: Which they
may ſoon beleeve, when they behold
<pb facs="tcp:170264:10"/>
ſo univerſal a defection from it, and
that their congregations are thin,
careleſſe, and irregular: the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
unfrequented, and other
Ordinances diſregarded: their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
diſputed; their perſons hated,
their demeans tottering, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny
of illiterate men ready to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
their places; and (which is
moſt ſadly to be lamented) Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it ſelf made an amazement and
a ſcruple. Let ſad experience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and pitty to a poor languiſhing
Church, move us to lay aſide all
perſonal and paſſionate diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and animoſities, which have
produced ſuch miſerable effects, and
draw our contentions to this one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
that we ſtrive together, who
ſhall be moſt forward in the work
of the Lord. All the ſatisfaction
then, that I tender to this kind of
Readers is, That they are obliged to
think me charitable, and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
point I have determined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their perſwaſions, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I made it an argument of
<pb facs="tcp:170264:11"/>
more comfort and diligence in the
profeſſion of Chriſt. And I thank
God I look upon them, and aell men
that differ from me, with no other
eye, then as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachees
(Vivat homo, moriatur
error)</hi> let their errors dye, but let
themſelves be happy.</p>
            <p>Having thus diſ-ingaged my
ſelf from all theſe exceptions; It
remaines only to ſhew the uſe of
theſe enſuing exerciſes: which will
beſt appear, by diſcovering the
gradual progreſſe of my intentions
about them: as they became pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
one of another, by neceſſary
inferences. For I firſt propounded
to my ſelf, only the Catechiſme for
the rules of life: but then I found,
that through the ſeverity of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-obedience
many ſcruples might
invade pious minds, concerning
Gods grace to help to perform them,
&amp; concerning his acceptance of their
infirm obedience to them, which
occaſioned the following treatiſe,
concerning ſatisfactions of doubts
<pb facs="tcp:170264:11"/>
about the doctrines of Grace. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that I conſidered, that many
good minds, ready to ingage in a
religious life, were ſadly perplexed
about the diverſities of profeſſions,
(all ſtrongly pretending to be for
Chriſt) and eſpecially about the
Miniſtery, decryed every where, as
unlawful, and Anttchriſtian:
which (as it became neceſſary) oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
the third part: Satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
doubts concerning the profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Church and Miniſtery.
Then finding that a principal part
of holy life, conſiſted in unceſſant
exerciſe of prayers to God: I
thought it not enough, to invite
men to the duty; but alſo to direct
them to the right performance of
it: which produced the fourth part:
A Manual of Forms of Prayers.
And laſtly, conſidering of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
it is to Religion, to have
children rightly ſeaſoned with pious
principles: I ſubjoyned for that end,
A ſhort Catechiſme to be taught to
them. In all which, if I may be
<pb facs="tcp:170264:12"/>
inſtrumental to any perſons obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ends deſigned: if I may bring
any ſoul to a right chriſtian life,
by the firſt: to a judicious and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hope in Gods mercy, by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond:
to the peace and communion
of the Church, by the third: to
frequent addreſſes to the throne of
grace, by the fourth: and any little
ones to be diſciples of Chriſt, by the
fifth: I ſhall not repent my ſelf of
my adventure, nor want incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

as, that God will blind

like Texts, and inferences from

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That ſuch acts of Gods
juſtice in taking away or deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grace, in reprobating, and
caſting off, are only ſubſequent
to the deſpiſing and neglecting
the foregoing offers of his
grace, and viſitations of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
This truth is fully eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in many inſtances of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
As firſt St.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 24. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the <hi>Romans</hi> affirmes, that
it was, becauſe when <hi>They knew
God, they worſhipped him not as
God, &amp;c. Therefore he gave them
up, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>becauſe they changed
the truth of God into a lye, &amp;c.
Therefore he gave them up to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
mind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In another
place he writes, that the power
of Antichriſt ſhall become effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
to the deſtruction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a lye &amp;c. But it is of ſuch
as before <hi>received not the love of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170264:52"/>
the truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 8.</note> 
               <hi>that they might be ſaved.</hi>
St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us that they to
whom Chriſt ſhould become a
ſtumbling-block, and a Rock
of offence, are ſuch, as were firſt
diſobedient to him. And this
way of God is moſt conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in his dealing with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the Jewes (to whom thoſe
places in the queſtion, chiefly
referre.) For his ſeverity upon
them,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 22</note> was only unto ſuch that
firſt fell from him. They had
a day of mercy which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed,
after which it was juſt
with God to make it a time
of hardening and excluding
them from mercy. Which
when God ſhall ſo do,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 20</note> what
art thou, O man, that thou
ſhouldſt queſtion his juſtice, or
reply againſt him,<note place="margin">V. 21.</note> 
               <hi>who hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
as a Potter over his clay, to make
ſome veſſells to honour, and ſome to
diſhonour?</hi> when ſome accept,
others reject and deſpiſe his
grace. Therefore Gods wayes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170264:53"/>
are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>equal. That this truth
may yet be fully ſignified,<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 5, &amp;c.</note> we
argue that the ſtony and other
unprofitable grounds, wanted
not their ſeed: the unfruitful
tree had its husbandry,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 7.</note> manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and long forbearance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was ſentenced to be cut
down:<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 17</note> The refuſing gueſts at

To conclude,<note place="margin">Luk. 19. 42</note> 
               <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
had a day of viſitation, in which
they neglected the things of
their peace, before the fearful
ſentence was paſt, that they
ſhould be hid from their eyes.
From all which it followes, that
to want grace, to be hardened,
to be a veſſel of diſhonour, can
be no arguments to ſuſpect God
will deny ſuch grace and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ſpiritual aſſiſtancies, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
motives to beware of the
abuſe and neglect of grace
when it is offered, leſt we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit

of an irreſpective decree for the

up my reſt in this one thing, that
I am comfortably confident,
that whatſoever Gods election
and predeſtination is, it doth
not contradict his promiſes of
mercy, nor his end of giving
Chriſt unto the world, both
which (by the univerſal ſcope
of the Goſpel) are general and
conditional. And it is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>England</hi>

that if ſalvation through
Chriſt ſhall be given to them only
that perform the conditions, when
I conſider the weakneſs of my faith,
the defects of my repentance, and
my innumerable failings in every
part of the performancies of holy
living, I find nothing but argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of diſcouragement, and little
hopes of being accepted to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
How may I ſatisfy my ſoul in
ſuch a diſcomfort?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though (as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent)
that the faith, repentance
and holineſſe of Gods beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
have ever been, and ſhall
ever be defective and imperfect,
they being unable, through
their corruptions, perfectly to
perform thoſe Goſpel-conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
yet is God pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170264:55"/>
of their faithfull and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
endeavour to fulfill them.
For the ſtate of Grace doth not

reigning power, rule, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

towards God, is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
by a freedome from all
ſinning, (who then could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before God, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
of his own concience
with comfort?) but is to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by obſervation, that the
ſpiritual part hath the greateſt
predominancy in the thoughts,
affections,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 24.</note> deſignes, and actions;
and that the luſts and carnall
part are leſſe, and every day leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening,
by the power of the
predominant grace. In which

being ſuddenly retracted, and
the ſoule humbled for them,<note place="margin">1 Io. 2. 1.</note>
are unqueſtionably pardoned
through the bleſſed plea and

               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> You ſee here a moſt
bleſſed progreſſe of mercy to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
firſt a dreadful juſtice ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
(which the ſacrifice of
worlds could never have done) by
the ſuffering of him that was both
God and Man: then ſecondly, a
condition propounded in a law,
which man could not but have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
himſelf, had God allowed him a
capacity to have choſen one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to have made himſelf bleſſed,
even in this life. What is the
third?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
be thus pleaſant in their
exerciſe, approveable in their
own nature, and ſo ſucceſſefull
in their end; yet ſuch is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the infelicity of man, that
his whole frame being corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and depraved, and having
in all parts and faculties ſuch a
general ineptitude, and averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170264:57"/>
to his owne principall

an impoſſibility.<note place="margin">Rev. 21. 6.</note> Therefore
in the third place,<note place="margin">Iam. 4 6.</note> Chriſt hath
merited that there ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to man a new principle of
life,<note place="margin">Heb 13. 21</note> that is, (by Gods grace) an

of mercy is to draw us in unto
him.<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 44.</note> And that which ſummes
up all the comforts of this kind

not be denied us in our wants,

            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is there now after all
this, a further neceſſity of another
degree of Chriſts merits and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes: For though (as you
even now ſaid) the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not grievous, and the
ſpiritual aſſiſtance powerful, to
enable the ſoule to performe
them, yet ſtill (ſuch is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of nature, and the direct
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170264:58"/>
oppoſition of our carnal part to
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> and his government)
that no man can perform the
conditions without innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and intolerable imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
(as was alſo even
now intimated) Therefore in
the fourth place (ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
riches of Grace, and
perſuancy of mercy) he hath
merited, that though our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
be defective, yet if it be
ſincere, (upon our humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for thoſe failings,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 1.</note> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
to withſtand them in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
it ſhould be accepted, the

the due,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> and proper wages of
every one of thoſe ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Though the mercies
you have already mentioned, reach
unto the clouds, and (by a juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of their greatneſſe)
have out ſtript wonder, and ſilenced
even hope it ſelf: yet becauſe you
mentioned a fifth effect of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

and mediation of Chriſt; where

            <p>By this diſcourſe I finde my

about the particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

my diſcouragements removed,
that might hinder the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a life according to thoſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170264:59"/>
ſtrict rules of holineſſe. And
now as I cannot but glorify
God, for a work of ſo infinite a
mercy in his ſervants, having
made the promiſes, rules, and
arguments, to be religious, and
conſequently bleſſed; as evident
as the light, and as certain as a
demonſtration: ſo I cannot but
juſtify him in the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the wicked; That he
ſhould make the Goſpel to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a milſtone, to fall upon,
and grinde them to powder,
becauſe they deſpiſed it;<note place="margin">Mat, 10. 15</note> and
that the caſe of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah</hi>
ſhould be more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the day of judgement,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 23</note>

eſcape that have neglected ſo

man therefore that deſpiſeth
the grace of God offered in
Chriſt, and that chuſeth rather
to ſatisfy his vain luſts, then to
give up his ſoul to his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(I ſay, let every ſuch perſon)
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170264:60"/>
know, that there is no true

but horrour at his dying
houre, a curſe at the great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and after that an hell to

becauſe he deſpiſed ſo tender a

a ſuffering of a gracious Jeſus,
ſo importunate ſwaſions of the

rejected ſuch ſweet precepts,

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt to beware of ſuch
a Profeſſion, and Religion, that
hath no other ground, but the
pretence of the light and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
gifts, and inſpirations of
the Spirit, to guide men to, and
in it. For ſuch a profeſſion muſt
be very unſafe and dangerous,
for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Reaſ.</note> becauſe there hath been
no ſucceſſion of any ſuch imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
light or revelations, ſince
the Apoſtles age: when they
were neceſſary, that the whole
way of Chriſts firſt planting his
Church, might, in all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
be purely miraculous.
Since which time, no Church
of Chriſt in any place, or at any
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170264:62"/>
time have made profeſſion upon
that ground, till the late Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts
in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
For certainly, if that had been
the ground of profeſſing Chriſt,
that Church which is a City on
a hill, and that Goſpel which is
the Mountaine of the Lord,
would not have left us without
all evidence and preſident, in
ſuch a long ſpace of time. But
if they pleaſe to conclude the
whole Chriſtian world in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
from the Apoſtles times
to this period, though they
think it nothing to condemn ſo
many ages, to uphold their
own phantaſmes, yet I ask
them how the promiſe to the
Church was effected, when
Chriſt engaged to ſend the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of truth, to guide them into
all truth; if fourteen or fifteen
hundred years together, the
whole Church ſo foully er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
by a falſe, unlawful, and
Antichriſtian profeſsion? But
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170264:63"/>
becauſe they lay clayme to ſuch
immediate gifts of the Spirit,
(without the ſubminiſtration of
learning, education in Sciences
and Tongues, and ſuch like
preparations of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for ſpirituall knowledge)
from the examples of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
I further require of them,
why they pretend to ſome of
thoſe miraculous gifts, and not
to all, as gifts of tongues, heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the like, which were
the ſignifications and proofs,
that the other gifts and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were of God. When
therefore their ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
pretended raptures,
prayings, and preachings are
delivered by them, &amp; owned to
be the inſpirations of the Spirit,
which may proceed from other
naturall dexterities, and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
helps, and having no other
miraculous gifts, as of tongues
and healing, and the like; as
the Apoſtles had, to prove
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170264:63"/>
them to be ſo, their own aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are very fallible, and the
profeſſion dangerous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Reaſ.</note> ſuch a profeſsinn

opinion and fancy, there is alſo
the ſpirit of the world, which is
the common humour and bent
of every preſent time.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 11 V. 12.</note> Theſe
and many of this ſort will be
pretenders to guide, as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God. Therefore when I
am tempted to beleeve any
thing, upon the bare pretence
of the Spirit, in what great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
am I in, to be guided by a
falſe ſpiitit, there being many to
one true Spirit of God? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
But <hi>try the ſpirits,</hi> that is, thoſe
falſe ſpirits ſhall be ſo likened to
the true Spirit of God, in ſo
grear an aſſimulation, that they
are not to be diſtinguiſhed
without trial and examination.
And this is no wonder,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11., 13, 14.</note> when
<hi>Satau himſelf can transform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into an Angel of light,</hi> and
his deceitful agents to be like the
true Apoſtles of Chriſt. Now
as the difficulty of diſcerning
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170264:64"/>
and conſequently the danger of
ſuch a profeſsion) of the true
Spirit from the falſe, ariſeth
from their ſimilitude; ſo alſo
much more in reſpect of what
reaſon I have to ſuſpect my ſelf,
as unable to try and examine
them aright. Firſt, becauſe
when I conſider how eaſily my
judgement is deceived in things
obvious to ſenſe, as in civil diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
and outward affaires,
how much more fallible muſt
that my judgement be, in diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
ſecret and inviſible
ſpirits, lying under the cunning
artificies of devils and evil men,
who, by them, attempt to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
weak ſoules? Secondly,
when I conſider how eaſily I
may be prejudicated, and if fo,
how ſoon, and certainly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
When a prejudgement
hath once paſſed upon the
mind, in the worſt cauſe that
ever was, how doth every like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood
make an argument, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170264:65"/>
fallacious argument growes
into a demonſtration, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mans diſcourſe of the ſame
judgement, ſhall have an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and a beleefe: But every
argument and adviſing perſon
to the contrary, ſhall be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
anſwered with nothing,
but a ſuſpicion and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
Therefore when I am
tempted to a religion or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
upon the pretence of the
Spirit, to what dangers do I
expoſe my ſelf? leſt I ſhould not
(through the want of, or a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicated
judgement) diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
the true Spirit from the
falſe, when they are both made
as like, as light to light. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe <hi>many falſe Prophets,
&amp;c.</hi> which inferres, that falſe
Prophets when they come, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ofeſsion is againſt
the ground of all viſible eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
muſt pretend a Spirit: It
being the common artifice of
ſeducers, to muffle up the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170264:65"/>
of their followers,
by alledging ſomething that is
high and undiſcernable: like
ſome Aſtronomers, who betray
their diſciples to a ditch or a
cheat, by cauſing them to look
up with wonder, to ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Scheme of nothing. So
that ſtill fuch a profeſsion muſt
needs be unſafe, becauſe it is
forewarned and propheſied,
that falſe Prophets when they
come, ſhall have this mark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, they ſhall pretend a
Spirit.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if the pretended
ground of being directed by an
immediate light of the Spirit
were true, (and conſequently
ſafe) there could be no profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more regular and certain;
the ſame Spirit will alwayes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
the ſame thing. But we
ſee that the pretenders to the
Spirit, are divided into Legions
of factions, <hi>Anabaptiſts, Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,
Antitrinitarians, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripturiſts,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170264:66"/>
Ranters, Quakers,</hi> and
many ſuch of like ſort; among
which, not one Sect agrees with
another, nor two Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the ſame Sect among
themſelves, nor ſcarcely the
members of the ſame Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
one with another, and very
ſeldome the ſame member at
any one time, with what he was
himſelf a little before. And yet
all pretend the Spirit of God for
their guide, from whence their
ſeveral opinions are as unlikely
to proceed, as that the two Poles
ſhould center in one point, or
that contradictions might be
reconciled. How then canſt
thou be ſafe? with what Sect
wilt thou joyn profeſsion? with
what Congregation of that Sect?
with what part of that Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation?
and then in what opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
wilt thou joyn? ſuch as they
maintained laſt year, or thoſe
they now hold, or ſuch as they
are like to take up the next?
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170264:66"/>
Now to ſtrengthen the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is obſerved that ſuch
diviſions and ſubdiviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe that fall from the
Churches unity, are ſignificant
marks of their falſity, and that
they are not of the true Spirit of
God. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> reports of the
<hi>Valentinians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 5.</note> 
               <hi>that when they were

<hi>Auſtin</hi> of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Bapt. c. 6.</note> that in his
time they were cut aſunder, and
divided into very many ſmall
pieces &amp; factions: and the ſame
may be obſerved by almoſt all
the ancient remarkable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies:
And how much of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
falls upon ſuch as have
departed from us, I leave to the
impartial Reader to judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But do you follow no directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Spirit in your profeſſion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes; in theſe foure
wayes or reſpects. Firſt, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the guidance of the holy
Scriptures, as they were given
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170264:67"/>
by inſpiration of the holy Spirit.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note>
Secondly, I follow the examples,
pattern,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 6</note> and Doctrines of the
firſt Churches which were
planted by the Apoſtles, and
Apoſtolick men of the firſt age,
who were directed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
gifts of the Spirit, as
of propheſying, tongues, and
miraculous healing, as was then
expedient for the conviction of
the world, that they were from
God. Thirdly, I follow that
light of truth, which the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall
Church of Chriſt have kept
and preſerved, as to all times
and places: which I beleeve to
be the effect of Chriſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of ſending his Spirit of
truth,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 13.</note> to guide into all truth.
Fourthly, I follow the direction
of the holy Spirit,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 45.</note> whereby I
am taught of God, that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
and inabled by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
and aſſiſting grace, to
lead a holy life,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 15</note> and to have my
judgement ſpiritualized, that I
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170264:67"/>
may mind, deſire, diſcern, and
deſign ſpiritual things. Now
whatſoever new light is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
inconſiſtent with the holy
Scriptures ſo interpreted, by
the common judgement of the
firſt planters, and the Churches
neareſt them; or that ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the All-truth of the Spirit
in fundamentals maintained and
confirmed by univerſal profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
or that conſiſts not with
godlines, and the Goſpel-rules of
a holy life, mercy, charity, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe,
juſtice, and the like;
I dare not embrace any new
light upon the grounds fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is your ſecond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
or caveat?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> To beware of ſuch a
profeſſion, that hath no other
ground then a plea from Srip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
upon private interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
which ground (though it
hath not produced ſuch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
effects of errour, as the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170264:68"/>
former, yet hath been more
dangerous, and deſtructive to
the Churches peace and unity.
Now the unſafetineſſe of ſuch a
profeſſion in the firſt place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
becauſe the moſt abſurd
hereticks of the ancient Church,
in bringing in their then novel
errours, (as plainly and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
appeares by the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and hiſtories of the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,
Arians, Sabellians, Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,
Donatiſts,</hi> and others)
when they would no otherwiſe
accompliſh their enviouſneſſe
againſt the then preſent Church,
departed from its communion
upon new principles of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
conſequence, and cried up
Scripture for their cauſe. A te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
or two I may inſtance
in,<note place="margin">Lib. de praeſ. adv. Herit c. 15. conſule to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum caput.</note> from the Ancients inſtead of
many. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaking of
hereticks, ſaith, <hi>That when they
perſwade of matters of faith, but
out of the writings of faith, they
pretend the Scriptures, and by ſuch
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170264:68"/>
boldneſſe move many to them.</hi> To
the ſame purpoſe <hi>Athanaſius.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Orat cont. Arian.</note>
               <hi>Endure not thoſe that perſwade you
to new things, contrary to the faith
received, although they antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
them from the holy Scriptures.</hi>
In the next place, I ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
adde as a reaſon to ſuſpect
the unſafetineſſe of ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
the fatall infelicities and
irreconcileable differencies, that
have alwayes befallen the
Church, but eſpecially in theſe
laſt ages, upon the preſumption
of private interpretation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
every man, as he hath been
indulgent to his own opinion
(which either education, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
advantage or ignorance,
hath inclined his ſpirit to) ſo
hath he decided and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the controverſies of the
Church, or made new ones,
worſe then the former. And I am
confident, were there a thouſand
cells, and ſo many of our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Interpreters in them, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170264:69"/>
to paſſe their judgements
to determine the controverted
doctrines, to make a confeſsion
of faith, to marſhall a Church-government,
to form a ſervice
and worſhip of God from the
Scriptures by their private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations,
and they all
ſuppoſed to lay aſide thoſe few
principles, which they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
from the received do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and practices of the
Church, and no ſingling of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
one to another; we ſhould
ſoon and certainly find a proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of a thouſand ſeveral religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and profeſsions. Now the
main reaſon is this; though the
holy Scriptures be in themſelves
moſt perſpicuous and plain, as
to the direction of life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
for which cauſe <hi>David</hi> calls
them, a light to his feet, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn
to his paths; yet, as to the
deep myſteries of faith, and the
determination of many conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
emergent controverſies of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170264:69"/>
doctrine and government; God
hath pleaſed to deliver his truths
in ſo dark and abſtruſe a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that they that want humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to hear the common judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Churches of Chriſt,
and their received interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
may eaſily be delivered
over by God, to find argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
enough in Scripture, to
captivate and ſatisfy a private
and prejudicate ſpirit in any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of religion, <hi>wreſting the
Scripture to their own deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> In what manner do you
hold the direction of the Scriptures,
and their interpretation, as to your
profeſsion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, I acknowledge
the Bleſſed Scriptures to be the
rule of faith, the end and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of all controverſies; and
where they are clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
I ſubmit my ſoul to them,
as to the final end of all my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ries
and doubts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:170264:70"/>
Secondly, in the things that
God hath pleaſed ſhould be
doubtfully delivered, (which is
occaſioned, either from ſome
difficulty in the <hi>Idiome,</hi> or from
ſeeming difference with other
places, requiring curious diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
or when the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
are clad and darkened,
with tropes and figures, which
are frequent in Scriptures; or
Laſtly, when the Scriptures are
occaſionall, and a due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the time when, and
the perſons to whom they were
ſpoken, or written, is neceſſary
to the underſtanding of them)
I ſay in things ſo doubtfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
as to doctrine or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
I ſubmit my private
reaſon, and opinion, to the grand
interpretation, and common
conſent of the firſt Churches,
for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe they were unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
in our preſent controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
&amp; ſo without danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170264:70"/>
byaſſed by paſsion; and they
ordinarily lying under perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
were not likely to gratify
an errour, for any private or
worldly regards. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they had moſt reaſon to
know what were the practices
of the Apoſtles, and Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
men, moſt certain guides to
follow, in controverted and
doubtful points of Government,
and the circumſtantial parts of
religion. Their footſteps, which
had ſo lately planted the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Chriſt, could not be ſo
ſoon worn out, but that they left
diſcernable tracts, for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medate
ſucceſſors, to walk in.
Thirdly, they knew better the
occaſions of the Apoſtles wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and other co-incident cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
of the then preſent
times; to which many paſſages
of great concernment do refer,
which a private perſon laying
aſide Antiquity, would be farre
enough from diſcerning, and ſo
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170264:71"/>
moſt likely to miſtake the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, being ignorant of
the ſcope and drift of ſuch holy
expreſsions. For theſe reaſons
it is, that the learned profeſſors
of this Church, have offered the
trial of the eſtabliſhed profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Scripture, ſo interpreted,
againſt all its adverſaries. And
I will inſtance onely in that
yet unanſwered appeal of the
Authour againſt <hi>Fiſher</hi> the Jeſuit
in theſe words.<note place="margin">Page 53.</note> 
               <hi>That all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
Articles of the Church of

the joynt and conſtant beleef of

when the Church was at the beſt;
and by the Councels held within

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is the third dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not to embrace a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that is taken up contrary
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170264:71"/>
to a received profeſsion, upon
the credit of the plauſible beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and ſmoorh converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the promoters and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of it. The unſafetineſſe of
ſuch a profeſsion may be eaſily
obſerved, and concluded. Firſt,
becauſe it is obſervable, that
when our Saviour gives a <hi>caveat</hi>
concerning falſe Prophets, he
foretels them not diſtinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by their outward behaviour:
For though they ſhall be <hi>rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wolves inwardly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 14.</note> that is, in
their deſignes of turning the
Church of Chriſt, yet ſhall
they cover their villany <hi>with
ſheeps cloathing,</hi> that is, ſo great a
proportion of framed ſanctimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and formed piety, outward
innocency and humility, or ſo
much of either, or all of them,
as may advance a reputation of
their new doctrines, to a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
or prejudicated people.
This St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>the form of
godlineſſe,</hi> to uphold the credit of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170264:72"/>
ſuch as forſaking publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
<hi>ſhall creep into houſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 5</note> 
               <hi>and
lead captive ſilly women.</hi> And
for ſuch ends,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1 11 14.</note> it is as eaſy a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for <hi>falſe Apoſtles to transform
themſelves into the Apoſtles of
Chriſt, as for the devill himſelf
to appear an Angel of light,</hi> as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> argueth. And ſecondly, it
is not only poſsible, for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
enemies of Chriſt, in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of their deſignes to put on
ſuch deceitful habits of outward
holineſſe, and therefore a new
profeſsion taken up upon that
ground, very unſafe: But it is
alſo neceſſary (and therefore
the more dangerous) that ſuch
bringers in of new lights, and
principles, muſt pretend to
more then ordinary ſanctity,
having no other juſt or ſembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
plea, to perſwade or attract
men to their miſguidances.
Now, though many ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences
in theſe times may
clearly evince this aſſertion, yet
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170264:72"/>
I appear to an univerſal obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ancient enemies to
truth in propagating their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
for a confirmation of it.
Among which I may inſtance
in one or two. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
the artificies of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi>
to deceive their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
the main was,<note place="margin">Lib. de mo. Eccl. Cath. 1 Tom. 1.</note> 
               <hi>That they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
before them an appearance of
a pure life, and memorable conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</hi>
The next is of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi>
who affirmes of the <hi>Arrians,
That for their fictitious holineſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epiſt. 82.</note>
               <hi>they got a general beleef of their
way.</hi> Now the great ſtratagem,
in their deſign of perſonating
ſuch degrees of holineſſe, zeal, &amp;
piety, is to take advantage, to
check the imperfections and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudencies,
into which the true
Paſtours of the Church, by time,
and peace, have been betrayed:
and to raiſe a repute to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by their <hi>odium,</hi> and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſital
diſgrace, which by ſuch
arts, they have attempted to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170264:73"/>
put upon them with the people.
Therefore ſuch a profeſsion,
that is entertained onely upon
the argument of outward ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
muſt needs be very unſafe,
becauſe the greateſt enemies to
Chriſtian truth, have, will, and
muſt palliate their notable
changes in religion, by ſuch
pretences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what can you ſay
for the defence of your profeſsion,
that may ſatisfy them that object
againſt you, the corruptions of the
lives of your Miniſters, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, (we know, and
can prove) that no profeſsion
in it ſelf, containes doctrines of
more univerſal ſubmiſsion to all
the commands of Chriſt, nor
principles more obliging to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
peace, or purity, to greater
reverence, or more ſolemn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God, to faithfuller ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to authority, or purer cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to man; then the received
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170264:73"/>
doctrines of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Examine but this poore
ſhadow of its religion, in this
preceding Catechiſme, and I
challenge any man to an obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to ſhew what impieties to
God, injuſtice to men, or unſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
in our ſelves, in body, or
mind, we allow.</p>
            <p>That our Profeſſors and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
have not univerſally lived
up to the purity of its doctrine,
is as certainly true, as that all
outward Profeſsors of Chriſt,
and alwayes have been a mixt
company of good and bad,
which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et in the Goſpel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates,
to which the Kingdom
of God (that is,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 47.</note> the ſtate of the
Goſpel) is likened: or, as that
the very Apoſtles and firſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of Chriſt were ſo; or, as
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in moſt, if not in all
his Epiſtles, eſpecially to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 21.</note> and that in the very
ſocieties admitted to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
clearly evinceth to be ſo:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170264:74"/>
or Laſtly, as certainly true, as
that all the Churches of Chriſt
have been ſo, in all ages and
places. Now in this mixture,
the numbers of hypocritical
and looſe Profeſſors, and their
deviations from the holineſs of
the Goſpel, have been more or
leſs, with reſpect to the times in
which they lived, as they were
more or leſſe courted with
peace and proſperity, or oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with adverſities and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions.
It often falling out,
that the true Churches of Chriſt
have at ſome times made the
leſſe viſible progreſſe up the
ſtream of piety, as the ſtronger
torrents, and winds of contrary
temptations, have borne them
downe, and oppoſed them.
So that to take offence and
quarrel againſt a religion, or
profeſsion, upon the argument
of the mixture of the profeſſors,
when the doctrines be pure and
holy, is moſt unjuſt and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170264:74"/>
and might be evineing
againſt the beſt Churches of
Chriſt that ever were, or will
be, to the end of the world. It is
true, it is a great felicity, and
glory to a profeſsion, when the
numbers of Saints increaſe, and
are predominant, when Gods
honour is more generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferved,
and his worſhip main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
godlineſſe encouraged,
and ſin ſhamed, and ſtrictly
corrected: but, if in a corrupt
age, it becomes otherwiſe, ſo
loug as the eſtabliſhed profeſſion
be holy in it ſelf, there is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to forſake her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and much leſſe to purſue a
deſtruction, to the religion it
ſelf. They ſhould rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in it, take off the offence
from it, and make it better by
their exemplary living, then to
make the offence worſe, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from it, or to take the
task of an enemy, to ruine and
overthrow it. Now the reſult
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170264:75"/>
is this, the mixture of all the beſt
Churches of Chriſt being chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
weighed, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of a long continued
peace (which alwayes contracts
the ruſt of corruption) and all
other accidents of preſent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
conſidered, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
no one period of time, ever
preſented a Church, that ever
declared greater effects of piety,
or produced a more numerous
progeny of better Chriſtians,
then the Church of <hi>England</hi>
hath done. And I challenge
all the adverſaries of this affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Church, to evince my aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by any former preſident,
or preſent example. As to the
loud clamour of corruptions, in
the lives of the Miniſters of this
Church, (by which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to ſatisfy the world about
their unparallel'd and unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
uſages of them, and indulge
their own cruelties, by thinking
they ſerve God while they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170264:75"/>
them, as our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied)
we are as willing to
acknowledge and lament them,
as they can be to ſuggeſt them.
But that I may clearly take off
the offence that is uſed as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
againſt the profeſſion of
this Church, by the allegation of
ſuch corruptions in the lives of
its Miniſters, I deſire that theſe
particulars may be charitably
and impartially conſidered.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1.</note> That the religion of
this Church doth as little allow
ſuch corruptions, and gives as
ſtrong an obligation to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
holineſſe, and is as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of entertaining all poſſible ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities
for any preſent reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or future preventing ſuch
evils, as any Chriſtian profeſſion
ever was, or any other can be.
And if the looſe reines of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and the temptations of a
corrupt and proſperous age,
have occaſioned much more er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of life in Miniſters, then
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170264:76"/>
was ſuitable to ſo holy a calling,
yet is not the lawfulneſſe of their
call to be juſtly impeached, nor
the religion and Church it ſelf
chargeable with ſuch corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider that in all
the pureſt ages of Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion,
the Miniſters did always
evidence they had their honour
in earthen veſſels, that is, were
men of common imperfections,<note place="margin">Act. 14. 15.</note>
and ſubject to the ſame frailties
which are coincident to other
men. To prove which, I need
not exceed my deſign of brevity,
by making hiſtorical narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
through the ſeveral times
of the Church, of the common
failings of the Miniſtery in
them. Account but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
themſelves,<note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 6.</note> and you may
obſerve <hi>Judas</hi> to have been a
thief and a devill;<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 74</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> to
have not onely denied, but alſo
to have forſworne our Saviour;
St. <hi>Thomas</hi> groſsely disbeleeved
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170264:76"/>
him, and they all once forſake
him: who had they lived in
this age, would have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to Articles enough, to
have ejected them from their
Apoſtolical offices, called their
ſtandings in queſtion, and to
have given arguments to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
adverſary, to have ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
their profeſſion. Now if
the fountains were defective,
how could the ſtreams of their
ſucceſſors be expected to be
pure, and free from all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
And becauſe our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
have expoſed us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
for our imperfections, of
which though we juſtly accuſe
our ſelves, and from our ſoules
deſire an univerſal amendment,
yet we are willing to be tried by
the ſtate of the Miniſtery in
any time, that our cunningeſt
enemy can name for general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
all circumſtances conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, conſider what an
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170264:77"/>
eaſie thing it is to contemne,
when men are reſolved to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
and what an hard thing it
is to be innocent, when a man
layes at the foot of every fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and unreaſonable diſtaſte,
and humour.</p>
            <p>This evidently appears by the
uſage of our Bleſſed Saviour,
who though he was the onely
perſon that was purely innocent,
yet there wanted not them,<note place="margin">Joh. 9. 16.</note> to
make him guilty of great and
high miſdemeanours;<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 19</note> he was
accuſed as,<note place="margin">Joh. 8. 48.</note> and reputed a wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibber,
a friend of Publicans
and ſinners,<note place="margin">Joh. 10. 20.</note> a <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and
Prince of devils;<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 24.</note> and when he
came upon the Articles of his
life,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 65.</note> he was found guilty by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of blaſphemy, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things as <hi>Pilate</hi> told
him.<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 13.</note> And certainly were the
lives of Gods beſt ſervants (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a Miniſtery) ſearched to
the bottom of their times, and
their ſingle falls recorded, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170264:77"/>
that by malicious accuſers (ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to find defects, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to quarrel) and ſo preſented
in the multiplying glaſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection,
to the view of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
already prejudicated by an
ill opinion, who could be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
innocent? or where
would be found a Miniſtery or
a perſon, which might not be
called corrupted? How much
of this caſe is ours, let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencies
of adverſaries atteſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, let our adverſaries
cool their fury, and conſider
what ſecurity they have above
other men, to have their own
next ſucceeding Clergy exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from corruptions after their
enjoyments of peace, and the
heats of oppoſition be digeſted,
whether they can ſecure a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
for them above all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
and common, inciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to errour; or whether they
would willingly have them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſuch a condemnation, which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170264:78"/>
an ill-affected enemy, diſpoſed to
accuſe, would faſten upon them.
I think it not a noble or Chriſti-thing
to ſearch for mens faults
or frailties, otherwiſe I might
upon a good ground affirm, the
Miniſtery of the neweſt ſtamp,
and lateſt ſhift, guilty of as great
failings in themſelves, and to
have been the occaſion of as
great offences in others, (though
of another nature) as thoſe for
which we ſuffer ſo many indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and uncivil uſages. And
I beleeve could the people
ſee (and I wiſh they could)
what the new Miniſtery would
do in ſome few yeares of peace
and power; I ſay I beleeve, they
would think they had loſt a
Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qneſt.</hi> This diſcourſe, though
fully ſatisfying the ſcruples that
may be objected concerning the
lives of Miniſters, yet leaves ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knot untyed, which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of our profeſsion have caſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170264:78"/>
upon the conſciences of many weak,
though well-diſpoſed ſpirits, and
that is concerning the lawfulneſſe
of their calling, as the Miniſtery of
this Church now ſtands. In which
I deſire to ſee your ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> As to that point, though I
might acquieſce in the various
Treatiſes, with which many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
perſons have enlightned the
world, againſt all the cxceptions
of the adverſaries to Miniſtery;
yet for the ſatisfaction of every
preſent Reader, I will ſubjoyn
theſe two arguments, in their
defence.</p>
            <p>The firſt is from the effect of
Miniſtery;<note place="margin">1. Arg.</note> an argumentation,
which our Saviour intimates,
ought to be uſed in this very
caſe, to diſcriminate true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
from falſe Prophets;<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Ye ſhall
know them by their fruits.</hi> And
bleſſed St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that could have
brought Angels, and men, and
the plea of an immediate ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from God, to the proof of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170264:79"/>
his high and miraculous ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is pleaſed to argue for his
Apoſtleſhip, with his <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
from the effect of the ſame
among them.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 2.</note> For (ſaith he)
<hi>the zeal of my Apoſtleſhip are ye
in the Lord.</hi> Now whatſoever
effects, and fruits, are judged
producible from the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of Chriſt, to demonſtrate
them ſuch, have been eminently
brought forth by the Miniſtery
of this national Church. What
grace was there ever eminent in
any Chriſtian Church, that
hath not as apparently been
demonſtrable in this? what
heavenly members of Chriſts
Kingdome, have ſhined in every
part of this nation, no way infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the moſt renowned
Saints of ancient times, but that
the frequency of profeſſors, and
(as it were) familiarity of piety,
have eclipſed their own excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies?
And without doubt
weighing thoſe extenuating ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170264:79"/>
of Chriſts Kingdom,
(as,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 32.</note> the <hi>little Flock, few that find
it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 14.</note> and the like) we might with
facility obſerve in this nation,
plentiful additions of ſouls to the
Church, above any nation in
the world, proportion of places
conſidered. Whence then theſe
effects, and demonſtrations
of religion, but from Gods
pleaſure to preſerve a never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing
ſucceſſion of Miniſtery,
who diſſerninated in every part
of the nation, have laboured in
Word and Doctrine among us?
for it canuot be ſuppoſed that
this Church have received theſe
grapes of thornes, or figges of
thiſtles, or that a corrupt tree,
that is, a falſe or Anti-chriſtian
Miniſtery, ſhould bring forth
ſuch good fruit,<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 7. 17.</note> as our Saviour
argues in this very caſe. And
after all this, leſt theſe eminent
graces, and bleſſed effects, ſhould
ſtill be attributed to any other,
either immediate, or mediate,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170264:80"/>
proceediug of God; I deſire any
of our adverſaries to ſhew, that
ever any nation was converted
to, or continued in a Chriſtian
profeſſion, or that ever the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of a Nation hath not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to a Period, with the fall of
its Miniſtery, and then I may be
induced to ſuſpect, this Church
received ſuch graces from ſome
other inſtrument then the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery.
And for further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
it is no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to obſerve, how much the
intereſt of Religion, is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Miniſteries preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by conſidering, how piety,
peace, charity, reverence to
Gods worſhip, and the whole
frame of religion have declined,
and the contrary evils of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe,
ſacriledge, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,
Atheiſme, oppreſſion,
violence, and injuſtice, have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
improved by their fall.
Now the force of the argument
is this; There being theſe effects
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170264:80"/>
of piety, and ſalvation, as unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel'd
conſequences of the work
of the Miniſtery of this Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Church, and there being no
other ordinary means (the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod
of grace under the Goſpel)
from whence otherwiſe they
ſhould proceed, we therefore
cunclude them lawful inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Gods work, and a bleſt
and truly Chriſtian Miniſtery
to this Church.</p>
            <p>The fecond argument for
brevity ſake I make as general
and comprehenſive as I can,<note place="margin">3. Arg.</note> and
thus it is. If the Miniſters of the
Churches of Chriſt in all ages
and places through the whole
ſucceſſion of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had the ſame ſeparation to
their offices, that we of this
Church of <hi>England</hi> have, then
by neceſſary conſequence either
the univerſal Miniſtery of Chriſt
were alwayes Antichriſtian,
(which would be next to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
to aſſert) as well as we,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170264:81"/>
or we Chriſtian and lawful, as
well as they. Now let our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
ſhew, that in any age of
that great ſpace of time, or in
any place, where Chriſts Name
was ever profeſſed, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Miniſtery thereof were
otherwiſe in ſubſtance ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
(whereby to raiſe any plea
to their new, or rather, no call,)
we will acknowledge the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of our calling to be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
queſtioned. This argument
hath its foundation upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of Chriſt to his univerſal
Church, in the name of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
<hi>Howbeit when the Spirit of
truth is come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 13</note> 
               <hi>he will guide you into
all truth.</hi> Which promiſe had
apparently, in a conſiderable
point, been unaccompliſhed,
had the univerſal Church of
Chriſt, ſo many hundred years
ſucceſſively, erred by an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
and unlawful Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and by conſequence all the
Chriſtian world, all that great
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170264:81"/>
while had been deprived of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ordinances, (the outward
means of grace,) which depend
upon the lawful Miſſion of
the Miniſtery: How ſhall they
hear to a ſucceſs of beleefe, but
by their preaching,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 15.</note> who are
lawfully ſent?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Theſe arguments are
convincing, and now as it ſeems to
me, a man may as ſoon, and upon
as good ground queſtion a great
part of his Chriſtian Religion, as
the lawfulneſſe of the Miniſtery of
this Church, being inferred from
thoſe premiſſes, which conclude and
prove one, as well as the other. I
deſire therefore rather to venture
my ſoule with all the Churches of
Chriſt, and under a Miniſtery that
have been received as lawful by
them, and of whom we have had
experience in this national Church,
in excellent effects of all ſpirituall
bleſſings, then to embrace the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a few, who ſtudy new
things, ſuch as the Churches of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170264:82"/>
Chriſt never knew before; and to
ſubmit to ſuch a Miniſtery as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
in no ſucceſsion, and without
any character, either extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or ordinary, to demonſtrate their
miſsion, and of which, in a ſhort
time, we have had ſad experiences,
as appears by the diviſions, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
fond opinions, and great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties,
that have proſpered under
them.</p>
            <p>There remaines one ſcruple more.
What canſt thou ſay to ſatisfy them,
that urge the preſent fall of this
Church, and ſufferings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of its Miniſtery, as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion,
and Religion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
there be a great many that
follow the diſingenuous practice
of that ſort of people, of which
the holy <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> complaines,<note place="margin">Pſal. 69. 27</note>
that love <hi>to perſecute him whom
God hath ſmitten, and to talk how to
vex him whom he hath wounded:</hi>
Crying out againſt us like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170264:82"/>
untoward generation, <hi>God

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 70. 11</note> 
               <hi>perſecute and
take them, for there is none to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

me that perſons pretending
light in Religion, and an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in the Scriptures,
ſhould make outward provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
the guidance of their
judgement, in determining
the juſtice or unjuſtice of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Concluſions by events prove
nothing but the folly of a vulgar
judgement, that is byaſſed by
them. When moſt frequent it is,
that the <hi>wicked proſper in their way,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 3. 7.</note>
when he permits them to blaſt
the honour and ſafety of the
juſt. If proſperous providence
gives the ſentence of juſtice, The
Turk that ſets up his trophies in
the moſt renowned parts of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170264:83"/>
Chriſtendome already, and if
he ſhould poure in his forces to
the overthrow of all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
nations that remain, could
never want an argument to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify
his uſurpations, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies.
Nor doth the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
unſucceſſeful attempts for
its preſervation, diſprove its
truth and being: But rather (if
it were lawful, or indeed poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to determine from exteriour
providences) the frequent tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies
of its continual ſnfferings,
might induce us to a beleef, that
Truth and perſecution have
gone hand in hand. Hence
the worthy obſervers of the
Churches inſtability in worldly
ſafety, have found out a reaſon
of its happineſſe, from its miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
The Church hath increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with perſecutions, and is
crowned with martyrdomes,<note place="margin">Epiſt 62. ad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theoph.</note>
ſaith St. <hi>Hierome.</hi> Then it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quers
when it is oppreſſed, and
obtaines, when forſaken, ſaith

St. <hi>Hilary:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Trin.</note> For if its truth ſhould
have depended upon worldly

lay ſo long under the bloody
perſecutions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
<hi>Nero, Domitian, Trajan,</hi>
&amp;c? Now if any juſt cauſe that
is oppreſſed, if any part of
Chriſts Church that is afflicted,
may plead no diſadvantage to
them, by Gods permitting them
to bee outwardly miſerable,
much more the Miniſtery;
whoſe, of all juſt cauſes, and
who of all parties in the Church

were all theſe forſaken of God,

had diſproved the truth of
their calling, or cauſe, the very

leave this to their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,

then I earneſtly beg of thee; that
when thou readeſt and owneſt
theſe plaein directions for Devotion,
thou obligeſt thy ſelf upon as ſtrong
purpoſes to follow them, or at leaſt
the duties intended by them, as the

That thou take care by making it
a part of thy duty to Chriſt, to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

elements of religious knowledge, ſo
with ſuitable practices of prayer,
as ſoon as they ſhall be capable of

whatſoever, thou canſt obtain,

            <p>I deſire thee, that before thou

periods, that thou mayeſt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit in thy addreſſes

with affection, reverence,

with God, as moſt of the

before thou departeſt from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170264:88"/>

ſhall direct thee; and digeſt
the ſame by meditation, to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
application to thy ſelf, that
thou mayeſt live in the ſtrength of
it, in all thy actions to God and man.</p>
            <p>I have divided (as thou ſhalt
obſerve) the prayers into ſeveral
parts, according to the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
periods of the duty. Firſt,
becauſe they will be the more fit,
and methodical, to be taught to
children, ſervants, and ſuch as
cannot read. Secondly, that after
the end of any one part of the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the ſupplicant may ſtay and
collect his ſpirit to a frame, fit
for the next: conſidering (as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance)
that confeſsion and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
and ſo the reſt do require
different carriages of the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Thirdly, becauſe the pious ſoule
may more fitly ſtay in any part, and
poure out it ſelf to God, as ſpiritual
neceſsity will be adminiſtred, and
yet not break the order of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170264:89"/>
Laſtly, becauſe ſuch a

that is apt to be contracted,
by one long continued form.</p>

And all thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
