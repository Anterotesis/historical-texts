            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

called me into the Country about
a ſmall Affair, relating to a
Member of your Company, I there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
had an opportunity to behold the
Great Houſes of Charity belonging to
your Corporation; amongſt the reſt, I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
two Almes-Houſes, and two Schools,
in which Schools I found many expert
<pb facs="tcp:52730:3"/>
and witty Boyes, and very oppertunely
came to be a Spectator of a Play Acted
by the Boyes of one of the Schools, which
was performed beyond belief, for ſuch

then beholding the good Order and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of the Government of the Schoole
and Almes-Houſes, and the decent provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for the Poor; and then reflected back,
and beheld the Sterne that guided them,
(which are you Worthy Gentl men) and
there I found not onely your Care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Ancient and Noble Acts of
Charity of your Predeceſſors, even in the
worſt of Times, but obſerved your great
Induſtry, Wiſdom, and Diſcretion in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Additions daily for the relief of your
Poor, and adding greater ſtrength to your
Corporation, as you lately have done by
renewing your Charter; nor are you onely
prudent amongſt your ſelves, but are thought

fit Miniſters to be intruſted by State of

which was wont to be heard in the Streets.
And ſuch is your Loyalty, that in great

               </gap> the good Goddeſs had
not firſt deceived: I therefore adviſe thee (my
Friend) never to give a credit to thoſe ſmiles
which are primarily deceitful; for, although
they pretend friendſhip and peace, yet what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
proceeds thence, are but temporary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
that with <hi>Proteus,</hi> change face every

minute: but if thou canſt ſo place them, as to be
willing upon demand to ſurrender the ſame

that thou canſt anſwer all perverſneſſes with an

He knows not his own ſtrength who never tried
it; Adverſity brings us into the Ring to wreſtle,
and makes us, in defence of our Reputation, ſhew
all we can: And if our endeavours prove
too weak, <hi>Hercules</hi> will help, Heaven prepares
good men with Croſſes which are <hi>mala per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi>
but <hi>malum in ſe,</hi> evil <hi>quatenus</hi> evil never

of tempers, for what happens to one, may
chance to another, and it is as well in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
as Reaſon, what he accounts it, and will
make it.</p>
            <p>That there is an indiſpenſable Fate that hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
every man to his end, even beyond his own
intention; there is uncertainty in Wiſdom as
well as Folly, for all is Vanity. When a man
deviſeth by policy to ſave himſelf, that very
policy leads him to ruine. Decrees are paſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, and our own wit often hunts us into the
<pb facs="tcp:52730:5"/>
ſnares that we would above all things avoid:
what we ſuſpect and would fly, that we cannot:
what now is an <hi>Aſylum,</hi> proves anon a Priſon:
we deſign that for a means of our preſervation,
which proves our deſtruction; and what we
thought our greateſt diſadvantage, proves our
ſafety: So that man is the Tenice-ball of Time,
ſometimes taken from the Plough, to the
Throne; and thence again, on a ſudden, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to the Priſon and a Halter, as if there
were ſuch an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> between Felicity and
Miſery, that no man could avoid being wretched
or happy, or both. But not admitting that, yet
ſuppoſing our ſelves poſſeſſed of <hi>Fortunatus</hi>

of our deſires, who would be more
miſerable then he that ſhould cull out his own
wayes? What a ſpecious ſhew carried <hi>Mydas</hi>
his wiſh with it, and how it paid him at laſt with
ruine? Though God in the Creation of man
called a Council <hi>Faciamus,</hi> yet ever ſince in all
things he will work alone, and man muſt not

and Vertue attended with Affliction, and the
burthens of unpleaſing Accidents, rather then
Vice waited on, and garlanded with all the ſoft
demulſions of a preſent contentment. Hereof
might be produced many Examples, one only
I will name, which is of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who being
committed to cuſtody by Publick Authority
(though unjuſtly) would neither attempt to
break Priſon, nor offer any violence, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity
to Juſtice, to purchaſe his Life or
Liberty. The rules of Vertue are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
to be learned without a ſevere Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
The Rod of Diſcipline, and the Fire
of Affliction can onely ſcour us from our
droſs, and burn off all our ruſt; and hereby
the faithful learn all thoſe other excellent
perfections, accompanied with other glorious
Graces.</p>
            <p>I confeſs this, <hi>rara avis,</hi> a great novelty to
ſee a Rich or Potent man Religious, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
(<hi>a religando</hi>) binds up, and reſtrains,
whereas Riches tempt and prompt to licentious
Libertiniſm. Our Saviours Parable of a Camel
paſſing a Needles Eye, was <hi>durus ſermo,</hi> but
himſelf explained the Text. When wealth
abounds, men ſeldom come by ſufferings to
be ſober; they buy out their penance, and
<pb facs="tcp:52730:8"/>
caſt over-board thoſe Conſiderations that
ſhould make them ſerious. They are ſo ſwelled
by the ſlaviſh humorings of their Attendants,
and ſo elated by the crouchings of all about
them, that inveloped with ſenſuality, they not
only miſs of knowing themſelves, but others;
and by the pravity of their weak Nature, are ſo
ſet on the ſolaces of this life, that they ſeldome
have time to think of another, or better. There
is moſt commonly a Worm in the faireſt Fruit,
which makes it decay. The beſt inclinations of
humane Nature are vitiated by Pride, which
ſooner ſeiſeth the Peacock with his beautiful
Traine, then the lean bald-Coot. Old <hi>Jacob</hi>
begged but only Food and Rayment, and <hi>Agar</hi>
prayeth directly againſt Plenty; and though
<hi>Solomon</hi> was ſo wiſe as not to ask it, yet we ſee,
when he had it, it had well-nigh eaten out all
his wiſdom. But, there is one thing in wealth
which faſcinates beyond all theſe, in that it is
apt to ſeduce a man into a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a love of
himſelf, and a ſelf-conceit of his wiſdom;
whence haply it might be, that when <hi>Simonides</hi>
was asked which was beſt for man, Wealth
or Wiſdom, he made a ſcruple, as doubting
what anſwer to give; and the reaſon was, as he
ſaid, <hi>That he had often obſerved wiſe men wait
<pb facs="tcp:52730:8"/>
and attend at the houſes of rich men:</hi> but
alas, if waiting in this age were all, it would
be excuſable; but the pride of our Great
Ones is ſo exorbitant, that after a tedious
attendance, at laſt comes an anſwer indeed,
but ſo ful of diſdain and tyranny, that would
affright the hearer. And this might be the
cauſe of what one ſaid, <hi>That a rich Tyrant is
the worſt of all wild Beaſts; and a rich Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
one of Chriſts Wonders. Nihil honeſtius,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Seneca, magnificentiuſque quam pecunias
contemnere ſi non habeas, ad beneficentiam liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatemque
conferre;</hi> If we have not wealth, 'tis
Noble and Princely not to be fond after it;
but far more Heroick, if we have it, to ſow
it into Charity and Benificence: but, whether
ſo or no, 'tis the cuſtom of the World, to
magnifie the wealthy man, though of never ſo
mean parts; whereas poverty muſt be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
though attended with never ſo many ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Qualities; ſo that to be Rich, is to be
three parts of the way onward to perfection,
while Poverty is a pavement for the high-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man to tread on: Gold is the only Cover-led
of Imperfections, is Follies Curtain to hide
all defects from the World. VVe in theſe

Gold that lay buried in the loweſt parts, is

without worth, but as a rich ſaddle upon an
Aſſes back.</p>
            <p>As to my Reſtraint, which is another Joynt
whereon you inſiſted, I am almoſt of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s
opinion, <hi>Non nobis ſolum, ſed ad decus &amp; liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem
nati ſumus.</hi> The greateſt Prince that ever
was produced by Woman, comes into the
World inſanguined, and is a poor reſiſtleſs
Slave to the firſt Arms he falls into. Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
is not ſuch a miſchief as the World
ignorantly reputes it: the greateſt of it is, in
that the Eye is debarred from the delight of
the Worlds variety; yet is not this total, but
in part and local only; for to a good man, a
priſon is no more then a place of retiring and
ſequeſtration from the world, which many
both of the wiſeſt and greateſt have volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
taken upon themſelves, witneſs, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes,
Diocleſian, Charles</hi> the Fifth, &amp;c.
beſides many other, whoſe Examples would
be without number. Now, although by this
kind of pleading, we alleviate the cruelty of
Fate, yet Nature pleads for Liberty; and
though Command may be eaſie, yet ſometimes
<pb facs="tcp:52730:10"/>
they grate and gall; yet ſtill if we appeal to
the mind of man, it will affirm, That it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being a King, though in a Tub, then to
be a Slave in a Palace roofed with Gold. If then
I have Liberty (which is ſo generally eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
I will reſt in the Priviledges that accrue
by it: And if I want it, yet will I ſatisfie my
ſelf with the benefits that attend that want, ſo
that in either eſtate, I will make Content my
fellow.</p>
            <p>Dear Friend, give me leave to hope for this
Liberty, although haply, you will ſay, hope
many times fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mans greateſt Enemy, according to that of the
Wiſe Man, Hope deferred maketh the heart ſick;
yet is it not to be denied, that this very Hope
is the miſerable and afflicted mars chiefeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge

beams of Comfort. How many had ſunk and

            <p>Sir, I will end this Diſcourſe; only firſt, I
muſt put you in remembrance of your unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of upbraiding me of your Favours done
to me ſince my Troubles; If Love (as the word
of Truth affirms) will cover a multitude of Sins;
Friendſhip, which is the perfect growth of Love,
ought, without peradventure much more to
hide infirmities. Whoever doeth a Courteſie to
another, and after upbraids him with it, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
a return, is certainly kind only to himſelf:
who looks for a requital, ſerves himſelf, not me:
If he often recount the Favours he hath done
me, thereby he cancels the debt I owed him,
files off the chains that kept me his Priſoner,
and with his Tongue unlooſeth the fetters his
hands had put on If I be able to do a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
I rebate it by repeating, and blot it out
when I go about to Text it; and the Receiver
<pb facs="tcp:52730:11"/>
becomes unworthy of it, if he forget it. It
was thus long ſince declared by the ſententious
<hi>Seneca, Beneficii inter duos lex eſt, alter ſtatim

dedit beneficium taceat, narret qui accepit;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

That he that doth it forgets it preſently; but,
he that doth receive it, never: Let him that
beſtows it, be ſilent; but, let him that takes it,
ſpeak thereof: He that blows a Trumpet at his
Almſ-giving is a <hi>Phariſee</hi> in Friendſhip, and

Queſtion, unanimouſly declared.</p>
                  <p>That no Free-man ought to be committed or detained in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or otherwiſe reſtrained by the Command of the King or

ought to be committed, detained or reſtrained.</p>
               </q>
               <p>And they have ſent me with others of their Members, to
repreſent unto your Lordſhips the true grounds of ſuch their
Reſolution, and have charged me particularly, leaving the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52730:25"/>
reaſons of Law and Preſidents for others to give your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
ſatisfaction, that this Liberty is eſtabliſhed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the whole State, the King, the Lords Spiritual
and Temporal, and Commons, by ſeveral Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the Authority whereof is ſo great, that it can receive
no Anſwer: ſave by Interpretation or Repeal by future Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes;
and thoſe that I ſhall mind your Lordſhips of, are ſo
direct to the point, that they can bear no other expoſition
at all, and ſure I am they are ſtill in force.</p>
               <p>The firſt of them is, the Grand Charter of the Liberties
of <hi>England,</hi> firſt granted in the ſeaventeenth year of King
<hi>John,</hi> and renewed in the ninth year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third,
and ſince confirmed in Parliament above thirty times; The
words are thus, Cap. 29. <hi>Nullus Liber homo Capiatur vel Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonetur,
aut Diſſeſietur de Libero Tenemento ſuo, vel libertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,
vel Liberis conſuetudinibus ſuis, aut utlegatur, aut exuletur,
aut aliquo modo deſtruatur, nec ſuper eum ibimus, nec ſuper eum
mittemus, niſi per Legale Judicium Parium ſuorum vel per Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
Terrae.</hi> Theſe words, <hi>Nullus Liber homo,</hi> &amp;c. are expreſs
enough, yet it is remarkable that <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> an Author
of ſpecial credit doth obſerve Fol. 432, that the Charter of
9. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. was the very ſame as of the 17 of King <hi>John</hi> (<hi>in
nullo diſsimilis,</hi> are his words,) and that of King <hi>John</hi> he
ſetteth down <hi>verbatim,</hi> Fol. 342, and there the words
are directly, <hi>Nec eum in carcerem mittemus;</hi> And ſuch a
corruption as is now in the print, might eaſily happen 'twixt
9. <hi>H.</hi> 3. and 28. <hi>E.</hi> 1. when this Charter was firſt exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified;
but certainly there is ſufficient left in that which is
extant to decide this queſtion, For the words are, <hi>That no
Free-man ſhall be taken or Imoriſoned, but by the lawful Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Peers, which is by Jury Peers for Peers, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Jurors for others who are their Peers, or by the Law of
the Land, which words (Law of the Land) </hi>muſt of neceſſity
be underſtood in this notion, to be by due Proceſs of the Law,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52730:25"/>
and not the Law of the Land generally, otherwiſe it would
comprehend Bond-men (whom we call Villains) who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
by the word <hi>Liber;</hi> for the general Law of the Land
doth allow their Lords to Impriſon them at pleaſure without
Cauſe; wherein they only differ from the Free-men in reſpect
of their perſons, who cannot be Impriſoned without a cauſe:
And that this is the true underſtanding of thoſe words (<hi>per
Legem Terrae</hi>) will more plainly appear by divers other Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
that I ſhall uſe which do expound the ſame according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
And though the words of this grand Charter be ſpoken
in the third perſon, yet they are not to be underſtood of
Suits betwixt party and party, at leaſt not of them alone, but
even of the King's Suits againſt his Subjects, as will appear
by the occaſion of the getting of that Charter, which was
by reaſon of the difference betwixt thoſe Kings and their
People, and therefore properly to be applyed unto their power
over them, and not to ordinary queſtions betwixt Subject and
Subject. Secondly, the words <hi>Per Legale judicum pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
ſuorum,</hi> immediately preceding the other of <hi>Per Legem
Terrae,</hi> are meant of Tryals at the King's Suit, and not at the
proſecution of a Subject; And therefore if a Peer of the Realm
be Arraigned at the Suit of the King upon an Indictment of
Murder, he ſhall be Tryed by his Peers, that is Nobles, but
if he be appealed of Murder by a Subject, his Tryal ſhall be
by an ordinary Jury of Twelve Free-holders, as appeareth
in 10. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 6. 33. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Brook</hi> titl. Tryals 142. <hi>Stamford</hi>
Pleas of the Crown, lib. 3. cap. 1 folio 152. And in the
10. <hi>E.</hi> 4. it is ſaid, ſuch is the meaning of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
by the ſame reaſon therefore as <hi>per judicium parium ſuorum,</hi>
extends to the King's Suit, ſo ſhall theſe words <hi>per Legem
Terrae.</hi> And in 8. <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>Rot. Parliament. memb.</hi> 7. There is
a Petition that a Writt under the Privy Seal went to the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
of the great Seal, to cauſe Lands to be ſeized into the
King's hands; By force of which there went a Writt out of
the Chancery to the Eſcheater to ſeize againſt the form of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52730:26"/>
grand Charter, that the King nor his Miniſters ſhall out no
man of Free-hold without reaſonable Judgement; and the
party was reſtored to his Land, which ſheweth the Statute
did extend to the King. There was no invaſion upon this
perſonal Liberty, till the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third,
which was eftſoons reſented by the Subjects; for in 5 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.
<hi>cap.</hi> 9. it is ordained in theſe words;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is Enacted, That no man from henceforth ſhall be atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

people of the ſame Neighbourhood, where ſuch deeds be done in

Our Lord the King by the aſſent of the Prelates, Dukes,

hindered, taken and impriſoned without Indictment, or other
proceſs made by the Law upon them, as well of things done out

it is ordained, That all they which make ſuggeſtions, wall be

Here by due Proceſs and Original Writ, according to the
ancient Law of the Land, is meant the ſame thing, as,
<hi>Per Legem Terrae in Magna Charta;</hi> and the abuſe was,
That they were put to anſwer by Commandment of the
King.</p>
               <p>The Kings Anſwer is thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Becauſe that this Article is an Article of the Grand Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

               </p>
               <p>By this appeareth, that <hi>Per Legem Terrae in Magna Charta,</hi>
is meant by due Proceſs of the Law.</p>
               <p>Thus your Lordſhips have heard Acts of Parliament in
the point; but the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter the firſt, cap.</hi> 15.
is urged to diſprove this opinion, where it is expreſly ſaid,
That a man is not Repleviſable, who is committed by the
command of the King; therefore the Command of the King
without any cauſe ſhewed, is ſufficient to commit a man to
priſon. And becauſe the ſtrength of the Argument may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and the Anſwer be better underſtood, I ſhall read the
words of that Statute, which are thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And foraſmuch as Sheriffs and others which have taken and
kept in priſon perſons detected of felony, and oftentimes have
let out by Replevin ſuch as were not Repleviſable, and have
kept in priſon ſuch as were Repleviſable; becauſe they would
gain of the one party, and grieve the other. And foraſmuch as
before this time it was not certainly determined what perſons
were repleviable, and what not: but only thoſe that were taken
for the death of a man, or by Commandment of the King, or of
his Iuſtices, or for the Forreſt. It is provided, and by the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52730:29"/>
King commanded, that ſuch priſoners as before were outlawed;
and they which have abjured the Realm, provors, and
ſuch as be taken with the manner, and thoſe which have broken
the Kings Priſon, Thieves openly defamed and known, and
ſuch as be appealed by provors, ſo long as the provors be living,
if they be not of good name, and ſuch as be taken for burning of
houſes feloniouſly done, or for falſe money, or for counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kings Seal, or perſons excommunicate taken at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of the Biſhop, or for manifeſt offences, or for Treaſon
touching the King himſelf, ſhall be in no wiſe Repleviſable by
Common Writ, or without Writ; but ſuch as be indicted of
Larceny by Inqueſts taken before Sheriffs or Bayliffs by their
office, or of light ſuſpition, or for petty Larceny, that amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not above the value of twelve pence, if they were not guilty
of ſome other Larceny aforetime, or guilty of receipt of felons,
or of commandment, or force, or aid in felony done, or guilty of
ſome other treſpaſſes, for which one ought not to loſe life or
member; And a man appealed by a provor, after the death of the
provor, if he be no common thief, nor defamed, ſhall from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
be let out by ſufficient Surety, whereof the Sheriff will
be anſwerable, and that without giving ought of their goods.
And if the Sheriff or any other let any go at large by Surety,
that is not Repleviſable, if he be Sheriff or Conſtable, or any
other Bayliff of Fee which hath keeping of Priſons, and thereof
be attainted he ſhall loſe his Fee and Office for ever. And if
the under-Sheriff, Conſtable, or Bayliff of ſuch as hath Fee
for keeping of Priſons, do it contrary to the will of his Lord, or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52730:29"/>
any other Bayliff being not of Fee, they ſhall have three years
impriſonment, and make a Fine at the Kings pleaſure: And if
any withhold priſoners Repleviſable, after that they have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſufficient Surety, he ſhall pay a grievous Amerciament to
the King; And if he take any reward for the deliverance of
ſuch, he ſhall pay double to the priſoner, and alſo ſhall be in the
great mercy of the King.</q>

            <l>SPectators, is it your deſire to find</l>
            <l>Such <hi>Witty Jeſts</hi> as pleaſe a joyful mind?</l>
            <l>Go ſeek them where th'are, ſure th'are to be had,</l>
            <l>'Tis not VVits recreation to be ſad.</l>
            <l>VVit muſt avaunt, with all its Levities,</l>
            <l>VVhere heavineſs becomes the Obſequies:</l>
            <l>For, if't be true, ſad Objects do require</l>
            <l>Sad Thoughts, ſad VVords, and ſad Attire.</l>
            <l>Then do not (pray) my <hi>Muſe</hi> for dulneſs tax,</l>
            <l>Since lighter Phanſies ſute not with her blacks.</l>
            <l>But, ſtay my <hi>Muſe,</hi> thy Lines let PLUTO read,</l>
            <l>They will conduct him to a Grave or Bed;</l>
            <l>VVhere, when the Curtain's drawn, each active part</l>
            <l>will move, without inſtructions from Black Art;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>His</hi> nature motive is, in queſt of ill,</l>
            <l>Stated in miſchief, all <hi>his</hi> ableſt skill;</l>
            <l>Neither know right from wrong, til wrong be done</l>
            <l>Fix Nature will, to condemn'd Cuſtoms run:</l>
            <l>Unchangedly, who to his ſins can ſet.</l>
            <l>A certain end, when hath he never met</l>
            <l>Bluſhes once from his hardned forehead thrown,</l>
            <l>VVho is it ſins, and is content with one?</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:52730:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
No, no, our PLUTO hath mauy in ſtore,</l>
            <l>And longs to Act them ore and ore:</l>
            <l>But <hi>Magna Charta</hi> ſtopp'd his intent,</l>
            <l>By a late Attachment, which he ſent.</l>
            <l>Unto Sheriff—to execute,</l>
            <l>VVhich makes the Devil very mute;</l>
            <l>And now ſtands bound unto his good behavior</l>
            <l>And muſt neither kick, nor ſtrike, nor ſwager:</l>
            <l>And therefore now, ſince <hi>Pluto</hi> is in bands,</l>
            <l>Let each with me rejoyce, and <hi>Clap their hands.</hi>
