            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Dark beneath, but bright above:</l>
               <l>Here disdaining, there in Love.</l>
               <l>How loose and easie hence to go:</l>
               <l>How girt and ready to ascend.</l>
               <l>Moving but on a point below,</l>
               <l>It all about does upwards bend.</l>
               <l>Such did the Manna's sacred Dew destil;</l>

               <l>LUxurious Man, to bring his Vice in use,</l>
               <l>Did after him the World seduce:</l>
               <l>And from the fields the Flow'rs and Plants allure,</l>
               <l>Where Nature was most plain and pure.</l>
               <l>He first enclos'd within the Gardens square</l>

               <l>The Pink grew then as double as his Mind;</l>
               <l>The nutriment did change the kind.</l>
               <l>With strange perfumes he did the Roses taint.</l>
               <l>And Flow'rs themselves were taught to paint.</l>

               <l>Its Onion root they then so high did hold,</l>
               <l>That one was for a Meadow sold.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>OBlig'd by frequent visits of this man,</l>
                  <l>Whom as Priest, Poet, and Musician,</l>
                  <l>I for some branch of <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> took,</l>
                  <l>(Though he derives himself from <hi>my Lord Brooke)</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>I sought his Lodging; which is at the Sign</l>
                  <l>Of the sad <hi>Pelican;</hi> Subject divine</l>
                  <l>For Poetry: There three Stair-Cases high,</l>
                  <l>Which signifies his triple property,</l>
                  <l>I found at last a Chamber, as 'twas said,</l>
                  <l>But seem'd a Coffin set on the Stairs head.</l>
                  <l>Not higher then Seav'n, nor larger then three feet;</l>
                  <l>Only there was nor Seeling, nor a Sheet,</l>

Save that th' ingenious Door did as you come</l>
                  <l>Turn in, and shew to Wainscot half the Room.</l>
                  <l>Yet of his State no man could have complain'd;</l>
                  <l>There being no Bed where he entertain'd:</l>
                  <l>And though within one Cell so narrow pent,</l>
                  <l>He'd <hi>Stanza</hi>'s for a whole Appartement.</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Straight without further information,</l>
               <l>In hideous verse, he, and a dismal tone,</l>
               <l>Begins to exercise; as if I were</l>
               <l>Possest; and sure the <hi>Devil</hi> brought me there.</l>
               <l>But I, who now imagin'd my self brought</l>
               <l>To my last Tryal, in a serious thought</l>
               <l>Calm'd the disorders of my youthful Breast,</l>
               <l>And to my Martyrdom prepared Rest.</l>
               <l>Only this frail Ambition did remain,</l>
               <l>The last distemper of the sober Brain,</l>
               <l>That there had been some present to assure</l>
               <l>The future Ages how I did indure:</l>
               <l>And how I, silent, turn'd my burning Ear</l>
               <l>Towards the Verse; and when that could n</l>
               <l>Held him the other; and unchanged yet,</l>
               <l>Ask'd still for more, and pray'd him to repeat:</l>
               <l>Till the Tyrant, weary to persecute,</l>
               <l>Left off, and try'd t' allure me with his Lute.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now as two Instruments, to the same key</l>
               <l>Being tun'd by Art, if the one touched be</l>
               <l>The other opposite as soon replies,</l>
               <l>Mov'd by the Air and hidden Sympathies;</l>
               <l>So while he with his gouty Fingers craules</l>
               <l>Over the Lute, his murmuring Belly calls,</l>
               <l>Whose hungry Guts to the same streightness twin'd</l>
               <l>In Echo to the trembling Strings repin'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I, that perceiv'd now what his Musick ment,</l>
               <l>Ask'd civilly if he had eat this Lent.</l>
               <l>He answered yes; with such, and such an one.</l>
               <l>For he has this of gen'rous, that alone</l>
               <l>He never feeds; save only when he tryes</l>
               <l>With gristly Tongue to dart the passing Flyes.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:60431:32"/>
I ask'd if he eat flesh. And he, that was</l>
               <l>So hungry that though ready to say <hi>Mass</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Would break his fast before, said he was Sick,</l>
               <l>And th' <hi>Ordinance</hi> was only Politick.</l>
               <l>Nor was I longer to invite him: Scant</l>
               <l>Happy at once to make him Protestant,</l>
               <l>And Silent. Nothing now Dinner stay'd</l>
               <l>But till he had himself a Body made.</l>
               <l>I mean till he were drest: for else so thin</l>
               <l>He stands, as if he only fed had been</l>
               <l>With consecrated Wafers: and the <hi>Host</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Hath sure more flesh and blood then he can boast.</l>
               <l>This <hi>Basso Relievo</hi> of a Man,</l>
               <l>Who as a Camel tall, yet easly can</l>
               <l>The Needles Eye thread without any stich,</l>
               <l>(His only impossible is to be rich)</l>
               <l>Lest his too suttle Body, growing rare,</l>
               <l>Should leave his Soul to wander in the Air,</l>
               <l>He therefore circumscribes himself in rimes;</l>
               <l>And swaddled in's own papers seaven times,</l>
               <l>Wears a close Jacket of poetick Buff,</l>
               <l>With which he doth his third Dimension Stuff.</l>
               <l>Thus armed underneath, he over all</l>
               <l>Does make a primitive <hi>Sotana</hi> fall;</l>
               <l>And above that yet casts an antick Cloak,</l>
               <l>Worn at the first Counsel of <hi>Antioch;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Which by the <hi>Jews</hi> long hid, and Disesteem'd,</l>
               <l>He heard of by Tradition, and redeem'd.</l>
               <l>But were he not in this black habit deck't,</l>
               <l>This half transparent Man would soon reflect</l>
               <l>Each colour that he past by; and be seen,</l>
               <l>As the <hi>Chamelion,</hi> yellow, blew, or green.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He drest, and ready to disfurnish now</l>
               <l>His Chamber, whose compactness did allow</l>
               <l>No empty place for complementing doubt,</l>
               <l>But who came last is forc'd first to go out;</l>
               <l>I meet one on the Stairs who made me stand,</l>
               <l>Stopping the passage, and did him demand:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:60431:32"/>
I answer'd he is here <hi>Sir;</hi> but you see</l>
               <l>You cannot pass to him but thorow me.</l>
               <l>He thought himself affronted; and reply'd,</l>
               <l>I whom the Pallace never has deny'd</l>
               <l>Will make the way here; I said <hi>Sir</hi> you'l do</l>
               <l>Me a great favour, for I seek to go.</l>
               <l>He gathring fury still made sign to draw;</l>
               <l>But himself there clos'd in a Scabbard saw</l>
               <l>As narrow as his Sword's; and I, that was</l>
               <l>Delightful, said there can no Body pass</l>
               <l>Except by penetration hither, where</l>
               <l>Two make a crowd, nor can three Persons here</l>
               <l>Consist but in one substance. Then, to fit</l>
               <l>Our peace, the Priest said I too had some wit:</l>
               <l>To prov't, I said, the place doth us invite</l>
               <l>But its own narrowness, Sir, to unite.</l>
               <l>He ask'd me pardon; and to make me way</l>
               <l>Went down, as I him follow'd to obey.</l>
               <l>But the propitiatory Priest had straight</l>
               <l>Oblig'd us, when below, to celebrate</l>
               <l>Together our attonement: so increas'd</l>
               <l>Betwixt us two the Dinner to a Feast.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Let it suffice that we could eat in peace;</l>
               <l>And that both Poems did and Quarrels cease</l>
               <l>During the Table; though my new made Friend</l>
               <l>Did, as he threatned, ere 'twere long intend</l>
               <l>To be both witty and valiant: I loth,</l>
               <l>Said 'twas too late, he was already both.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But now, Alas, my first Tormentor came,</l>
               <l>Who satisfy'd with eating, but not tame</l>
               <l>Turns to recite; though Judges most severe</l>
               <l>After th' Assizes dinner mild appear,</l>
               <l>And on full stomach do condemn but few:</l>
               <l>Yet he more strict my sentence doth renew;</l>
               <l>And draws out of the black box of his Breast</l>
               <l>Ten quire of paper in which he was drest.</l>
               <l>Yet that which was a greater cruelty</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Nero</hi>'s Poem he calls charity:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:60431:33"/>
And so the <hi>Pelican</hi> at his door hung</l>
               <l>Picks out the tender bosome to its young.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Of all his Poems there he stands ungirt</l>
               <l>Save only two foul copies for his shirt:</l>
               <l>Yet these he promises as soon as clean.</l>
               <l>But how I loath'd to see my Neighbour glean</l>
               <l>Those papers, which he pilled from within</l>
               <l>Like white fleaks rising from a Leaper's skin!</l>
               <l>More odious then those raggs which the <hi>French</hi> youth</l>
               <l>At ordinaries after dinner show'th,</l>
               <l>When they compare their <hi>Chancres</hi> and <hi>Poulains.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Yet he first kist them, and after takes pains</l>
               <l>To read; and then, because he understood (good.</l>
               <l>Not one Word, thought and swore that they were</l>
               <l>But all his praises could not now appease</l>
               <l>The provok't Author, whom it did displease</l>
               <l>To hear his Verses, by so just a curse,</l>
               <l>That were ill made condemn'd to be read worse:</l>
               <l>And how (impossible) he made yet more</l>
               <l>Absurdityes in them then were before.</l>
               <l>For he his untun'd voice did fall or raise</l>
               <l>As a deaf Man upon a Viol playes,</l>
               <l>Making the half points and the periods run</l>
               <l>Confus'der then the atomes in the Sun.</l>
               <l>Thereat the Poet swell'd, with anger full,</l>
               <l>And roar'd out, like <hi>Perillus</hi> in's own <hi>Bull;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> you read false. That any one but you</l>
               <l>Should know the contrary. Whereat, I, now</l>
               <l>Made Mediator, in my room, said, Why?</l>
               <l>To say that you read false <hi>Sir</hi> is no Lye.</l>
               <l>Thereat the waxen Youth relented straight;</l>
               <l>But saw with sad dispair that was too late.</l>
               <l>For the disdainful Poet was retir'd</l>
               <l>Home, his most furious Satyr to have fir'd</l>
               <l>Against the Rebel; who, at this struck dead,</l>
               <l>Wept bitterly as disinherited.</l>
               <l>Who should commend his Mistress now? Or who</l>
               <l>Praise him? both difficult indeed to do</l>

With truth. I counsell'd him to go in time,</l>
               <l>Ere the fierce Poets anger turn'd to rime.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He hasted; and I, finding my self free,</l>

               <l>Have made the Chance be painted; and go now</l>
               <l>To hang it in <hi>Saint Peter's</hi> for a Vow.</l>

The good Interpreter. Some in this task</l>

               <l>Changing the Latine, but do more obscure</l>
               <l>That sence in <hi>English</hi> which was bright and pure.</l>
               <l>So of Translators they are Authors grown,</l>

               <l>He is Translations thief that addeth more,</l>

               <l>And so disliking, that they nothing see</l>
               <l>Now worth the liking, but thy Book and thee.</l>
               <l>And (if I Judgment have) I censure right;</l>
               <l>For something guides my hand that I must write.</l>

            <head>TO Sir John Trott,</head>

               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have not that vanity to believe, if you weigh your late Loss by the common ballance, that any thing I can write to you should lighten your resentments: nor if you measure things by the rule of Christianity, do I think it needful to comfort you in your own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and your Sons happiness. Only having a great esteem and affection for you, and the grateful memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of him that is departed being still green and fresh upon my Spirit, I cannot forbear to inquire how you have stood the second shock at your sad meeting of Friends in the Country. I know that the very sight of those who have been witnesses of our better For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, doth but serve to reinforce a Calamity. I know the contagion of grief, and infection of Tears, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when it runs in a blood. And I my self could sooner imitate then blame those innocent relentings of Nature, so that they spring from tenderness only and humanity, not from an implacable sorrow. The Tears of a family may flow together like those little drops that compact the Rainbow, and if they be plac'd with the same advantage towards Heaven as those are to the Sun, they too have their splendor; and like that bow while they unbend into seasonable showers, yet they promise that there shall not be a second flood. But the dissoluteness of grief, the prodigality of sorrow is neither to be indulg'd in a mans self, nor comply'd within others. If that were allowable in these cases, <hi>Eli's</hi> was the readiest way and highest complement of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60431:38"/>
mourning, who fell back from his seat and broke his neck. But neither does that precedent hold. For though he had been Chancellor, and in effect King of <hi>Israel,</hi> for so many years; and such men value as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so their losses at an higher rate then other; yet when he heard that <hi>Israel</hi> was overcome, that his two Sons <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> were slain in one day, and saw himself so without hope of Issue, and which imbitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it further without succession to the Government, yet he fell not till the News that the Ark of God was taken. I pray God that we may never have the same paralel perfected in our publick concernments. Then we shall need all the strength of Grace and Nature to support us. But upon a private loss, and sweetned with so many circumstances as yours, to be impatient, to be uncomfortable, would be to dispute with God and beg the question. Though in respect of an on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gourd an only Son be inestimable, yet in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to God man bears a thousand times less proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so that it is like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s sin to be angry at God for the withering of his Shadow. <hi>Zipporah,</hi> though the delay had almost cost her husband his life, yet when he did but circumcise her Son, in a womanish pevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness reproacht <hi>Moses</hi> as a bloody husband. But if God take the Son himself, but spare the Father, shall we say that he is a bloody God. He that gave his own Son, may he not take ours? 'Tis pride that makes a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel. And nothing but the over-weening of our selves and our own things that raises us against divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Whereas <hi>Abraham's</hi> obedience was better then Sacrifice. And if God please to accept both, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a farther Tryal, but a greater honour. I could say over upon this beaten occasion most of those les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of morality and religion that have been so often repeated and are as soon forgotten. We abound with precept, but we want examples. You, Sir, that have all these things in your memory, and the clearness of whose Judgment is not to be obscured by any greater
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60431:38"/>
interposition, it remains that you be exemplary to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in your own practice. 'Tis true, it is an hard task to learn and teach at the same time. And, where your self are the experiment, it is as if a man should dissect his own body and read the Anatomy Lecture. But I will not heighten the difficulty while I advise the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Only, as in difficult things, you will do well to make use of all that may strengthen and assist you. The word of God: The society of good men: and the books of the Ancients. There is one way more, which is by diversion, business, and activity; which are also necessary to be used in their season. But I my self, who live to so little purpose, can have little au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or ability to advise you in it, who are a Person that are and may be much more so generally useful. All that I have been able to do since, hath been to write this sorry Elogie of your Son, which if it be as good as I could wish, it is as yet no undecent imployment. However I know you will take any thing kindly from your very affectionate friend and most humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>

               <l>NOW does <hi>Spains</hi> Fleet her spatious wings unfold,</l>
               <l>Leaves the new World and hastens for the old:</l>
               <l>But though the wind was fair, they slowly swoome</l>
               <l>Frayted with acted Guilt, and Guilt to come:</l>
               <l>For this rich load, of which so proud they are,</l>
               <l>Was rais'd by Tyranny, and rais'd for War;</l>
               <l>Every capatious Gallions womb was fill'd,</l>
               <l>With what the Womb of wealthy Kingdomes yield,</l>
               <l>The new Worlds wounded Intails they had tore,</l>
               <l>For wealth wherewith to wound the old once more.</l>
               <l>Wealth which all others Avarice might cloy,</l>
               <l>But yet in them caus'd as much fear, as Joy.</l>
               <l>For now upon the Main, themselves they saw,</l>
               <l>That boundless Empire, where you give the Law,</l>
               <l>Of winds and waters rage, they fearful be,</l>
               <l>But much more fearful are your Flags to see.</l>
               <l>Day, that to those who sail upon the deep,</l>
               <l>More wish't for, and more welcome is then sleep,</l>
               <l>They dreaded to behold, Least the Sun's light,</l>
               <l>With <hi>English</hi> Streamers, should salute their sight:</l>
               <l>In thickest darkness they would choose to steer,</l>
               <l>So that such darkness might suppress their fear;</l>
               <l>At length theirs vanishes, and fortune smiles;</l>
               <l>For they behold the sweet Canary Isles;</l>
               <l>One of which doubtless is by Nature blest</l>
               <l>Above both Worlds, since 'tis above the rest.</l>

A happy People, which at once do gain</l>
               <l>The benefits without the ills of rain.</l>
               <l>Both health and profit, Fate cannot deny;</l>
               <l>Where still the Earth is moist, the Air still dry;</l>
               <l>The jarring Elements no discord know,</l>
               <l>Fewel and Rain together kindly grow;</l>
               <l>And coolness there, with heat doth never fight,</l>
               <l>This only rules by day, and that by Night.</l>
               <l>Your worth to all these Isles, a just right brings,</l>
               <l>The best of Lands should have the best of Kings.</l>
               <l>And these want nothing Heaven can afford,</l>
               <l>Unless it be, the having you their Lord;</l>
               <l>But this great want, will not along one prove,</l>
               <l>Your Conquering Sword will soon that want remove.</l>

               <l>Casting that League off, which she held so long,</l>
               <l>She cast off that which only made her strong.</l>
               <l>Forces and art, she soon will feel, are vain,</l>
               <l>Peace, against you, was the sole strength of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>By that alone those Islands she secures,</l>
               <l>Peace made them hers, but War will make them yours;</l>
               <l>There the indulgent Soil that rich Grape breeds,</l>
               <l>Which of the Gods the fancied drink exceeds;</l>
               <l>They still do yield, such is their pretious mould,</l>
               <l>All that is good, and are not curst with Gold.</l>
               <l>With fatal Gold, for still where that does grow,</l>
               <l>Neither the Soyl, nor People quiet know.</l>
               <l>Which troubles men to raise it when 'tis Oar,</l>
               <l>And when 'tis raised, does trouble them much more.</l>
               <l>Ah, why was thither brought that cause of War,</l>
               <l>Kind Nature had from thence remov'd so far.</l>
               <l>In vain doth she those Islands free from Ill,</l>

               <l>But whilst I draw that Scene, where you ere long,</l>

               <l>For <hi>Sanctacruze</hi> the glad Fleet takes her way,</l>

               <l>They learn'd with Terrour, that nor Summers heat,</l>
               <l>Nor Winters storms, had made your Fleet retreat.</l>
               <l>To fight against such Foes, was vain they knew,</l>

               <l>Forts, Lines, and Sconces all the Bay along,</l>
               <l>They build and act all that can make them strong.</l>

               <l>Yet they by restless toyl, became at Length,</l>

               <l>THE forward Youth that would appear</l>

               <l>His Numbers languishing.</l>
               <l>'Tis time to leave the Books in dust,</l>
               <l>And oyl th' unused Armours rust:</l>
               <l>Removing from the Wall</l>
               <l>The Corslet of the Hall.</l>
               <l>So restless <hi>Cromwel</hi> could not cease</l>
               <l>In the inglorious Arts of Peace,</l>
               <l>But through adventrous War</l>
               <l>Urged his active Star.</l>
               <l>And, like the three-fork'd Lightning, first</l>
               <l>Breaking the Clouds where it was nurst,</l>
               <l>Did through his own Side</l>
               <l>His fiery way divide.</l>
               <l>For 'tis all one to Courage high</l>
               <l>The Emulous or Enemy;</l>
               <l>And with such to inclose</l>
               <l>Is more then to oppose.</l>
               <l>Then burning through the Air he went,</l>
               <l>And Pallaces and Temples rent:</l>
               <l>And <hi>Caesars</hi> head at last</l>

And, if we would speak true,</l>
               <l>Much to the Man is due.</l>
               <l>Who, from his private Gardens, where</l>
               <l>He liv'd reserved and austere,</l>
               <l>As if his hightest plot</l>

               <l>And plead the antient Rights in vain:</l>

               <l>As Men are strong or weak.</l>
               <l>Nature that hateth emptiness,</l>
               <l>Allows of penetration less:</l>
               <l>And therefore must make room</l>
               <l>Where greater Spirits come.</l>
               <l>What Field of all the Civil Wars,</l>

               <l>Where, twining subtile fears with hope,</l>
               <l>He wove a Net of such a scope,</l>

               <l>To <hi>Caresbrooks</hi> narrow case.</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>He</hi> nothing common did or mean</l>
               <l>Upon that memorable Scene:</l>
               <l>But with his keener Eye</l>
               <l>The Axes edge did try:</l>
               <l>Nor call'd the <hi>Gods</hi> with vulgar spight</l>
               <l>To vindicate his helpless Right,</l>
               <l>But bow'd his comely Head,</l>

This was that memorable Hour</l>

               <l>A bleeding Head where they begun,</l>

               <l>Foresaw it's happy Fate.</l>
               <l>And now the <hi>Irish</hi> are asham'd</l>

               <l>He to the <hi>Common Feet</hi> presents</l>

            </head>
            <lg>
               <l>THat Providence which had so long the care</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Cromwell's</hi> head, and numbred ev'ry hair,</l>
               <l>Now in its self (the Glass where all appears)</l>
               <l>Had seen the period of his golden Years:</l>
               <l>And thenceforth onely did attend to trace,</l>
               <l>What death might least so sair a Life deface.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The People, which what most they fear esteem,</l>
               <l>Death when more horrid so more noble deem;</l>
               <l>And blame the last <hi>Act,</hi> like <hi>Spectators</hi> vain,</l>
               <l>Unless the <hi>Prince</hi> whom they applaud be slain.</l>
               <l>Nor Fate indeed can well refuse that right</l>
               <l>To those that liv'd in War, to dye in Fight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But long his <hi>Valour</hi> none had left that could</l>
               <l>Indanger him, or <hi>Clemency</hi> that would.</l>
               <l>And he whom Nature all for Peace had made,</l>
               <l>But angry Heaven unto War had sway'd,</l>
               <l>And so less useful where he most desir'd,</l>
               <l>For what he least affected was admir'd,</l>
               <l>Deserved yet an End whose ev'ry part</l>
               <l>Should speak the wondrous softness of his Heart.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi> the fatal Writ was sign'd;</l>
               <l>(Those nobler weaknesses of humane Mind,</l>
               <l>From which those Powers that issu'd the Decree,</l>
               <l>Although immortal, found they were not free.)</l>
               <l>That they, to whom his Breast still open lyes,</l>
               <l>In gentle Passions should his Death disguise:</l>
               <l>And leave succeeding Ages cause to mourn,</l>
               <l>As long as Grief shall weep, or Love shall burn.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Streight does a slow and languishing Disease</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Eliza,</hi> Natures and his darling, seize.</l>
               <l>Her when an infant, taken with her Charms,</l>
               <l>He oft would flourish in his mighty Arms;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:60431:74"/>
And, lest their force the tender burthen wrong,</l>
               <l>Slacken the vigour of his Muscles strong;</l>
               <l>Then to the Mothers brest her softly move,</l>
               <l>Which while she drain'd of Milk she fill'd with Love:</l>
               <l>But as with riper Years her Virtue grew,</l>
               <l>And ev'ry minute adds a Lustre new;</l>
               <l>When with meridian height her Beauty shin'd,</l>
               <l>And thorough that sparkled her fairer Mind;</l>
               <l>When She with Smiles serene and Words discreet</l>
               <l>His hidden Soul at ev'ry turn could meet;</l>
               <l>Then might y' ha' daily his Affection spy'd,</l>
               <l>Doubling that knot which Destiny had ty'd.</l>
               <l>While they by sence, not knowing, comprehend</l>
               <l>How on each other both their Fates depend.</l>
               <l>With her each day the pleasing Hours he shares,</l>
               <l>And at her Aspect calms her growing Cares;</l>
               <l>Or with a Grandsire's joy her Children sees</l>
               <l>Hanging about her neck or at his knees.</l>
               <l>Hold fast dear Infants, hold them both or none;</l>
               <l>This will not stay when once the other's gone.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A silent fire now wasts those Limbs of Wax,</l>
               <l>And him within his tortur'd Image racks.</l>
               <l>So the Flowr with'ring which the Garden crown'd,</l>
               <l>The sad Root pines in secret under ground.</l>
               <l>Each Groan he doubled and each Sigh he sigh'd,</l>
               <l>Repeated over to the restless Night.</l>
               <l>No trembling String compos'd to numbers new,</l>
               <l>Answers the touch in Notes more sad more true.</l>
               <l>She lest He grieve hides what She can her pains,</l>
               <l>And He to lessen hers his Sorrow feigns:</l>
               <l>Yet both perceiv'd, yet both conceal'd their Skills,</l>
               <l>And so diminishing increast their ills:</l>
               <l>That whether by each others grief they fell,</l>
               <l>Or on their own redoubled, none can tell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And now <hi>Eliza</hi>'s purple Locks were shorn,</l>
               <l>Where She so long her <hi>Fathers</hi> fate had worn:</l>
               <l>And frequent lightning to her Soul that flyes,</l>
               <l>Devides the Air, and opens all the Skyes:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:60431:75"/>
And now his Life, suspended by her breath,</l>
               <l>Ran out impetuously to hasting Death.</l>
               <l>Like polish'd Mirrours, so his steely Brest</l>
               <l>Had ev'ry figure of her woes exprest;</l>
               <l>And with the damp of her last Gasps obscur'd,</l>
               <l>Had drawn such staines as were not to be cur'd.</l>
               <l>Fate could not either reach with single stroke,</l>
               <l>But the dear Image fled the Mirrour broke.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Who now shall tell us more of mournful Swans,</l>
               <l>Of Halcyons kind, or bleeding Pelicans?</l>
               <l>No downy breast did ere so gently beat,</l>
               <l>Or fan with airy plumes so soft an heat.</l>
               <l>For he no duty by his height excus'd,</l>
               <l>Nor though a <hi>Prince</hi> to be a <hi>Man</hi> refus'd:</l>
               <l>But rather then in his <hi>Eliza</hi>'s pain</l>
               <l>Not love, not grieve, would neither live nor reign:</l>
               <l>And in himself so oft immortal try'd,</l>
               <l>Yet in compassion of another dy'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So have I seen a Vine, whose lasting Age</l>
               <l>Of many a Winter hath surviv'd the rage.</l>
               <l>Under whose shady tent Men ev'ry year</l>
               <l>At its rich bloods expence their Sorrows chear,</l>
               <l>If some dear branch where it extends its life</l>
               <l>Chance to be prun'd by an untimely knife,</l>
               <l>The Parent-Tree unto the Grief succeeds,</l>
               <l>And through the Wound its vital humour bleeds;</l>
               <l>Trickling in watry drops, whose flowing shape</l>
               <l>Weeps that it falls ere fix'd into a Grape.</l>
               <l>So the dry Stock, no more that spreading Vine,</l>
               <l>Frustrates the Autumn and the hopes of Wine.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A secret Cause does sure those Signs ordain</l>
               <l>Fore boding Princes falls, and seldom vain.</l>
               <l>Whether some Kinder Pow'rs, that wish us well,</l>
               <l>What they above cannot prevent, foretell;</l>
               <l>Or the great World do by consent presage,</l>
               <l>As hollow Seas with future Tempests rage:</l>
               <l>Or rather Heav'n, which us so long foresees,</l>
               <l>Their fun'rals celebrate while it decrees.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:60431:75"/>
But never yet was any humane Fate</l>
               <l>By nature solemniz'd with so much state.</l>
               <l>He unconcern'd the dreadful passage crost;</l>
               <l>But oh what pangs that Death did Nature cost!</l>
               <l>First the great <hi>Thunder</hi> was shot off, and sent</l>
               <l>The Signal from the starry Battlement.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Winds</hi> receive it, and its force out-do,</l>
               <l>As practising how they could thunder too:</l>
               <l>Out of the Binders Hand the Sheaves they tore,</l>
               <l>And thrash'd the Harvest in the airy floore;</l>
               <l>Or of huge Trees, whose growth with his did rise,</l>
               <l>The deep foundations open'd to the Skyes.</l>
               <l>Then heavy <hi>Showres</hi> the winged Tempests dead,</l>
               <l>And pour the Deluge ore the <hi>Chaos</hi> head.</l>
               <l>The Race of warlike <hi>Horses</hi> at his Tomb</l>

               </l>
               <l>With pensive head towards the ground they fall,</l>
               <l>And helpless languish at the tainted Stall.</l>
               <l>Numbers of <hi>Men</hi> decrease with pains unknown,</l>
               <l>And hasten not to see his Death their own.</l>
               <l>Such Tortures all the Elements unfix'd,</l>
               <l>Troubled to part where so exactly mix'd.</l>
               <l>And as through Air his wasting Spirits flow'd,</l>
               <l>The Universe labour'd beneath their load.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>The <hi>Stars</hi> that for him fought had only pow'r</l>

               <l>Which, since they might not hinder, yet they cast</l>

               <l>No part of time but bore his mark away</l>
               <l>Of honour; all the Year was <hi>Cromwell's</hi> day</l>
               <l>But this, of all the most auspicious found,</l>
               <l>Twice had in open field him Victor crown'd:</l>

               <l>He march'd, and through deep <hi>Severn</hi> ending war.</l>
