            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Therefore, that it may appeare clearely and euidently to your Lordship, what cauſe did eſpeciallie mooue me to entertaine this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
<pb facs="tcp:2918:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I will by your Honours fauour, in few words, as becommeth me, explane and vnfold the ſecret ſenſe of my minde. The fortunes of noblemen, a man adorned with nobilitie: the ſtate and forme of politike affaires, ſome eye of a common weale: the aſpiring Icarian Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, he, whoſe authoritie is effectuall for the depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Popiſh Phaetons, is onely fit to cenſure and with iudiciall ſtile to note. And what did perſwade me to this labour, being deſtinated to another profeſſion, and euen then champing vpon the vnpleaſant barke of the ſtudie of the Law, which might eaſilie procure a diſtaſt of more delightfull learning, I do not purpoſe to conceale. Plutarch in that part or region of his worke, which is entitled Lucullus (for his whole volume doth reſemble the hugeneſſe of the world) hath reported, and imparted to poſteritie, that Lucullus, Hortenſius, and Siſenna be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing famous for skill in Law, did by couenant determine to write according to lot the hiſtorie of that time. To Lucullus was allotted the deſcription of the Marſian warre, who content with this taske, did with great commendation finish it: and he being a worthie Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, did in the Greeke language diſplay the notable conqueſtes of the Romanes: which thing hauing recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and digeſted in my minde, I found by infallible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experience, that one ſtudious of Law might afford ſome leaſurable time to the diuulging of an hiſtorie. For I do not deſpaire to follow theſe Romanes, though I do not aſpire to their exquiſite and induſtrious perfection: for that were to climbe aboue the climates: but to imitate any man, is euery mans talent. But this ſlender gift, of paper and ſmall accompt (I would it were worthie of your
<pb facs="tcp:2918:3"/>
Honour, your birth, your place) yet flowing from that minde, of which it was conceiued, that is to true nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie moſt addicted, take (moſt Honorable Lord) in good worth and aboue my deſert or expectation, and not onely with looking, but with liking vouchſafe it. The Lord God ſupport your Honour with vnchaungeable ſafetie.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ourteene yeares are now runne out ſithence I fully ended and diſpatched this hiſtoricall labour: for departing from the Vniuerſitie of Oxford in the yeare 1584, and addreſſing my ſelfe to the ſtudie of the Law, I thought it more conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and reaſonable at once to finiſh and perfect this worke, which I had already begun, then breaking my courſe with delaies to be ſtill ſtriking on the anuill, knowing that things begun, are more eaſily conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then thinges interrupted can be conioyned; wherefore in that very yeare and ſome few daies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, I did begin, continue and conſummate the three bookes of this hiſtorie, ſince which time it hath lyen in the couert of my ſtudie, of my ſelfe ſeldome looked on, of others ſome times read, who by vrgent perſwaſion would haue mooued me to offer it to the publike view of my countreymen, to which I would in no wiſe condiſcend, alleaging for reaſon that it would be thought a blemiſh of impudencie in me to aſſay the diſcription of ſuch things, which by <hi>Appian, Plutarch, Paterculus,</hi> &amp; others haue bene excellently deliuered; which I tooke to be a ſufficient fortreſſe and ſupport of my excuſe and refuſall, but againe I heard that all the Romane writers which haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the accidents of this hiſtorie, are either in
<pb facs="tcp:2918:5"/>
their narrations too long and prolixe, or elſe too harſh and vnpleaſant, or elſe ſo exceeding briefe that the coherence and mutuall dependance of things could hardly be diſcerned or coniectured in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſſe of ſo ſtrict deſciphering. This I heard with patience, and anſwered with ſilence, for I durſt not oppoſe my blunt arguments to their daintie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite: the truth ſtanding ſo in the middle way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt bs both, that I could not with ſafe conſcience in all theſe allegations diſſent from them, nor with ſound opinion in all conſent vnto them, wherefore weighing more preciſely in minde, and ballancing with vnaffectioned thoughts the ſtate of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt vs, and beholding the naked pourtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it ſelfe without ſhadow of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I perceiued that the great prolixitie and the too exceeding breuitie of the Romane hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers could not well be couered with the veile of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſonable excuſe: and further the obiection of others could not well be confuted, who do condemne in their writings great diſagreament and contrariety of narration, wherefore remembring my firſt intent in the collecting of theſe hiſtoricall reports, which was to ſingle and ſequeſter the vndeniable truth of the hiſtorie from the droſſe and falſhood which was in many places intermixed and enfolded in it: and to do this in ſuch ſort, that my ſpeciall care in auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the extremities of length and breuity, two loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome faults, from which notwithſtanding few writers be free, might fully and manifeſtly appeare: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering likewiſe that hiſtories are now in ſpeciall
<pb facs="tcp:2918:5"/>
requeſt and accompt, whereat I greatly reioyce, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging them to be the teachers of vertuous life, good conuerſation, diſcreete behauiour, politike gouernement, conuenient enterpriſes, aduiſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, warie defences, grounded experience, and refined wiſedome. And being again ſolicited by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſible meanes, to commit the cenſure of this my hiſtoricall collection to the curteſie of others, I haue at laſt yeelded to this motion, repoſing my ſelfe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon kinde conſtruction, then rigorous deſert. The vſe of this hiſtorie is threefold, firſt the reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the miſchiefes of diſcord and ciuill diſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which the innocent are proſcribed for their wealth, noblemen diſhonored, cities become waſte by baniſhment and bloodſhed: nay (which is more) virgins are deflowred, infants are taken out of their parents armes, and put to the ſword, matrons do ſuffer villanie, temples and houſes are ſpoyled, and euery place is full of armed men, of carcaſſes, of bloud, of teares. Secondly the opening of the cauſe hereof, which is nothing elſe but ambition, for out of this ſeed groweth a whole harueſt of euils. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the declaring of the remedie, which is by humble eſtimation of our ſelues, by liuing well, not by lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king well: by conuerſing in the light of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale with equals, not by complotting in darke conuenticles againſt ſuperiors: by conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelues with our lot, and not contending to our loſſe: by hoping without aſpiring, and by ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring without conſpiring. Let Rome in this hiſtory be a witneſſe, that a ſlipperie aſcending was alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb facs="tcp:2918:6"/>
with a headlong diſcent, and that peace is a great deale better then triumph, which will be an occaſion I truſt to my countreymen of England to be thankfull to God for this ſweete quiet and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renitie of this flouriſhing eſtate, in which England now ſtandeth, wherein the day ſtriueth with the night whether ſhall be calmer: and let it mooue thee whoſoeuer thou art, courteous Reader, to pray with the earneſt endeuor of thy hart, that the Iris which is the pledge of our peace may ſtill ſhine amongſt vs, that the happie Virgin which is the ſtarre of ſafety in the Zodiacke of this common weale may continue immoueable, that our <hi>Halcyon</hi> may ſtill ſit in this <hi>Albion,</hi> on this white rocke to make the ſeas calme, and the waues ſilent, and to preſerue the league of heauen and earth, I meane true Religion amongſt vs. From my Chamber in Graies Inne 13.

Dictatorſhip, the Cenſorſhip, the warlike Empire, the prieſtly dignitie, and many other moſt excellent honors, which before did ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to the Peeres of Rome, and now there wanted nothing to make their power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, but onely that Plebiſcites, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees made by the people, ſhould binde the greater powers, as well as the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which at that time the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the Nobles were exempted. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make them generall, and of like force againſt all, they wreſted from the fathers after much buſineſſe, the law Hortenſia, by which it was enacted that in euery important matter the people ſhould be equally intereſted with the Senate, and that the lawes ſo made and ratified by them, ſhould ſtretch as well to the Senators, as to the people themſelues. After that the common-weale was brought to this good and temperate conſtitution, many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable lawes were eſtabliſhed, many victories followed, many cities bowed vnto them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie monarchies ſued for their fauour, manie tyrants feared their puiſſance, &amp; manie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys dreaded their inuaſion. Then there flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed

in Rome moſt admirable examples of abſtinencie, modeſtie, iuſtice, fortitude, and which was the ſeale of their ſecuritie, an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall vnitie and agreement. Then the ſame of their Curij, their Coruncani, their Fabritij, their Metelli, their Fabij, their Marcelli, their Scipioes, their Pauli, their Lepidi, did ring in the world, whoſe great magnanimitie &amp; wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the tumult of warres, together with their ſingular temperance, and loyaltie in the calme of peace, is to be wondred at of all, and of all to be reuerenced. But when either the Senate or people did paſſe the liſts and limits of aequall regiment, the ancient and vertuous orders of the citie were immediatly troden vnder foote, and their good and laudable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes were encountred and put to flight by diſſolute and vnbridled enormities: then the Aſiaticall triumphs did incorporate into the citie a womaniſh wantonneſſe, then proude ambition mounted her plume of diſdaine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the top of the Capitolle, then their exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue pride and iouiſſance for their victories had againſt Pyrrhus, for their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſt of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, for the ouerthrow of Philip, Perſeus,

Antiochus, mightie kings, for the winning of Spaine, Sicilie, Sardinia, Illyria, Macedonia and Greece, being as yet freſh in their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, were as bellowes to puffe vp their ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling humours. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there ſucceeded a diſmall diſcord, which beginning when the eſtate was at the higheſt, did not end or expire, till it fell to the loweſt ebbe, ſticking faſt in the ſands of a grieuous deſolation. If a man will retroſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuely meaſure the ſpace of former times, &amp; the whole compaſſe of yeares, wherein the fortunes of the Romanes were by God his hand turned about, he ſhall finde that all the weight of their affaires, before the incohation of the Empire of Auguſtus, may be diſperſed into ſixe ages; wherof the firſt containing the number of fiftie yeares, was ſpent in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a towne; for that gorgeous ſeate which nowe we call Rome, was then but a plot of<note place="margin">Rome built.</note> ground, to which houſes were wanting, but afterward a great multitude of Latine &amp; Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane ſhepheards, together with Phrygians &amp; Arcadians, flowing to that place, as to a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reuerenced by pilgrims and trauellers, the common-weale was compacted of theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2918:11"/>
people, as a bodie of diuerſe elements. Romulus the founder of their citie &amp; empire, did delight wholly in mountaines, riuers, woods, mariſhes and waſtes, playing perhaps the eſpiall, to diſcouer and find out in what place it were beſt to erect a citie, and how to conuey things neceſſarie vnto it, and how to adorne it with continual increment and addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of demeiſnes; to ſuch imaginations the fields and places deſolate were moſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and to his ſauage ſocietie this practiſe of life was moſt acceptable.</p>
            <p>The ſecond age which chalengeth other fiftie yeares, did ingender in them working ſpirits and loftie cogitations, which eneagred and inflamed their mindes, againſt the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners &amp; borderers: then it firſt began to beare the countenance and ſhape of a kingdome, which was after enlarged to the ſhore of the Midland and Adriaticke ſeas, which they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vſed as bridges to other nations, then as bounders to their owne.</p>
            <p>The third age whoſe ſteps were an hundred and fiftie yeares, was the crowne and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their kingdome, in which whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

was done was done by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the pompe, glorie and magnificence of that eſtate: as yet the Romane pride was in her blade, and in the tenderneſſe of her minoritie, this threefold age was ſpent vnder ſeuen kings, differing by fatall prouidence in the diſpoſition of their nature, as the frame and condition of that common-weale did eſpecially require: for who was euer more fierce and ardent then Romulus? Such a one they needed to inuade<note place="margin">Romulus ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſt in ſight.</note> the kingdomes of others. VVho more reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious then Numa?

That he might ſharpen their valour by his wit. VVherefore Aucus the great builder?<note place="margin">Aucus a great builder</note> That he might extend their citie with colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ioyne it together with bridges, enuiron it with walles. The ornaments; enſignes and<note place="margin">Tarquinius his orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</note> braueries of Tarquinius, did with rayes of dignitie illuſtrate and decore that eſtate.

And the importune domination of

proud Tarquine did verie much profite, for<note place="margin">Proud Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quine occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</note> the people afflicted by iniuries, did force a paſſage to their libertie.</p>
            <p>The fourth age was as it were the youth of the Romane monarchie, when the flower of their proweſſe being greene, and the bloud of their mindes bloſſoming in their faces and armes, the ſhepheardly ſauageneſſe did as yet breathe foorth the reliques of an vndaunted ſtomacke. Then flouriſhed theſe Romane ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, and miracles Cocles, Sceuola, Cloaetia, which chronicles do therefore witneſſe, that poſteritie may wonder. Then were the Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes repulſed and the Latines and Volſcia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s daily and deadly enemies, vanquiſhed by the triumphant husbandman L. Quintius Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnatus,<note place="margin">The ſpeedie war of Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnatus.</note> which war he ended within fifteene dayes, as if he had made haſt to returne to his tillage. Then were ouercome the Vientines, the Faliſcians, and the Fidenates: then the Galles a couragious nation, vſing their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for armour, in all reſpects ſo terrible, that they might ſeeme to be borne for the death of men, and deſtruction of cities, were vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vanquiſhed: then were ouercome the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2918:13"/>
Sabines and Samnites waſting and diſpoiling<note place="margin">The praiſe of Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pania.</note> the fields of Campania, being the goodlieſt plot, the Diamond-ſparke and the hony-ſpot of all Italie: there is no land more temperate for aire, for it hath a double ſpring-tide: no ſoile more fertile, and therfore it is called the combat of Bacchus &amp; Ceres, no region more hoſpitable in regard of the ſea, here be the noble hauens Caieta, Miſenus, &amp; the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bathes Lucrine and Auerne, the reſting places of the ſea. Here the mountaines clad with vines Gaurus, Falernus, Maſſitus, and the firie hill Veſurius: here the famous citie Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua third ſiſter to Rome and Carthage doth imperiouſly ſtand. They begirt Samniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with warre and bloud on all ſides, till they had rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated her verie ruines, and reuilled in her bowels, and twelue ſeuerall nations of Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana waging hote and furious battell againſt them, in ſuch ſort and terrible maner, as if darts had bene throwne at the Romans from the coulds, were likewiſe ſuppreſſed. In this age happened the Tarentine warre, in which<note place="margin">Pyrrhus figh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting againſt the Romans.</note> the armie of Pyrrhus continually ſlaying was continually ſlaine, and reuenge did liue in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2918:13"/>
death of the Romanes: ſo that Pyrrhus did thinke him ſelfe to be borne vnder Hercules his ſtarre, who hauing cut off the ſeuen heads of Hydra, ſeuen other did ſpring vp. But from this Captaine the Romanes plucked ſuch ſpoiles, that neuer fairer were caried in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. For before this day nothing paſſed in triumph, but the heards of the Volſcian cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and the flocks of the Sabine ſheepe, the broken wagons of the Gaules, &amp; the cruſhed harneſſe of the Samnites: but in this triumph, if you reſpect the priſoners, they were Moloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Theſſalians, Macedonians, Brutians, Apulians, Lucans: if you regard the pompe, it was gold, purple, curious pictures, tablets, and the delights of Tarentum. Next to this was the victorie of the Piſani and Salentini: this age ſhewed her force the ſpace of two hundred and fiftie yeares.</p>
            <p>Then followed the fifth age, in which the bodie of the common-weale grew to great ſtrength, the ioints and ſinewes being by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſoliditie ſetled in firme eſtate. Therefore the conquering nation hauing now attained to the verie manhood of manlineſſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played

her ſtanderd round about the ſides of Italie, to the skirts of the ſea, pawſed a litle, as a great ſcalefire, which conſuming all the woods and groues in the way that it goeth, is abrupted and put out of courſe by a floud co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming betweene. But ſoone after ſeeing a rich pray on the other ſide of the ſea, ſuppoſing it to be a peece of gold pulled from her maſſe, they did ſo vehemently deſire the ſame, that becauſe it could not be ioyned vnto their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion by bridges for the interruption of the ſea, therefore they reſolued to ioyne it by ſword and battell: and ſo was Sicilia ſubdued by the Romanes, which was the cauſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall of the firſt Carthaginian warre, which the warres of the Ligurians, Inſubrians and Illyrians did follow: and after the ſecond Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſecond Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> war.</note> warre, ſo dangerous and bloudie to the Romanes, that if a man compare the loſſe of both nations, they which did conquer, were more like to perſons conquered. For it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that noble brood, and valiant people of Carthage to be abridged of the ſea, depriued of the Ilands, to pay tribute, and to vndergo not onely the bridle, but the yoke: to this age
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2918:14"/>
muſt be aſcribed the circuit of one hundred yeares, which may be termed the golden age of the Romanes, &amp; the firſt age in which they ſhewing their ſtreamers on each ſide of the Ocean, did tranſport their warres into all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world, in whoſe yeares the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes were honeſt, religious, iuſt, ſincere, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and dutifull.</p>
            <p>The ſixt age containing 120. yeares was troubleſome and vgly, bloudie &amp; deteſtable, vices growing with their Empire. For with the wars valiantly fought againſt Iugurtha, &amp; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates, againſt the Carthaginians, Cimbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Parthians, Galles &amp; Germanes, by which the Romane glorie aſcended and pierced the skie, the ciuill ſlaughters of the Gracchi, and of Druſus, of Marius, Sylla and others were mingled and enterlarded: how mournefull a ſpectacle was it, that they fought the ſame time with fellowes in league, with fellowes in the citie, with bondmen, with fencers, all the Senate afterward contending and being in hurliburly with it ſelfe? Theſe times receiued of the other ages an exquiſite commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale, as it were a curious picture, which after mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2918:15"/>
and decaying by age, they did not only neglect to renew, with the ſame colours, but they alſo forgot to preſerue the outwarde forme and lineaments thereof, for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of the auncient maners, which were both vnuſed and vnknowne: for by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent vices they loſt the common-weale in fact, and in name retained it. How lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was the face of things at that inſtant? when euerie man confuſedly being found in the field, in the ſtreetes, in townes, in houſes, in highwaies, in markets, in temples, in beds, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the table or in the porch, was ſuddenly and ſauagely murdered? what howlings were there of them that died? what teares of them that liued, and beheld this? The cauſe of theſe miſeries was too great proſperitie. VVhat made the people ſo earneſt to extort the lawes of fields and corne, but verie famine procured by riot on the one part, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe on the other? for ſuch was the lauiſh miſ-ſpending, &amp; exceſſiue vianding of ſome, that it can hardly be defined, whether more did periſh by the blade or by the banquet, and ſuch againe was the couetouſneſſe, &amp; greedie
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2918:15"/>
exacting of others, that none can iudicially decide, whether the Romanes were more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaged by the enemie in time of warre, or by the vſurer in peaceable ſeaſons. Hence grew the two ciuil broiles of the Gracchi, and that of Saturninus being the third, and that of Druſus being the fourth, who maintained the Senate againſt the Knights: and for the further abetting and auow of this quarell, he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the freedome of the Citie to diuerſe Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians animated to this attempt, ſo that in one Citie there was as much diſcord as in two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall<note place="margin">The Italian warre.</note> campes. This bred the Italian warre, becauſe promiſe was not perfourmed. And<note place="margin">Mithridates an enemy to the Romans.</note> next enſued the warre of Mithridates, ſeeing the Romans on each ſide intangled with gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiles, which preſently bred the enmitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Marius and Sylla, when Marius would haue deueſted Sylla of his Generalſhip giuen<note place="margin">The conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt Marius and Sylla.</note> him by the Senat for the oppugnation of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates. Theſe two gaue Mithridates enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, by leauing the ribbes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale naked and open vnto him, Marius led an armie, ambition led Marius: ambition I ſay ingendred by riches, did raiſe contention
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2918:16"/>
betwixt them: from this the warre of Serto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius and Pompey had his originall, whereof the one was proſcribed by Sylla, the other protected. For Pompey was accompted Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laes minion or fauorite, whom he therefore called Magnus, that himſelfe might ſeeme greater, being the Saint whom Pompey ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Sylla was cruell in reuenging crueltie, and his medicine was worſe then the maladie itſelfe. This ſtirred the diſſention of Lepidus<note place="margin">The diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus.</note> and Catulus, whereof the one would haue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, the other reuerſed, all the acts of Sylla. Then Catiline whom his luſt occaſioned by<note place="margin">Catilines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</note> Syllaes indulgence brought to beggerie, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelfe to the Conſuls. Then Pompey<note place="margin">Pompeyes great dignity in Rome.</note> entred the liſts, as a follower of Sylla, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained excellent dignitie in theſe times, but ciuill, and ſuch as the regular courſe of that common-weale did affoord, whoſe power &amp; authoritie Caeſar could not tollerate, becauſe<note place="margin">Caeſar ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not brooke it.</note> he could not match it: which notwithſtanding he being ouercome and ſlaine, Caeſar paſſed and tranſcended. But when this vſurper had bleached the floore of the Senate houſe with his owne bloud, who before had ouerflowed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2918:16"/>

            <p>This broile and hapleſſe diſſention was the firſt conſpiracy in which ciuil bloud was ſhed, and the firſt diſpenſation of drawing ſwordes within the walles: after that time right was oppreſſed by violence, and the mightier man was accompted the better, the quarels of citizens that were wont to be cured by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe and agreement, were now decided by ſword and bloudſhed, and warres were not followed according to the goodneſſe of the cauſe, but according to the greatneſſe of the pray.

who were ſeditious Italians, whom Druſus la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to make free-men of the Eſtate, he thought to terrifie the citie, but within a ſhort time he was ſlaine in his owne porch, his ſide<note place="margin">Druſus is ſlaine.</note> being pierced with a knife, which ſheathed in his entrailes, and was left there ſticking and filling the mouth of the wound, but when he yeelded vp to the heauens his vitall ſpirit, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his eyes vpon the companie that ſtoode about him, &amp; lamenting that diſmall chance, he breathed out theſe words at the laſt inſtant and with the ſurrender of his ſoule: Tell me my friends and kinsfolke, may the common-weale at any time enioy a more faithfull citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, then I haue heretofore bene?

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2918:25"/>
flames and perillous ſcalefire of the Italian warre, which becauſe it was moſt dangerouſly begun and continued, &amp; with great difficultie quenched and ended, I thinke it not amiſſe to make full deſcription thereof, laying for my foundation the cauſe which moued the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians or Latines to reuolt from the Romans, and to breake their faith before conſtantly kept. But the cauſes of things are ſo ſecret &amp; miſticall, being the moſt remote obiects, to which our vnderſtanding may aſpire, that we may eaſily be deceiued by diſguiſed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced reaſons, whileſt we ſeeke for the true and eſſential cauſes. For to report things that be done it is eaſie, becauſe the eye and the tongue may diſpatch it, but to diſcouer and vnfold the cauſes of things, requireth braine, ſoule, and the beſt proweſſe of mans nature, wherefore to find out the cauſes of this warre, diligence muſt be vſed. This warre is of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe men diuerſly named, ſome terme it the Italian, ſome the Marſian, ſome the Sociall war: all which haue ſufficient reaſon to make good their ſeuerall appellations. The Italian warre it was tearmed, becauſe it was raiſed by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2918:26"/>
ſuch Italians, as were in league with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, which was the occaſion of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of manie good turnes and benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the Romanes: for though they did not inioy the liberties of the city of Rome in ſuch large and ample maner, as the citizens or free men of that Citie, yet they poſſeſſed them in farre greater meaſure, then others which were meere ſtraungers to that Eſtate, and that by the law of ſocietie, which to the Romanes was alwayes ſacred and inuiolate: this warre therfore vpon their reuolt was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Sociale, as maintained by them who had contracted &amp; eſtabliſhed a league of ſocietie. The Marſian war it was called, becauſe the firſt<note place="margin">The Italian warre firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by the Marſians</note> commotion was attempted by the Marſians, a free people of Italie. The cauſe &amp; the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this war do in time greatly differ, for the cauſe hath a retroſpect to the firſt times of the Romane monarchie, when the people of Italie being greatly infeſted and endamaged by the continuall inuaſions of the Romanes, did watch oportunitie, and with ſerious expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation attended, if by anie poſſible meanes they might requite the Romanes with the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2918:26"/>
like, and recouer their auncient rights and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions, and at one inſtant breake both the league and ſhake off the feare which they then had of the Romanes, and which was the laſt marke of their enterpriſe, rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund then condition with the Romanes. But as there is no euill without excuſe, and no prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence without ſome colour of reaſon, and no wiles can be wanting to malicious &amp; wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wits, therefore an occaſion was ſought for, whereby peace might be diſſolued, and diſcord warranted. Here now appeareth the error wherein Druſus was intangled. For they made him an inſtrument or lure to draw vnto them the free vſe of the Romane liberties, which in truth they did neither greatly deſire, not ſtrongly hope for, but they looked for a repulſe, and thought that would be a good occaſion to ground their tumults vpon, and as it were a vaile for their leud endeuours: whereby it is euident that as the cauſe of this warre is ancient, ſo the beginning thereof is<note place="margin">The repulſe of Druſus the beginning of the Italian warre.</note> to be referred to the repulſe of Druſus, which happened ſixe hundred ſixtie and two yeares after the building of Rome. Theſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2918:27"/>
of Italie had this purpoſe and intent, at their feſtiual meetings to ioyne their heads and hands together, and ſo to proceed to the Citie, there to worke the death of the two Conſuls Sex. Iulius Caeſar, and Martius Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus: but this matter being diſcouered, they did preſently put to death Seruilius Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull,<note place="margin">Seruilius Proconſull ſlaine by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motioners of Italie.</note> who was ſent vnto them at the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their ſtirres, by peaceable &amp; reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes to appeaſe and determine them, and all the other Romanes which were at Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum, were ſlaine. This bloudie deed being reported at Rome, did greatly plunge the minds of the Romanes in doubt and ſorrow. For this ſlaughter was as it were an Adamant to draw the other Italians, who did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire in this murther to their part, and as a firy beacon to the Romanes, to giue them war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning not to preſcribe too much in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, but to be circumſpect, &amp; by all warie preuention to anticipate theſe euils, which if it ſhould haue bene neglected of them, would preſently haue turned to ſuch a cloud of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, that the fire which did before ſerue to giue light, would after haue bent his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2918:27"/>
force to burne and conſume: for the next neighbour to admonition is correction, and it is eaſier to auoide then to eſcape a danger. But the Romanes with prouident care fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that the defection and reuolt of them who were linked in ſocietie with them, might be a great maime to their Eſtate, &amp; as it were a ladder for forreine and profeſſed enemies to ſcale the walles of their Citie, did therefore in this war make ſpeciall choiſe, both of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and ſouldiers: for meane men were not to be employed in a warre of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and they that were vnskilfull, were not in the midſt of theſe eminent dangers, to be trained and taught. And becauſe they ſaw that the commodious ending and compoſing of this war, was the hinge whereupon the whole eſtate of the Common-weale did depende; therefore it was decreed by Senate, that both the Conſuls (a rare thing in that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, and neuer done but when exceeding daunger was feared) ſhould go in perſon to the managing of this warre. Neither were the Italia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnprouided or vnaduiſed: for they knew, that if they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered, they ſhould
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2918:28"/>
fall from the eſtate of fellowes to be ſlaues, &amp; their league ſhould neuer more be truſted, which them ſelues had broken: and if they ſhould enioy the victorie, that they ſhould then haue all the wealth of the world at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. This golden bootie being enameld with a ſweete deſire of reuenging old iniuries (for they had written them in marble with a pen of yron) did greatly incenſe their minds, and rauiſh their ſpirits with a burning affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fight. The Marſians who brought the firſt ſtubble to kindle this flame, were gouerned by Silo Popedius, a man as it ſeemed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny<note place="margin">Silo Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall enemy to the Romans.</note> oppoſed againſt the Romanes, to whoſe eares nothing was ſo delightfull as the report of a Romanes death, hating that hower in which he did not impeach their good eſtate. He in this reſpect was diuerſe from manie of his countrimen, in that he deteſted a Romane becauſe he was a Romane. VVherefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſingled out ſome of his factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who were partly by the inſtinct of their nature, partly by his inſtigation, obdurate and eager in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt the Romanes, hauing propoſed and ſhewed vnto them the ſcope and drifte
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2918:28"/>
whereunto his purpoſe did aime, and hauing diſcloſed the meanes, whereby he hoped to compaſſe and effect his deſignements, and laſtly hauing declared vnto them the rewards which they might gaine by their valor, he did labour by this ſpeech to inflame their furie, <q>I am moued and enforced to this new enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,<note place="margin">Silo Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Marſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> not by anie ambitious deſire of enhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing my eſtate, but becauſe I ſee a poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful baite of deceit hidden vnder the pretence of Societie, becauſe I ſee too great charges &amp; burdens to be impoſed vpon vs, becauſe I ſee leud forreiners to be our commaunders, and originarie Italians, though men of good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, kept vnder the ſnaffle, and placed in the ſinke-hole. I ſee the credite of our nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, the libertie deſtroyed, and the ſtate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne, and for our great labours vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and dangers ſuſtained for the Romans, we haue this reward, that we are deſpiſed by them, and they haue not thought it ſufficient to be aided by vs, vnleſſe in the pride of their ſpirits they may inſult vpon our neckes, men of inſolent mindes, by nature iniurious to all other men and by fortune ſuperiour. If a man
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2918:29"/>
ſhould examine from the beginning, and as they ſay from the roote, the degrees of their eſtate, what iuſtice ſhall he find? nay what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice ſhall he not find? The two twinnes who<note place="margin">Romulus &amp; Remus baſtards.</note> were the founders of their city, were baſtards, begotten by the rape of a holy virgin, and by deſtinie were caſt foorth as of no regard, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a ſhe-wolfe feeling perhaps ſome ſauour<note place="margin">Nouriſhed by a wolfe.</note> of her owne nature in them, did with her dugs nouriſh them. After, when from milke they were growne to meate, they were fedde by a chough, and when they had attained to mans eſtate, nothing would pleaſe then but a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp; a regall citie, the foundation wherof was ſolemnized by an augurie deriued from the flight of Eagles. Thus a moſt rauenous bird did ominate vnto them a monarchy, thus a moſt greedie beaſt whoſe hungry teeth, and vnſatiable appetite no pray could content, did giue them milke, thus a moſt theeuiſh and buſie brained birde was their foſter-father. Theſe were the portents and ſignes of their Citie, that it ſhould be a daughter verie like to the parents: theſe did prognoſticate vnto vs the ſpoiles, rapines, inuaſions and violent
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2918:29"/>
incrochments that ſhould afterward be made by the Romanes. And for that cauſe Romulus wold not make or appoint limits and bounds for his kingdome, that he might by force en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into euery ſoile as his own. But what wold not Romulus do, which had the heart to ſhed<note place="margin">Remus is ſlaine by Romulus.</note> the bloud of his owne and onely brother? And thus was their citie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated by bloud: but ſome of the Romanes do with impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie denie this fact, ſome with modeſtie do doubt of it, ſome with griefe do conceale it, and they which by cleare proofe are enforced to confeſſe it, do with this imagination molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the fault, that it was done by the conſent but not by the hand of Romulus. But whether he commaunded it, or committed it, he was a murtherer. After this hainous crime enſued the rape of the Sabine virgins, the rauiſhment<note place="margin">The rape of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</note> of whom they excuſe, becauſe they would not yeeld their franke conſent to mariage: ſurely they cannot iuſtly be reproued, if they, being a noble people, did denie mariage to ſuch a baſe aſſemblie of ſhepheards, heardſmen and hoggards, newly crept out of the ſtraw: for in that great aſſemblie of newe vpſtartes there
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2918:30"/>
were but an hundred men, who were lawfully begotten, and theſe forſooth were at the firſt made Senators. But nothing doth more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray the vniuſt dealing and lacke of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Romanes, then the lamentable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the Saguntines, who had bin alwayes verie conſtant in fellowſhip and friendſhip toward them, and whileſt they did keep their faith to them, they loſt their Citie. Saguntus was fiercely beſieged by Hanniball, which when the Romanes heard, they ſent preſently<note place="margin">The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors are deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Amids theſe delaies, that poore citie within eight or nine moneths after the laying of ſiege was deſtroied of the Carthaginians, when the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">The miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min of the Sagu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tines.</note> conſumed with famine, and one of them did eate anothers carkaſſe, and being wearie of the world, becauſe they ſhould not come as captiues into the enemies power, they made a common fire, into which, when one of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2918:30"/>
them had ſlaine another with the ſword, they were throwne. How manifeſt and manifold is the abuſe which they offred to the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians? They did incite Maſiniſſa the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the Carthaginians to quarrell with<note place="margin">Maſiniſſa quarelleth with the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</note> them, who praetended that the Carthaginia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ought to haue no more land then Dido the Tyrian queene did enioy, which was as much as could be meaſured by the hide of an Oxe being cut into thongs. But could their preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption &amp; poſſeſſion during the ſpace of ſeauen hundred yeares be ſo eaſily diſſipated? by the ſame reaſon the Romanes ſhould content the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues with the cottages and cabbins, which firſt they inhabited. But the Carthaginians being greatly vexed by Maſiniſſa and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes aſſiſting him, did fall proſtrate at the feete of the Romanes, and did grieuouſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the intollerable couetouſneſſe and pride of Maſiniſſa, and requeſted with teares, that of three things they might obtaine one: namely, that either they might equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the whole cauſe and conrrouerſie before the regents of ſome common-weale leagued in ſocietie with them both, and indifferently
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2918:31"/>
affected toward them, or that they would ſuffer them to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by iuſt warre againſt the vniuſt armes of Maſiniſſa, or laſtly, if fauour did more preuaile with them then truth, that they would once determine and certainly ſet downe, what and how much they ſhould yeeld to Maſiniſſa. But the Romanes did not one whit helpe theſe afflicted perſons, and that good Affricanus, whom they ſo<note place="margin">Scipio ſent as vmpier betwixt Maſiniſſa &amp; the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> much commended, being ſent as an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent vmpire betwixt them and their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, did make their diſcord a great deale more: and the deſolate Carthaginians, when they were enforced to prouide for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, were accuſed at Rome for the breach of league, and hereupon they were declared to be enemies. They had ſtraite commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the Romans to reſtore the Romane ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages, to deliuer their money and treaſure into the hands of the Romanes, and by that meane to purchaſe the ſafetie of their Citie: all this was done. VVell this was not enough: the Romanes muſt haue their ſhips, their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and weapons: they deliuered theſe likewiſe: yet this ſuffiſed not: the Romanes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2918:31"/>
muſt haue their Citie, and the Carthaginians muſt build ſome other Citie farre from this: this was graunted vnto them, and Carthage<note place="margin">The Citie of Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge burnt.</note> the faireſt Citie of all Affricke was by them preſently burnt, and turned euen with the ground. Here when the Romanes were preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and vrged with their promiſe, their anſwer was, that in ſpeaking of the ſafetie of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they did meane the ſafetie of the citizens and inhabitants, not of the Citie which did conſiſt of ſtone and timber: O ſnares! ô im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures! ô ſophiſtrie! can the Romans with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bluſhing obiect perfidiouſneſſe and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie to the Carthaginians? Surely as they dealt with them being leagued in ancient ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie with them, ſo I am afraid they wil deale with vs. And I do the rather ſuſpect it, becauſe I ſee they will ſtil haue a difference betweene them ſelues and vs. Herein lieth a myſterie, I will not ſay of the Punicke fraude, but of the Romane arte. And when it pleaſeth them to drawe the curtaine, we ſhall be made their ſlaues, and our goods their dearling. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I requeſt you all with all the vehemencie and force of my minde, that you would with
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2918:32"/>
one heart contend for the recouerie &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of liberty, and that you would at length aime at ſuch a common-weale, wherein right and law, not the priuate will of powerful men may beare ſway. To the which purpoſe I know all the other people of Italie ioyned in league and fellowſhip with vs, will affoord the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent aſſiſtance of their perſons, and the beſt wealth of their treaſuries. As for me, ſuch hath my birth, ſuch hath my education bene, that I preferre the dignitie of my countrey, and the libertie of this common-weale before all things in the world. VVhich if you do ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly embrace, I am fully reſolued to lay my life open to all dangers, without anie regard of eſtate or priuate reſpect: if not, I will lay downe weapons, and leaue the eſtate of the common-wealth as it now ſtandeth, to your owne diſcretion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Marſians hearing the name of liberty, did greedily receiue it, and therefore applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Popedius, as informing them of that which was moſt for their vſe, becauſe there appeared in his ſpeech no ſignes of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe or ambition, but an earneſt and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2918:32"/>
deſire of publique good, did reſolue to follow him as their generall.</p>
            <p>They had no ſooner ſet vp flagge of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt the Romanes, but there reſorted vnto them a huge multitude of all the prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Italie: ſo readie are diſloyall perſons to caſt off the yoke of obedience, or common ſocietie, when they haue gotten a head. The metamorphoſis truly was verie great, to ſee the Citie of Rome enuironed on all ſides by foes, which before was garded by friends, &amp; there was none almoſt left to defend the City but the citizens, and nothing to defend the citizens but the Citie. The people that reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted were the Marſians, the Samnites, the Vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians, the Veſtini, the Irpini, the Lucani, the Marruſini, the Aſculani, the Peligni, the Piſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni: and they were led by great Captaines, men of valour and ſeruice, hauing as great deſire to fight with the Romanes, as the Romanes had to rule ouer them. The moſt of them were of ſo choiſe courage and conduction, that the Romanes had before in many warres relyed vpon their ſeruice. But yet the name of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane was ſuch a ſcepter to their ſpirits, that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2918:33"/>
they were ſtill kept in awe and order without anie thought of reuolting. Theſe men were now quite altered, as if they had lately bene at ſome mart of ſoules, and had exchaunged their mindes with ſome men by nature enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt the Romanes: and it is greatly to be wondred how the mightie power of the diuine Maieſtie, doth ſway the moments of things, and ſorteth them in peremptorie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to ſtraunge and vnlooked for effects, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reaſon blind, pollicie aſtoniſhed, ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth feeble, and valour daſtardly, turning loue into hatred, feare into furie, boldneſſe into trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and in the circuite of one minute ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the conquered perſon a conqueror. The Romanes did not in anie warre ſhewe more wiſedome and courage, which two things are in common vnderſtanding repugnant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wiſedome for the moſt part procureth feare in dangerous accidents, which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to courage, and courage cauſeth raſhneſſe which is contrarie to wiſedome. But ſo were their fortunes croſſed, &amp; the lot of warre was ſo variable, that this warre was reſolutely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken of them, vnhappily continued, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2918:33"/>
victoriouſly concluded. The Romane armie had two Generals: namely P. Rutilius one of the Conſuls, whoſe Lieutenants were Cn. Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius Strabo, Q. Caepio, C. Perperna, C. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Valerius Meſſalla: and L. Caeſar the other Conſul, who had theſe Lieutenants, P. Lentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, T. Didius, P. Licinius Craſſus, L. Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Sylla, M. Marcellus, all famous Captains, men of excellent deſert and heroicall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the moſt of them fit not onely to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage a warre, but a kingdom, yea an Empire: yet of all theſe none did obtaine the victorie during the firſt yeare of their fight, C. Marius and L. Caeſar onely excepted, yet Caeſar was not long before with his whole armie diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, and Marius did with great difficultie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieue one victorie, which was the beginning of a greater warre. The Conſuls did thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the encounters of themſelues and their Lieutenants, L. Caeſar was oppoſed to Vet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Cato, who led a wing of the Marſian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, but Caeſar being ouer mated by a man of greater wiſedome and magnanimitie, was enforced to flie, and after the ſlaughter of two thouſand of his men, being hotely purſued &amp;

continued old broiles, and made new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls Cn. Pompeius Strabo, L.

It ſeemeth that Rome in theſe dayes was a verie ſchoole of warfare, which did yeeld the ſupply of ſuch excellent Captaines, after the departure of Captaines not much more excellent. C.

Cinna being now the ſole regent of Italie, the greateſt part of the Nobilitie fled to Sylla into Achaia, who in the meane time did ſo fight with Mithridates his Lieutenants and Coronels about Athens, Macedonia, and Beotia, that he tooke Athens, and made great hauocke of his enemies. But if any impute the rebellion of theſe times vnto the citie of<note place="margin">The Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans faithfull to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</note> Athens, he is altogether ignorant of the truth. For the faith of the Athenians was alwaies ſo firme and inuiolate towards the Romanes, that euery action which was performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh or ſtaine of promiſe, was ſaid to be done by an Athenian faith: but they being heauily oppreſſed by the vnſufferable vſage of Mithridates his hoſt, were beſieged of their

friends, when they were held captiue of their enemies, and obaying neceſſitie ſtayed their bodies within the wals, though their minds were without, and entirely with the Romans. Sylla did then conduct his armie into Aſia, where he found Mithridates very tractable &amp;<note place="margin">Silla his hard conditions of peace co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Sylla<note place="margin">Sylla paſſeth quietly tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Italie.</note> hauing entred Italie, it was thought he came not as a reuenger of warre, but as an authour of peace, with ſuch quietneſſe and mildneſſe he lead his armie through Calabria and Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, with a great &amp; ſpeciall regard of the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corne, of meddowes, of men, of caſtles,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2918:43"/>
and cities, and indeed he aſſayed by lawfull articles, and equall conditions, to appeaſe the diſcord, but peace could not pleaſe them which were immoderatly couetous. Sillaes army did daily increaſe, euery good and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete Italian making recourſe vnto him, and he had a moſt happy victory about Capua a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Scipio and Norbanus Conſuls, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus being ouercome by fight, Scipio being forſaken of his army, yet Sylla gaue him leaue to depart, without hurt or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſo vnlike was he to himſelfe in his warres, and after his victory, for whilſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie was freſh, he was more mild then equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie required, but when peace had taken roote, he was more cruell then any barbarous Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian, for Q.

At that time to fill vp the meaſure

of publike miſhap, in the city of Rome, where before men did emulate one another in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions, now they did combate and contend in malicious practiſes, &amp; he thought himſelfe the beſt man, that was moſt wicked and iniurious. Sylla had three mighty aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, Carbo, and C. Marius, the ſonne of Marius that was the ſeauenth time Conſull, which both were Conſuls whilſt Sylla rong an allarme at the gates of Preneſte, and Pontius Teleſinus, who leuying an army of the Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, did ſtoutly confront Sylla before the walles of Preneſte, he was an Italian borne, but was not free of the city of Rome, a valiant ſouldier and a great enemy to a Romane name, who ſtood in defence of Preneſte, but not with the Conſuls.

Teleſinus did greatly encourage his ſouldiers, ſaying that <q>the day of their battell was the laſt period of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2918:44"/>
the Romane glorie, and he cried that Rome, Rome muſt be throwne downe, and razed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foundations, adding therewithall that there wold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neuer be wanting inuadors of the Italian liberties, as long as the wood ſtoode where ſuch wolues were harboured.</q> At the firſt houre of the night the Romane armie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued their courage, Teleſinus the next day after was found halfe dead, bearing the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance rather of a conqueror then of a man ſubdued, whoſe head being cut off Sylla co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be caried along the ſtreetes of<note place="margin">C. Marius the younger is ſlaine by Syllaes ſoul diers.</note> Preneſte. C.

grieuouſly diſcomforted with the death of her children, her babes were brought foorth for the ſword to glut vpon, the bodies of her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients were made as pauements to walk vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, her matrons became a pray and prize to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rauiſher, her prieſts and deuoute ſacrificers were ſlaine before the gates of the temples. Syllaes bodie was conueied in ſumptuous manner to Campus Martius, in which place before the buriall the two Conſuls, namely M. Aemilius Lepidus, and Q.

Catulus together with the Senate defended the contrarie, ſaying that though his motion were good and honeſt, yet it might be the beginning of ſome tumult, which would be moſt daungerous if it were ſuddenly done, becauſe the common-weale was but newly recomforted, and had as yet enioyed but a ſhort pauſe of tranquilitie. By this diſſention they fell to weapons, Cn. Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the death of Sylla, Q. Sertorius riſing in armes maintained warre in Spaine: for when he ſaw that the faction of Marius which he ſpecially fauoured, was vtterly defeated and diſſipated by L.

VVherefore Cn. Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius being as yet a priuate man, had charge giuen him of the Senate to go into Spaine. There came at that time for the aide and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Sertorius, M. Perperna with a great multitude of ſouldiers. Cn. Pompeius made
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2918:47"/>
way for himſelfe through the Alpes, betwixt the famous ſprings of Padus and Rhodanus. He immediatly after his coming into Spain, did enter into conflict with two of Sertorius his captaines, Herennius and Perperna, and not farre from the citie of Talentia ouercame them: Herennius was there ſlaine, Perperna eſcaped by flight. Pompey did paſſe the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Pyrenae an mountaines, Sertorius in Luſitania, and at the beginning of the ſpring, Metellus and Pompeius did encounter with ſeuerall armies Sertorius and Perperna, in which battell Sertorius conſtrained Pompey to fly, and Metellus draue Perperna to the like extremitie, Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pey was at that time woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the thigh, afterward they met againe at Seguntia, where Sertorius did the ſecond time ouerthrow Pompey, and Metellus Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perna: the third time when Sertorius was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming againſt Metellus, Pompey meeting him in the way, cauſed him to retire: Sertorius did againe oppoſe himſelfe to Pompey. Hauing taking Segida a noble citie of Celtiberia, where Sertorius loſt a thouſand ſouldiers &amp; Pompey as many: then they turned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues

to the beſieging of townes, Pompey did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege Palantia, but Sertorius did raiſe the ſiege, and of them which beſieged Caliguriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did ſlay three thouſand. Metellus and Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius with great ſtoutneſſe &amp; ſtomacke took many cities that were leagued with Sertorius and at Ilerda and Ilioſca the townes of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lergitanes they put Sertorius to a deſperate plunge, but Caligurium the citie of the Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons he did with much proweſſe &amp; puiſſance defend. Sertorius was like to Iugurth in his fight, and in his fortune not vnlike to him, the exploits and ſtratagemes of them both were ſingular and admirable, but their end and laſt euent was miſerable and mournefull. Iugur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha<note place="margin">Sertorius is ſlaine.</note> was taken by treacherie: Sertorius by the treaſon of M. Antonius and M.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, in the eight yeare of his rebellion, his empire was preſently transferred to M. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perna, whome Pompey ouercame, tooke priſoner, and put to death, and in the tenth yeare after the beginning of this warre, he tooke Spaine. The Romanes were in theſe times buſied &amp; moleſted in Italie by certaine
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2918:48"/>
fencers or ſword players, trayned vp in a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed fight vnder the gouernment of Lentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, but defying their maiſter, and ſtirred with an helliſh humor to ſeate themſelues in the higheſt thrones of honor (for as fire is to gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, ſo is ambition to the heart of man, which if it be but touched with ſelfe-loue mounteth aloft and neuer be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth downward till it be turned to aſhes) they raunged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and drew to their enſignes a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude offorlorn men. For in proceſſe of time their armie did encreaſe to foureſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and moe. The leaders were Spartacus, Enomans, and Crixus, who making great ſpoile and ſaccage in Italie, at length imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telled themſelues vpon the mountaine Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurius. Againſt them were ſent Clodius Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Publius Varinius, but their armies were ſuddenly by theſe enemies diſcomfited: therefore the yeare next enſuing C. Lentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus and L. Gellius Conſuls, and Q. Arrius the Praetor prepared againſt them. Crixus one of theſe rebellious captaines, was together with his whole armie vtterly ouerthrowne: but Spartacus, in whome was more vigor of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2918:48"/>
courage, and counſell, conducting his ſouldiers from the Apennine mountaine to the Alpes, and from the Alpes into France, was at the firſt enforced to retire by one of the Conſuls, by the other to flye. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hauing animated, ſurueyed, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled his men, he did ſuddenly turne backe<note place="margin">Spartacus a fence-plaier, doth encoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter the army of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls.</note> vpon the Conſuls, gaue them battell, in ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places ouercame them: &amp; was marching toward Rome there to poſſeſſe himſelf of the Capitole, and to erect a monarchie, but that the Conſuls reuniting their diſſipated forces, did hardly with much labour &amp; great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of men reſtraine and hinder him. But he hauing loſt his purpoſe, yet not looſing his<note place="margin">Spartacus taketh the citie of the Thurians.</note> time ſurpriſed the goodly citie of the Thuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, where breathing for a while &amp; refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his armie, and ſoone after reencountring the Romanes, he obtained a glorious victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and a plentifull ſpoile. This ſucceſſe did notably enhance the pride of Spartacus, who preſuming now that he was better then the Conſuls, thought himſelfe therefore fit to be a king. And as Athenio not long before, a ſhepheard and drudge in the fields, hauing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2918:49"/>
ſlaine his maiſter in Sicilie, and muſtred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der enſigne a great number of vagrant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by whoſe meanes he did ſpoile, and lay waſt many hamlets, caſtles, and villages, and applauding to himſelfe in this ſucceſfull pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and roguerie, was adorned with a purple garment, ſtrowted and walked along with a ſtaffe of ſiluer, and enuironed his head with a crowne of gold: ſo did this rebell of Italie aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to himſelfe a regall pompe and title, &amp; making fortune his reſt, which of all things is moſt vnlike to it ſelfe, thought he might as eaſily continue as beginne a conqueſt. But the Romanes who neuer could ſuffer victorie to warme her ſelfe long with the robes of a ſtraunger, committed the whole ſcope and<note place="margin">M. Craſſus appointed for the warre againſt Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacus.</note> charge of the warre to M.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2918:49"/>
and preſently put to the ſword. After theſe times M. Cicero being Conſul, whoſe nouity and ſtrangeneſſe in Rome, the nobilitie and rareneſſe of his good gifts might iuſtly excuſe who for all his excellent qualities was more beholding to nature then education, as for his vertue famous, ſo for his eloquence moſt famous, by whom it was that the Romanes were not inferiour to them in wit, whom they vanquiſhed in warre, the conſpiracie of Catiline was detected and determined, and Cicero for his conſtancie, courage, &amp; watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, in ſuppreſſing the ſcalefire of that warre to the vtmoſt cinder, was intitled by<note place="margin">Cicero cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led Pater patriae.</note> the name of Pater patriae, the father of his countrey. But before I enter into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of his rebellion, I muſt make knowne the perſon of the traytor, and the cauſe of the treaſon. L. Sergius Catilina was in face and<note place="margin">Catiline his qualities.</note> feature comely and abſolute, in wit prompt and pregnant, in eloquence ſweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, in pompe and maieſtie princely and regall, in courtly behauiour quaint and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: and to ſet vpon this gold a Diamond, of a moſt noble parentage. There were certaine
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2918:50"/>
families amongſt the Romanes, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted &amp; ouerheaded the reſt, being moſt auncient and of a worthie originall, and they are parted into two diſcents, ſome of them hauing the Aborigines to their aunceſtours, and ſome the Troianes. The firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall of the race of the Aborigines, was the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie of the Vitellij, being diſcended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus the king of the Aborigines, which did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite Italie before the comming of Aeneas, and Queene Vitellia, which in many places was worſhipped as a goddeſſe: the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was the familie of the Fabij, whoſe ofſpring is rightly deriued from Fabius the ſon of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules: the third was the lineage of the Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nij, iſſuing from Anton an other of Hercules his ſonnes: the fourth was the race of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titij, ſo named of Potitius, who did with great curteſie entertaine Hercules, when he was entred Italie: the fift was the houſe of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milij, borne of Mamilia the daughter of Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus one of Vlyſſes his ſonnes begotten of Circe that notorious enchauntreſſe. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther families which referred their beginning to the Troiane roote, were ten in number:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2918:50"/>
firſt the houſe of the Iulij, who deſcended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iulus the ſonne of Aeneas: the ſecond the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milij, who tooke their name of Aemilius the ſonne of Aſcanius a Troiane, &amp; of that houſe was the matchleſſe Scipio, ſonne to Paulus Aemilius, who being the Romane Generall deſtroyed Carthage. The third the Nautij of Nautes one of Aeneas his companions: for when Diomedes hauing ſtolen the image of Pallas, did perceiue that it was of no vſe to him, after the deſtruction of Troy he offered it as a preſent to Aeneas paſſing by his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but as Aeneas doing then ſacrifice was turning himſelfe, Nautes did lay hold of the image, &amp; by that meanes did appropriate the vſe of it to himſelfe, ſo that the Nautij and not the Iulij did enioy the myſteries of Minerua: the fourth the Cloaelij of Cloaelius an other of Aeneas his companions: the fift the Iunij of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius<note place="margin">The linage of Catiline.</note> an other of his aſſociates: the ſixt the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gij of Sergeſtus one of the Troiane captaines, of which familie was L. Sergius Catilina, and before him none of that name was euer tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any ſauour of rebellion. The ſeuenth the Memij of Mueſteus, an other of the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iane
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2918:51"/>
trauellers, the eight the Cloantij of Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthus a bird of the ſame fether, the ninth the Giganij or the Gianij of the Troiane Gias, the tenth the Caecilij of Saeculus a Troiane alſo who built Preneſte. Catiline being ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the nobilitie aboue deſcribed, made himſelfe through his vices and miſdemeanor ignoble and odious: his life was the picture of licentiouſneſſe: to women he was ſo lewdly affectionate, that euery curtizane of Rome layed claime vnto him. And to marie Aurelia Oreſtilla into a vacant houſe, he committed the ſhamefull murder of his owne and onely<note place="margin">Catiline kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his own ſonne.</note> child: for two things he promiſed her, and performed for her, which were tokens of a mercileſſe heart, the balefull death of his ſon, and the chaunge of the ſtate, in ſuch ſort that Aurelia Oreſtilla ſhould be the Dictatreſſe of Rome. And for the performance he bound himſelfe by a curſed circumſtance, drinking mans bloud to fill his bloudthirſtie humour. In al his actions he was a perfect Protean, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and compoſing himſelfe to all ſides and ſects: with the grauer ſort of men he would be ſad and ſeuere: with the riotous, prodigall &amp;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2918:51"/>
exceſſiue: with chaſt matrons modeſt and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xome: with light huſwiues wanton and vaine: with young gentlemen pleaſant and actiue: with auncient fathers demure and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: to the baſer ſort curteous and pitifull: to the nobler perſons ſociable and gratefull: ſo variable &amp; diſcoulored he was in his doings, that M. Cicero did greatly maruell at his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold dexteritie. The firſt ſparks of Catilines conſpiracie began to blaze and appeare, L. Tullus, M. Lepidus being Conſuls, ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eightie &amp; ſeuen yeres after the building<note place="margin">Catiline greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted.</note> of Rome. At that time was Catuline greatly indebted, &amp; becauſe he could not diſcharge the ſumme within the time appointed and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by lawe, nor bring in an eſtimate or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation of his goods, whereby it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that he was able to defray the debt, he<note place="margin">Catiline for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to make ſure for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip.</note> was forbidden to make ſute for the Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, whereupon being ſtirred by a reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wrath, he ſought by all meanes poſſible to execute his iniurious intent. There was at that time in Rome Cn. Piſo, a man of deſperate boldneſſe, poore and yet preſumptuous, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline did open and impart his meaning to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2918:52"/>
him and Pub. Antronius, and they three deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to kill the Conſuls, which were made the next yeare after Catilines repulſe. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of this matter was deferred till it came to greater ripeneſſe. Afterward they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the death of the moſt part of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators: the time was appointed when their complices and confederates, abbetters, and aſſiſtants ſhould meet in armour: but becauſe Catiline perceiued that the number of theſe rebellious ſouldiers was not yet ſufficient to giue onſet to the citie, he withdrew his hand for a time, and diſmiſſed the armie. But a yeare after M. Cicero, and C. Antonius ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing entred the Conſulſhip, Catiline being now alſo diſgraced with another repulſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected into his ſeditious braine his aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent plots and former villanies: then he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with P. Lentulus &amp; C. Cethegus Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to worke the death of the Conſuls, to ſlay the Senate, to burne the citie, and to alter the ſtate: and for this purpoſe they did by letters inuite to this horrible maſſacre many Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes that were employed in forraine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. This being apparantly euident, &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2918:52"/>
being now at the doore, and in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to pierce into the citie, vnleſſe ſome mature aduiſe were preſently taken, a Senate was appointed in the temple of Iupiter Stator, vnto which place ſhameleſſe Catiline, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he might bleare their eyes by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended purgation reſorted alſo, and with an vnchaunged countenance ſhrowded vnder the habite of a Senator, the heart of a ſerpent. And becauſe the method of this hiſtorie may ſeeme in this place to require ſome deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Senatorie ſtate, I will briefly ſet downe the conſtant and perpetuall order of the Romanes in going to their ſenate houſe, though I cannot counteruaile with aequall termes, nor with a perfect diſcourſe the great maieſtie and pompe, that in this reuerend ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie was obſerued. The firſt place in the proceeding to their Senate had the Dictator,<note place="margin">The ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie which the Romans vſed in their proceeding to the Senate</note> (when that office was in eſſe) the next the Conſuls, the third the Praetors: the Dictator was therefore preferred becauſe his power was ſupreme, and was not ſubiect to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll of any other, the Conſuls were in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, becauſe they were in praehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2918:53"/>
next to the Dictator, and all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Senate were ratified by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring date according to the dignitie of their perſons: their triumphs alſo were ſigned with the ſame marke: ſuch a triumph was ſaid to be done, ſuch an one being the ſecond time Conſull, and ſuch an one being the third time Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſul, according as their aduancement was. In the third rancke of theſe greater Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates were the Praetors, becauſe they had authoritie to call a Senate as the Dictator &amp; the Conſuls had, which was not permitted to the inferiour magiſtrates: they had alſo iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to examine any matter that was done within the hundred ſtone, after the vulgar ſupputation, within an hundred miles of the citie of Rome on euery ſide. Before the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator went twelue Lictors or Sergeants, who at the bidding of the Dictator and Conſuls did arreſt offenders, and commaunded ſtrangers that met them in ſigne of reuerence to light from their horſes, they caried in their hands an enſigne of terror, a double poleaxe enuironed with a bundle of rods. The Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was caried in a chaire of eſtate, being clad
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2918:53"/>
with a purple gowne, edged with a crimſon border, and inueſted with a robe triumphall, which were the ornaments of the auncient kings of Rome: the ſame attire had the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls and Praetors, but the Praetors did weare a ſiluer coloured garment, and did alwaies ride vpon milke white horſes: after theſe the next place had the Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſors, if there were any at that time, for they were in the number of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall magiſtrates, their office being not of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie, no more then the Dictatorſhip. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe being the more worthie potentates, the inferiour ſort of the authorized perſons did immediatly follow. The firſt of that order were the Aediles of the chaire, becauſe they were conueyed to the ſenatehouſe in a chaire of yuorie, which monument of honour, as it ſeemeth was permitted vnto them, becauſe in ancient times they were truſted and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the entire regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the citie: theſe were created of the bodie of the Senate: next to them ſucceeded the Aediles of the people, which were raiſed to that dignitie from the roote of the people: after the Aediles follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they which had borne office, though they
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2918:54"/>
were not charged with any office that preſent yeare. All of them ſeuerally marſhalled accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the worthineſſe of their calling, the Conſulians, the Praetorians, the Aedilitians, the laſt place had the Senators, which had not yet borne office. The number of them all in ſuch an aſſemblie did ſome time amount to the number of ſixe hundred all of them, theſe onely excepted who were borne in chaires of eſtate, riding on faire pampered horſes, and long traind gownes, the skirts of which were circumſcribed with theſe words, Senatus, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puluſ<expan>

Of thee Catiline when the Romanes keepe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence they pronounce ſentence, when they ſuffer thy miſdeedes they condemne them, when they are at reſt with themſelues, they are at deadly warre with thee. But why am I ſo earneſt againſt thee? Is it poſſible that any thing ſhold amend thee? may it be hoped for that thou wilt reforme thy ſelfe, that thou wilt ſhake off theſe faults? that thou wilt baniſh theſe enormities? Thou art not of ſo good &amp; vertuous inclination, that honeſtie may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime thee from whoredome, feare from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice, and reaſon from outrage: to this mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe nature hath framed thee, frowardneſſe hath exerciſed thee, and deſtinie hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee, and for theſe deformities of thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <p>Catiline hauing all this while itching eares,<note place="margin">Catiline his impudent anſwer to Cicero.</note> but a more itching toung, made in diſorderly manner this diſdainfull reply: I haue a long <q>time maruelled and now with aſtoniſhment do wonder (ye noble Lords and ancient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie of kings) for as to the reſt I will not be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d my ſelfe to them but againſt them, that with ſo patient eare, and minds impaſſionate, ye can digeſt the cholericke railings of this rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall parot, whome ſince we firſt promoted from the pearch to the pinacle, from the bar to the bench, from the ground whereon we go, to the tribunall whereon we ſit, the Senate ſurfetting long ago on his rude and vnmaner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeeches, is now conſtrained to make a diet of a diſeaſe: vpon me as ye haue plainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, he hath ſpent the whole cheſt of his gall, who am as free from the crimes inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as he is farre from the vertues which he
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2918:57"/>
aſcribeth to you. He thought perhaps (what wickedneſſe I pray you hath he not thought) to blow me out of the gates of the citie, by the venimous aire of his impoiſened lungs, but maugre his malicious throat. I ſtand before his lowring face, to the abaſhment of his fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen forehead, and the confuſion of his ill ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king eloquence, as one irreproucable, being like a cage of chryſtall, vpon which the more poyſon is caſt, the more cleare it doth ſeeme. I am not made (Conſul Marcus) of ſo fleeting and brittle mould, that the gnaſhing of thy teeth ſhould either fray me or fret me: but if I were guiltie of the faults alleadged, why was I not impeached of them before thy Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but vnder the triumph of thy tearmes muſt ſuffer this intollerable iniurie? Catiline is an Epicure forſooth, becauſe Cicero is a Stoicke, Catiline is wanton, becauſe Cicero is iealous, Catiline is lawleſſe, becauſe Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes will muſt be a lawe to him: Catiline is prodigall, becauſe he hath not beſtowed any bribes vpon Cicero: Catiline is rebellious, becauſe Cicero is fearefull and timerous: Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline is an enemie to the common-weale,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2918:58"/>
becauſe he is not friend to Ciceroes priuate pollicie: mightie accuſations and vnanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! Hath he not drawne bloud (trow you) of Catilines credit? It grieueth me worthie Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, and truſt me, it grieueth mine heart, that the hope of the Romane youth, and the ſweet ſocietie of gallant gentlemen your ſelues atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, bearing, &amp; forbearing, ſhould by the ſpawne of a ragge be ſo hainouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced: as for his diſtempered declamation it is no noueltie with vs my Lords, for it is the vſuall methode of his mercenare toung, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poore and pitifull preſumptions, to hazard the life and ſoule of his clients cauſe. But what madneſſe is it for one that is lately crept into the citie to talke of antiquities, taking mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in hand which are elder then his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which were forgotten and dead before he was begotten and borne? Thou art not aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient enough Cicero to ſpeake of our aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, nor worthie enough to talk of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, thou art as a pilgrime in this citie, thou art ignorant of the orders and cuſtomes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, thou ſeemeſt to wander in another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and not to beare office in the Metrapolis

of Italie: thou threatneſt vs with extremities, and layeſt on load with impriſonments, as if our bodies ſhould be anuils to thine hatred: but ſuffer not my ſweet, mild and curteous magiſtrates of Rome, that vpon Ciceroes ſuggeſtion we ſhould endure ſuch reproch: the ignominie of arraignment is miſerable, the arreſting of guiltleſſe men is lamentable, baniſhment is diſcomfortable, but the rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rowling, tearing and tormenting of men far be it not only fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bodie of a Romane, but euen from his thoughts, from his eyes, from his eares. For mine own part I confeſſe, and profeſſe, and pretend, that Catiline li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not to pleaſe, but to diſpleaſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place M. Cicero, of whome when I ſpeake, I ſpeake of tyrannie, of villanie, of baſeneſſe, and aſſure thy ſelfe Cicero, that either the law of Rome, or the lawe of reaſon ſhall be my warrant in this caſe, and to them that be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented in this citie, thy fall will be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall s;atisfaction.</q>

            <p>Catiline departed out of the ſenate houſe continuing his furie, and becauſe danger was feared, it was thought good that the Senate
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2918:59"/>
ſhould be diſmiſſed in the night time. Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line went with a ſlender gard to the tents of Manlius.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2918:59"/>
but in wiſedome and aduiſe a father, &amp; a right Senator, who (when others perſwaded that the conſpirators ſhould be kept aliue in ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wards) being the laſt of them that ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the rebellious, did inueigh with ſuch force of mind and wit againſt the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that by the vehemencie of his ſpeech he cancelled their opinions, which perſwaded lenitie, and made their ſoftneſſe to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: and the greater part of the Senate in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of Catoes gracious ſeueritie, did acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Catiline hearing what was done at Rome, gathered an armie, and making a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious iourney through the ſteepe and crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie hils, intended a voyage into that part of Fraunce, which is beyond the Alpes: which Q.

               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:2918:61"/>
from the ſpoile. In that warre he partly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and partly ſubdued to the Romane power, Armenia, Colchis, Cappadocia, Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Syria, and all the region of Paleſtine to the riuer of Euphrates. He ouercame beſide Paphlagonia, Galatia, Phrigia, Myſia, Lydia, Caria, Ionia, and all that part of Aſia which lyeth about Pergamus. He committed the regiment of Armenia maior to Tigranes, the Iſland of Boſphorus to Pharnaces, Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia to Arioberzanes, Seleucia to Antiochus Commagenus: to Deiotarus and other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarkes Galatia with Armenia minor, to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus and Pylaemenes Paphlagonia, to Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarchus Colchis, to Hircane Paleſtine.

He was neare in bloud to C. Marius, and was Cinnaes ſonne in lawe, neither during Syllaes Dictatorſhip could he by any means be moued to diuorce Cinnaes daughter, though M. Piſo a Conſularian, did for feare of Sylla ſunder himſelfe from Annia Cinnaes widow, by which conſtancie Caeſar did greatly endaunger himſelfe; for his death<note place="margin">Caeſars death ſought for by Sillaes officers.</note> was ſought for by Syllaes officers, Sylla him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe being ignorant of their purpoſe. Caeſar being made Conſul, a league of ſoueraigne ſocietie was concluded betwixt him and Cn. Pompeius, &amp; M. Craſſus. Pompey did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enter into that league, becauſe he would haue his acts and deedes, which he had made in the prouinces before mentioned, that were
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2918:62"/>
conquered by him, fully confirmed and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Senate. Caeſar by taking that courſe had a double intent, to increaſe his owne honour by yeelding to Pompeis glory, and to eſtabliſh his owne authoritie by char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him with the hatred of this treuirall power. Craſſus had this drift to maintaine &amp; preſerue the aeſtimation which he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die obtained by the power of Caeſar, and the authoritie of Pompey. There was alſo an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie contracted by marriage betwixt Caeſar<note place="margin">Pompey marrieth with Iulia Caeſars daughter.</note> and Pompey: for Pompey tooke to wife Iulia Caeſars daughter. Caeſar had the regiment of Fraunce committed to him by the Senate, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whoſe Conſulſhip ended, and before his departure into Fraunce, P. Clodius Tribune<note place="margin">Clodius Tribune of the people becommeth ſeditious.</note> of the people began to giue new edge vnto quarrels, and did with maine force bend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt Cicero. For what agreement could there be betwixt them, when their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners did ſo farre diſagree? The head of diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was cut off when Catiline was ſlaine, the bodie alſo was mangled when his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates were put to death, but the ſerpents taile did as yet mooue: for Clodius did ſeeke by all

But it was to be wondred at, that a man conuicted of ſo notorious and hainous crimes, durſt proceede to ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie as to attempt the diſgrace of M. Cicero, or any way to diſturbe his quietneſſe. At that time Clodius was infamous for his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie<note place="margin">Clodius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous for adulterie with Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia Caeſars wife.</note> with Pompeya Caeſars wife, which amiddeſt the moſt religious &amp; ſolemne rites of Bona Dea, this vnchaſt Tribune commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and theſe ceremonies, which it was not lawfull for any man to behold, Clodius in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans attire did pollute. But he was the author of greater lewdneſſe then this, when with his owne ſiſters he became inceſtuous, two of<note place="margin">Clodius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous for inceſt with his ſiſters.</note> them being his ſiſters german, and married to two worthie Romanes, the one of them to Q.

For theſe and other his faults, he was condemned by the ſeuerall cenſures<note place="margin">Clodius co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2918:63"/>
do greatly doubt, whether the Conſuls that did abſolue him, or Clodius that was abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, did more deſerue puniſhment: for by that meane ſuch a window of impunitie was then opened, as could not be ſhut in the ſpace of many yeares enſuing. But Clodius becauſe he was Tribune, and becauſe he was Clodius, did thinke all time loſt wherein Cicero was ſafe. He was then in great fauour both with the people and Conſuls: for when any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie was ſought for by the Conſuls, which could not be preiudiciall to the people, he would labour earneſtly for the Conſuls, and when the people would haue had any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite which did not concerne the Conſuls, he was wholly for the people: ſo that by diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing neither, he pleaſed them both. Vpon this ground he aduentured to make lawes, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt which one was enacted againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who had put a Romane citizen to death without the iudgement of the people of Rome, which lawe though it ranne in generall termes, yet in ſence and meaning it was directly leuelled againſt Cicero, who in his Conſulſhip had by Senate condemned the confederates of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2918:64"/>
Cicero perceiuing this did clad him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe<note place="margin">Cicero mourneth.</note> with mourning roabes, the Senators al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo were attired with blacke, as the aſſociates of his ſorrow, the Romane knights did weare his colour, the inconſolate citie did droope and deplore his ſtate, and the forreiners that heard thereof did enlarge the griefe. For the redreſſing of this maladie meanes were made to Craſſus, Caeſar, and Pompey. But Caeſar denyed to ſtand againſt Clodius, becauſe he feared that the lawes and decrees made by him the yeare next before when he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul ſhould be diſanulled and abrogated by Clodius if he maintained hatred againſt him. M. Craſſus was monies weathercocke, and an hungrie cormorant of coyne, and therefore refuſed to meddle in this matter, becauſe they that craued the aſſiſtance of his authoritie, came not to him with golden faces: only Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey did helpe, countenance, &amp; comfort him, and proteſted openly that himſelfe would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſlaine by Clodius, then Cicero ſhold be abuſed: but the Conſuls commanding the Senators and others to lay aſide their mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſable, did ſo firmely lincke themſelues to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2918:64"/>
Clodius, both againſt Cicero and Pompey, that neither could Pompey profite him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would Cicero ſtay in the citie. For how could he expect any better ſucceſſe, L. Piſo &amp; A. Gabinius being Conſuls, men of notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous naughtineſſe, and raked out of the ſcum of Senators? VVherefore Cicero left the city,<note place="margin">Cicero com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie exile.</note> and in the very day of his departure, his houſe that ſtoode on mount Palatine was burnt by Clodius, and the ſoile was conſecrated to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie: his goods were confiſcated, his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and farmes beſtowed vpon others: there was a lawe alſo made touching his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherby it was prohibited that he ſhold<note place="margin">A ſharpe law made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</note> not haue the vſe of water and fire within the citie, that none within fiue hundred miles of Italie ſhould receiue him into his houſe, that none ſhould make any motion for him to the Senate, that none ſhould deliuer his opinion of Cicero, that none ſhould diſpute of that which was done, that none ſhould ſpeake of it, that none ſhould go vnto him, that none ſhould write vnto him. But in the end Cn. Pompeius hauing vndertaken emnitie with Clodius, being vrged by the earneſt petition
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2918:65"/>
of Titus Annius Milo, and moued by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant kindneſſe of his heroicall nature, did in his mind make ſpeciall election of this care to reduce Cicero from baniſhment. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the yeare next enſuing, P. Lentulus and Q.

The ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his houſe ſtoode, was exempted from reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious conſecration, and his houſe was not ſo ſhamefully throwne downe by Clodius, as it was ſumptuouſly reedified by the Senate, his poſſeſſions were reſtored vnto him, and all the acts which Clodius made in his Tribune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip<note place="margin">Clodius per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth to be an enemie to Cicero.</note> were adiudged to be void. Clodius did greatly indignate at the returne of Cicero, &amp; hauing aggregated vnto him a raſcall route of thriftleſſe and vnconſcionable ruffians, he partly draue away, and did partly maime and murder the carpenters and workmen, that were buſied about the renewing of Ciceroes houſe, he burnt beſide the houſe of Q.

            <p>In the ſeuenth yeare Caeſar went into Italy, vpon occaſion of a mutinie which there did befall.

the Tureus, the Aulerci, the Lemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nickes, the Audians did ioyne in armour and did confederate with the Carnutians.

            <p>In the ninth yeare Caeſar did not enterpriſe any warlike affaires, but laboured ſpecially to cut off all occaſions of reuolting: therfore honorably emparling with the magiſtrates

But what careth he for that, was he not one of Syllaes whelpes, whoſe ſword reaking with Italian bloud he ſo greedily licked, that the taſt thereof doth as yet relice in his rauenous and polluted lawes? But learne of Sylla, learn of thy Sylla Pompey, that a tyrant bathing himſelfe in goare, ſhall at length ſinke by the weight of his cruelties. VVhat Caeſar hath done, I referre to the Oracle of Bellona, what

Caeſar haſted to Brunduſium to aſſault the Conſuls in that place, but failing of his purpoſe he addreſſed toward Rome: there was then in the citie great feare and amazedneſſe, the people cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to memorie the crueltie of Marius, the matrons with their rented haire did diſplay their fearefulneſſe, the young damſels with ſalt teares did blemiſh their faces, their skri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king voices &amp; deepe drawne ſighs, did moue the heauens to a ſympathie. The ſilly babes flying as it were from the face of Caeſar, did cleaue to the breaſts of their parents, the ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt necks did then begin to ſtoope, and the ſtrongeſt hearts to melt, and nothing could be ſeene in Rome but ſignes of ſorrow: for as the earth when ſhe is diſrobed of her budding and fructifying trees, and of her amiable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, which is her onely grace and garment roiall, is like a naked table wherein nothing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2918:72"/>
is painted, ſo was Rome at that inſtant being bereaued of her young and luſtie gentlemen, euen as if the ſpringtide ſhould be taken from the yeare: and a great deformitie did then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ariſe by the abſence of the graue and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers, who with their ſpreading ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow did ſhield and protect the bodie of the citie, and did nouriſh the riſing plants of the generous braſill, gathering ſtrength and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie vnder the curtaine of their boughs. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar hauing entred Rome, vſed all ſorts of men with great kindneſſe and curteſie, and hauing conuocated an aſſemblie declaring and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauating vnto them the iniuries of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he transferred all the blame vpon Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey, and made a notable pretence, that he was deſirous of vnitie, and that peace was the virgin of his heart. But Caeſars Diamond was nothing elſe but glaſſe, and his words no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wind, which at that preſent was clearely and euidently perceiued, for he went in great haſt to the temple of Saturne, where the treaſurie of Rome was before his ranſack inuiolably kept, and at the gates of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple L.

who were addicted to Caeſar rather for feare then contrarietie of opinion, Metellus gaue place to Caeſar, and he ruſhing ſuddenly into<note place="margin">Caeſar ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth the trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſurie.</note> the temple, cauſed the treaſurie which in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares ſpace was leuied by polles, which was gained in the Carthaginian war, and in the victories had againſt Philip Perſeus, and Pirrhus, together with the tribute of Aſia, of Creet, and the wealth which Cato brought from Cypris, and which Pompey purchaſed by his warres, being caried before him when he triumphed, to be laid on aſſes backes, and to be caried as the ſinew and ſupporter of his warres. This was thought the fowleſt act that euer was committed by Caeſar, and it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer feared that Rome ſhold be poore by Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar. This captaine being as glad for this new bootie as ſome of his friends were ſorie, led his ſouldiers toward Spaine, where Afranius<note place="margin">Caeſar mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth toward Spaine.</note> and Petreius did rule the affaires vnder Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey, but he did ſo maſſerate them with famine that he poſſeſt the greateſt part of Spaine, without ſhedding many drops of bloud: then he went into that part of Spaine, which is now called Andeluzia, where M.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied his vncle in the warres following, but becauſe it is a tradition of more antiquitie then credit, I do rather note it then affirme it. The fortune that Caeſar had, and the credite which Pompey enioyed in forraine nations, were two enticing lures, that drew to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral campes a great multitude of forrainers.

               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:2918:75"/>Let it not any whit diſmay you friendly<note place="margin">Pompey his oration to his ſouldiers</note> forreiners, and faithfull harted Romanes, that <q>you are now farre from the wals of the taken citie, and if the Italian ingenuitie, and the heate of the Romane bloud be as yet warme within the Romanes, let them not marke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon what earth they ſtand, ſo they ſtand vpon the ground of a good and lawfull quarrell. It is I truſt euident to you all that we are the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: for if we were in the vtmoſt climate of the world, aud directly vnder the freezing waine of the Northerne Beare, yet in our hands ſhould be the adminiſtration and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the affaires of Italie. VVhen Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus was at Veios Rome was there alſo, and the Romanes forſaking their houſes, did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer chaunge their lawes. Now is Rome Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars captiue, and a ſort of ſorrowfull hearts hath he there in hold, emptie houſes, ſilent lawes, and cloſe courts: we are here as the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhers of Caeſars faults<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the armor which we now beare, is but onely the wrath of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengefull Rome. Caeſars warfare is as iuſt as Catilines, and when he ſhould be like to the Scipioes, and the Marcelli, he falleth into the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2918:75"/>
rebellious faction of C. Marius, Lepidus, Carbo, Sertorius: and yet in truth I honour him too much to conſort him with theſe. He maketh accompt of me as of one withered, halfe dead and foredone with yeares: but it is better for you to haue an ancient captaine, then for Caeſar to leade an armie of ſpent and outworne Veteranes. And though the age which hope doth follow be farre more plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and acceptable, then that which death doth purſue, yet wiſedome and experience proceede from elder times, &amp; the head whoſe haires reſemble the feathers of the ſwan is a Senate houſe to a good armie. And if I may not be a ſouldier, yet I will be the example of a ſouldier vnto you. The aeſtimation that I haue alwaies had amongſt you Romanes, by whoſe meanes I haue bene extolled to that honour, aboue which neuer any Romane ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen did aſcend, may warrant my warfare. VVith vs alſo are both the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſuls, with vs the armies of many forraine kings &amp; potentates. Is Caeſar trow you ſo venturous, becauſe he warred ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g againſt the vnruly French? why it was but a ſporting practiſe, more fit to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2918:76"/>
traine his ſouldiers, then to merite triumph: or hath his fortune againſt the Germaines raiſed his courage, he went not ſo ſpeedily to the Germaines as he departed from them, and rather fearing them then feared of them, he called the Germaine ſea the whirlepit of hell? or doth his bloud begin to boile within him, becauſe the fame of his furie did ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly driue the Senators out of their houſes and harbours? VVhen I diſplayed my blazing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne vpon the Ponticke ſea, the Ocean was no more traced with the pirate ſhips, but they did all crowd into a narrow corner of the earth. Mithridates that vntamed prince, who long expected when victorie ſhould flie from Rome, I enforced to take his pauillion, in which he died like a fugitiue coward, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was more fortunate then the moſt fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sylla. There is no part of the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my trophees, and what land ſoeuer lyeth vnder the ſunne, hath either bene vanquiſhed or terrified by Pompey: and I haue left no warre for Caeſar, but this which now he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, in which though he ouercome, yet he ſhall neuer triumph. VVherefore the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2918:76"/>
Caeſar doth approch vnto you, the more let your courage riſe, or if words cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, imagine that you are now vpon the banckes of Tiber, and that the Romane ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons ſtanding vpon the wals of the citie, with ſtreaming teares, and diſperſed hairelockes, do exhort you and intreate you to fight: Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that out of the gates of the citie the old and grayheaded fathers, that are notable to weild weapons do proſtrate vnto your feete their hoarie heades, requiring ſuccour and defence of you: and thinke that Rome herſelf fearing a tyrant boweth vnto you: thinke that the infants which are alreadie borne, &amp; which hereafter ſhall be borne, haue mingled their common teares, and that they which as yet neuer ſaw the light, deſire to be borne free, and they which do now liue deſire to dy free: and if all this will not ſerue, then Pompey (if he may ſo debaſe the maieſtie of a Generall) with his wife and children will fal before your feet. But this is my laſt beheſt that I require of you, let not Pompey who in his youth hath alwaies honored you, be diſhonored through your default in his dying yeares, for your

ſelues, for your kindred, your freedome and good eſtate. I proteſt thus much, that I will neuer returne to Rome but I will carrie peace in my hand, and the Oliue braunch ſhall be my enſigne.</q> The Romanes were greatly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened hearing theſe words, ſeeing their Generall ſo youthfully minded, &amp; as it were refined in the mould of Mars. VVherefore they expected Caeſar with prepared minds. And Caeſar hauing now praefected gouernors ouer Orichum and Apollonia, made great haſt to Dirrachio, in which place at his firſt comming Pompey gaue him the onſet, and<note place="margin">Pompey put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Caeſar to flight.</note> made him to flie hauing loſt a great part of his armie: and though M.

In Pompeis campe all things were glorious, magnificent,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2918:77"/>
and glittering in ſhew: in Caeſars all things powerfull, actiue, and ſtrong. The Romanes being thus deuided both parties were greatly enflamed with deſire of fight: Pompeis ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were readie to depriue him of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and to enter the field without a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: ſo deliberatiue was that noble Captaine of their welfare, and ſo deſperate were they and careleſſe what befell vpon them. In Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey there was this deſire and thought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome with as little bloudſhed as might be. But what fiends and damned ſpirits diddeſt thou inuocate Caius Caeſar? what Stygian fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, what infernall hagges, and what nightly terrors dideſt thou intreat? to what Eumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des diddeſt thou ſacrifice, intending ſuch a generall ſlaughter? Pompey being earneſtly vrged by his ſouldiers thought good to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall his men, and to ſet the armie as might be moſt conuenient for the ſoile whereon they were to combate. The left wing of the armie<note place="margin">Pompey marſhalleth his armie.</note> was committed to L. Lentulus, the leading of the right wing had L. Domitius, the ſtrength and middeſt of the battell did whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relie vpon P. Scipio: vpon the bankes and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2918:78"/>
ſides of the riuers did march the Cappadoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans &amp; Ponticke horſemen: in the brode field were Tetrarches, Kings, and Princes, and all the purpled Lords that were tributarie to Rome: Pompeis ſquadrons were furniſhed with many Romanes, Italians, and Spaniards. Caeſar ſeeing his enemies to haue diſcended into the plaine, was heartily glad that ſo good occaſion was offred him, and that the day was come which with a million of wiſhes he called for: wherefore departing out of his tents and marſhalling his ſouldiers he made toward Pompey. In this battell, the fathers face was directly againſt the ſonnes, the brother was preparing himſelfe againſt his brother, the vncle was the firſt that leuelled at the nephew, and he that did ſlay moſt of his kindred was accompted moſt couragious. VVhen the tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets denounced the warres, and gaue a ſigne of fight, the Caeſarians did fiercely giue aſſault<note place="margin">The Caeſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans giue the firſt aſſault.</note> to the Pompeians. The force and vigor of the warre did conſiſt in the launces, ſpeares, and ſwords, which Pompey had well prouided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, by ioyning the targets one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that Caeſar had much ado to breake
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2918:78"/>
the array: but fearing leſt his foremen ſhould faint, he cauſed the tranſuers legions to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his enſigne, who as it were with a ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind aduenturing vpon Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peis armie, ſtroke them downe on each ſide ſo faſt as they went. The barded horſe being incenſed with the heate of the warre, his heart being boared with the point of the ſpeare, exempted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the reine. The Barbarians being not able to reſtraine them gaue way to Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, and the foming ſteede being now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the field, the fight was confuſed and diſordered: for vpon whom the dart did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly light, leauing their horſes perforce they lay groning and groueling on the earth, till the hoofes of the arrearing courſers did cruſh the veile of their braines. Caeſar was now come to the heart and center of Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peis armie, but the night drew on which made both ſides pauſe: Caeſar did thanke his ſouldiers, and gliding through euery troope and band of them, he did put nouriſhing oile into their burning wrath. He tooke view of their ſwords, curiouſly obſeruing whoſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon was ouerflowed with bloud, and whoſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2918:79"/>
was dipped at the point, whoſe hand did tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and whoſe was ſtedfaſt, who changed the countenance through feare, &amp; who through furie, and caſting his eyes on the proſtrate carcaſſes, frowning vpon them with curled forehead, as not yet ſatisfied he fed his irefull lookes with the deſolate aſpect of his ſlaine countriemen, but if he perceiued a gaſpe in the fleſh of his owne ſouldiers, he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to cloſe it vp with his hand, &amp; giuing them words of comfort and encouragement did ſooner heale them then indeede they were healed. At the dawning of the day next enſuing, and at the firſt entrance of that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings bloudie houres, when the welkin had put aſide the vizard of the night, the ſtarres being couered and the earth diſcouered by the Sunne, Caeſar giuing his ſouldiers new ſwords, new darts, ſpeares and launces, and awaking their courage, giuing them alſo to vnderſtand with the point of his launce, in what part of the aduerſe armie the forreine kings, the Conſuls, the Senators, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie were placed, directed them as it were by aime, to gage the bodies of many excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2918:79"/>
men, who entangling their weapons in the intrals of theſe noble enemies, did throw to the ground &amp; to extreme ruine many prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly potentates: many reuerent perſons were buried in go are: many of the Lepidi, of the Metelli, of the Coruini and Torquati: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt the fortune of Domitius was dolorous and deſpitefull, he as before hath bene ſaid, was once pardoned and diſmiſſed of Caeſar, but now was ſingled out by Caeſar and grieuouſly wounded, but yet ſo great was his mind that he would not ſtoope to begge a ſecond pardon, whome Caeſar loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon like a tyrant, and ſeeing him rowle his fainting members in the moiſtned duſt, did with this bitterneſſe inſult, giuing him the<note place="margin">Caeſar his ſpeech to Domitius.</note> ſcornefull gaze: L. Domitius now I hope at length you wil forſake your maiſter Pompey, hereafter I truſt you will practiſe no enmitie againſt Caeſar. But as good fortune would, he had as yet breath enough to replie in theſe few words. Caeſar I dy a free man, and I go to the region of Proſerpina, not ſeeing thee as a conquerour, but as yet inferiour to Pompey, and euen at my death am I refreſhed with this
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2918:80"/>
hope, that thou liueſt to be ſubdued by the rigor of deſtinie, which wil take reuenge both for vs, and for thy ſonne in law. Hauing ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken theſe words his life fled from him, and his ſight was taken away with a dreadful dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by whoſe wounds ſo much bloud was not loſt, as there was glorie gained. For he gaue a cleare token of an honorable mind, accompting it a great deale better to haue dignitie without life, then life without digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But Caeſar thinking nothing to be done if any thing were vndone, ragingly and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly did ſeeke for the perſon of Pompey, &amp; ruſhing into the thicke of his ſouldiers, neuer ſtretched out his arme without deaths war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and neuer looked backe but when he ſaw none to fight withall. Pompey ſtanding a farre off on the top of an hill, ſeeing the fields to ſwimme with bloud, and the Romane Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to be nothing now but an heape of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes, and that his owne decay was ſought for by the bloud of a multitude, reſeruing himſelfe to ſome better fortune, forſooke the field and fled to Lariſſa. Caeſar perceiuing it,<note place="margin">Pompey flieth to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa.</note> thought it better to giue ſome reſt to his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2918:80"/>
then with a ſudden purſuite to make af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him: wherefore he retired his ſouldiers, &amp; came to Pompeys tents. VVhen the wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring night was chaſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the inferiour Iſlands by the recourſing day, and the Sunne had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted his brightneſſe to our vnder-neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and the dreames were readie to poſſeſſe the Theater of the fancie, the weariſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the world declining to their reſt: the Caeſarians hauing ranſacked Pompeis tents, and refreſhed their fainting bodies with the viand there left, betooke themſelues to their eaſe, and repoſed their wearied limmes in theſe plots which the Pompeians did before lodge in. But how ſhall I deſcribe the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of that night, in which hell did breath out the ghoſts of them that were ſlaine, the aire was infected with contagious vapours, and the ſtarres trembled at the beholding of the vncouth Stygians? Sleepe did bring no quietneſſe vnto them, but flames, murmurs, horrors, and the hideous ſounds of the skri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king<note place="margin">The dreams and viſions of the Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</note> Harpies. The ghoſt of the ſlaughtered Romane did appeare vnto them, and euery mans fancie was a fiend vnto him: ſome did
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2918:81"/>
thinke that they beheld the image of a young man, ſome of an old man, others did dreame that their brethren were come to take reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge on them, but in Caeſars mind were all theſe terrors: the ſlaine Senate did ſeeme to enco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe him on all ſides, brandiſhing their fierie ſwords, ſweating, frying and dropping with roſen and ſulpher, and the greateſt torment of all was a guiltie conſcience. He was now moleſted with the powers of hell, when his enemies that ſuruiued ſlept quietly in Lariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa. Pompey after his miſhap in Pharſalie made ſpeedie voiage toward Egipt where Ptolome<note place="margin">Pompey tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelleth to Egypt.</note> did raigne: for Pompey hauing procured the reſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his father to the throne of Egipt, and with many other ſinguler benefites ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing deſerued his fauour, thought that the young Prince in a kind regard wold haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him according to his honour and deſert: but who doth buſie his memorie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting benefites? and who will thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe beholden to one that is diſtreſſed? and when doth not fortune chaunge friendſhip? Ptolome, vnthankfull Ptolome, diſleagued with the ſenſleſſe litargie of foule ingratitude,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2918:81"/>
when by certaine report he heard that Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey had approched to the ſhore, ſent out his dire and dreadfull meſſengers to depriue the aged bodie of the vnuanquiſhed mind. And when Achilles that bold butcherer did with his glaiue portend the laſt end of his daies, Pompey whoſe excellent qualities might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline a maſſagite to mercie, craued with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant countenance but a word or two of them, and as for life he was content to leaue it: the ſauage helhound would ſcarcely condeſcend to this requeſt, but at length his tygers heart yeelded, and Pompey in few words wiſhing to the Romanes libertie, to his wife comfort, to his ſonnes ſafetie, was beheaded by theſe<note place="margin">Pompey is beheaded by the Egyptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</note> mercileſſe Egyptians, and his head was born as a preſent to Ptolome, which was farre too good a preſent for ſo lewde a prince. But how falſe was this world to Pompey, who had not now earth enough for his ſepulture, to whom before the earth was too little for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſt: but rare is that bird whoſe feathers do not moult, and happie is that man whoſe glorie doth not eclipſe. Caeſar made haſt after Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey with an hote and earneſt purſuite, not
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2918:82"/>
knowing that he was praeuented of the prize which he aimed at, and as the beaſts which nature hath placed in the wilderneſſe, when poore pilgrimes walke by their ſolitarie and vncouth dens, runne all together with one rage, hunting their footſteps, euery one thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to purchaſe the pray, the Lion, the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, the Beare, the Beuer, the Tiger, the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerne and the VVolfe, making the woods to ring with hollow outcries. So the Caeſarians did enquire and make after Pompey, ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the ſeas with ſounding trumpets, drums, fifes, and ſhawmes, and neuer ceaſſed their purſuite till they were arriued in Egipt, where they were roially entertained of Cleopatra<note place="margin">Caeſar enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of Cleopatra.</note> the Egyptian princeſſe, who with complaint and mournfull melodie, did allure Caeſar, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring her ſingular beautie, to tame and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the pride of Ptolome, who had then deforced her from her ſoueraigne eſtate. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar did not deny this faire Oratreſſe, hauing alreadie perſwaded him, if her toung had bin ſilent. Mars ſpent a long time with Venus, and before his departure from thence Cleopatra was another Calphurnia vnto him. But why
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2918:82"/>
do I name Calphurnia? For what proportion can there be betwixt a chaſt matron and a ſhameleſſe curtizan. Caeſar labouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore Cleopatra to her former dignitie was ſuddenly aſſaulted by the king of Egypt with<note place="margin">Caeſar is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by the king of Egypt.</note> an huge armie, and in that warre he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to many extremities, the conduit pipes were cut a ſunder, and he was beſieged on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſide being as yet in Cleopatraes pallace, but in the end wraſtling out of theſe misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, he gaue battell to the Egyptians at Pharoes, and conueying himſelfe into a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for the defence and ſafegard of his fleete which was grieuouſly toſt, he was ſo vexed and ſhaken by his enemies, that he was faine to leaue his gally, and ſwimming a great way in the riuer of Nilus, returned with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie<note place="margin">Caeſar ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in the riuer of Nilus</note> to his armie, but at the laſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Egyptians at Alexandria, he put the king and his whole armie to the ſword: and in theſe warres was burnt the notable librarie of Ptolomeus Philadelphus, but much againſt Caeſars mind, who as he was ſpecially learned ſo he made ſpeciall accompt of that monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of learning. Caeſar hauing raiſed Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2918:83"/>
to her priſtinate roialtie, departed from Egypt and haſtened toward Vtica, but in the way being enformed that Pharnaces the ſon of Mithridates, whome Pompey when he had finiſhed the warre againſt Mithridates, had made king of Boſphorus, had ſubtracted from the Romanes, and atchieued to himſelf Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia, Colchis, Armenia, and part of Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus: Caeſar ſent againſt him Domitius Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,<note place="margin">Caeſar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces.</note> whoſe armie was diſcomfited by Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces. Caeſar did then in perſon make expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition againſt him, and aſſaulting him at Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, cauſed him at the firſt ioyning of battell to flye, and hauing entred Boſphorus, he was<note place="margin">Caeſar put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Pharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to flight.</note> ſlaine of Aſander the author of his inuaſions. VVhileſt Caeſar was marching toward Vtica, M. Cato diſdaining to receiue life at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of Caeſar, and greatly perplexed in mind that a man ſo rebelliouſly bent ſhould haue ſo proſperous fortune, did with violent hands<note place="margin">M. Cato kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe</note> determine his daies. Caeſar hauing taken V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica as he was returning to Rome, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter P.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2918:83"/>
and Caeſar ſayling from thence enſhoared in Sardinia, and making no long tarriance in that place, came the fiue and twentieth day of that moneth, which beares his name at this day to the citie of Rome, where he was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed with ſuch applauſe, ſuch gratulation, with ſuch melodie, with ſo rare banquets, and with ſo gorgious ſhewes, that Pompeis death was not bewailed with halfe ſo many teares, as he was entertained with ioyes, and for the ſealing of their good affection towards him, they did grant to him by a fourefold triumph to enlarge his fame. A triumph was a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent<note place="margin">What thing a triumph was amongſt the Romans &amp; how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</note> honour, which the captaine who by battell had ouercome his enemies, returning with his armie into the citie did at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy by the decree of the Senate, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the conſent of the people. It was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a triumph becauſe the ſouldiers did crye along the ſtreete as they went to the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolle, Io triumph. Surely the Romanes did greatly aduantage themſelues by the vſing of theſe triumphes, for by them men were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to warlike exploits. But many thinke a common-weale then onely to flouriſh, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:2918:84"/>
it hath peace and plentie, but being moued with the preſent face of things, and not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſting the ſequele, they ſlip into errour, and foſter in their minds fond opinions, for plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie breedeth ſecuritie, ſecuritie warre, warre deſolation. The ſtate of a countrey is then to be tearmed proſperous, when it is throughly furniſhed with men able and ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe forreine forces, with the prouentions of the earth, and other treaſures of husbandrie. But how canſt thou aſſure thy ſelfe of free and peaceable inioying of the riches of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the ſpace of one moneth without milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie diſcipline? For all regions except thoſe which are ſituate vnder the extremitie of the climates, are enuironed with the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of other nations, from which warre may ariſe as eaſily, as the winde bloweth from the foure quarters of the world, in which dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous accident the firſt and laſt refuge of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane helpes is the ſoldiers arme. Doubtleſſe the Romanes were exquiſite in all heroicall deſert, but in their bountie and beneficence to ſouldiers incomparably excellent: for they knew, that the prouinces and Ilands adiacent
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2918:84"/>
could not be wonne by home ſitting, or by a treatie of words: but they muſt gird their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, confront their enemies, and exchange bloud for bloud, and when theſe countreyes were conquered, &amp; they had taſted the ſweet of the vintage, which the ſouldiers had gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they did not reward them with ſower grapes, neither powred they vineger into their wounds, but aſſigned vnto them penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie lands, for their maintenance, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> franke allowance of ample rewards, encouraged them with crownes of glorie, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, honors and dignities, ſo that victorie flouriſhed there where armes were fauoured. Surely Princes &amp; potentates ought with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der indulgence to reſpect the infatigable paines of the ſouldier, leſt he murmur and ſay when he goeth to the fight, I ſhall either be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, or ſlaine: and ſo be wholly ſubiect to the will and diſpoſall of mine enemie, or elſe be partaker of the victorie, and returne into my country, as into a pitched field, where I ſhall fight with penurie, contempt and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe, the laſt of which being either in the enemies chaines, or in the number of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2918:85"/>
his dead men, I ſhould neuer haue felt. But if the ſouldiers induſtrie be not quickened and ſtirred vp by bountie and reward, he hath no more will to performe any part of martial ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, then a dead coarſe hath power to ariſe out of the graue. For what can be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to a man then his bloud, being the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and nurſe of his vitall ſpirits, and the ground of his bodily ſubſtance, which no free and ingenuous nature will looſe or hazard for nothing. And in truth there is great ods in the euent, for the ſouldier may either be ſlaine and ſo die without receiuing of his ſalarie, or elſe be wounded and die vnder the cure, and ſo receiue his ſtipend to the halfe part. This account being thus caſt, it falleth out that the ſouldier looſeth all or ſome part, &amp; the Prince who is his pay-maiſter, ſaueth either all or ſome part. And whoſoeuer ſhall argument or diſcourſe vpon found reaſon, and infallible experience, may eaſily proue and conuince, that theſe commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-weales haue moſt proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which haue liberally maintained and had in ſingular regard militarie artes. The men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of Caeſars triumph hath occaſioned
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2918:85"/>
me to vſe this digreſſion. This word Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus is deriued of the Greeke name of Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, who hauing ſubdued India, was the firſt inuenter of this honor. Of triumphs there were two ſorts obſerued of the Romans, one the graund triumph, which by praehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence was called Triumphus, the other was the pettie triumph, and was commonly called Ouatio, of theſe triumphs ſome were done on land, ſome on ſea, ſome in the citie, ſome on mount Albane. It was therefore called O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio, becauſe the victoriate ſouldiers retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the fight did ſhowte, and double the letter O. An Ouation did much differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a triumph, becauſe he which came into the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by way of Ouation, was neither caried in chariot, nor cladde with robe triumphall, nor with any ornament of eſtate, neither did his armie march before him when he was entred the citie, neither was he crowned with laurel, nor brought in with ſound of trumpets, but walked through the citie on foot, his head being adorned with a mirtle crowne, his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers following him, and the ſhawmes onely ſounding. How the great triumph was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2918:86"/>
may be perceiued by this of Caeſars which was thus performed.</p>
            <p>Caius Caeſar ſitting in a rich and ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<note place="margin">Caeſar his triumphs deſcribed.</note> chariot, bordred round about with the crownes of Princes, his vpper garment being of purpled tiſſue, and beſpanged with lines of gold, his victorious armie marching before him garniſhed with the ſpoiles of Europa and Affrick, his captiues being bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with chaines, which were tied to his chariots taile, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a wonderfull maieſtie to the gazing people: the trumpets and the clarions did ſound on each ſide. His firſt triumph diſplaied<note place="margin">Caeſars firſt triumph.</note> with a moſt radiant ſtanderd, the ſpoiles and conqueſts which he had in Fraunce: the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Rhodanus and Rhene were wrought in ſiluer, the ſtreames were curiouſly deciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the waues did ſeeme to riſe with a naturall and reall flowing.

In the fourth triumph Affrike went as captiue,<note place="margin">Caeſars fourth tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</note> and the perſon of Iuba king of Mauritania, his armes pictured as hauing mannacles of them was then alſo reſembled. For his victorie at Pharſalia there was no triumph, becauſe Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey was a Romane. VVhen Rome with ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling countenance had beheld theſe ſhewes, Caeſar accompanied with the Romane nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie entred the Capitolle, and there with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced fires and fragrant odours did ſacrifice to Iupiter. After his thankes, vowes, and prayers perfourmed, he returned with the great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe and admiration of men, and amiddeſt other ſolemnities, Criſpus Saluſtius did greet him with this Oration.</p>
            <p>I know that it is a difficult and hard matter<note place="margin">Saluſtes oration to Caeſar.</note> to giue counſell to a king, or Emperour, or to <q>any man that is highly aduaunced, becauſe they haue ſtore of counſellers, &amp; there is none ſo wiſe and warie, who can giue certaine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of that which is to come. Againe, bad
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2918:87"/>
counſelles are manie times better liked then good, becauſe fortune dallieth in things, and fancy in men according to their pleaſure. But I had a great minde in my youth, to handle matters of ſtate, and in knowing of them I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed great labour and trauell, not to this end onely, that I might obtaine ſome place of dignitie in the common-weale, which manie by euill artes and vnlawfull meanes haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, but that I might alſo fully know the eſtate of the common-weale, as well in peace as in warre, and how much by munition, by men, and by monie it could do. Therefore toſſing many things in my mind this was my reſolution, to praeferre thy dignitie Caeſar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine owne fame, and modeſtie, and to put anything in practiſe ſo I might procure glorie to thee. And this I did not raſhly or to flatter thee, but becauſe in thee amongſt the reſt, I find one skill very maruellous, that thy mind hath bene greater in aduerſitie, then in proſperitie. But with others it is a matter of more accompt and reckening, that men be ſooner wearie with praiſing thy valor, then thy ſelfart wearied with doing things worthie
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2918:87"/>
of praiſe. Surely I hold it for a rule, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be fet from the depth of inuention, which is not readie to thy thought. And if this purpoſe ſhould onely raigne in thy breſt to deliuer thy ſelfe from the furie of enimies, and how thou maieſt retaine the fauour and good liking of the people, thou ſhould do a thing vnworthie of thy vertue. But if that mind be as yet reſident in thee, which from the beginning diſturbed the faction of ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, which brought the Romanes from the heauie yoake of ſeruitude vnto libertie, which without weapons did confound the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of thine enemies, whereof haue enſued ſo many and ſo glorious actes both at home and abrode, that thy foes cannot complaine of any thing but of thine excellencie, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from me ſuch things, as of the ſumme or ſtate of the common-weale I ſhall deliuer: which doubtleſſe thou ſhalt either find to be true, or elſe certainly not farre from the truth. There is no man brought vp in a free eſtate, who doth willingly yeeld ſuperioritie to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and though the mightier man be by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a good and mild diſpoſition, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2918:88"/>
when he will he may be wicked and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious, he is therefore feared: which hapneth becauſe many great men are peruerſly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and thinke themſelues ſo much the ſafer, by how much more they do permit other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer whom they rule, to be wicked &amp; vniuſt. But ſurely a contrarie courſe ſhould be taken, when the Prince is good himſelfe, to labour and indeuour likewiſe to make the people good. For euery bad fellow doth moſt vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly beare a gouernour, but this to thee Caeſar is of greater difficultie, then to others who haue ruled before thee: thy warre hath bene more mild then the peace of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: beſides they which did ouercome, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the ſpoile, they which are ouercome are their fellow citizens. Through theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties muſt thou paſſe. And ſtrengthen the common-weale for ſucceeding poſteritie, not by weapons, nor as againſt enemies, but which is farre greater and more difficult, by peaceable meanes. Therefore to this point the ſtate of things doth call euery man either of great or of meane wiſedome, to vtter as much good as he can concerning this matter.

For mine owne part this I thinke, that as by thee the victorie ſhall be qualified and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo ſhall all things follow. Thou diddeſt wage battell noble Caeſar with an excellent man, of great power, and deſirous of glorie, a man of greater fortune then wiſedome, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſome few, enemies both to thee &amp; to themſelues, ſuch as either affinitie did draw vnto him, or ſome other bond of dutie:</q> for none of them was partaker of his dominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Pompey could not brooke an equall.</note> which he could not tollerate. For if he could haue brooked an equall, the world had not <q>bene ſet on fire with warre: but becauſe thou art deſirous to eſtabliſh peace, and vpon this anuill thou and thy friends do continually beate, conſider I pray thee of what nature the thing is whereof you conſult. Certainly I haue this conceit, that becauſe all things which haue beginning muſt haue end, when the fate and determined lot of deſtruction ſhall fall vpon this citie, that our citizens will contend and make warre againſt their fellow citizens, and ſo being wearied and conſumed will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a pray to ſome forraigne king or nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: otherwiſe, not the whole world, nor all
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2918:89"/>
the people vnder the arch of the heauens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſtred or aſſembled together, ſhall be able to ſhake or cruſh this flouriſhing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale. Therefore the good effects of concord are to be maintained, and the euils of diſcord to be baniſhed and driuen away: that may eaſily come to paſſe, if thou abridge the licence of riotous ſpending, and iniurious extorting, becauſe young gentlemen in theſe times are inured to ſuch a faſhion, that they thinke it a glorious matter vainly to miſpend their owne goods and the goods of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, denying nothing to their owne luſt, nor to the ſhameleſſe requeſt of their leud compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: and their reſtleſſe mind hauing entred into a crooked way, and diſſolute courſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their maintenance faileth them, and wonted ſupplies are wanting, do conceiue a burning indignation againſt their fellow citizens, and turne all things out of courſe. In that commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale all things are well ordered, where offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and dignities are not ſold, and where am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition enioyeth not the rewards of vertue: this and all other euils ſhall ceaſe when mony ſhall ceaſe to be honoured, where riches are
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2918:89"/>
precious, there all good things are vile: faith, honeſtie, modeſtie, chaſtitie, becauſe there is but one way to vertue, and that is hard and rough, but to mony there be many ſmooth waies: it is gained as well by euill as by good meanes. Couetouſneſſe is a ſauage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring beaſt, immane, &amp; intollerable: which way ſo euer it wendeth, it waſteth, &amp; deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth townes, fields, temples and houſes: it min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth holy and humane things together: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther armes nor wals can ſtop the courſe of it. It ſpoileth and bereaueth men of fame, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, countrie and parents: but if thou debaſe the high accompt of monie, the force of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe by good manners will be abated. I haue by reading found, that all kingdomes, cities, and nations haue ſo long enioyed a proſperous eſtate, whilſt true aduiſe did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile in them: but whenſoeuer fauour, feare, or pleaſure was the ſterne or motiue of their counſels, then their wealth was firſt diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, next their dominion abridged, and laſtly, their libertie impeached. VVherefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech and exhort thee renowned Caeſar, that thou wouldeſt not ſuffer ſuch a goodly domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

as this to be tainted with ruſt, or by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord rented in peeces. If that thing happen, neither night nor day will appeaſe the ſtorms of thy mind, but by dreames being rowzed from thy bed, thou ſhalt be chaſed and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with continuall cares. I haue diſpatched in few ſuch things as I accompted honorable for thee Caeſar, and neceſſarie for this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale. The moſt part of men to iudge of others, haue ſufficient conceit, at leaſt in their owne conceit, and to reprooue an other mans deeds or words, euery mans mind doth burne with deſire. They thinke their throat is not wide enough, nor their toung glib e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to poure out of their breaſts their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious exceptions, to whoſe cenſure that I am ſubiect, doth ſo little ſhame me, that it would haue grieued me to haue bene ſilent: for, whether it ſhall pleaſe thee to follow this courſe or ſome better, I ſhall not be mooued: ſith I haue ſpoken as much as my barrenneſſe could bring foorth. It remaineth for me and for vs all to wiſh, that ſuch things as thou ſhalt in wiſedome effect, the gods would proſper.</q> Caeſar afterward to match his foure triumphs,

was made the fourth time Conſul: his ſtatue<note place="margin">The great honors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon Caeſar.</note> alſo was placed amongſt the ſtatues of the auncient kings: in the Senat-houſe there was a throne of iuorie made for him: in the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his roome was ſuch, as it contained plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, pompe, and coſt: his image was exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitly painted in the Orcheſter, a place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Romaine gentlemen did vſe to daunce and vaut: the moneth of Iuly was then alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated to Iulius, as the moneth of March is to Mars.

But Caeſars fortunes did ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter begin to decline, and theſe diuerſe colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red titles were but as reinebowes, which do glitter gallantly for a time, but are ſuddenly extinct: his fatall houre was now approching, and enuie ſtayed in the cloudes expecting his end. But as a mightie and huge oake, being clad with the exuuials and trophes of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, fenced with an armie of boughs, garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with a coate of barke as hard as ſteele, deſpiſeth the force and power of the windes,

as being onely able to dallie with the leaues, and not to weaken the roote; but the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne wind that ſtrong champion of the airie region, ſecretly lurking in the vault of ſome hollow cloud, doth firſt murmur at this aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring oake, and then doth ſtrike his creſt with ſome greater ſtrength, and laſtly with the deepeſt breath of his lungs doth blow vp the roote. So vndoubtedly was it with Caeſar, who diſdained feare, and thought it a great deale better to die then to thinke on misfortune: but deſtinie is no mans drudge, and death is euery mans conqueror, matching the ſcepter with the ſpade, and the crowned king with the praiſleſſe peaſant. As none was more noble then Caeſar, ſo nothing was more notable, then the death of Caeſar: for his deareſt frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds became his greateſt enemies, and their hands plucked him downe, whoſe ſhoulders did lift him vp. Many cauſes were pretended of the<note place="margin">The cauſes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie bent againſt Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</note> conſpiracie bent againſt him, the honours which were beſtowed vpon him, being both manie and great, did cauſe him to be enuied of the Nobles: and likewiſe it was a matter of cauill, becauſe ſitting before temple of Venus

genitrix the Senate comming to him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with him of great affaires, he did ſit and welcome them, and did not riſe vnto them: another occaſion of quarell was, becauſe M. Antonius would haue ſet a Diademe vpon his head: the fourth cauſe was, becauſe he depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Epidius, Metellus, and Ceſetius Flauius of the Tribuneſhip: fiftly it was greatly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured, becauſe it was conſtantly reported, that L.

For theſe cauſes a conſpiracie being raiſed againſt him, in which the chiefe agents of the Pompeians, were M. Brutus and C. Caſſius, and of the Caeſarians D. Brutus and C.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2918:92"/>
did let downe his robe from his ſhoulders to couer them, and fell as a ſacrifice vnder the ſtatue of Cn. Pompeius Magnus. M.

After this bloudie exploit, they by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was ſlaine, held the Capitolle. I cannot giue Brutus praiſe for this, but I rather thinke that he deſerueth diſpraiſe: for had the cauſe of quailing him bene iuſt, yet the courſe &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of killing him, doth apparantly ſeeme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull: for by that act the law Portia was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,<note place="margin">The law Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia broken by the killing of Caeſar.</note> by which it was prouided, that it ſhould not be lawfull for anie to put to death anie ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of Rome indicta cauſa. The law Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia<note place="margin">The law Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia broken by the killing of Caeſar.</note> de maieſtate was alſo violated, by which it was made high treaſon, for any man to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie aduiſe, or make anie conſpiracie, whereby a Romane Magiſtrate, or he which had a ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power, without iudiciall proces might ſuffer death. And that ancient law was alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, by which it was forbidden, that no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator ſhould enter into the Senate-houſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with any warlike weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or hauing about

him anie edged toole. Surely they that will end tumult with tumult, can neuer be ſeized of good ſucceſſe or fortunate eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: for diſcord may breed, continue &amp; augment contention, but it can neuer end it: and to expect that all differences ſhould be calmely compounded by generall accord, is a thing not much to be hoped for, becauſe it ſeldome happeneth. M. Brutus, the chiefe actor in Caeſars tragedie, was in counſel deepe, in wit profound, in plot politicke, and one that hated the principality whereof he deueſted Caeſar. But did Brutus looke for peace by bloudſhed? did he thinke to auoyd tyrannie by tumult? was there no way to wound Caeſar, but by ſtabbing his own conſcience? &amp; no way to make Caeſar odious, but by incurring the ſame obloquie? VVill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie man ſpeake vnto me of the wiſedome of Brutus, when he thinketh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the field of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi, wherein Brutus was like to the Comet, who feeding vpon vapours &amp; vaine opinions, at length conſumed and confounded himſelf: and thus were the two Bruti, I meane the firſt and the laſt, famous men of that honourable name, both fatall to the eſtate of the Romane
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2918:93"/>
Common-weale: for the former of them did expell the laſt king of the Romanes, and the later did murder their firſt Emperour. But if Caeſars death had bene attended, till naturall diſſolution, or iuſt proceeding had cauſed it, his nephews entrie into the monarchie might well haue bene barred and intercepted: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe honors were annexed and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to Caeſars perſon. And if patience might haue managed their wiſdomes, though there had bene a Caeſar, yet ſhould there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue bene an Auguſtus. But by bloudſhed to ſeeke for peace, is by oyle to quench fire. VVhen any innouation or alteration is to be hatched, the ſtate of things muſt be quiet and ſecure, that the wheele may be eaſily turned about, without hearing any noiſe. For to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the murder of a ſoueraigne Magiſtrate, &amp; to defend thy ſelfe by armes, is as if a man ſhould couer himſelfe by water from a ſhowre of raine, or ſhould deſcend into ſome hollow of the earth for auoiding of infectious aire: &amp; if the moſt barbarous and immaine tyrant, ſhould trecherouſly, that is without warrant of iuſtice be ſlaughtered, though at his death he
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2918:94"/>
were vtterly deſtitute of friends, yet his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhould be ſure to finde enemies: for no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weale can be without men of aſpiring humours, and when ſuch a murder is wrought they find preſent occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to tumultuate, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Anarchie breedeth confuſion, &amp; that it is beſt fiſhing in a troubled ſtreame: making a glorious praetence to reuenge the death of a Prince, though in heart &amp; in truth, they beare greater affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the monarchie remaining, then to the Monarke who is taken away: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in regard of ſupreme power and praehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, will I put diuerſitie betweene the perſon of a king and a tyrant; for he which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to an imperiall or regall ſoueraigntie, by warlike induſtrie and victorious exploit, is no leſſe a Monarke, then he which cometh to it by election, ſucceſſion or deſcent: &amp; he that is made ſubiect by ſword, is as much ſubiect as he that by birth is a deniſon. But was Iulius Caeſar a tyrant? Surely there was more tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in the ſlaughter then in the man ſlaine: Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar I graunt was a traitour to the State before the victorie, but after he exchanged that baſe name, with the beſt title of dignitie, and of a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2918:94"/>
traitour became an Emperour: yet did he not aggrauate to himſelfe that type of honor, the people offred it vnto him, he accepted it with thankes: manie had offended him, he pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, yea rewarded them with great bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. He was content to haue a fellow Conſull, he ſuſpected none of them which were the workmen of his death, he did neither depreſſe the Noble man by ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, nor aduance them of obſcure condition by flatterie and bribes: &amp; which is inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>patible to tyrannie, he ſhewed ſelf-will in nothing, when he was inueſted with ſupremacie; but queſtionleſſe the Romanes ſhould not haue nouriſhed this lyon in their Citie, or being nouriſhed, they ſhould not haue diſgraced him. The goared body of Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar<note place="margin">Caeſar his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</note> was honourably tranſported to Campus Martius. Afterward M. Cicero becauſe he was deſirous to reſtore peace, and to reconcile the ſtates, procured a decree to be made after the example of the Athenians, which they called their Amneſtia, that the killing of Caeſar ſhold be forgotten &amp; forgiuen, and this was ratified by Senate. But the conſpirors would not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie wiſe lay aſide their armour, vnleſſe they
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2918:95"/>
might haue certaine aſſurance and ſecuritie that their perſons, lands, and goods ſhould be ſafe and vntouched. VVherefore for pledges they had the ſonnes of M. Antonius, &amp; M. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus, and then they deſcended out of the Capitolle. C. Octauius hearing of the great change that had happened in Rome, came as ſome ſay from Epirus, as others from Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, to whom I rather agree: but he was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to all ſides and ſectes. And by the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his vncle, who had adopted him to be his heire, he tooke the name of Iulius Caeſar. M. Lepidus was at that time made Pontifex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maximus in Caeſars place. The Senate did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne the prouince of Syria to Dolabella, and Macedonia to Antonius: but afterward when M. Antonius did ſhew himſelf too imperious, and would haue reſigned his charge in Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, and haue bene Praeſident of France, he ſuffered a repulſe of the Senate, wherupon he<note place="margin">The Senate incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt M.

abuſed of Antonius: Octauius therefore by the aſſent of the Senate, being accompanied with his vncles veteranes, prepared warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. D. Brutus to whom the prouince of France was committed by Caeſar, and after his death confirmed to him by the Senate, that he might reſiſt Antonius, who was then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king toward Fraunce, came with an armie to Mutina, and there ſuffered himſelfe to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.<note place="margin">D.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding any thing, warre was proclaimed, and Hirtius being Conſul went againſt him, Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius as Propraetor, Panſa the other Conſul fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them within a few dayes after. Caeſar and Hirtius hauing brought Bononia into their power, did pitch their tents neare to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius, who leauing a ſufficient armie to beate them from the wals of the towne wherein his forces were, did priuily and cloſely go from thence to meete with Panſa, as he was coming to Bononia, with whom he entred battell, and<note place="margin">M.

will not do it. The Pompeians were in truth wedded to too much partialitie, for why had Brutus the glorie of triumph, vnleſſe it were becauſe his life was ſaued by other mens va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour? And why were the bodies of Panſa and Hirtius ſolemnely and honorably enterred, and Caeſar who was liuing, &amp; partaker of the victorie nothing regarded? Nay they did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly deſpiſe him. For, ſending meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers they enioined them to parle with his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and leaue Octauius vnſpoken to: but they did with great choler anſwer, that they would not heare anie thing vnleſſe their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall were preſent. This peruerſe and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous dealing made Octauius to enter the City in warlike maner, and as an enemy vnto them, and there he made himſelfe Conſul, &amp; Q. Pedius his colleague. M. Cicero did then<note place="margin">M.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2918:96"/>
affinitie was contracted betwixt Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and Caeſar, for Caeſar tooke to wife Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia<note place="margin">Caeſar taketh Clodia to wife.</note> the ſtep-daughter of Antonius. He was Conſul before he was of the age of twentie yeares, and in that Conſulſhip held nothing in ſo curious charge, as to take reuenge vpon the enemies of his adoptiue father: wherfore he requeſted Q.

Therfore by ſuch mariage emnitie will not fully ceaſe, nor friendſhip firmely be ſetteled: for it is rather a meane betwixt theſe two extremes, then either a mother to the one, or a ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame to the other. I receiued letters lately<note place="margin">Antonius writeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tumelious letters to Brutus &amp; Caſſius.</note> from M.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:2918:97"/>
be ſent from him, to vs: but his threatnings I do not much regard. For amongſt free men the authoritie of him that threatneth, is no more, then the law wil permit: for mine owne part I could wiſh that he were great in the Common-weale, ſo he were honeſt. I will not prouoke him to emnitie, but will alway prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the libertie of my countrey, before his friendſhip: he obiecteth to vs often the death of Caeſar, but he ſhould conſider how ſmall a time Caeſar raigned, not how litle while he liued. And Octauius forſooth digeſting at length, the hollow conditions of his father in law, ſeemeth greatly to ſtomake that we boſt ſo much of the Ides of March, when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding only one man was ſlaine: yet not ſo much as he vanteth of the Nones of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at which time he ſlaughtered more then one. Cicero once thought that the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale as a naked orphane ſhould be prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by armes, but now he praeferreth an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt peace before a iuſt warre: wherein he ſheweth how vniuſt he is: he is fortunes page, and fauoureth them moſt who haue moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourors. A wiſe man, though by oportunitie
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2918:98"/>
he do alter his pace, yet ſtill keepeth his way, ſerueth time for aduantage not for feare, and as the ſunne ſetteth to riſe againe, ſo he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his courſe to continue his purpoſe: but to an vnconſtant man euerie accident is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation, by which he is diuerſified and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from the center of his thoughts. Though Octauius call Cicero father, vſe him kindly, praiſe him, thanke him, yet it wil appeare that his words are contrarie to his meaning: for what is more auerſe from common ſenſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to call him father whom he will not fuffer to be free? By theſe lineame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts I haue ſhadowed vnto thee my Caſſius the fickleneſſe and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricitie of Ciceroes variable mind, which as it is not certaine to himſelfe, ſo it is not ſafe to vs: let him liue as he doth adulatoriouſly and abiectly: to me which am oppoſed to the thing it ſelfe, that is, to a kingly regiment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie rule, domination and ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which would extol it ſelf aboue the lawes, no ſubiection can be ſuch as that I may brook it. There can be no valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nor free mind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſtancie, neither can any thing be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious without the iudgement of reaſon. In the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2918:98"/>
buſineſſe of the common-weale I would haue nothing done, without the conſtitution and decree of the Senate and people, neither will I arrogantly praeiudicate, or boldly retractate that which they ſhall hereafter do, or hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue done, but I accompt it more conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the good eſtate of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weale, rather with pitie to mollifie the miſerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of diſtreſſed perſons, then by graunting euerie thing to the deſire of the mightie, to inflame their luſt and inſolencie. Surely the Senatours are many times deceiued in their hope, and if a man haue done one thing wel, they preſently yeeld and permit all things vnto him, as though a minde corrupted by their largeſſe, and liberall offers, might not be traduced and caried away to euill purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and attempts: but they may not beſtow any thing which to men euill diſpoſed may be either a praeſident or a protection, and I am afraid that Octauius by his late Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, do thinke him ſelfe to haue aſcended higher, then that he will deſcend: for if An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius by the death of Iulius Caeſar tooke prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion of tyranniſing, how much more
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2918:99"/>
will Octauius vſurpe, when both Senate and people do applaud to his affection. Neither will I commend the facilitie and prouidence of the Senate in this behalfe, before I haueful experience, that Octauius will content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, with the ordinarie honors that he hath receiued: but if it otherwiſe happen, I muſt needes pronounce the Senate guiltie of the fault, which they might well haue praeuented. Yet if this yong man do lay aſide ſiniſter and affectious humours, and imbarke himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon cauſe with impartiall thoughts, I ſhall then thinke that the Common-weale will be able to ſupport it ſelfe, by her owne ſtrength and ſinewes, that is iuſtice and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie; and that thenceforth, no offence, ſhall either be cruelly reuenged, or diſſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Of our future affaires this is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate reſolution, ſo it may obtaine thy approbation; if things happen to be in better plight we will returne to Rome, if the eſtate be as now it is, we will liue as now we do, in voluntarie exile: if it decline fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bad to worſe, we muſt flie to armes as our laſt and worſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, wherefore Caſſius do not faint, nor

            <p>Caeſar when by no meane he could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of Brutus, who was Praeſident of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia, and Caſſius who had the regiment of Syria; he ſent for M. Antonius and M. Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus who were then in France, and they three meeting at Bononia, had conference of orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and diſpoſing the common affaires, and there they agreed to be Treuiri, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the common-weale for fiue years ſpace. To the charge of Lepidus Spaine and Gallia Narbonenſis were alotted, to M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius the other parts of Fraunce, to Caeſar Libia, Sicilia, and Sardinia. After theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations they came to Rome, and aſſigned offices to whom it pleaſed them, asking no leaue either of people or Senate. At that time many excellent Lords and Gentlemen were proſcribed, together with an hundred and thirtie Senators, among whom was L. Paulus the brother of M. Lepidus, L. Caeſar the vncle of Antonius, and he who did ſo much praiſe<note place="margin">Cicero is put to death.</note> Octauius M. Cicero. But that was done by
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2918:100"/>
the venimous rancor of Antonius, by whoſe meanes he was beheaded, and the head was<note place="margin">Fuluiaes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiteful dea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceroes tong.</note> ſerued in meaſe vnto him, which when Fuluia the impudent wife of Antonius had eſpied, plucking and renting from the chaps his gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tongue, ſhe diſtained it with the ſpittle &amp; fome of her mouth, ſhe pricked it with nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, launced it with her nailes, brayed it with her fiſt, racked it with her armes, and ſtamped it with her feete. Fooliſh and ſenſleſſe anger, to inflict reuenge vpon a thing that was ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and for the miſliking of the man, to hate the dead part of his body. But thou didſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Antonius (for the indignation of poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie will riſe againſt thee) thou didſt nothing by taking away the publike voice of the City and that all-pleaſing tongue. Thou haſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiled Cicero of a poore remnant of dayes, thou haſt pared away his old age, thou haſt cauſed him to be ſlaine, when he wiſhed for death, but his fame and the glorie of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and excellent learning, thou art ſo farre from abridging, that thou haſt augmented it: he liueth and ſhall liue by the memorie of all ages, and whilſt the frame of this world ſhall
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2918:100"/>
ſtand, and this bodie of nature ſhal continue, which that onely Romane did in minde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template, by wit vnderſtand, &amp; by eloquence deſcribe, the commendation of Cicero ſhall alway accompanie it, the ſucceding wits ſhall wonder at his writings, &amp; euery mans doome ſhall condemne thy cruelty. But the miſerie of theſe times none can ſufficiently deplore, ſo vnpoſſible it is to expreſſe it by words. But this is to be noted, that the care of wiues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their husbands, that were proſcribed, was maruellous, &amp; in the higheſt degree: the fidelitie of their free-men but indifferent, the loyaltie of their bond-men very ſlender, the loue of their children none at all, ſo griſly and loathſome is aduerſity to a mans owne bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. Caſſius hearing of the great tumults of Rome, went from Syria to Smyrna in Aſia, where M. Brutus was, to take aduiſe of the ordering of the battel againſt M. Antonius, &amp; C. Octauius, who they heard did make expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition againſt them. VVherefore Caſſius ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ouercome the Rhodians, and Ariobar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanes, and Brutus hauing ſubdued the Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans, the Lycians, and other nations of Aſia,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:2918:101"/>
which did before moleſt them, they haſted to Macedonia that they might there wage bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. And thither not long after came Caeſar, and M. Antonius with a huge hoſt, and before the citie of Philippi they faced their enemies with the tents. That fight was verie fierce and very doubtful, for Brutus put Caeſar to flight, and Antonius Caſſius, and each of their tents was ranſacked of the victor. C. Caſſius when Brutus, who he feared was ſlaine, returned a farre off, with his horſemen, thinking that they were the enemies that purſued him, did worke his owne death by the hand of one of his retinue. VVithin a few dayes after M. Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus being ouercome in another battell, and ouerborne with deſpaire, enforced Strabo that fled with him to ſlay him with his ſword: which act, many noble Romanes to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fortie did imitate. There were neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to whom fortune did ſooner approch, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Brutus and Caſſius: and neuer anie from whom ſhe did more ſuddenly flie: Caſſius was the better Captaine, Brutus the better Counſeller, Brutus was more to be loued, Caſſius to be feared, becauſe the one excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:2918:101"/>
in vertue, the other in valor. VVho if they had conquered in this fight, it would haue bene more expedient for the Romanes to haue bene ruled by Brutus then Caſſius, by how much it was more ſafe to them in the end to be gouerned by Octauius then Antonius. The yeare following there grew diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Caeſar and L. Antonius Conſul, and Fuluia wife to M. Antonius. They were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Caeſar, becauſe he ſhared that part of Macedonia to his ſouldiers which M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius ſhould haue had. Fuluia was the more earneſt againſt Octauius, becauſe he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a deep diſpleaſure againſt her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and had thereupon diuorced her. Caeſar was likewiſe incenſed againſt Antonius, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not ſend to him that ſupply of ſouldiers, which he ought to haue. Antonius therefore in his brothers quarell, maintained warre, Fuluia leagued vnto him held Praene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte, and there ſhe behaued her ſelfe as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſul, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temning P. Seruilius who was indeed Conſul, being like to a woman in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but onely in ſexe: L. Antonius with an hoſtile inuaſion entred the citie of Rome, the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2918:102"/>
armie of M. Lepidus, who was left there as warden of the Citie being diſcomfited, and afterward departing thence toward Fraunce, was intercepted by Caeſar, who beſieged him a long time at Peruſia, in the countrey of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truria,<note place="margin">Caeſar beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Peruſia</note> and oftentimes making an eruption &amp; ſuffering a repulſe, he was conſtrained to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him ſelfe, whom Caeſar pardoned, but many of the Senators and Romane Knights were ſacrificed vpon the altar of Iulius Caeſar. He deſtroyed Peruſia, and hauing brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his power all the armie of the contrarie ſide ended that warre, Cn. Domitius Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, and C. Aſinius Pollio being Conſuls, Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio<note place="margin">The praiſe of Aſinius Pollio.</note> was a man of notable gifts, who howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer matters befell, was loued of all ſortes of men. Iulius Caeſar did make great reckening and accompt of him, after his death the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Caeſar did greatly fauour him, M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius had him in ſingular aeſtimation, Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius held him neare vnto his heart, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſcholer, and a worthie ſouldier the onely obiect of the learned, whom both in proſe &amp; poemes, they haue condignely commended, ſo that I need not to proceede in his praiſes,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2918:102"/>
this is my only doubt, whether he were more to be extolled for his laudable qualities, then admired for his rare and wonderfull fortune; he was not long before with Antonius in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, but ſeeing him ſo vainely beſotted with the loue of Cleopatra, ſeeing him knight of the Cannapee, who was earſt Lord of the field, being aſhamed of him as he was a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, aſhamed of him as a General, aſhamed of him as now an vnworthie companion for Pollio, he left him in Aegypt with his concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, and came to Rome. Afterward Caeſar and Lepidus fell at variance, ſo that Lepidus was compelled to ſurrender all his authority, and to ſtand to Caeſars mercie for his life. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar<note place="margin">Octauius Caeſar figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with Sex. Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peius</note> did then fight with Sex. Pompeius on the ſea. Pompey being there ouercome fled to Sicilie, and afterward into Aſia, and as he was preparing warre againſt Antoni, he was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of M. Titius, Antonius his Lieutenant, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was ſlaine. The laſt ciuill warre which was betwixt the Romaines was that which was fought by Caeſar againſt Antoni at Actium. The occaſion of emnitie betwixt them was thus, Antonius did reproue Caeſar becauſe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2918:103"/>
he had taken to himſelf the armie of Lepidus &amp; that which followed Sex. Pompeius, which ought to haue bene common to them three. Caeſar did obiect to Antonius, that he did keepe Aegypt without lawfull commiſſion, that he cauſed Sex. Pompeius to be ſlaine without his conſent, that he caſt Artauaſdes a Prince, leagued with the Romans, and taken by trecherie, into priſon, &amp; diſhonored him, with gyues and fetters, to the great infamie of the Romanes, that he was more familiar with Cleopatra then became an honeſt man, that he had beſtowed too great giftes vpon her, that he had called Caeſars ſurmiſed ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard begotten of Cleopatra, Caeſarion, to the great diſgrace of that houſe. Theſe things priuately by letters and publikely by meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, were mentioned by mutuall obiection.<note place="margin">Octauius rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of M.

Certaine ſouldiers which did flie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Antonius to him, told him that the authentike will or teſtament of M. Antonius, did remaine in the cuſtodie of the Virgins veſtall, of whom Caeſar did obtaine
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2918:103"/>
it, the tenor and forme whereof was thus.</p>
            <p>I M. Antonius one of the three ſtates of<note place="margin">The teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of M. Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</note> Rome, and the ſonne of M. Antonius, do by this my laſt will and teſtament make and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine Philadelphus &amp; Alexander my ſonnes by Cleopatra, the heires of all my wealth and ſubſtance, which I had by deſcent from M. Antonius my father; but with this clauſe, and vpon this condition, that if I die in Rome or elſewhere, they ſhall ſolemnely conuey my bodie to Alexandria in Aegypt, and beſtow it there in a marble ſepulcher, which by this my will ſhall be made for my ſelfe and Cleopatra the Queene of Aegypt. But if they faile of this or do otherwiſe, without lawfull or vrgent cauſe, then I will that all theſe things which I leaue vnto my aforeſaid ſons, be conuerted to the vſe &amp; behoofe of the Nuns of Veſta, &amp; my ghoſt ſhal implore the aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex-Maximus, &amp; the prieſts of Iupiter which are in the Capitol, to ſolicit the ſpirits of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to puniſh the vnthankfulneſſe of my ſons, &amp; then I ordaine &amp; wil, that the Pontifex Maximus ſhall cauſe my bodie to be repoſed in a conuenient ſepulcher, within the walles
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2918:104"/>
of this citie, and I will alſo that as many bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaues as be now in my power, ſhall preſently after my death be manumitted &amp; made free by the Praetor; and to euerie of my other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants I bequeath a Seſtertian, &amp; a mourning garment. Laſtly, I do pronounce by this my laſt will and teſtament, that Caeſarion the ſon of Cleopatra, is the true, certaine, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted ſonne of C. Iulius Caeſar. And to the aforeſaid Cleopatra, I giue all my wealth and treaſure, that I haue gained, purchaſed and atchieued either in warre or in peace. Done by me M. Antonius vj. kal. Iul. Ap. Claudius, C. Norbanus Coſſ.</p>
            <p>VVhen the people of Rome had heard the purport of this teſtament, they thought that Antonius his drift, was to giue Rome to Cleopatra, for a ſpeciall fauour, for which cauſe they were maruellouſly moued againſt Antonius. Caeſar did behaue him ſelfe in this matter very wiſely and warily, for in wordes he praetended warre againſt Cleopatra only, and cauſed it to be proclaimed by the heralt, that the Aegyptian Queene did intend the ſuppreſſing of the Romanes. That was done
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2918:104"/>
by Caeſar, to the end that he might auoyd the hatred of manie noble men, who did rather affect Antonius then him. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Antonius for the loue of Cleopatra wold neither come into the citie to render account of his doings, nor depoſe his Triumuiracie, but was wholly buſied in praeparing warre againſt Italie, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar did furniſh himſelfe as well for ſea as for land: he therefore gathered manie ſouldiers out of Spaine, Fraunce, Lybia, Sardinia and Sicilia. Antonius likewiſe did make an armie of Aſians, Thracians, Macedonians, Graecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Aegyptians and Cyrenians. And in the yeare following C. Caeſar and M. Meſſalla being Conſuls, Antonius and Cleopatra at Actium a promontorie of Epirus, encountred Caeſar, who hauing proſperous ſucceſſe in many bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels againſt them, as well on ſea as on land, they being at length ouercome fled to Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria in Aegypt. Caeſar did ſacrifice all the<note place="margin">Octauius Cae<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſar ſacrifiſeth all the Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to Apollo.</note> pinaſſes which he had taken in warre, to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo, who was worſhipped at Actium, as a monument of thankfulneſſe for his victorie, and did alſo inſtitute a fiue yeres ſolemnitie, which was called the ſolemnitie of Actium,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:2918:105"/>
beſides this he built a faire temple to Apollo, and in the place where his tents were pitched<note place="margin">Octauius buildeth Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copolis.</note> he founded a great city called Nicopolis, the citie of victorie. Aſinius Pollio did ſtill prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the auncient amitie that was betwixt him and M. Antonius, for when Caeſar at his departing from Rome, requeſted him that he would ioyne with him, in his warres againſt Antonius, he made this anſwer: The benefites of Antonius towards me, will not permit me to be an enemie vnto him, and my merites at the hands of Antonius be farre otherwiſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Antonius ſhould be an enemie vnto me, wherefore leauing both and leaning to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I wil ſtay here in Italie, and be the ſpoile of the conqueror. Caeſar did afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege Antonius &amp; Cleopatra at Alexandria, where Antonius being in a moſt deſperate plight, being in no poſſibilitie to recouer Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars fauour, and hearing by a falſe rumor, that Cleopatra was ſlaine, did ſuddenly ſtab him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Caeſar tooke Alexandria, and with it Cleopatra, but becauſe ſhe would not grace Octauius ſo much as to be led in triumph by<note place="margin">Cleopatra killed by Aſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes.</note> him, ſhe put Aſpes to her breaſts, and was by
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:2918:105"/>
them done to death, though her keeper had praeciſe charge to looke carefully vnto her. Aegypt was then brought by Caeſar into the forme of a prouince, and hauing made Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Gallus Praeſident there, he came to Rome, where he had a triple triumph, the one of Dalmatia, which he brought to conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie after his warre finiſhed againſt Sex. Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius, the other of Actium, the third of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria. VVhen Caeſar with the great applauſe and gratulation of the Romanes had pacified the whole praecinct of the world, and for that cauſe had ſhut the temple of Ianus the third time, and an augurie of ſafetie was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which two things were neuer done but when the whole Empire was in quietneſſe, he purpoſed to depoſe the Empirie, &amp; to bring the common-weale to a good &amp; perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. To depoſe the Empirie, M. Agrippa did perſwade him, but Maecaenas did diſſwade him, whoſe opinion he yeelded vnto. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeuoring by law to confirme the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirie, and to win the fauour and good aeſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well of the Nobles and Senators, as of the people, he burnt all the letters which
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2918:106"/>
the citizens that were then in Rome or out of Rome had writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Antonius, leſt any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator who did follow Antonius his faction, ſhould thinke himſelfe to be hated of Caeſar for that cauſe, &amp; ſo ſhould attempt ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe againſt him: he releeued the common ſtocke, which was greatly waſted by ciuill warres, with his owne priuate wealth, &amp; them that were indebted to the common treaſurie, the billes of debt being burnt with his owne handes, he did free from the daunger of the rolle. And whereas many things were done, in the tumults and ſeditions of the citizens, againſt law and cuſtome by Lepidus and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius, he did repeale them by an Edict, and made his ſixth Conſulſhip, which he then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed to be the death-day of theſe lawes; by which meanes when he had worthily drawne vnto him the hearts of the people, yet in one thing he pleaſed them aboue the reſt, which was done rather of pollicie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of plaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: for hauing ſingled out a great number of Senators, whoſe loue toward him was ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially approued, in a very frequent Senate, he did offer to ſurrender the Empire into the

hands of the Senators and people. But ſome of the Senators, becauſe they ſuſpected that his wordes differed from his meaning, ſome becauſe they did feare greater daunger by a popular eſtate, others becauſe they feared his diſpleaſure, if they ſhould agree vnto it, they did with one voice refuſe the offer, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in earneſt ſute and humble petition vnto him, that he would be the ſole gouernour and abſolute Emperour of Rome, and for that cauſe they did decree that the ſtipe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of thoſe who did guard his perſon ſhould be doubled, that he might be in more ſafetie by that meane, both to his friends and to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale. VVhen by the franke aſſent of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and people, he had thus, not confirmed the auncient Empirie, but in deed created a new Monarchie, that he might ſeeme popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, he was content to charge him ſelfe with the weightie affaires of the Empire: but the authoritie and dignitie thereof he did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with the people: and therefore vnto the Senate and people he did allot Numidia, Aſia, Graecia, Epirus, Dalmatia, Macedonia, Sicilia, Creta, Cyrene, Bythinia, Pontus, Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2918:107"/>
and Hiſpania Betica: which were the more peaceable and quiet countries. To him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe he tooke the other parts of Spaine, and all Fraunce, Narbonenſis, Lugdunenſis, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitanica Celtica, likewiſe Germania, Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſyria, Phoenicia, Cyprus and Aegypt. And that he might void out of their minds all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of Monarchie, the ſupreme authoritie that was aſſigned to him he did only reſtraine to ten yeres continuance. The Romanes did beſtow diuerſe honors vpon Caeſar, planting before the doore of his Court a Bay tree, on<note place="margin">The Romans plant a bay tree before Octauius his doore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> the top whereof they ſet a wreath of oaken boughs, ſignifying that he was the man that had both ouercome their enemies, and ſet their citie in ſafetie. They decreed alſo that his Court ſhould be called a Pallace, ſo that in what region ſoeuer the Romane Emperor did ſoiourne, his Court was called a Pallace, and that he ſhould be called Auguſtus. For when many would haue adorned him with ſome title of excellencie, Caeſar had a great deſire to be called Romulus ſecundus, but becauſe that did reſemble too much the title of a king, he was content to be called Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2918:107"/>
that is, maieſticall or diuine. Thus had Caeſar the power of a king the ſtile only fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed. In him all the dignities and magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies did meete, he was ſole Conſul, in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining iudicially of publike affaires, ſole Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex, for he had that ſpeciall title, ſole Cenſor in taxing the Romanes by poales, and fining them for faults, ſole Tribune, in abrogating theſe lawes &amp; voiding theſe acts which were made and done by other magiſtrates: which though in ſhew they were manie, yet in deed there was now but one Magiſtrate in Rome, one Emperour, one Auguſtus; but theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors did not warrant Caeſars quietneſſe, for he was endangered by many trecheries, and being thereby too ſeuere in puniſhing both the worthie and vnworthie, vpon ſuſpition &amp; ſurmiſe without anie formall proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, he did indeed miniſter oile vnto the flame of their malice. Amongſt the reſt Cn. Cornelius, whoſe grandfather was Cn. Pompeius Magnus, did with his complices imagine and conſpire the death of Auguſtus, whom Caeſar would not put to death, becauſe he thought by that meane, he ſhould gaine
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2918:108"/>
no great ſecuritie, neither would he deliuer them from impriſonment, leſt others might take courage &amp; counſell to attempt the like. VVith this doubt &amp; perplexitie he was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly troubled, and cares did torment his mind both in the night and in the day time; wherefore walking alone in his garden, and muſing what to do, Liuia the Empreſſe came vnto him, and prayed him of all loues to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale vnto her, what griefe had encroched vpon his heart, and what was the cauſe of his vnuſuall dumpes, to whom Caeſar made this anſwer. <q>Can any man, Liuia, be of a calme and contented mind; againſt whom on euery ſide are layd the ſnares of treaſon? Seeſt thou not how manie doe beſiege my quietneſſe, whom the puniſhment of condemned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons doth not only not deterre, but, as if there were ſome hope of reward, others ruſh deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratly forward to vnlawfull attempts. Liuia when ſhe heard this, did thus reply. It is no maruel, my Lord, if you be beſet with da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, partly becauſe you are a man, and therefore borne to caſualtie, partly an Emperour, by whoſe authoritie, becauſe manie are put to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2918:108"/>
death, many that liue do conceiue hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; for a Prince ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not only not pleaſe all, but though he gouerne in moſt orderly and peaceable maner, it cannot be otherwiſe, but he ſhould haue many foes. For there be not ſo many iuſt as iniurious, whoſe humours can neuer be ſatisfied, &amp; they which be of the better ſort do aime at great matters, which becauſe they can not obtaine, and becauſe they are inferiour to others, are full of male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment, and for that cauſe they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with their Prince. But the danger vnto which you are ſubiect by them which do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpire againſt your perſon, but againſt your eſtate, cannot anie way be auoided. For if you were a priuate man, none would offer you iniurie, vnleſſe he receiued wrong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at your hands, but an Empire, and the reuenues thereof, they which haue power do rather affect, then they which are poore do loath. This though it be a point of vnconſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men, yet as other faults, ſo this is the ſeed of nature, which out of ſome men nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by rewards nor by threats you ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to extirpate: for neither feare nor lawe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2918:109"/>
can do more then nature. VVhich being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, it will ſeeme a great deale more conuenient to ſtrengthen and ſtabliſh your Empire with faithfulneſſe and loyaltie, then with ſharpneſſe and rigor. Auguſtus did thus reioyne: I know, Liuia, that the higheſt things be moſt ſubiect to hatred, &amp; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Emperours haue the greateſt enemies: for if our cares, griefes and perils were not greater then the griefes and perturbations of priuate me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we ſhould be aequal to the Gods; but this doth chiefly moleſt me, that I cannot deuiſe anie remedie, which may cure &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer this miſchiefe. All men haue enemies, &amp; many haue bene ſlaine by enemies, but the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of Princes lieth ſo open to caſualtie, that we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to feare our familiar frinds and our daily acquaintance, with whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we muſt continually conuerſe, we do continually feare, and this maladie is more hardly redreſſed then emnitie: for againſt our enemies we may oppoſe our friends, but if our friends do faile vs, where is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our helpe? therfore both ſolitude and multitude is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto vs, &amp; it is dangerous to be without
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2918:109"/>
a gard, but to haue an vnfaithful gard is much more dangerous. Apparant enemies may be auoided, but falſe hearted friends we cannot anie way ſhunne: for we muſt call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> friends, of whoſe conſtant faithfulneſſe we can not poſſibly be aſſured; for my ſelfe I do plainely proteſt, that my heart abhorreth from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of puniſhment, and the neceſſitie of torture goeth greatly againſt my mind. Then ſaid Liuia, You haue ſpoken well my Lord, but if you will be aduiſed by me, &amp; you ought not to refuſe my counſell becauſe it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from a woman; I will aduiſe you of that which none of your friends will impart vnto you, not becauſe they are ignorant of it, but for that they dread your diſpleaſure. VVhich Auguſtus taking hold of, Tell it me Liuia ſaid he whatſoeuer it is. I will, ſaid Liuia, and that as willingly as you would heare it, for I am made partaker of your deſtinie. Caeſar being ſafe I am Empreſſe, and he being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored, which misfortune the Gods auert, I am alſo diſgraced, and bereaued of glorie. That I may not vſe an ambuſh of words, nor a labyrinth of circumſtances: my theame ſhal
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2918:110"/>
be one word, and that is, Clemencie. Change thy courſe Auguſtus, and forgiue ſome of thy foes, manie things may be healed by lenitie, which crueltie can neuer cut off. Neither do I ſpeake this, as if diſloyall and irregular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould generally and without difference receiue mercie, nay they that be notoriouſly ſtained, and branded with conſpiracie, they that trouble the quietneſſe of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, they that are ouerflowed with vices, whoſe life is nothing elſe but leudnes, ſo that they are paſt hope or helpe, cut them off my Auguſtus, as the putrified parts of a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered bodie: but they which either through the infirmitie of youth, or the imprudency of mind, or through ignorance or miſchaunce haue offended, or which againſt their willes haue bene drawne into daunger, admoniſh them, but with minatorie ſpeeches: and let them finde grace but with condition. Some thou mayeſt puniſh with exile, ſome with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie, and ſome with money: and that none may be vniuſtly condemned, nor by a fained accuſation ſuffer death, let the truth be tried by ſuch proofes, as may worthilie be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:2918:110"/>
For it behooueth thee Auguſtus, not onely to be free from doing wrong, but euen from ſhew and ſemblance of iniurie. Priuate men haue done enough if they haue not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, but a Prince muſt endeuor not to be ſuſpected of faults. Thou ruleſt ouer men, not ouer beaſts, ouer Romanes, and not ouer Barbarians, and the onely meane to lincke their hearts vnto thee, is to benefite all and to oppreſſe none. For though a man may be conſtrained to feare, yet he cannot be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to loue; for when the ſubiect clearely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerneth that his Prince is bountifull, he is ſoone perſwaded: but when he is once reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vpon manifeſt praeſumption, that ſome be vniuſtly put to death, leſt the ſame thing happen vnto him, he may iuſtly feare: and who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſo feareth, he hateth with the ſtrength of his heart. But a Prince is the priuiledge of his ſubiects ſecurity, that they take no harme, neither of forreiners, nor of their fellow ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, much leſſe of their Prince &amp; protector. And it is a great deale more magnificent and glorious to ſaue then to kill: wherfore lawes, benefites, admonitions muſt be vſed, that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:2918:111"/>
men may become circumſpect, &amp; warie, and further they muſt be ſo diligently watched and obſerued, that though they would be, yet they may not be traiterous; and they which are greene in conceit, and as it were flexible waxe to the ſtronger powers, muſt haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall conſeruatiues leſt they be corrupted: and to tollerate the offences of ſome, is both great wiſedome and great manhood: for if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie mans fault ſhould be his fall, the earth would ſoone lacke inhabitants. Thinke my good Auguſtus, that the ſword cannot do all things for thee: it cannot make men wiſe, it cannot make them faithful: it may conſtraine them, but it cannot perſwade them: it doth pierce the heart of him that is ſlaine, but it doth alienate the mind of him that doth liue. VVherefore alter thy opinion noble Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and by vſing clemencie they will thinke that all that thou haſt heretofore done was done by neceſſitie and againſt thy will, but if thou perſeuereſt ſtill in the ſame minde and purpoſe, they will impute all that hath bene done to the auſteritie and ſoureneſſe of thy nature.</q> VVith theſe ſpeeches of Liuia Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2918:111"/>
being moued, pardoned many, and vſed as much lenitie as his owne ſafetie would beare: whereby he purchaſed the entire loue of the Romanes, and all his life time after there was neuer anie treaſon attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Thus after ciuill emnities extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, forreine warres fully ended, iuſtice recalled, deſtiny ſatisfied, ſtrength was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to lawes, authoritie to Magiſtrates, dignitie to the Nobles, maieſtie to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ſafetie to the people: the fieldes were without hinderance trimmed and tilled, the ſacrifices celebrated and ſolemnized, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe returned to men, and euerie poſſeſſion to his lawfull owner: good lawes were made, imperfect lawes were amended, bad lawes cancelled: the Senators were ſeuere without curriſhneſſe, the people honeſt without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint: and with this harmonie peace pleaſed the Romanes.</p>
