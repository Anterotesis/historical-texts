            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Of the Crinitall Starre, which appeareth this October and Nouember.</hi> 1580.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T ſeemeth (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) a difficult and hard matter, for any man to wryte or doo any thyng that ſhoulde be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in theſe dayes, eſpecially, when the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of men is growen ſtrange and diuers, accomptyng ech thyng, eyther too whyte or too blacke, too ſweete or too ſowre, too woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie or too vilde: Yet at this tyme, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectyng curious opinions, neyther regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the ſpeach of the Captious, ſo muche as the requeſt of friendes, doo ſet foorth this my iudgement touchyng this Crinitall Starre, ſhewyng to vs the greatneſſe of Gods goodneſſe, by ſuch a forewarnyng to repentaunce. But ſuche is the corruption and hardneſſe of this Age, that we contemne and neglect all tokens in the Heauens, by reſpectyng our onely ſecuritie, for the tyme preſent. And yet, yf euery man woulde rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the courſe of his lyfe paſt, he ſhoulde ſee in hym ſelfe great cauſe to tremble at theſe
<pb facs="tcp:23645:2"/>
thynges. And alſo, if we conſider what great rout of euylles doth beſet vs, and way how many hath been deſtroyed, or what hurtes hath been by Lyghtnynges, Earthquakes, Ground openinges, Flooddes, tempeſtes of the Sea, great Windes, infectious Ayre, Warres, Mortalities, Plagues, ſtrange Diſeaſes, and ſuch lyke, which thynges, Commettes doth commonly pronounce to enſue: I ſuppoſe that the remembraunce of ſuch dangers, woulde make vs not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together cardleſſe of theſe Tokens, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to vs calamities for our vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And therefore, who ſo euer doth make light accompt of Earthquakes and gleming Starres, and is not mooued at the ſyght thereof, with the ſeare of Gods diſpleaſure: the ſame people doth alſo as lyghtly, and as lytle regarde their owne conſcience, and amendment of lyfe. Wherefore it is tyme that we ceaſſe from puffyng vp our ſelues with pryde, letcherie, and enuie, and to cleaue to repentaunce, and to lay holde vpon <hi>Dauids</hi> Anker, which is the multitude of Goddes mercie: For as it is in the .xxxi. Pſalme, <hi>Mercie wyll muiron them which truſt in the Lorde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23645:2"/>
Nowe, if any man ſuppoſe that nothyng can be rightly gathered by Aſtronomie of Comettes, he is muche deceiued, and he is too blynde in his hart, that thinke it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothyng: for, touching the laſt tayled Starre, which appeared. 1577. agaynſt the face of the great Planet <hi>Saturne</hi> toward the Southweſt, it is euident, that the effect of his ſignification was to continue three yeeres, and dyd ende but a lytle before Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas laſt paſt.</p>
            <p>And touchyng the fyrſt yeere. 1578. the effect was ſeene Southwarde by Warres, with the ſlaughter of Princes. And in the ſeconde yeere. 1579. it brought foorth great irruption of Waters and Floddes. And in the thirde yeere. 1580. the effecte of that Commet was dreadful, by a feareful Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, the ſyxt of Apryll, betweene fiue and ſyxe at nyght: And with Warres againſt the <hi>Portyngales</hi> by the <hi>Spaniardes:</hi> vnto whom that Commet was ſpecially appropriate, by vertue of his place and terme in whiche it ſtoode: And alſo with a new kinde of ſtrange diſeaſe, as it were a Sommer Rewme he hath ended his effectes.</p>
            <p>And immediatly vpon the endyng of all
<pb facs="tcp:23645:3"/>
theſe effectes, there is come to appearance a Crinitall Starre, farre different from the other, in place, ſituation, and cooloure: which I obſerued to appeare immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the new Moone, the .viii. day of October, placed betweene the .xii. and .xi. houſe of the Heauens, after Sunne ſettyng, the Moone fyrſt of al receiuing the ſhadowie vmbration of this Crinita, by a quartyle radiation from <hi>Scorpio.</hi> Secondly, I noted the Sunne to receiue the next ſhadowe by ſtrong aſpect, and that the Sunne aboue all other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nettes, is moſtly and woorſt radiated, in the tyme of the continuance of this Crinita, fyrſt with the quartile of <hi>Saturne,</hi> ſecondly with the oppoſition of <hi>Mars:</hi> Which thyng doth ſignifie, in that the Sunne and the Moone (which be <hi>Animae mundi)</hi> doth eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially receiue the impreſſion of his euyll aſpect, that the Sympathy of his influence ſhall be greeuous, with Plagues, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious Ayre, with calamitie among the people, and with captiuitie and euyl to ſome perſons. And this ſhall be to the Countreys lying within the eyght and nynth clymate.</p>
            <p>Alſo I note, that this Crinita is fixed agaynſt a Starre of the thyrde Magnitude,
<pb facs="tcp:23645:3"/>
neere vpon the Dolphyn, of the nature of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and is of a Septentrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Latitude from the Zodiacke: And alſo, that this Crinita is fixed vnder the Signe called <hi>Aquarius,</hi> beyng an Ayeryall and Weſterne Signe, there placed, neere vnto that ponderous Planet <hi>Saturne,</hi> poſſeſſing his owne houſe, with the company of <hi>Caput Draconis,</hi> whiche portendeth towarde the Northeaſt, and Northweſt Countries; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the tyme of his effect, great corruption and infection in the Ayre, great harme and hynderaunce by ragyng Windes, Waters, and Flooddes, miſerie among the people of the ſayd Countreys, <hi>Damnum altis homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus,</hi> deceitfull deuyſes, and great terrour to ſome, with captiuitie.</p>
            <p>Next to this, I doo obſerue the coloure of this Crinitall Starre, to be wateryſhe, darke, pale, and Saturnine, which is the very coloure of death: whereby it ſignifieth ſadneſſe, ſorowe, Plagues, miſerie, mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, feare, and hunger, to be among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dwellyng within the eyght and nynth Clymate. And all this for our vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vnleſſe we repent vs of our ſinnes, which are ſo ryfe among vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23645:4"/>
Farther I note howe that the tayle of this Crinitall Starre, is extended towarde the face of <hi>Mars,</hi> and towarde the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt partes, which is the true teſtimonie of Warres, bloodſheddyng, of ſodayne irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Souldiers, of Sickneſſes, Plagues, Sweattes, blooddy Flixe, and heapyng vp of ſorowe among the people in the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt and Weſt Countreys.</p>
            <p>Finally, I obſerue that this Crinitall Starre, is of a thyn ſubſtaunce, &amp; that it ſhal laſt tyl the Sunne hath paſſed vnder the end of <hi>Libra, Scorpio</hi> &amp; <hi>Sagittarie,</hi> and ſo long it ſhall be apparently ſeene at Sunne ſettyng, in the tyme of his continuance, to be in the xi.x. and part of the .ix. houſe, and that it is in the .xi. Signe from <hi>Aries:</hi> Which doth ſignifie euyll conſpiracies, deceitfull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges, and muche terrour and daunger to many men in the Northeaſt and Weſt Countreys, ſo that to conclude this fyrſt part, the full ſignification of this Crinita, is to continue two yeeres and three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: And therefore let vs pray, that GOD may diuert and turne from vs the daungers, which it ſignifieth, in Plagues, warres, and inundation of flooddes, windes, and waters.
<pb facs="tcp:23645:4"/>
And thus generally of his place, coloure, and ſignification: next folowe, what, where, and when, his effect ſhall fall.</p>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>The ſeconde part, touching this Crinitall Starre.</head>
               <p>WHere as I haue ſhewed general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what this Crinital Starre ſignifieth, it foloweth in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde treatiſe, to declare in what countryes the effectes ſhalbe, and at what tymes. For ſeeyng the earth is diuided into foure partes, <hi>Europe, Aſia, Affrica,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> and euery one of theſe comprehend a multitude of Countryes, and euery Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye is ſubiect to diuers perylles of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and doth dyffer in clymates, and in the obliquitie of the Horizon: Then it muſt needes be, that no Comet or tayled Starre, can ſhewe his effect generally in al the foure diuiſions of the earth, but properly to thoſe Countryes ouer which it is placed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to clymatical and parellell lynes. So then touchyng this Crinita, waying his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, &amp; his Latitude Northerly from the Zodiacke, with the extractyng of his euyll
<pb facs="tcp:23645:5"/>
ſhadowes vpon certayne poyntes of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, with his place and terme in which i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſtand, I finde by Aſtronomical diuiſion, that the effect ſhall not reach into <hi>Africa,</hi> nor to the middle Seas, neyther to any Countryes ſpecially, but to thoſe which are within the viii. and .ix. Clymate, and properly to thoſe places, Cities, and Townes, which are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Aquary, Taurus, Leo,</hi> and <hi>Scorpio,</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the foreſayd climates. Wherefore to come to proper places, I finde that the effect of his ſhadowes ſhal be ſeene in thoſe places which be neere to the Ryuer of <hi>Rhene,</hi> and <hi>Danubius,</hi> ſo that <hi>Germany</hi> ſhal feele of it.</p>
               <p>Alſo the force and euyll ſhalbe ſhewed vpon <hi>Flaunders, Hollande, Zealande<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Freeſelande,</hi> and no leſſe vpon <hi>Denmarke, Danſke, Englande, Scotlande,</hi> and <hi>Irelande.</hi> And in lyke caſe to <hi>Pollonde,</hi> and <hi>Belgica</hi> in <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Pycardy.</hi> Some of theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes feelyng it with Plagues, mortalities, ſome with blooddie warres, ſome with the death of great Peares, and other ſome with miſery by great Floodds, wyndes, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowes of waters: of which, other countryes Southward, &amp; Eaſt, as <hi>Spayne, Barbarie</hi> &amp; <hi>Italy, Turkie, Greece,</hi> and all which dwell
<pb facs="tcp:23645:5"/>
out of the eyght and .ix. clymate, ſhalbe free, in reſpect of the corruption of ayre, &amp; gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous harme which is portended by weather, both by Lande and Sea.</p>
               <p>Next, whereas I note that the effectes of this Crinita, ſhall appeare two yeeres and three quarters, I obſerue by the profectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Athazer,</hi> and other circumſtances, that the next yeere. 1581. the effectes ſhal be as folowe. Firſt touchyng diſeaſes, there ſhall raigne Inflammations, Burnyng Feuers, Plagues, Hart burnynges, Blood ſhotten eyes, Blooddie flyxe, Meaſles, Pockes, Pleuriſies, heate in the ſtomacke, fallyng ſicknes, Phrenſies, and the ſtone: theſe be the pryncipal diſeaſes. Alſo the partes that ſhall be moſtly touched, be the hart, cheſt, brayne, eyes, backe, bladder: but it geueth the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication forcible vpon the mynde and brayne of man, that men ſhall be geuen to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe of hart, and that madneſſe, furiouſneſſe, phranticknes, ſadneſſe, melancholy, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke diſpoſition ſhal be ſeene greatly to abounde in men of the foreſaid countreys the next yeere, and therefore let vs pray to God, leſt for our wyckedneſſe he turneth vs to a reprobate ſenſe.
