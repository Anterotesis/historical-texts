            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF ever it were time to ſpeak or write, tis now, ſo many ſtrange Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currances, requiring both.</p>
            <p>How much thou art concerned in this enſuing <hi>Tryal</hi> (where not only the Priſoners, but the Fundamental Laws of <hi>England)</hi> have been moſt Arbitrarily Arraigned, Read, and thou mayſt plainly judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> is counted a Pretence for Rebelliion, and <hi>Religious Aſſemblies, Routs,</hi> and <hi>Riots;</hi> and the <hi>Defenders</hi> of both, are by them, reputed <hi>Factious</hi> and <hi>diſ-affected.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> are their great <hi>Charter,</hi> but to call for <hi>Englands,</hi> is a Crime, incurring the penalty of their <hi>Bale-Dock,</hi> and <hi>Naſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole,</hi> nay, the menace of a <hi>Gag,</hi> and <hi>Iron Shackles</hi> too.</p>
            <p>The Jury (though proper Judges) of Law and Fact) they would have over-ruled in both, as if their Verdict ſignified no more, then to eccho back the illegal charge of the Bench; and becauſe their courage, and honeſty did more then hold pace, with the threat and abuſe of thoſe, who ſate as Judges, (after two dayes and two nights reſtraint for a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict) in the end were fined and impriſoned, for giving it.</p>
            <p>O! what monſtrous, and illegal proceedings are theſe? Who reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably can call his Coat his own? When <hi>Property, is made ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the Will and Intereſt of his Judges;</hi> or, who can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteem himſelf a Free man? <hi>When all Pleas for liberty are eſteemed Sedition,</hi> and the Laws, that give, and maintain them, ſo many inſignificant pieces of formality.</p>
            <p>And What do they leſs then plainly tell us ſo, who at will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>break open our Locks, rob our Houſes, raze their Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, impriſon our Perſons, and finally deny us Juſtice</hi> to our relief; as if they then acted moſt like Chriſtian men, when they were moſt barbarous, in ruining ſuch, as really are ſo; and that no Sacrifice could be ſo acceptable to God, as the deſtruction of thoſe, that moſt fear him.</p>

            <head>An <hi>Appendix,</hi> by way of <hi>Defence</hi> for the <hi>Priſoners,</hi> as what might have been offered againſt the Indictment, and illegal 'Proceedings of the Court thereon, had they not violently over-rul'd and ſtopp'd them.</head>
            <p>UPon a ſober diſquiſition into the ſeveral parts of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, we find it ſo wretchedly defective, as if it were nothing elſe but a meer compoſition of error, rather calculated to the malitious deſigns of the Judges, then to the leaſt verity of Fact committed by the Priſoners.</p>
            <p>To prove this, what we ſay, will be a main help to diſcover the Arbitrary proceedings of the Bench in their frequent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces to the <hi>Jury;</hi> as if it were not ſo much their Buſineſs to try, as to condemn the Priſoners; and that not ſo much for any fact they had committed, as what the Court would have ſuggeſted to the <hi>Jury</hi> to have been their Fact.</p>
            <p>§. 1. <hi>It is the conſtant Common-Law of</hi> England, <hi>that no man ſhould be Taken, Impriſoned, Amerced, Deſeized of his Free-hold, of his Liberties or free Cuſtoms, but by the judgement of his Peers, which are vulgerly called a Jury, from</hi> Jurare, <hi>becauſe they are ſworn to do right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 2. The only aſſiſtance that is given the <hi>Jury,</hi> in order to a Verdict is;</p>
            <p>Firſt, The <hi>Evidence</hi> given of the Fact committed, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon indicted.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The knowledge of that Law, Act or Statute the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment is grounded upon, and which the Priſoners are ſaid to have tranſgreſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:38113:13"/>
§. 3. We ſhall neglect to mention here, how much they were deprived, of that juſt advantage the ancient equal Laws of <hi>England</hi> do allow; deſigning it for a concluſion of the whole, and ſhall only ſpeak here to matter of Fact and Law.</p>
            <p>§. 4. The Evidence, you have read in the Tryal, the utmoſt import of which, is no more then this; That <hi>William Penn</hi> was ſpeaking in <hi>Gracious-Street,</hi> to an Aſſembly of people, but knew not what he ſaid, which is ſo great a contradiction, as he that runs may read it; for no man can ſay another man Preaches, and yet underſtand not what he ſaith; he may conjecture it, but that is a lame evidence in Law; it might as well have been ſworn, That he was ſpeaking of Law, Phyſick, Trade, or any other matter of civil concernment. Beſides, there is no Law againſt Preaching what is Truth, whether it be in the Street, or in any other place; nor is it poſſible, that any man can truly ſwear, That he Preacht Sedition, Hereſie, &amp;c. unleſs he ſo heard him, that he could tell what he ſaid.</p>
            <p>§. 5. The Evidence further ſaith, That <hi>W. Mead</hi> was there, <hi>but til being in Gracious-Street be a fault, and hearing a man ſpeak the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs knows not what, be contrary to Law,</hi> the whole Evidence is uſeleſs, and impertinent; but what they want of that, they endeavour to ſupply with Indictment; whoſe parts we proceed to conſider.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Exceptions againſt the Indictment.</head>
               <p>§. 6. It ſaith, That the Priſoners <hi>[were met upon the 15th day of Auguſt,</hi> 1670] whereas their own Evidence affirms it to be upon the 14th day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 70.</p>
               <p>§. 7. <hi>[That they met with force and Arms]</hi> which is ſo great a Lye, that the Court had no better cover for it, then to tell the Jury, it was only a piece of Form, urging that the man tried for clipping of money this preſent Seſsions had the ſame words uſed in his Indictment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:38113:14"/>
But that this Anſwer is too ſcanty, as well as it was too weak to prevail with the Jury; we deſire it may be conſidered, that the ſame words may be uſed more of courſe, and out of form at one time, then at another: And though we grant they can have little force with any Jury in a Clippers caſe, for meer Clipping; yet they are words that give ſo juſt a ground of jealouſie, nay, that carry ſo clear an Evidence of illegallity where they are truly proved and affirmed of any Meeting, as that they are the proper Roots from whence do ſpring thoſe Branches which render an Indictment terrible, and an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly truly the terror of the people.</p>
               <p>§. 8. <hi>[Unlawfully, and tumultuouſly to diſturb the Peace]</hi> which is as true, as what is ſaid before, (that is, as falſe) this will evidently appear to all that conſider how lawfull it is to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with no other deſign then to worſhip God, and their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a lawful Aſſembly an unlawfull one, no more makes it ſo, then to ſay Light is darkneſs, black is white, concludes ſo impudent a falſity true.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, becauſe to worſhip God can never be a crime, no Meeting or Aſſembly, deſigning to worſhip God, can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. Such as go about to prove an unlawfull Aſſembly, muſt prove the Aſſemblers intent not to Worſhip God, but that no man can do, becauſe no man can know another mans intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therefore its impoſſible that any ſhould prove ſuch an Aſſembly unlawful. That is properly an unlawful Aſſembly, according to the definition of the Law; when ſeveral perſons are met together, with deſign to uſe violence and to do miſchief; but that Diſſenters meet with no ſuch intention, is manifeſt to the whole World, therefore their Aſſemblies are not unlawful; he that hath only right to be worſhipped, which is God, hath only right to inſtitute how he will be worſhipped; and ſuch as worſhip him in that Way they apprehend him to have inſtituted, are ſo far from being unlawful Aſſemblers, that therein they do but expreſs the duty they owe to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Tumultuouſly]</hi> Imports as much as Diſorderly, or an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly full of Noiſe, Busſle, and Confuſion, uſing force and violence, to the injury of Perſons, Houſes, or Grounds. But
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38113:14"/>
whether Religious Diſſenters, in their peaceable Meetings, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in deſiring, and ſeeking nothing more then to expreſs that duty they owe to God Almighty, be a Tumultuous action, or meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the ſence expreſt (and which is the very definition of the Law) will be the queſtion. Certainly ſuch as call theſe Meetings tumultuous, as to break the peace, offer the greateſt violence to common words, that can be well imagined; for they may as rightly ſay, ſuch perſons meet adulterouſly, thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhly, &amp;c. as to affirm they meet tumultuouſly, becauſe they are as truly applicable; in ſhort, ſuch particulars, as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to prove them ſuch Meetings in Law, are wholly want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>§. 9. <hi>[To the diſturbance of the peace]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the diſturbance of the peace be but matter of form with the reſt, as is uſually pleaded; leave out this matter of form and then ſee what great matter will be left.</p>
               <p>Certainly ſuch Aſſemblies, as are not to the breach and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of the peace, are far from being unlawful or tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary: but if the peace be broken by them, how comes it the evidence was ſo ſhort? We cannot believe it was in favour of the Priſoners. This may ſhew to all the reaſonable World, how forward ſome are, to brand innocency with hateful Names, to bring a ſuſpition, where there was none deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>§. 10. <hi>[That the ſaid</hi> Penn <hi>and</hi> Mead <hi>met by agreement before hand made.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if perſons that never ſaw each other, nor converſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither had correſpondence by any other hand, cannot be ſaid to be agreed, to any action, before it be done; then the Priſoners were far from an Agreement; for they had never Seen, Converſt, nor Correſponded, directly, nor indirectly, before the Officers came to diſturb the Aſſembly: We well know how far they would have ſtretcht the word, <hi>Agreement,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy;</hi> but God who brings to nought, the Counſels of the wicked, prevented their cruel deſigns.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:38113:15"/>
§. 11. <hi>[That</hi> William Mead <hi>did abet the ſaid</hi> William Penn <hi>in preaching.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No man can be ſaid to abet another, whilſt they are both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to each other, eſpecially in this caſe, where abetting follows agreeing, and agreeing ſuppoſes fore-knowledge. Nay, the word abet in Law ſignifies to <hi>command, procure or counſel</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which <hi>W. Mead,</hi> could not be ſaid to do, in reference to <hi>W. Pen,</hi> they being ſo great Strangers one to another, and at ſo great a diſtance; for the Evidence proves that he was with Lievtenant <hi>Cook,</hi> and Lievtenant <hi>Cook</hi> ſwears he could not make his way to <hi>W. Penn,</hi> for the Croud.</p>
               <p>§. 12 <hi>[That</hi> W. Penn'<hi>s Preaching and ſpeaking cauſed a great co<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> and tumult of People, to remain and continue a long time in the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is ſo improbable to believe, that the very nature of a tumult admits of no ſuch thing as preaching; but implies a diſorderly multitude, where all may be ſaid to ſpeak, rather then any to hear.</p>
               <p>§. 1. <hi>[In contempt of the King and his Laws.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are ſo ſar from contemning the King and his Laws, that they are obleiged and conſtrained by their own principles, to obey every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, <hi>but not againſt the Lord for mans ſake,</hi> which is the queſtion in hand. Beſides, their continuance there, was not in contempt, but by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the chief Officer preſent, that came there by the Kings authority; nor is it for the honour of the King that ſuch perſons ſhould be ſaid to act in contempt of his Laws, as only meet to honour God and his Laws.</p>
               <p>§. 2. <hi>[And to the great diſturbance of the Kings peace.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is far from diſturbing and breaking the Kings peace for men peaceably to meet to worſhip God; for it is then properly broken and invaded, when force and violence are uſed, to the hurt and prejudice of Perſons and Eſtates; or when any thing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38113:15"/>
is done that tends to the ſtirring up of Sedition, and begetting in people a diſlike of the civil Government: But that ſuch things are not practiſed by us in our Aſſemblies, either to offer violence to mens Perſons and Eſtates, or to ſtir up People to Sedition, or diſlike to the civil Government, is obvious to all that viſit our Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>[To the great terror and diſturbance of the Kings leige people and Subjects, and to the evil example of all others in the like caſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, againſt the Kings peace, his Crown, and Dignity.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were theſe black Criminations as true as they are wretchedly falſe, we ſhould give as juſt an occaſion, to looſe our Liberties, as our cruel Adverſaries, are ready to take any to deprive us unjuſtly of them, O! How notorious is it to all ſober people, that our manner of life is far from terrifying any; and how abſurd to think that naked men (in the generality of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, known to be harmleſs and quiet) ſhould prove a terror or diſturbance to the people; certainly, if any ſuch thing ſhould be in the time of our Meetings, it is brought with the cruelty and barbarous actions of your own Souldiers; they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learned by our example to beat, hale before Magiſtrates, fine, and impriſon for matters relating to Gods Worſhip; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they ſay, we are their preſidents; for all thoſe <hi>Adulterous, Prodigal, Laſcivious, Drunken, Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Prophane acts, they dayly commit, and eſteem rather occaſion of brag and boaſt, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and repentance:</hi> No, they need not go ſo far, they have too many (God Almighty knows) of their own Superiors for their example.</p>
               <p>§. 4. But we can never paſs over with ſilence, nor enough obſerve the deteſtible juggle of ſuch Indictments, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire all <hi>Engliſh and Conſcientious men</hi> to mind, as they value themſelves in the like occaſions. How little a grain of fact was proved, yet how ſpatious an Indictment was made? had it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the evidence, the bulk had been excuſable; but when it only ſwelled with malicious ſcaring Phraſes, to ſuggeſt to the people, that they were the meereſt Villains, the moſt dangerous
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38113:16"/>
Perſons, and deſigning mutually the ſubverſion of the Laws, and breach of the peace, to the terrifying of the People, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Who can chooſe but tell them of their Romance-Indictment, that is ſo forged, as it truly merits another againſt it ſelf. This they childiſhly call <hi>Form;</hi> but had an <hi>Italian</hi> or other Stranger been in Court, he would have judged it matter of fact, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it unworthy of a Kings Court, to accuſe men in terms, not legally, truly, or probably due to the fact, they really had committed; as well as that no Court would practiſe it, but that which loved to deprive men of their Liberties, and Lives, rather then to ſave them; <hi>Nolens Volens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. Had their cruelty and juggle ended here it ſelf, they would have ſpared us the pains of any further obſervation. But that which we have to add, on the Priſoners behalf, renders their actions ſo abominable, in the ſight of Juſtice, that all honeſt and ingenious hearts muſt needs abhor their baſe ſnares.</p>
               <p>They tell the Jury, <hi>That being but Judges of fact only, they were to bring the Priſoners in guilty</hi> (that is of the fact) <hi>at their peril; and it was the part of the Bench, to judge what was Law:</hi> So that if the Jury had brought them in <hi>Guilty,</hi> without any further addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional explanation (though intentionally they meant only of the fact proved by evidence) yet the Bench would have extended it to every part of the Indictment, and by this impious deluſion, to have perjured a well meaning Jury, and have had their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous ends upon the innnocent Priſoners. But the Jury better underſtanding themſelves brought in <hi>Will. Penn</hi> guilty of the fact proved, namely, <hi>That he was ſpeaking to ſome people met in</hi> Gratious-Church-Street, <hi>but not of an unlawful Aſſembly, ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt antiated</hi> (the mention of which ſtabbed their deſign of mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general anſwer of <hi>guilty,</hi> to their own ends, to the heart) nor indeed could they do otherwiſe; for as well the Jury as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, were denyed to have any Law produced, by which they might meaſure the Truth of the Indictment, and guilt of the fact. But becauſe the Recorder would or could not (perhaps tis ſo long ſince he read Law that he may have forgotten it) we ſhall perform his part, in ſhewing what is that <hi>common Law of the

All the various kinds or models of Government, that are in the World, ſtand either upon <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>Contract,</hi> the firſt, rule by men, the ſecond, by Laws: It is our happineſs to be born under ſuch a conſtitution, as is moſt abhorrent in it ſelf, of all arbitrary Government, and which is, and ever has been, moſt choice and careful of her Laws, by which all Right is preſerved.</p>
               <p>§. 7. All Laws are either Fundamental, and ſo immutable; or Superficial and ſo alterable. By the firſt we underſtand ſuch Laws, as injoyn men to be juſt, honeſt, vertuous; to do no wrong, to kill, rob, deceive, prejudice none; but to do, as one would be done unto; to cheriſh good, and to terifie wicked men; in ſhort, univerſal Reaſon, <hi>which are not ſubject to any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, becauſe no emergency, time, or occaſion can ever juſtifie a ſuſpention of their execution, much leſs their utter Abrogation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 8. By Superficial Laws we underſtand, ſuch Acts, Laws, or Statutes; as are ſuited to preſent occurrances; and which may as well be abrogated, for the good of the Kingdom, as they were firſt made for it. For inſtance, thoſe Statutes, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to Victuals, Cloaths, and Places of Trade, &amp;c. which have ever ſtood whilſt the reaſon of them was in force, but when that benefit, which once redounded, ſell by croſs occurrances, they ended according to that old maxime, <hi>Ceſſante ratione Legis, ceſſat Lex;</hi> but this cannot be ſaid of Fundamental Laws, <hi>Till Houſes ſtand without their Foundations, and Engliſh man-kind wholly ceaſe to be,</hi> which brings cloſe upon the point.</p>
               <p>§. 9. There is not any Country, that has more conſtantly expreſt her care and deep ſolicitude, to the preſervation of her fundamental Laws, then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; and though
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38113:17"/>
the evil of ſome particular times and perſons have endeavoured an utter Abolition of thoſe excellent Fundamentals, which we have before defined and defended from any juſt reaſon of revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; yet God Almighty, who is always concerned to avenge the cauſe of Juſtice, and thoſe excellent good Laws, by which it is upheld, has by his providence befool'd their contrivances, &amp; baſfled their attempts, by bringing their deſigns to naught, and their perſons frequently to condign puniſhment and diſgrace, their Age no Antiquary living can aſſure us, unleſs they ſay, As old as Reaſon it ſelf; but our own Authors are not lacking to inform us, that the Liberties, Properties and Priviledges of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation are very ancient.</p>
               <p>§. 10. For <hi>Hern</hi> in his <hi>Mirror of Juſtice</hi> (writ in <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt's time) <hi>Fol.</hi> 1. tells us, <q>That after God had abated the Nobility of the <hi>Britans,</hi> he did deliver the Realm to men more humble and ſimple, of the Countries adjoyning, to wit, the <hi>Saxons,</hi> which came from the parts of <hi>Almaign</hi> to conquer this Land, of which men there were forty Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, which did rule as Companions; and thoſe Princes did call this Realm <hi>England,</hi> which before was named the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Britan:</hi> Theſe, after great wars, tribulations and pains, by long time ſuffered, did chuſe a King to raign over them, to govern the people of God, and to maintain and defend their perſons, and their good in quiet, by the Rules of Right, and at the beginning they did cauſe him to ſware to maintain the holy Chriſtian Faith, and to guide his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by Right, with all his power, without reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and to obſerve the Laws: And after when the Kingdom was turned into an Heritage, King <hi>Alfred,</hi> that governed this Kingdom about an hundred ſeventy one years before the Conqueſt, did cauſe the great men of the Kingdom to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at <hi>London,</hi> and there did ordain for a perpetual uſage, That twice in the year, or oftner, if need ſhould be, in time of Peace, they ſhould aſſemble at <hi>London</hi> in Parliament; for the Government of Gods People, that men might live in quiet and receive right by certain uſages and holy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>IN the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, Amen: Whereas our Soveraign Lord the King, to the honour of God, and of holy Church, and for the common profit of the Realm, hath granted for him, and his Heirs for ever, theſe Articles above written:</hi> Robert <hi>Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, <hi>Primate of all</hi> England, <hi>admoniſhed all his Province once twice and thrice, becauſe that ſhortneſs will not ſuffer ſo much delay, as to give knowledge to all the People of</hi> England <hi>of theſe preſents in writing: We therefore enjoyn all Perſons, of what eſtate ſoever they be, that they, and every of them, as much as in them is, ſhall uphold and maintain theſe Articles granted by our Soveraign Lord the King, in all points: And all thoſe that in any point do reſiſt, or break, or in any manner hereafter Procure, Counſel, or in any wiſe Aſſent to Teſtifie or Break thoſe Ordinances, or go about it, by word or deed, openly or privily, by any manner of pretence or colour; we, the aforeſaid Arch Biſhop, by our Authority in this Writing expreſſed, do Excommunicate and Accurſe, and from the Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and from all the Company of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and from all the Sacraments of Holy Church do ſequeſter, and exclude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may here ſee, that in the obſcureſt Times of ſottiſh Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, they were not left without a ſence of Juſtice, and the neceſſity of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> to be inviolably enjoy'd which brings us to the cauſe of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:38113:22"/>
1ſt The cauſe of this famous Charter, was, as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid, the Incroachments that were made by ſeveral Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of precedent Kings, that almoſt became Cuſtomary, and which had neer extinguiſht the free Cuſtoms due to Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: How great care it coſt our Anceſtors, it unbecomes us to ignore, or by our ſilence to neglect; It was that <hi>Yoak</hi> and <hi>Muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle,</hi> which failed not to diſ-able many rageing Bears, from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring <hi>the pleaſant Vineyard of Engliſh-Freedoms,</hi> that otherwiſe would not have left a fruitful Vine in being. Anon we may give the Reader an account of ſome, with their Wages as well as Works.</p>
            <p>2d The Reaſon of it, is ſo great, that it ſeems to be its own. It is the very <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Expreſſion</hi> of <hi>Juſtice, Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty;</hi> Points of ſuch eminent importance, as without which no Goverment can be ſaid to be reaſonable, but arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and tyrannical. It allows every man that liberty God and nature have given him, and the ſecure poſſeſſion of his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from the In-road or Invaſion of his Neighbour, or any elſe of that conſtitution. It juſtifies no man in a fault, only it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides equal and juſt ways to have the Offender tryed; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the malice of many Proſecutors, and the great value of Liberty and Life.</p>
            <p>3d The End of it was the moſt noble of any earthly projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to wit, <hi>The refixing of thoſe ſhaken Laws,</hi> held for many hundred years, by conſtant claim, that they living might be re-enſtated in their primitive liberty, and their poſterity ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the poſſeſſion of ſo great a happineſs.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe many rich Advantages, that accrew to the free People of <hi>England,</hi> from this great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and thoſe many confirmatory Statutes of the ſame, we ſhall preſent the Reader with the ſight of ſome few, that may moſt properly fall, under the conſideration and inquiry of theſe preſent times, as found in our Common Law Books.</p>

            <p>(1ſt) <hi>That this was by Law, before the Statute, and therefore this Statute but declaratory of the antient Law.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Beſides <hi>Cook</hi> well obſerves, that in the 4th Chap. of the 25th <hi>Edw. 3, Per Legem Terrae,</hi> imports no more, then a Tryal by due proceſs, and writ Original at Common Law, which cannot

            <p>Thus have we preſented you with ſome of thoſe maxims of Law, dearer to our Anceſtors, then life; <hi>Becauſe they are the defence of the Lives and Liberties of the People of</hi> England; it is from this 29th Chap. of the great Charter; <hi>Great,</hi> not ſor its Bulk, but the Priviledges in it; as from a ſpatious Root, that ſo many fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Branches of the Law of <hi>England</hi> ſprings, if <hi>Cook</hi> may be credited. But how <hi>ſacred</hi> ſoever they have been eſteemed, and ſtill are by noble and juſt minds, yet ſo degenerate are ſome, in their proceedings, that conſcious to themſelves of their baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they will not dare ſtand the touch of this great Charter, and thoſe juſt Laws grounded upon it, of which number we may truly rank the Mayor, and Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> with the reſt of their wiſe Companions, in their late Seſtions, at the Old Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon the occaſion of the Priſoners.</p>

the Recorder can never deliver himſelf, unleſs it be by avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>the Laws are not his Guide, and therefore does not ſuffer them to be pleaded before him in Judgment.</hi>

            <p>5ly The verdict being given, which is in Law, DICTUM VERITATIS, <hi>(The voice of Truth her ſelf)</hi> (becauſe not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their humor) <hi>They did five times reject it, with many abuſive imperious, and menacing Expreſſions to the Jury,</hi> (ſuch as no preſident can afford us) as if they were not the only conſtituted Judges by the Fundamental Laws of the Land, <hi>but meer Cyphers only to ſignifie ſomething behind their Figures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6ly Though the Priſoners were cleared by their Jury, yet were they continued for the non-payment of their Fines, laid upon them, for not pulling off their Hats, in which the Law is notoriouſly broken.</p>
            <p>(1ſt) <hi>In that no man ſhall be amerced, but according to the Offence; and they have fined each forty Marks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2d) <hi>They were not merced by any Jury, but at the will of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed Bench.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides there is no Law againſt the Hat, and where there is no Law there can be no Tranſgreſſion, and conſequently no legal Amercement or Fine 9 <hi>H.</hi> 3. Chap. 14. But how the Priſoners were trapanned into it, is moſt ridiculous on the ſide of the contrivers, that finding their Hats off, would have them put on again by their Officers, to fool the Priſoners, with a trial of putting them off again, which Childiſh conceit not being gratified they fined them the forty Marks a piece.</p>
            <p>7ly Inſtead of accepting their Verdict as good in Law, and for the true deciſſion of the matter, according to the great Charter (that conſtitutes them proper Judges, and which bears them out, with many other good Laws, in what they agreed to, as a Verdict, the Court did moſt illegally, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38113:24"/>
tyrannically fine and impriſon them, as in the Tryal was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. And that notwithſtanding the late juſt reſentment of the Houſe of Commons, in Judge <hi>Keelings</hi> Caſe, where they reſolved, that the preſident and practice of Fining, and Impriſoning <hi>of Juries, for their Verdicts, were ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi> And here we muſt needs obſerve two things.</p>
            <p>(1ſt) That the Fundamental Laws of <hi>England</hi> cannot be more ſlighted, and contradicted in any thing (next Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens being quite deſtroyed) then in not ſuffering them to have that equal <hi>medium,</hi> or juſt way of tryal, that the ſame Law has provided, <hi>which is by a Jury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2d) That the late proceeding of the Court, at the Old Baily, is an evident Demonſtration, that Juries are now but <hi>meer Formality,</hi> and that the partial charge of the Bench muſt be the Verdict of the Jury; <hi>for if ever a Rape were attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Conſciences of any Jury, it was there.</hi> And indeed the ignorance of Jurors of their authority by Law, is the only Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their unhappy cringing to the Court, and being ſcared into an <hi>Anti-Conſcience Verdict,</hi> by their lawleſs threats.</p>
            <p>But we have lived to an Age, ſo deboiſt from all huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and reaſon, as well as Faith and Religion, that ſome ſtick not to turn <hi>Butchers to their own Priviledges, and Conſpirators againſt their own liberties.</hi> For however <hi>Magna Charta</hi> had once the reputation of a ſacred unalterable Law, and few hardned enough, to incur and bear the long Curſe, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Violaters of it, yet it is frequently objected now, that the benefits there deſigned <hi>are but temporary,</hi> and therefore lyable to alteration, as other Statutes are. <hi>What Game ſuch Perſons play at, may be lively read, in the attempts of</hi> Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſius, Palaris, <hi>&amp;c. which would have Will and Power be the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that the Priviledges due to <hi>Engliſh-</hi>men, by the great Charter of <hi>England,</hi> have their Foundation in Reaſon and Law; and that thoſe new <hi>Caſſandrian</hi> wayes, to introduce <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> deſerve to be deteſted by all perſons profeſſing ſence and honeſty, and the leaſt Allegiance to our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:38113:25"/>
Government; we ſhall make appear from a ſober conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the nature of thoſe Priviledges contained in that <hi>Charter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) The Ground of alteration of any Law in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (where there is no invaſion) ſhould ariſe from the univerſal <hi>diſcommodity of its continuance,</hi> but there can be no diſprofit in the diſcontinuance of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no juſt ground of alteration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2) No one <hi>Engliſh-</hi>man is born Slave to another, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has the one a right to inherit the ſweat and benefit of the others labour (without conſent) <hi>therefore the Liberty and Property of an</hi> Engliſh-<hi>man, cannot reaſonably be at the will and beck of another, let his quality and rank be never ſo great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3) <hi>There can be nothing more unreaſonable then that which is partial,</hi> but to take away the LIBERTY and PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERTY of any (which are natural Rights) without breaking the Law of <hi>nature</hi> (and not of Will and Power) is manifeſtly partial, <hi>and therefore unreaſonable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4) If it be juſt and reaſonable <hi>for men to do as they would be done by,</hi> then no ſort of men ſhould invade the Liberties and Properties of other men, becauſe they would not be ſerved ſo themſelves.</p>
            <p n="5">(5) Where Liberty and Property are deſtroyed, there muſt alwayes be a ſtate of force and war, which however pleaſing it may be unto the <hi>Invaders</hi> it will be eſteemed intollerable by the <hi>Invaded,</hi> who will no longer remain ſubject in all humane probability, then while they want as much power to free themſelves, as their Adverſaries had to enſlave them: <hi>The troubles, hazards, ill-conſequences, and illegality of ſuch attempts, as they have declined by the moſt prudent in all Ages, ſo have they proved moſt uneaſie to the moſt ſavage of all Nations, who firſt or laſt have by a mighty Torent freed themſelves, to the due puniſhment and great infamy of their Oppreſſors:</hi> ſuch being the advantage, ſuch the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38113:25"/>
diſadvantage which neceſſarily do attend the fixation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of Liberty and Property.</p>
            <p>We ſhall proceed to make it appear that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> (as recited by us) imports nothing leſs then their preſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No Free-men ſhall be taken, or impriſoned, or be diſſeized of his Free-hold, or Liberties, or free Cuſtoms, or be out-lawed, or exiled, or any other wayes deſtroyed; nor we will not paſs upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawfull judgement of his Peers, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Free-man ſhall not be amerced for a ſmall fault, but after the manner of the fault, and for a great fault, after the greatneſs thereof, and none of the ſaid amercement ſhall be aſſeſſed, but by the Oath of good and lawfull men of the Vicinage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, It aſſerts <hi>Engliſh-</hi>men to be free; <hi>thats Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that they have Free-holds, <hi>thats Property.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That Amercement, or Penalties, ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the faults committed, <hi>which is Equity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, That they ſhall loſe neither, but when they are adjudged to have forfeited them, in the judgment of theirh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Neighbours, according to the Law of the Land; <hi>which is lawfull Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is eaſie to diſcern to what paſs the Enemies of the <hi>great Charter</hi> would bring the People.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are now Free-men; <hi>but they would have them Slaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, They have now Right unto their <hi>Wives, Children,</hi> and <hi>Eſtates,</hi> as their undoubted property; <hi>but ſuch would rob them of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Now no man is to be amerced, or puniſhed, but ſuitably to his fault; <hi>whilſt they would make it ſutable to their revengefull minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:38113:26"/>
Fourthly, Whereas the Power of Judgment lies in the Bre<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſts and Conſciences of twelve honeſt Neighbours; <hi>they would have it at the diſcretion of mercenary Judges:</hi> To which, we cannot chuſe but add, <hi>That ſuch Diſcourſes manifeſtly ſtrike at this preſent conſtitution of Government;</hi> for it being founded upon the <hi>Great Charter</hi> (which is the Antient Common Law of the Land) as upon its beſt Foundation; none can deſign the concelling of the <hi>Charter,</hi> but they muſt neceſſarily intend the extirpation <hi>of the Engliſh Government:</hi> For where the cauſe is taken away the effect muſt conſequently ceaſe. <hi>And as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of our antient Engliſh Laws, by the</hi> Great Charter, <hi>was the ſoveraign Balſom which cured our former breaches, ſo doubtleſs will the continuation of it, prove an excellent prevention to any future diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome are ready to object, <hi>That the Great Charter conſiſting as well of Religions as civil Rights, the former having received an alteration, there is the ſame reaſon, why the latter may have the like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which we anſwer, That the reaſon of alteration cannot be the ſame, therefore the conſequence is falſe. The one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter of Opinion, about Faith and Religious Worſhip, which is as various, as the unconſtant apprehenſions of men; but the other is matter of ſo immutable right, and juſtice, that all Generations (however differing in their religious Opinion) have concentered, and agreed to the <hi>certainty, equity,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable neceſſity of preſerving theſe fundamental Laws;</hi> ſo that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> hath not riſen and fallen with the differing reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Opinions, that have been in this Land, but have ever remained, as <hi>the ſtable right, of every individual Engliſh-man, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as an Engliſh-man.</hi> Otherwiſe, If the <hi>civil Priviledges</hi> of the People, had fallen with the pretended Religious Priviledges, of the <hi>Popiſh Tyranny,</hi> at the firſt Reformation (as muſt needs be ſuggeſted by this Objection) our caſe had ended here, <hi>that we had obtained a Spiritual Freedom, at the coſt of a Civil bondage;</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:38113:26"/>
which certainly was far from the intention of the firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and probably an unſeen conſequence, by the Objectors to their idle Opinion.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, there is no time, in which any man may plead the neceſſity of ſuch an action, as is unjuſt in its own nature, which he muſt unavoidably be guilty of, <hi>that doth deface or cancel that Law by which the juſtice of Liberty and Property is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and maintained to the People.</hi> And conſequently, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may legally attempt the ſubverſion, or extenuation of the force of the <hi>Great Charter.</hi> We ſhall proceed to prove from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances out of both.</p>
            <p>1ſt <hi>Any Judgment given contrary to the ſaid Charter, is to be undone, and holden for nought.</hi> 25 Edw. 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>2d <hi>Any that by Word, Deed, or Counſel, go contrary to the ſaid</hi> Charter, <hi>are to be excommunicated by the Biſhops: And the Arch-Biſhops of</hi> Canterbury <hi>and</hi> York, <hi>are bound to compel the other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to denounce Sentence accordingly, in caſe of their remiſſneſs, or neglect;</hi> which certainly hath relation to the State, rather then the <hi>Church; ſince there was never any neceſſity of compelling the Biſhops to denounce ſentence in their own caſe, though frequently in the peoples,</hi> 25 Edw. 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>3d <hi>That the great</hi> Charter, <hi>and</hi> Charter <hi>of Forreſt, be holden and kept in all Points, and if any Statute be made to the contrary, that it ſhall be holden for nought.</hi> 42 Edw. 3. 1. Upon which <hi>Cook,</hi> that famous Engliſh Lawyer, ſaid, <hi>That albeit Judgments in the King Courts, are of high regard in Law, and</hi> Judicia <hi>are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as</hi> Juris Dicta; <hi>yet it is provided by Act of Parliament, That if any Judgment be given contrary to any of the points of the great</hi> Charter, <hi>it ſhall be holden for nought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He further ſaith, <hi>That upon the Statute of the 25th</hi> Edw. 1. Chapter 1. <hi>That this great</hi> Charter, <hi>and the</hi> Charter <hi>of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, are properly the Common Law of this Land, or the Law is Common to all the People thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:38113:27"/>
4ly Another Statute runs thus, <hi>If any force come to diſturb the execution of the Common Law, ye ſhall cauſe their bodies to be arreſted, and put in Priſon; Ye ſhall deny no man right by the Kings Letters, nor counſel the King any thing, that may turn to his damage, or diſheriſon.</hi> 18 Edw. 3. <hi>Chap. 7. Neither to delay right by the great and little Seal.</hi> This is the Judges Charge and Oath. 2 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. chap. 8. 14 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 14. 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. chap. 10.</p>
            <p>5ly Such care hath been taken, for the preſervation of this great Charer, that in the 25th of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. It was enacted, <hi>That Commiſſioners ſhould iſſue forth, that there ſhould be choſen in every Shire-Court, by the commonalty of the ſame Shire, three ſubſtantial men, Knights, or other lawful, wiſe, and well diſpoſed perſons, to be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, which ſhall be aſſigned by the Kings Letters, Patents, under the great Seal, to hear and determine (without any other writ, but only their Commiſſion) ſuch plaints as ſhall be made upon all thoſe, that commit, or offend againſt any point, contained in the aforeſaid</hi> Charters. 28 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. chap. 1.</p>
            <p>6ly The neceſſity of preſerving theſe <hi>Charters,</hi> hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in nothing more, than in the care they have taken to confirm them; which as <hi>Cook</hi> obſerves, hath been by thirty two <hi>Parliaments confirmed, eſtabliſhed, and commanded to be put in execution,</hi> with the condign puniſhment they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon the Offenders. <hi>Cooks Proem,</hi> to the ſecond Book of his Inſt.</p>
            <p>7ly That in the notable <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> many of theſe great Priviledges, and free Cuſtoms, contained in the aforeſaid Charters, and other good Laws, <hi>are recited and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> 3 Car. 1.</p>
            <p>8ly The late King, in his Declaration, at <hi>New-Market,</hi> 1641. acknowledged <hi>the Law to be the Rule of his Power,</hi> By which he doubtleſs intended <hi>Fundamental Laws,</hi> ſince it may be the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38113:27"/>
great advantage of Countries, ſometimes to ſuſpend the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>temporary Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſo manifeſtly evidenced that <hi>venerable eſteem,</hi> our Anceſtors had of that <hi>Golden Rule</hi> (the great Charter) with their deep ſolicitude, to preſerve it, from the defacing of uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and faction. We ſhall proceed to give an account of their juſt reſentment and earneſt proſecution againſt ſome of thoſe, who in any Age have adventured, to undermine that antient Foundation, by introducing an arbitrary way of Government.</p>
            <p>1ſt, As Juditious <hi>Lambard</hi> reports in his <hi>Saxon</hi> Tranſlation; <hi>That the Kings in thoſe dayes, were by their Coronation-Oaths obliged, to keep, the antient fundamental Laws, and Cuſtoms of this Land</hi> (of which this great Charter is but declaratory) <hi>ſo did</hi> King Alfred (reputed the moſt famous Compiler of Laws amongſt them) <hi>give this diſcovery of his Indignation againſt his own Judges, for acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contrary to thoſe fundamental Laws, that he commanded the execution of forty of them;</hi> which may be a ſeaſonable <hi>Caveat</hi> to Judges of our times.</p>
            <p>2d <hi>Hubert de Burgo,</hi> once chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> (having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. in the eleventh year of his reign, (in his Counſel holden at <hi>Oxford) To canſel this great Charter, and that of the Forreſt) was juſtly ſentenced according to Law, by his Peers, in open Parliament.</hi> When the Statute called CONFIRMATIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIS CARTARUM was made; in the firſt Chapter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> is peculiarly called, the <hi>Common Law, 25 Edw.</hi> 1. Chap. 2.</p>
            <p>3d The <hi>Spencers</hi> (both Father and Son) for their arbitrary domination, and raſh, and evil counſel to <hi>Edw.</hi> the 2d (by which be was ſeduced to break the great <hi>Charter)</hi> were baniſhed for their pains, as <hi>Cook</hi> relates.</p>
            <p>4ly The ſame fate attended <hi>Treſillian</hi> and <hi>Belknap,</hi> for their il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal proceedings.</p>

5ly the Breach of this great Charter, was the ground of that exemplary Juſtice, done upon <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley,</hi> whoſe caſe is very memorable in this point; <hi>For though they gratified</hi> Hen. 7. <hi>in what they did, and had an Act of Parliament for their Warrant, made the eleventh of his reign; yet met they with their due reward from the hands of Juſtice, that Act being againſt Equity and common Reaſon, and ſo no juſtifiable ground, or Apology, for thoſe frequent abuſes, and oppreſſions of the People, they were found guilty of.</hi> Here what the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> further ſaith, concerning the matter, <q>There was an Act of Parliament, made in the eleaventh year of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. which had a <hi>fair flatteriing Pr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

See the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sewers; diſcretion ought to be thus diſcribed, <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretio eſt deſcernere per Legem; quid ſit juſtum;</hi> From whence three things ſeem, moſt remarkable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The great equity and juſtice of the great Charter, with the high value our Anceſtors have moſt deſervedly ſet upon it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The dreadful Maledictions, or Curſe, they have denounced upon the Breakers of it; with thoſe exemplary puniſhments they have not ſpared, to inflict upon ſuch notorious Offenders.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, So hainous a thing was it eſteemed of old, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour an enervation, or ſubverſion of theſe antient Rights and Priviledges, that Acts of Parliaments themſelves (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the moſt ſacred with the people,) have not been of force enough to ſecure or defend ſuch perſons from condign puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who in purſuance of them, have acted inconſiſtant with our great <hi>Charter.</hi> Therefore it is, that great Lawyer; the Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> doth once more agravate the example of <hi>Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> (with perſons of the ſame rank) into a juſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well to Parliaments as Judges, Juſtices and inferior Magiſtrates, to decline making, or executing any Act, that may in the leaſt ſeem, to reſtring or confirm, this ſo often avowed and confirmed <hi>Great Charter</hi> of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> ſince Parliaments are ſaid to err when they croſs it; the Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their Acts puniſhed, as Time-ſerving Tranſgreſſors; and that Kings themſelves, (though enriched by thoſe courſes) have with great Compunction and Repentance, left among their dying words their recantations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:38113:29"/>
Therefore moſt notable and true it was, with which we ſhall conclude this preſent Subject, what the King pleaſed to obſerve in a ſpeech to the Parliament, about 1662. <hi>(viz.) The good old Rules of Law are our beſt ſecurity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manner of the <hi>Courts</hi> behaviour towards the Priſoners, and Jury, with their many extravigant expreſſions, muſt not altogether ſlip our obſervation.</p>
            <p>(1ſt) Their carriage to the <hi>Jury</hi> outdoes all <hi>preſedents;</hi> they entertained them more like a <hi>Pack of Fellons,</hi> then a <hi>Jury of honeſt men,</hi> as being fitter to be try'd themſelves, then to acquit others. In ſhort, no <hi>Jury,</hi> for many Ages, received ſo many inſtances of diſpleaſure and affront, <hi>becauſe they prefered not the humor of the Court, before the quiet of their own Conſciences, even to be eſteemed as perjured, though they had really been ſo, had they not done what they did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2d) Their treatment of the Priſoners was not more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, then inhumane, Hiſtory can ſcarce tell us of one <hi>Heathen Roman</hi> that ever was ſo ignoble to his <hi>Captive:</hi> what! <hi>to accuſe, and not hear them; to threaten to Bore their tongues, Gag and Stop their Mouthes, Fetter their Leggs, meerly for defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that by the ancient fundamental Laws of</hi> England <hi>too.</hi> O Barbarous! had they been <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> that carriage would have ill become a Chriſtian Court, <hi>ſuch actions proving much ſtronger diſſwaſives, then Argument to convince them, how much the Chriſtian Religion inclines men to Juſtice and moderation above their dark Idolatry.</hi> It is truly lamentable that ſuch occaſion ſhould be given, <hi>for Intelligence to Forreign Parts,</hi> where <hi>England</hi> hath had the reputation of a Chriſtian Country, <hi>by the ill treating of its ſober and religious Inhabitants for their conſciencious Meetings to worſhip God.</hi> But above all, <hi>Diſſenters</hi> had little reaſon to have expected this boariſh fierceneſs from the <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>London, when they conſider his eager proſecution of the Kings Party under</hi> Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells <hi>Government, as thinking he could never give too great a teſtimony of his Loyalty to that new Inſtrument,</hi> which makes the old ſaying true, <hi>That one Runagade is worſe then three Turks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alderman <hi>Bludworth,</hi> being conſcious to himſelf of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial kindneſs to the <hi>Popiſh Firers,</hi> hopes to make amends by his zealous proſecution of the poor <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> for at the ſame Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38113:30"/>
he moved to have an Evidence <hi>(of no ſmall quality)</hi> againſt <hi>Harriſon,</hi> the Friar, ſent to <hi>Bridewel</hi> and whipt, <hi>that he was earneſt to have the Jury fined and impriſoned, becauſe they brought not the Priſoners guilty, for only worſhipping their God:</hi> whence it may be eaſie to obſerve, <hi>That Popiſh Friars, and Prelatical Perſecutors are meer Confederates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what others have only adventured to ſtammer at, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder of London,</hi> has been ſo ingenious as to ſpeak moſt plainly; or elſe what means thoſe two fatal Expreſſions, <hi>which are become the talk and terror both of City and Country?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, in aſſuring the Jury, <hi>That there would be a Law next Seſſion of Paliament, That no man ſhould have the protection of the Law, but ſuch as conformed to the Church:</hi> which, ſhould it be as true, as we hope it is falſe (and a diſhonorable <hi>Propheſie</hi> of that great Aſſembly) the <hi>Papiſts may live to ſee their</hi> Marian <hi>dayes out-done by profeſt Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſurely no <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> can be ſo ſottiſh, as to conceive that his right to <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> came in with his Profeſſion of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> or that his <hi>natural and humane Rights, are dependant on certain religious apprehenſions,</hi> and conſequently he muſt eſteem it a cruelty in the abſtract, that Perſons ſhould be denied the benefit of thoſe Laws which relate to civil concerns. who by their deportment in civil affairs, have no wayes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſt them, but meerly upon an opinion of Faith and matter of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>It is well known that <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property, Trade</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce</hi> were in the World long before the Points in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as the common Priviledges of Mankind; and therefore not to be meaſured out by a conformity to this, or the other religious perſwaſion, but purely as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-</hi>men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But we ſhould rather chooſe to eſteem this an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>heat</hi> in the <hi>Recorder,</hi> then that we could believe a <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons Recorder</hi> ſhould ſay, an <hi>Engliſh Parliament</hi> ſhould impoſe ſo much <hi>Slavery</hi> on the preſent Age, and entayl it upon their own Poſterity <hi>(who for ought they know may be reckoned among the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters of the next Age)</hi> did he not encourage us to believe, it was both his <hi>deſire</hi> and his <hi>Judgment,</hi> from that deliberate <hi>Elogy</hi> he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38113:30"/>
made on the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition,</hi> expreſſing himſelf much to this purpoſe: <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Till now I never underſtood the reaſon of the pollicy and prudence of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in ſuffering the <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> amonſt them: And certainly it will never be well with us, till ſome thing like unto the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition</hi> be in <hi>England.</hi>
               </q> The groſs malignity of which ſaying, is almoſt inexpreſſable: <hi>What does this but juſtifie that Helliſh deſign of the Papiſts to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the firſt Reformation;</hi> If this be good Doctrine, then <hi>Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtrant,</hi> the grand <hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> was a more venerable Perſon then <hi>Luther</hi> the Reformer. It was an expreſſion that had better become <hi>Cajetan the Popes Legate, then</hi> Howel, <hi>a Proteſtant Cities Recorder.</hi> This is ſo far from helping to convert the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that it is the way to <hi>harden him in his Idolatry;</hi> when his abominable <hi>cruelty,</hi> ſhall be eſteemed prudence, <hi>and his moſt barbarous and exquiſite torturing of Truth, an excellent way to prevent Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Recorder</hi> has ſpake for no more then for himſelf, it is well; but certainly he little deſerves to be thought a <hi>Proteſtant, and a Lawyer, that put both Reformation and Law into the Inquiſion:</hi> There being nothing more deſtructive of the fundamental Laws and Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> and that noble deſign <hi>of primitive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; then the Arbitrary Power and terrifying Raks of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Inquiſition.</hi> And doubtleſs the <hi>ſupream Governours</hi> of the <hi>Land, are highly oblieged in Honour and Conſcience</hi> (in diſcharge of their Truſt to God and the Peoples to take theſe things into their ſerious conſideration, as what is expected from them, by thoſe who earneſtly wiſh theirs and the Kingdoms ſafety and proſperity.</p>

               <hi>THe Houſe reſumed the Hearing of the reſt of the Report touching the matter of Reſtraints upon Juries; and that upon the examination of divers Witneſſes, in ſeveral Clauſes of reſtraints, put upon Juries, by the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> Keeling; <hi>whereupon the Committee made their Reſolutions, which are as followeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That the proceedings of the Lord Chief Juſtices, in the Caſes now reported, are Innovations, in the Trial of men for their Lives and Liberties; and that he hath uſed an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and Illegal power, which is of dangerous conſequence to the Lives and Liberties of the people of</hi> England, <hi>and tends to the introducing of an Arbitrary Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That in the place of Judicature, the Lord Chief Juſtice hath under-valued, vilified, and contemned</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>the great preſervers of our Lives, Freedom, and Propertie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That he be brought to Trial, in order to condign puniſhment, in ſuch manner as the Houſe ſhould judge moſt fit and requiſite.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Preſedents and Practice of Fining or Impriſoning, Jurors, for Verdicts, is Illegal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whether the Juſtices of this Court, in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings (both towards the Priſoners, and Jury) have acted according to Law, to their Oaths and Duty, and to do Juſtice without partiality? whereby Right might be preſerved, the Peace of the Land ſecured, and our Ancient Laws eſtabliſhed; or whether ſuch Actions tend not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of our Lives and Liberties, to rob us of (our Birth-right) the Fundamental Laws of <hi>England?</hi> and finally to bring in an Arbitrary and Illegal power to uſurp the Benches of all our Courts of Juſtice, we leave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Reader to judge.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, there can be no higher affront offered to King and Parliament, then the bringing their Reputations into ſuſpition with their People, by the irregular actions of ſubordinate Judges: And no Age can parallel the carriage of this <hi>Recorder, Mayor,</hi> &amp;c. Nor can we think ſo ignobly of the Parliament, as that they ſhould do leſs then call theſe Perſons to account, who fail'd not to do it to one leſs guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of more repute, (to wit) Judge <hi>Keeling:</hi> For if his behaviour gave juſt ground of jealouſie, that he intended an Innovation, and the introducing an Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this <hi>Recorder</hi> much more. Did chief Juſtice <hi>Keeling</hi> ſay, <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was <hi>Magna farta;</hi> ſo did this <hi>Recorder</hi> too: And did Juſtice <hi>Keeling</hi> Fine and Impriſon Juries, contrary to all Law, ſo did this <hi>Recorder</hi> alſo. In ſhort, there is no difference, unleſs it be, that the one was queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and the other deſerves it: But we deſire in this they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:38113:32"/>
may be ſaid to differ. That though the former eſcap'd puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the latter may not, who having a Preſedent before, did notwithſtanding notoriouſly tranſgreſs.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, The Law ſuppoſes the King can't err, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is willing to ſuppoſe, he alwayes acts by Law (and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt as Legis, eſt voluntas Regis,</hi> Or the Kings Will is regulated by the Law) but it ſays no ſuch thing of his Judges. And ſince they are oblig'd by Oath to diſregard the Kings Letters (though under the Broad and privy-Seal) if they any wiſe oppugn, or contradict the Laws of the Land; and conſidering that every ſingular Action of an inferior Miniſter, has an ugly reference to the Supream Magiſtrate, where not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked; we can't but conclude, that both Judges are anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their irregularities, eſpecially, where they had not a limitation of a Kings Letter, or Command; and that the Supream Magiſtrate is oblig'd, as in Honour and Safety to himſelf, <hi>Alfred-</hi>like, to bring ſuch to condign puniſhment, leſt every Seſſions produce the like Tragical Scenes of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation over the Conſciences of Juties, to the villifying and contemning of Juſtice, and great detriment, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the good and honeſt men of this Famous and Free City.</p>
