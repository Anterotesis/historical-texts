            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>I Sing the Man that rais'd a Shirtleſs Band</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Northern</hi> Rabble, when the Prince did land;</l>
            <l>A Sniveling Heroe with a Weaſel Face,</l>
            <l>And Features which an Eunuch would diſgrace;</l>
            <l>Of a dark Spirit, turbulent and proud,</l>
            <l>Rude to Superiors, fawning to the Crowd;</l>
            <l>Prompt to Revenge, and treacherouſly baſe,</l>
            <l>Plotting when private, bluſt'ring when in place;</l>
            <l>Too weak to hurt, yet ever working ill,</l>
            <l>Harmleſs in Action, Miſchievous in Will:</l>
            <l>Stiff for Religion, which he ne're profeſt,</l>
            <l>A Modiſh Zealot, with bad Morals bleſt,</l>
            <l>Lewdly profane, and wicked like the reſt;</l>
            <l>Sainted i'th Womb, and born with mortal hate.</l>
            <l>To the Eſtabliſh'd Forms in Church and State.</l>
            <l>The Youth was train'd in a Fanatick Club,</l>
            <l>And heard a Blockhead bellow in a Tub:</l>
            <l>In riper years, the great <hi>Achitophel,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>With all the Learning he receiv'd from Hell,</l>
            <l>Refin'd the hot-brain'd Lout, and taught him to rebell</l>
            <l>He ſtudied Anarchy, and Common-weal,</l>
            <l>And learn'd to varniſh Wickedneſs with Zeal.</l>
            <l>In Treaſon too he wondrous progreſs made;</l>
            <l>And once his ſecret labours were betray'd:</l>
            <l>But halting Juſtice came too late that time,</l>
            <l>For want of Evidence, but not of Crime:</l>
            <l>Witneſs the late Rehearſal that was made,</l>
            <l>When a Chief Actor the whole Scene diſplay'd;</l>
            <l>Witneſs what ſince the Chit himſelf has ſaid,</l>
            <l>Like mad St. <hi>As</hi>—wonders he foretells,</l>
            <l>And in the Art of Palmiſtry excells;</l>
            <l>With Frantick Geſtures, and a diſmal Meen,</l>
            <l>The Wretch diſcourſing to himſelf is ſeen:</l>
            <l>His boding looks a Mind diſtracted ſhow,</l>
            <l>And Envy ſits engrav'd upon his Brow;</l>
            <l>A reſtleſs Male-content, even when preferr'd,</l>
            <l>He leaves the Court, and mingles with the Herd;</l>
            <l>Flutt'ring and vain, he ſeeks their wild applauſe,</l>
            <l>And heads them in defiance of the Laws:</l>
            <l>Harrangues the gaping Mobile aloud,</l>
            <l>And plays the <hi>Merry-Andrew</hi> of the Crowd:</l>
            <l>He tells them his Eſtate is pawn'd and ſpent</l>
            <l>In waging War againſt the Government:</l>
            <l>In the great Council he their Cauſe promotes,</l>
            <l>The Patron of their perjured Darling, <hi>Oates.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>When <hi>Weavers</hi> with United Fury went</l>

            <l>He their great Guardian, in the Crowded Street,</l>
            <l>That medley Tribe of Mutineers did greet.</l>
            <l>Great <hi>Tom</hi>'s Leige-People thus he makes his own,</l>
            <l>And undermines that Captain's Envied Throne:</l>
            <l>His Sacred Rights this Upſtart does profane,</l>
            <l>Rivals his Greatneſs, and diſturbs his Reign.</l>
            <l>How did this <hi>Alien</hi> his ſtrong Realm invade,</l>
            <l>When in the progreſs which he lately made;</l>
            <l>Diſloyal City-Mobb, undue attendance paid.</l>
            <l>Methinks I ſee him bowing at the Head</l>
            <l>Of thoſe that through the wondring <hi>Strand</hi> he led.</l>
            <l>With pains and charge he did that Pageant gain;</l>
            <l>Nor was the Service of his Kindred vain:</l>
            <l>Their Intereſt, and his Man's, made up the Scoundrel Train.</l>
            <l>Huzzaing Crowds flockt to him in all parts,</l>
            <l>Which made his <hi>Siſter</hi> name him <hi>King of Hearts.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They kiſs'd his proffered Hand, and Worſhip paid</l>
            <l>To that dull Calf which they an Idol made;</l>
            <l>Wiſhing the <hi>Juncto</hi> which at <hi>London</hi> ſate,</l>
            <l>Had made him Ruler of the New-form'd State,</l>
            <l>And cry'd, <hi>Ware King,</hi> if he e're dooms thy Fate.</l>
            <l>How goodly was the Show! to ſee him train</l>
            <l>That Country-Rabble where himſelf does Reign,</l>
            <l>Like thoſe that lately Rul'd this plunder'd Town:</l>
            <l>Such Officers ſuch Diſcipline was ſhown.</l>
            <l>Yet their great Chief, whate're the Men endure,</l>
            <l>Like a wiſe Captain does himſelf ſecure.</l>
            <l>But this poor Fool did ill his life defend,</l>
            <l>Starv'd with the Javelin of Rake-hell Friend.</l>
            <l>This part he acted on his Rural Stage,</l>
            <l>The great Buffoon and Harlequin o' th' Age.</l>
            <l>When he return'd, his Subjects did attend</l>
            <l>Their ſneaking Monarch to his Journeys end:</l>
            <l>And in the Front Two Lob-cock <hi>Earls</hi> did ride,</l>
            <l>With Nobler Rabble by his meager ſide.</l>
            <l>Go on vain Man, and grow in Infamy,</l>
