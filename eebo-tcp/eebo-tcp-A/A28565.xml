         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THe firſt thing that is uſually inquired
after in a Book, is, who writ it?
and according as the Author is liked
or diſapproved, the Sentence often is paſſed
without taking the pains to examine one
tittle of it.</p>
            <p>Could my Name have g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>en any reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Book, it had perhaps not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed;
but I am none of thoſe, who have
acquired any Fame in the World, nor of
them that deſire it.</p>
            <p>The only deſign of theſe following Leaves,
is, to do good; and if I may attain my end,
I deſire no thanks: And if I miſs it, I am
as unwilling to reap Reproaches or Hatred;
ſo that if I may but be unknown, it is all I
aſpire to.</p>
            <p>I am forced by my Subject, to reflect
ſometimes ſharply on the Follies, and Vices
<pb facs="tcp:56345:3"/>
of Men in Authority, and I muſt expect
this will anger them, and it will be a much
eaſier Task (in revenge) to inquire into
my faults, than to amend and reform their
own; and if they can find me as culpable as
themſelves, this will be taken for a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
reaſon, why they ſhould not endeavour to
be better, becauſe their Reprover hath his
faults, as well as they, and, it may be, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Whole Duty of
Man,</hi> and all thoſe excellent Pieces that
followed, is as much to be admired for his
Prudent, and Modeſt Concealment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as for any other thing; and I am fully
perſwaded that thoſe pieces have done the
more good in the World, becauſe they ſeem
to drop from Heaven, and no man claims
the Honour of having written them. And
as I have endeavoured to imitate that
brave Man: ſo I ſhould eſteem it a mighty
happineſs, if I might be as little known, as
he, and this diſcourſe might but prove
half ſo uſeful to the World, as any one of his
have done.</p>
            <p>It was long ſince obſerved by <hi>Cicero,</hi>
               <q>That there was not any ſort of Life, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Publick or Private, at home or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
whether a man converſed with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or himſelf only; which was deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of its peculiar Rules, and that the
<pb facs="tcp:56345:3"/>
Excellence of Life conſiſted in Acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to them, all as Turpitude did in
neglecting them.</q> And the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>
in his Seventh Book of the <hi>Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Learning,</hi> having distributed
that part of Morality, which relate to the
Duties of Men, into the General, or Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
or Reſpective, according to every
mans Profeſſion, Calling, State, Perſon,
and Degree, thus goes on. <q>The firſt of
theſe, I have already obſerved, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
Cultivated, and Explicated by
the Ancients, and others: and the latter
is by Parts alſo treated of, though I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
found it reduced into any perfect body
of Science, nor do I blame the thus hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of it in parts; and perhaps it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo to do. For who is of that Capacity
or Confidence, that he either can or dare
undertake to diſcourſe and deſire perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently,
and to the Life, of the particular
and Relative Duties of all Orders, and
Conditions of Men? And thoſe diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of ſuch Subjects as theſe, which are
deſtitute of Experience, and are only
drawn from a General Knowledg, and
Scholaſtick Learning, for the moſt part
prove vain, and uſeleſs. For though the
Stander by do ſometime ſee more than the
Gameſter; and there is a Proverb which
is more bold, than ſound, as it relates to
<pb facs="tcp:56345:4"/>
the Cenſure of the Rabble concerning the
Actions of Princes, <hi>That he that ſtands
in the Vally can beſt view the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
yet it were much to be wiſhed, that
no man would concern himſelf with theſe
ſorts of Subjects, but he that was very
expert, and well acquainted with them.
For the diſcourſes of Speculative Men on
Practical Subjects, ſeem nothing better
to them that are Converſant, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them, than the diſcourſes of
of <hi>Phormio</hi> concerning War ſeemed to
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> who took them for mere
Dreams, and Deluſions. But there is one
fault uſually attends this Experimental
ſort of Writers, that they never know
when they have commended, and Extolled
their Province enough.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far that Great Man hath diſcourſed
of theſe ſorts of Duties, but I having him in
<hi>Latin</hi> have perhaps taken off ſomething of
the Elegance of his Stile, by turning it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Engliſh:</hi> yet it will give the Reader his
ſenſe of theſe undertakings, and whether
I have done my part well or ill belongs not
to me, but to him to determine; only I will
aſſure my Reader I did not conſult many
Books for it, but I have rather endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to repreſent things as I found them by
Experience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56345:4"/>
Nor do I knaw of any one who before me
hath made any ſuch Attempt, for tho many
have written the Law-part both in former
times, and of late; yet the Moral part is
either totally neglected, or only to be found
in Sermons, or ſome hints in other diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which are very much too ſhort to give
a clear, and ſatisfactory Account, and two
much diſperſed to be ſuddainly Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Yet there is hardly any Subject, that
more deſerves or needs a diſcourſe of this
Nature, whether we conſider the Office I
treat of, or the perſons that are employed
in it.</p>
            <p>The Office of a Juſtice of Peace is of a
vaſt extent, and if my Reader be but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to conſult the Heads of this diſcourſe,
he will find it is no barren Subject for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Reflections: there is no one Virtue in
the World of which a Juſtice of Peace, as
ſuch, will not ſometimes ſtand in need, and
there is no Vice neither, which will not look
worſe in him then in another man; but I
have only ſelected them that were moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to my Subject, and for the reſt my
Reader may much better conſult other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>And I have endeavoured to diſcourſe of
Virtues, and Vices, in another manner then
the Moraliſts uſually do, and it did well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb facs="tcp:56345:5"/>
me ſo to do, while I conſidered them as
the Attendents of a publick perſon, which
had a great influence upon the Community.
For a good Juſtice of Peace is a publick
ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ng, and does more good by his example
(or might do; if ſuch were not too uſually
envied, and hated) than by his Authority.</p>
            <p>And again, a Wicked Ruler by his ill
example corrupts more, than he can reform
by his Severity.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the perſons, that execute
this Office, ſuch a diſcourſe muſt needs be
very uſeful; for tho the Arch-Biſhop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> and his Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſties Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
and theſe Judges that go the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Circuits, and, in ſhort, almoſt all the
Great Miniſters of State and Great Men
of the Nation, are a part of them, and are
named in all the Commſſiions; yet the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who reſide in the ſeveral Counties, and
do actually execute the Office, are for the
moſt part, Noble-men, and Lay-Gentlemen,
or Lawyers; whoſe Education hath not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
neceſſitated them to thoſe Studies,
that are requiſite to fit them for ſuch Moral
Reflections, and thoſe, that are beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with them, will yet be pleaſed
perhaps to ſee this diſcourſe ready laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to their hands, and I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all hopes that ſome, or other may be ſo
far diſpleaſed with what what I have done,
<pb facs="tcp:56345:5"/>
as to do it better; for I will not deny that
the Subject deſerves a better Head, and
Pen than mine: and it would pleaſe me to
ſee the uſe of this ſuperſeeded by a better.</p>
            <p>But till this is done, I have only one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
to make to my Reader, That he would
candidly interpret what I have written;
not out of a deſign to find fault, and inſtruct
my Betters; but kindly to repreſent to
them the lovelineſs of Virtue, and the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and turpitude of Vice, that ſo my
Reader may from thence take occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himſelf in what is amiſs, and to give
God hearty thanks for preſerving him from
the reſt of thoſe Crimes, which have not yet
touched him.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe, who may take excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I do aſſure them I never intended to
reflect perſonally upon any one man in the
World, and I fear there is no one paſſage in
the whole Book, but what may too pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be applyed to too great a Number of Men,
I wiſh it were otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But then this may be added to the other
Reaſons I have given, why I have concealed
my Name, to prevent the Rabble from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
application of ſeveral of the worſt parts
of my diſcourſe, to perſons for whom they
were never intended, and if they can once
find out one, they will preſently pretend
they have found out all the reſt, and this
<pb facs="tcp:56345:6"/>
was meant of this man, and that of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and ſo I ſhall become accountable for
all their wild Surmizes.</p>
            <p>There is one other Exception which may
lie againſt the whole, and that is, that by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the World what ſort of men Magiſtrates
ſhould be, I have given their Inferiours
(who are alſo Naturally inclin'd to be more
inquiſitive into the faults of their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
then into that which is their own
duty) too great a temptation to conſider
what they are, or have been, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to undervalue, and deſpiſe them: but this
is in their own power in great part to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
by reforming what would have betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to the ſcorn of the Many, tho I
had never been born; for Virtue and Vice
were well understood before this little piece
was thought of, and men ever were, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
will be accordingly eſteemed.</p>
            <p>The late Lord Chancellor <hi>Clarendon,</hi> in
a Circular Letter to all the Juſtices of the
Peace in <hi>England,</hi> bearing date the <hi>30th</hi>
of <hi>March,</hi> 1665 tells them, <q>I aſſure you
the King hath ſo great a ſenſe of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
you do, or can do for him, that He
frequently ſays, He takes himſelf to be
particularly beholding to every good Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of the Peace, who is Chearful and
Active in his Place, and that if in truth
the Juſtices of the Peace in the ſeveral
<pb facs="tcp:56345:6"/>
Diviſions be as careful as they ought to
be in keeping the Watches, and in other
parts of their Office (the keeping up their
Monthly Meetings, and ſuppreſſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
can hardly be interrupted within,
and the Hopes and Imaginations of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Perſons, would be quickly broken,
and all men would ſtudy to be quiet, and
injoy thoſe many bleſſings God hath given
the Nation under this happy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All this is certainly true, and tho the
times were then, as they are now, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
and there was a formidable Conſpiracy
then ſet on foot by the Republicans, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
of the Nation, yet the ſole Vigilance
and Care of the Juſtices of the Peace diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
it, and made it end in Smoke, to
the Eternal Reproach, and Diſhonour of the
Conſpirators, which ſhews the excellence
and uſefulneſs of this Order of men.</p>
            <p>Yet give me leave to ſay, that thoſe good
Juſtices of the Peace, who are moſt Active
and Chearful in their Places, are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
either the Richeſt, and Greateſt,
or the beſt beloved, and moſt favoured by
the reſt. And for this, Sir <hi>Thomas
Egerton,</hi> Lord-Keeper of the Great Seal,
in the <hi>44th</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in a Speech made
the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1601. in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56345:7"/>
by her Maieſty's expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and Printed in the end of the <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Collections</hi> of the four laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of her Reign, ſhall be my witneſs,
who thus complained, <q>Is there any more
fervent than others, in the buſineſs of
the Common-wealth? he streight hath
given him the Epithite of a buſie Jack:
but I know there be many good, and I wiſh
their number were increaſed; but who
be they? Even the poorer and meanner
Juſtices, by one of which more good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to the Common-wealth, than by a
Hundred of greater condition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh this complaint were ſuperannuated,
and that our times were quite otherwiſe,
but alas ſuch Juſtices of the Peace must
not only be content to hear worſe Language
than this; but there is too frequently Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations
made amongſt the reſt, to croſs and
quaſh whatever they ſhall propoſe, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo juſt, and reaſonable, and nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for it, but that they are mean, proud,
buſie people, and will perk up too much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
their Betters, if they be not thus
mortified, and kept under, this is the worſt
ſort of Reſpect of Perſons, that can be
thought of, and moſt miſchievous and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
that whereas Envy ever riſeth by
Nature, here it deſcendeth, and the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
<pb facs="tcp:56345:7"/>
who ſhould love and cheriſh the Induſtry
and Vigilance of his Inferiour, envieth
and hateth him for being more ſerviceable,
than he need perhaps to have been.</p>
            <p>But let it be conſidered, who reaps the
Advantage of all their Induſtry and Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but the King and Kingdom, and theſe
very men, that thus ſeverely treat them;
if there were none ſuch the Nation muſt
needs in a ſmall time be ruined, for as the
Lord Chancellor <hi>Clarendon</hi> takes notice in
the above Cited Letter. <q>So much Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
ſo much Induſtry, and ſo much dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
as this People (the Enemies of
the Government) are poſſeſſed with,
cannot be diſappointed by a Supine Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
or Lazineſs in thoſe, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
with the Kings Authority, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
without an equal induſtry, dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and combination between Good Men for
the Preſervation of the Peace of the
Kingdom, and for the ſuppreſſing of the
Enemies thereof.</q> Now if inſtead of this,
the Juſtices of the Peace combine in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
one againſt another, and the Great
men will neither do the duties of
their Places themſelves, nor ſuffer the
meaner, but more active, to do it for them;
what can be the event in the end, but this,
That like a City beſieged without, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
within, we muſt ſooner or later fall a
<pb facs="tcp:56345:8"/>
Prey to our Enemies, without Remedy or
Pity?</p>
            <p>But if theſe great men were capable of
Reaſon, there would be no need of this, and
as they are not it is in vain to offer it, and
therefore I muſt Addreſs my next requeſt
to the Judges and Miniſters of State, that
they would ſometimes enquire in to this, and
without regard to the Fortunes or Titles
of men, ſupport and incourage the more
uſeful (if occaſion ſo require) againſt the
more Potent.</p>
            <p>I hope there will not be many occaſions for
this, but there may for what followeth, and
therefore I will propoſe it in the words of
the preſent <hi>Lord-Keeper</hi> in his Speech to
Mr. Serjeant <hi>Sanders,</hi> at the the time he was
ſworn Lord Chief Juſtice of the Kings-Bench,
on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 23d of <hi>January,</hi>
1682. Pag. 8, 9. <q>The Age is degenerate
and full of Faults; Faults of Irreligion,
Morality, Debauchery, Quarrelling, Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Faction, ſo full of Faults that it
requires more then a man to cenſure them,
You will therefore conſider that inferi our
Magiſtrates, and inferiour Juriſdictions
are to take a great part of this labour
off your hands, in that regard you
will upon all Occaſions encourage and
direct them to make them uſeful to you,
and not overthrow their Proceedings
<pb facs="tcp:56345:8"/>
upon every ſlight Exception, to drive
People to begin their Proceſs here at
greater charge. And when Juſtices of
the Peace act candidly, tho not with ſo
much skill in the Law, you will ſhew ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
to them, as Gentlemen that ſerve
the King, and the Publick for nothing,
and have not thoſe Aſſiſtances of Council
and Officers that are here.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It were, it may be, but reaſonable, that
this tenderneſs ſhould not only be ſhewed to
their Proceedings, but alſo to their Perſons
and Eſtates, eſpecially thoſe of the meaner
ſort, that ſo men may be the more eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſed
to undertake the Publick Service: as
for inſtance, in an eaſie excuſing their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
at the Aſſizes, when they have no
particular buſineſs, that doth require their
preſence there. For ſeeing other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the like fortune, who are not Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Peace, do ſeldom happen to be
ſummoned above once in two years, it ſeems
a little hard to force theſe to come twice in
one year, merely to fill the Bench with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Spectators at ſo great a Charge
to them, tho I know alſo that much may be
learned by ſuch an Attendance, and there is
no fear but as many, as can will take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of it; but this being but my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
opinion, is ſubmitted intirely to the
Judgment of my Superiours, and had not
<pb facs="tcp:56345:9"/>
been mentioned, but becauſe the reaſon my
Lord Chancellour gives ſeems to extend to
it.</p>
            <p>The Lord Chancellor <hi>Clarendon</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
in the Letter I have ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<q>That many perſons, who are in the
Commiſſion of the Peace, neglect to be
ſworn. And tells us His Majeſty had
given Order to his Attorney-General to
proceed againſt them.</q> This hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſince complained of by the Judges of
Aſſice in their Circuits alſo, but till the
root of this miſchief be cut, it will never
be otherwiſe, as theſe things now ſtand, no
man that is in the Commiſſion of the Peace,
can have this <hi>Dedimus Poteſtatem,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
he pay about four Pounds for it: and it
being an employment which can bring him
nothing but expence, and trouble, it is no
great wonder that men are not very willing
to part with their Money for it, and ſo many
having ſtood a year or two, and the Officers
at laſt deſpairing to get any thing of them,
are either left out gratis, or for a ſmall
matter. So they that ſerve the King for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
pay for it, and the reſt ſcape better
cheap: and on theſe Terms it is no wonder
if there be frequent occaſions for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>
            <p>But this is not all, worthy, and good men
who are fit to ſerve the King, do thus avoid
<pb facs="tcp:56345:9"/>
the ſervice, &amp; they that are no way qualified
for it, being more willing to part with their
Money get into the imployment, which they
manage accordingly.</p>
            <p>To prevent all which inconveniencies, it
were much more for his Majeſties Service,
that the <hi>Dedimus Poteſtatem</hi> were freely
ſent down, and the Officers rewarded for it
out of the Exchequer.</p>
            <p>But if this be not approved, it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Money were paid by the Treaſurer
of the Diviſion, to which ſuch new made
Justices belongs; and indeed ſeeing the
Country will reap the greateſt advantage by
it, it is moſt reaſonable they ſhould pay the
Charge of the Enterance, which may be
done by a ſhort Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>It would not be reaſonable only to make
the Enterance into this Honourable, and
Troubleſome Imployment more eaſie; but the
execution too. And to that purpoſe, I
will preſume to offer a few more Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to my Superiours. In many Caſes
there are ſo many, and various Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
that a man knows not which to
proceed upon, and they are ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
one to another. Now if theſe were
reduced into one, and all the reſt repealed,
it would much facilitate the execution of
the Commiſſion of the Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56345:10"/>
For inſtance, there are a great many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Acts of Parliament, concerning the
repair of the High-ways, and they all are
difficult to be executed in relation to the
chief thing, the Proviſion of Carriages,
that depending upon the determination of a
<hi>Plough-Tilth,</hi> which no body knows what it
is, and yet if it were never ſo well known,
that would not mend the matter much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
conſiderable quantities of Land would
never be brought into this ſo neceſſary
Work, what quantity ſoever were aſſigned
to it, and many rich men would do little or
nothing, and leave the burthen upon the
poorer ſort of men.</p>
            <p>There have been two or three Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Acts of Parliament made ſince his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Reſtauration,<note place="margin">14 cap. 6. 22 cap. 12.</note> to enable the Surveyers
to repair the Ways by a Rate or Land-Tax,
but they are all expired. Now, if
this courſe were ſettled forever for the
Carriages, and only the Cottagers tied to
do ſo many days work, all the other Acts
of Parliament might be ſpared.</p>
            <p>But it would not be amiſs then to give
the Juſtices of the Peace power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
what ſhould be paid by the Load for
Sand, Gravel, and other materials taken out
of private mens grounds, or the waſts of
other Mannors, where there is a want with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the reſpective Pariſhes, without obliging
<pb facs="tcp:56345:10"/>
them to fill up the places, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
impoſſible, for want of matter, and
always very chargeable.</p>
            <p>The Statutes, which concern the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Proviſion for the Poor, need a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
too, and ſome alteration, and when this
is done, I recommend it to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of wiſe men, whether it would not be
adviſeable to give Power to the Grand-Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and Juſtices of the Peace, Aſſembled
in their Aſſizes, to make By-Laws with
the Conſent of the Judges, and to repeal,
alter, or change them as occaſion requires,
becauſe this Affair is ſo different in one
place, from what it is in another, that it
can hardly be brought under one general
Rule; and it ſeems but reaſon to intruſt
ſuch, and ſo many Gentlemen, with a Power
which is granted to almost every petty Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe the Statute concerning Lands
given to Charitable uſes,<note place="margin">39. Eliz. 6.</note> might be made
much more uſeful, by Communicating that
Power to any 4 Juſtices of the Peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Commiſſion out of the Chancery, and
allowing an Appeal to the Seſſions,<note place="margin">1</note> with a
Tryal by Jury. And indeed all Lands gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Charitable uſes would be better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
if accounts were given to the Juſtices
of the Peace, which is already given in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to thoſe that are given to the repair
<pb facs="tcp:56345:11"/>
of<note n="†" place="margin">13 &amp; 14. c. 2. c. 6. § 14.</note> High-ways, and the Relief of<note n="*" place="margin">22 &amp; 23. c. 2. c. 20. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> 11.</note> Goals
and Priſoners, and there is the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for the reſt.</p>
            <p>There is one thing of which no care was
ever taken, that I know of, and that is,
for Guardians for ſuch Children, as are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo poor, as to be a Charge preſently to
the Pariſh, and yet have not ſuch Eſtates,
as to be able to bear an Application to the
Chancery for that Purpoſe, many of which
become at length a Charge to the Pariſh,
when what was left them, is conſumed.
Which might be prevented by giving the
Quarter Seſſions power to appoint them
Guardians, and take ſecurity of them for a
good Account, altering and changing them as
occaſion ſerves, and compelling them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and make payment without Suits of
Law, which ſuch poor Orphans Eſtates will
not bear.</p>
            <p>There are too many other things to be
brought into a Preface, to ſo ſmall a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
as this, and therefore I will omit
them, but there is one I cannot paſs over;
I could never yet learn any power that was
given to the Juſtices of the Peace, to Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
or Compel Witneſſes to appear in the
Seſſions, except it were against Felons.
Now it is moſt certain no Caſe can be ended
without them, and that very often they will
not appear without Compulſion, and ſo many a
<pb facs="tcp:56345:11"/>
good Cauſe muſt and doth miſcarry. And
this a thing, as worthy of a ſhort Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
as any other I know of, if it were
but to make the Remedy more Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</p>
            <p>There are many Paſſages in the preſent
<hi>Lord-Keeper</hi>'s Speech, which I have quoted
above, that would have been of great uſe
to me, if I had been ſo happy as to have
ſeen it before I had finiſhed this Piece,
but there is one which I had much rather
miſplace here, then omit it altogether. <hi>Pag.</hi>
the <hi>6th.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>A private man is praiſed for ſhewing
Humility and Deference to others in his
Converſation, and paſſing by Indignities.</p>
               <p>But a Judg (and ſo proportionably a
Magiſtrate) muſt take greatneſs upon him;
he muſt conſider he repreſents the Kings
Perſon in his Seat of Juſtice; he muſt
therefore be very careful to preſerve the
Dignity, that belongs to it.</p>
               <p>He muſt have paſſions, but not of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man, that may diſturb his Judgment,
but he muſt aſsume Paſſion to ſet off his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
when the greatneſs of the Crime
requires it, but it muſt be ſo, as it may
appear that his Judgment governs his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and directs it againſt the offence, and
not againſt the Perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56345:12"/>
A Judg muſt be covetous, but not as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man, for his own profit, but he muſt be
very ſolicitous for the Kings profit, knowing
that the Kings Revenue is like Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
without which the Government would
not be able to perform its ordinary Motions.</p>
            </q>
            <p>All which excellent Rules, the laſt not
excepted, do belong as well to Juſtices of
the Peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to the Judges, ſeeing ſo much
of the Kings Revenue is committed to their
care, and it is the worſt ſort of Treaſon,
that can be ſtarve our King.</p>
            <p>And now, if my Reader thinks fit to go on
and read the Book too, let me conjure him
to do it without Partiality, or Prejudice,
and with a reſolution to reform whatever
he ſhall remark to be amiſs in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or Practice, and when he hath ſo done
I will ask him no favour, let him think and
ſpeak what he pleaſes of me, I care not
how low I lie in his Eſteem, how imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
or tedious, unlearned or ignorant,
nay, how confident, or impudent I may ſeem
to be, ſo I may do him good, and if nothing
elſe will do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even anger him into an Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And if he will conſider ſeriouſly of it, he
muſt grant I can have no other end, becauſe I
write neither for Money, nor Preferment, nor
Glory nor any other worldly intereſt, but
merely for the publick good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56345:12"/>
And if any man is pleaſed with this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate,
I only beg of him the favour of one hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Prayer for me and mine, and the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of this Diſcourſe, that it may advance
the Glory of God, the Execution of Juſtice
and Judgment, and the Proſperity and
Welfare of the beſt Church, the best King,
and the beſt Civil Government in the whole
World.</p>

            <p>AS all the Works of God are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,<note place="margin">The Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note>
ſo are they full of Variety,

the Works of his Hands,
the Fabrick of the World, and all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

in the Government, and Conduct of them,
at once preſerving what he has made, and
ſo diſpoſing them, as to produce thoſe
Effects for which they were Created, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Knowledg, and ſometimes againſt
their Wills.</p>
            <p>But tho this is true of all the Creatures,
yet it is moſt apparent, and full of Wonder,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56345:16"/>
when it is applyed to the Government of
Mankind; for all the other Creatures do
pay a blind, and unerring obedience to the
Laws of their Creation, and do never
tranſgreſs willingly, but Man being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with diſcurſive Faculties, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted

againſt what he knows to be his Duty,

the whole World more Uncertain, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant,
than Men, changing like the wind
very often to the quite oppoſite Points of
the Compaſs, without any Reaſonable, and
ſometimes without any Senſible Cauſe.</p>

               </gap>ave aſcribed it to Fate, and the Influence

               </gap> the Stars, and others to the Nature of

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56345:17"/>
But I cannot conceive it proceeds from
any of theſe Cauſes; for taking Fate, as it
ought properly, for a blind and Natural
determination of things to their Events, it
cannot be ſuppoſed that there ſhould be
ſuch an inclination to perfect, and unco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>troulable
Liberty in Man, without any
poſſibility of having it ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>And as to the Stars, their Influences, and
Aſpects vary every moment, and are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in one Country from what they are
in Others. But this inclination runs thro
all Mankind, tho it is ſometimes reſtrained
by External Accidents, and is like the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
diſpoſed to Motion, tho ſometimes
quiet, becauſe no Winds Excite it.</p>
            <p>And as to any Natural Inclination in
Mankind to be governed, and Acquieſce in
the Wiſdom of Others, it is ſo contrary to
the former of Living in perfect Liberty,
that they two are inconſiſtent, and cannot
ſtand together.</p>
            <p>And therefore I have ever thought the
reaſon lay higher, and that it Muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from ſome Decree of God Almighty
which is irreſiſtable, and uncontroulabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and that he in his Divine Providence, hath
ſet Bounds to this raging Sea, ſaying to it,
<hi>Hither ſhalt thou come, and no further.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if it were otherwiſe, thoſe ſtrange
Revolutions that have hapned in the World
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56345:17"/>
would Certainly have left us ſome inſtances
of a People that had attained, and continued
in a ſtate of Natural freedom for ſome time
without any Government, or Governors.
For to ſpeak the truth, that is the thing
they all ſeek.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, were there not ſuch
an Inclination in Mankind; why ſhould
they ſo reſtleſsly purſue that airy Notion,
and for it venture the loſs of Life and
Limbs? And what is the Multitude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
whether one, or twenty, or ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
command them, to do what they
would not, or to ſuffer what they hate
above all things?</p>
            <p>But God is a cauſe ſtrong enough to
Over-rule this Ocean, always the ſame,
ever Watching over the affairs of Mankind,
and making things fall inſenſibly, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibly
into the Order he wills they ſhould
be in.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he laid the foundations of
humane Society in a Single Perſon, and
Made all the reſt to ſpring from him like
a Fountain; and enured them from their
infancy to obedience, and made them
ſenſible of the uſe, and benefit of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
before they could conſider what it
was.</p>
            <p>And as no Government was ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
without force, ſo that force like
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56345:18"/>
the Aſhes of the Phenix being warmed by
the Sun of the Divine Favour, hath ever
produced another to ſucceed it, and left
the Multitude repining, and diſcontented
at thoſe Chains it never could, nor ever
ſhall break, till Time ſhall be no more.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>SECTION I.</head>
               <p>IT is no leſs a Wonder to ſee how God
in every Age, and Nation hath raiſed
up Men to Govern, and indued them
with ſuch a proportion of Abilities, as fitted
them more, or leſs for that employment.</p>
               <p>Man is not Naturally his Brothers Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and great is the number always of
them, who are perfectly unconcern'd for
the Publick Proſperity, or Misfortune of
their own Times, or Countries; till they
find the danger approach their own houſes
or perſons, and then for the moſt part 'tis
too late to prevent it. And thoſe few
that are otherwiſe minded, do as often
miſtake, or but pretend the Publick Good;
and yet after all this, there is very ſeldom
Wanting a Sufficient Number, ſo qualified,
as to Keep the Several Parts of the World
in ſome tolerable order.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56345:18"/>
And the Wonder is the greater, if we
conſider, how often theſe men meet no
other recompence than Death, and Ruine
from their Superiors, or Inferiors, Domeſtick
or Foraign Enemies; and altho ſome few
of the happieſt attain to ſuch Fortunes, as
may in ſome degree Compenſate the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
yet the far greateſt part ſeldom gain
any thing by it, but diſquiet, envy, pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and an uncertain fame, and after all
lie Expoſed to more dangers, than thoſe
they govern.</p>
               <p>This then muſt be another Effect of
the Divine Providence, that as God raiſes
them up, and endows them with qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
fit for Government, ſo he inſpires
them with inclinations to go thro with
it, and Keeps them in that diſpoſition till
others are fit to ſucceed them; in all things
directing, and ſupporting them ſo far as
he thinks fit, ſometimes to make a People
Happy, and ſometimes Miſerable, as his
Juſtice, or his Mercy is deſerved by
them.</p>
               <p>My Deſign is to diſcourſe of onely one
ſort of Governours, and that one of the
Loweſt, the <hi>Juſtices of the Peace,</hi> and
to deſcribe, as well as I can what they
ſhould be; for that having had the honour
to ſerve my Country many years in that
Station, I have had opportunity to Obſerve
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56345:19"/>
ſome things in my ſelf, and others, that are
Capable of Amendment, and all my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
will produce ſome good Effect or
other upon my Self at leaſt; and Whileſt
I deſcribe what they ſhould be, I ſhall have
often occaſions to Conſider the more Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
what I have been; from whence
by the Aſſiſtance of God's holy Spirit,
which I humbly and devoutly ask, I may
encreaſe my repentance for what is Amiſs,
my gratitude for what is not, and others
may perhaps be Excited to joyn with
me, and ſo ſome reformation may follow,
which never any Times needed more than
Ours.</p>

               <head>SECTION II.</head>
               <p>OF thoſe Qualifications which I have
mentioned, ſome are Natural, others
are Acquired, but both are the gift of God;
Tho the firſt are more immediately ſo,
and becauſe they are the Foundations of
the other, do naturally ſort themſelves in
the firſt Rank, and ſo fall firſt Under our
Conſideration; and becauſe I deſign to
be as ſhort as I can, I ſhall mention only
three, <hi>Apprehenſion, Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Memory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:56345:19"/>
Tho God hath given more Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the ſloweſt of Mankind than to the
ſubtilleſt of the Brutes, yet they, that are to
Govern others had need have a more then
ordinary Quickneſs, and Vivacity; It being
the deſign of almoſt all that Approach them
to delude and deceive them, and rather to
extort, than obtain a ſavorable Sentence by
Juſt proof and truth; and they have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
that jealous opinion of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
as to Expect to go by the loſs if
they have nothing to truſt to but their
innocence, and plain down-right truth.
And from hence proceed thoſe Crafty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations
of the ill tempers, or actions of
thoſe they Complain of in other inſtances,
which are no part of the Complaint, but
only artificial flouriſhes to beget an ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of their Adverſaries, that they may
aſſure the Victory before-hand.</p>
               <p>Others again are ſo little Maſters of
Language, and do ſo ſeldom appear before
their Superiors, that a man of ordinary
Capacity can ſcarce tell what it is they
would have, and yet it may be the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
is juſt, and reaſonable, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
of theſe is as much to be pitied, as
the craft, and ſubtilty of the Other is to
be diſcountenanced, and reproved.</p>
               <p>And when both the Parties appear, and
the buſineſs is ripened for a Concluſion,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56345:20"/>
the ſame difficulties attend it, the Crafty
Knave is for avoiding the Puniſhment of
his Crimes, and the innocent ſimple Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
man is as apt to betray his Cauſe by his
well-Meaning ſimplicity, if the quickneſs
and integrity of the <hi>Juſtice</hi> do not prevent
it.</p>
               <p>In greater Caſes, and higher Courts things
are firſt ripened by their Officers, and then
debated by Council, before they ſpeak
their judgments, and ſo how unequal ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the abilities of the Parties are, the
Caſe appears with equal art on either ſide,
and yet after all this the Briskneſs, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of thoſe Judges is of great uſe
to diſcern Truth from Falſehood, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
from Realities.</p>
               <p>But in this caſe there is nothing of that
nature to be Expected, neither can the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
nor will the Caſes bear it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Juſtice of the Peace ſtands abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in need of a Competent quickneſs of
Apprehenſion, without which he will be
liable to make great miſtakes, form which
great diſhonour, and damage will enſue.</p>
               <p>But here it will not be amiſs to give
ſome men a Caution, whoſe defects lie on
the other ſide, and for want of Patience to
hear a Matter Out, Catch at it too ſoon,
and think they underſtand before they
hear, whoſe fault is greater and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56345:20"/>
then the other, and cauſes more
injuſtice, and oppreſſion; for theſe quick
men run away with a ſhadow, and will
rarely be perſwaded they are under a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
and are for the moſt part a little
inſolent, and impatient of Contradiction
how ſoftly ſoever it be Cloathed, and theſe
men are perhaps more unfit for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then the former.</p>
               <p>The Apprehenſion is the door, by which
all things are Admitted, but the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the houſe, that receives, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains
them. And whatever the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of Apprehending the Caſe is, tho it
may be a hindrance of diſpatch, it is rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Juſtice too, if the Judgment do
at laſt attain to the diſcovery of the truth.</p>
               <p>But there is more required in a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
than a bare underſtanding of the
thing, which is but in Order to a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of it, and therefore is not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
in its ſelf, as in its Conſequences
and Effects.</p>
               <p>There are three defects which ſeem to
attend the Judgment, Darkneſs or Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Confuſion or Diſorder, and Weakneſs,
which proceeds from both.</p>
               <p>Some men are of ſo Cloudy Judgments
that they do with great difficulty, if
ever, hit upon the truth of things, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
if it be Studiouſly diſguiſed, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56345:21"/>
Miſrepreſented, as for the moſt part is in
reaſon to be Expected here; and tho theſe
are not to be deſpiſed for this Natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
but rather to be pittied, and Aſſiſted,
yet it renders them unfit for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of Others is ſo confuſed,
that they do with as great difficulty attain
a Clear, and diſtinct Notion of any thing;
and as their judgment, ſo their diſcourſe
is dark, and Uncertain, and they can as
little be underſtood by others, as they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
them, themſelves; and this muſt
needs render all buſineſs that is tranſacted
by them, uncertain and full of Hazard.</p>
               <p>The laſt, and Worſt Defect is Imbecility,
and Weakneſs, which if it be great, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable;
the Cloudy Underſtanding may
at laſt, the Confuſed ſometimes Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
and hit the Mark, but neither Time
nor Chance can cure that natural Imbeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which proceeds from them both, and
therefore they of all men are not fit for
Government; and ſhould never ſeek it, or
imbrace it if it be offered to them, and it is
great pity they ſhould be ſuffered to Expoſe
themſelves, and their Places, to Scorn, and
Contempt by them that have Power, and
Means to prevent it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Memory,</hi> is a Natural Faculty of Great
Uſe in all Humane Tranſactions, but Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56345:21"/>
in Government, and that in the
Loweſt degrees of it.</p>
               <p>For it is the duty of a Magiſtrate to
Execute Laws, not to make them, and he
is to have an Eye to the matter of Fact at
the ſame time too; now he that hath ſuch
a defect in that Faculty, that he can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remember the Law, which is to Direct
him, nor the matter of Fact to which it is
to be applied, is certainly very unfit to
be a judge; and ſo in Proportion in all
the intermediate degrees of it.</p>
               <p>The Office of a Juſtice of the Peace is
very diffuſed, and comprehends in it a vaſt
Number, and Variety of things; and it
will conſequently require a good <hi>Memory</hi>
to tell preſently, whether any particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
caſe be within his Juriſdiction, or No. Mr.
<hi>Lambard</hi> complained in his time, (and
that is near a hundred years ago) that
there were <hi>Stacks</hi> of <hi>Statutes</hi> impoſed
upon them to take care of, and the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is now perhaps double to what it was
then. So that in this reſpect alſo it is Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
that he who Undertakes this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
ſhould be a Man of a good ſtrong Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
               <p>If any man doubts the truth of this, he
will find upon trial, that no humane Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
how great ſoever it be, can perfectly
comprehend all the particulars Exactly;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56345:22"/>
and that it will be Neceſſary to have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
recourſe to the Books, Eſpecially in
Statute Caſes, without which many and
great Errors muſt of Neceſſity be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
ſo that the Prudence of a Magiſtrate
doth conſiſt in a great <hi>degree</hi> in not <hi>Truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
too much to his Memory. But then
that ſhews a Neceſſity of having that uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Faculty to a good degree.</p>

               <p>THere are three other Accidental qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
which are of great uſe, and
would be conſidered. A Competent Eſtate,
a good Reputation, and a tolerable good
Education, and Learning.</p>
               <p>The Juſtice of the Peace enters upon an
imployment that will occaſion him much
loſs of Time, ſome Expence, and many
Enemies, and after all will afford him lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or nothing towards the bearing theſe
inconveniences, but a little unprofitable
Honour attended with much envy, and
had therefore need before-hand be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
of a competent Eſtate at leaſt, to
ſupport him in that imployment, or elſe
he will ſuddainly repent, what he indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreetly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56345:22"/>
undertook, and it may be intail the
Miſchief upon his Family, who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
his honour with ſmall complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
when they reflect upon his <hi>debts</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by it.</p>
               <p>Nor will he, and his Family be the only
Sufferers, the Country will, and muſt bear
a part in it too, Men of ſmall Eſtates are
very often of Mean ſpirits, and dare not
do their Duties where they Expect oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
and have great and rich men to
deal with, and ſo betray Juſtice not for
want of Skill, or Honeſty, but of Courage
to undertake, and go thro with it.</p>
               <p>Beſides, their Poverty will Expoſe them
to great Temptations of Bribery, and tho
the profit that can come by it is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable,
yet the miſchief that will
attend it is not ſo; for the perverting Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
in the ſmalleſt inſtance, is a great
Diſhonour, and Damage to a Country; and
the meaner the cauſe, the greater the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy;
the Meaner the People are that are
injured, the greater the Clamour.</p>
               <p>But of all men thoſe, that are much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
are the leaſt fit, for that both the
Creditor, and his Friends muſt too often be
gratified by the wretched man, at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of his Oath, his Integrity, his Honour,
and his Juſtice, and all occaſions muſt be
ſought for this too, that the World may ſee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56345:23"/>
how great a power the Rich Clown hath
upon his Worſhip.</p>
               <p>For theſe cauſes there was an Act of
Parliament made ſome Ages ſince, which
is as followeth.</p>
               <p>WHereas by Statutes made in the
time of the Kings noble Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors,
it was Ordained, That
in every County of <hi>England</hi> Juſtices
ſhould be aſſigned of the moſt Worthy of
the ſame Counties, to keep the Peace,
and to do other things, as in the ſame
Statutes fully is Contained; Which
Statutes notwithſtanding, now of late
in many Counties of <hi>England,</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Number have beén Deputed and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
which before this were not wont to
be, whereof ſome be of ſmall (<hi>that is ill</hi>)
Behaviour, by whom the People will
not be governed nor ruled, and ſome for
their Neceſſity do great Extortion and
Oppreſſion upon the People, whereof
great inconveniences be likely to riſe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if the King thereof do not provide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy:
The King willing againſt ſuch
inconveniences to provide remedy, hath
Ordained, and Eſtabliſhed by Authority
aforeſaid, That no Juſtice of Peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Realm of <hi>England</hi> in any County,
ſhall be aſſigned, or deputed if he have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56345:23"/>
not Lands or Tenements to the Value
of 20 <abbr>l.</abbr> by the year: and if any be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained

or Tenements to the Value aforeſaid,
that he thereof ſhall give Knowledg to the

which ſhall put another ſufficient in

or Precept by force of ſuch Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
he ſhall incur the penalty of 20 <abbr>l.</abbr>

That if there be not ſufficient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

and of Good Governance within any ſuch

to the value aforeſaid by his diſcretion.
<hi>The 18 H. 6. cap.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>I have tranſcribed this Statute almoſt at
large, becauſe it makes ſo lively a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the inconveniences, and takes ſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56345:24"/>
exact a care to prevent them; and it is to
be obſerved, That xx l. by the Year at the
making of this Statute, was a Knights fee,
and that they would truſt to Nothing but
an Apparent Viſible Eſtate, for it muſt be
in Lands or Tenements, and yet was there
not then the Hundredth part of that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
committed to Juſtices then, there is
now, and their Expences that were conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
much leſs; and tho in caſe of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
ſome Lawyers of a leſs Eſtate were
Admitted, yet this was out of pure Neceſſity
in thoſe ignorant Times; and then they
were to be men of Good Governance, that
is, of a Good Reputation for their Lives
and Integrity, and ſuch men in thoſe time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
might by their Profeſſions be able to ſpend
with men of good Eſtates.</p>
               <p>But two inconveniences have ariſen
in our Times that were not in being
then; The firſt is, That Men of great
Eſtate do too commonly leave the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and ſpend their times and Eſtates in
<hi>London,</hi> and other great Cities in perfect
Idleneſs, and Luxury. The Other is, That
the Old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Induſtry is almoſt totally
Extinguiſhed, and they that Live in the
Country will not take that pains their
Anceſtors did either for themſelves, or their
Country.</p>
               <p>It is not at all likely that theſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56345:24"/>
will meet a Suddain, or Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Cure, and therefore it were to be
wiſhed, that men of Smaller Eſtates and
greater Induſtry might be encouraged by
ſome Honeſt, and Convenient Privileges
and Advantages to bear this burthen for
the good of their Country, without too
much dammage to their own Families.</p>
               <p>2. After the Advantage of <hi>Wealth,</hi> I
place that of <hi>Reputation,</hi> becauſe, as the
World goes, it will not be eaſily had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Other. And in this Caſe it is of
great Uſe to the <hi>Juſtice of Peace,</hi> and to
the Government, if he have a good Eſteem
amongſt his Neighbours at his firſt ſetting
out, and he ought to be always Careful
of it in all his Proceedings afterwards; part
of this may deſcend upon a man, and part
may be gained by himſelf with Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>As the common People of <hi>England</hi> have
always Lived under a Monarchy, ſo they
have been governed under their Prince by
a Potent Nobility and a Flouriſhing Gentry,
and will certainly Envy, and Repine at men
of no deſcent, when they come to be ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them; but then if they be men of good
Eſtates, and Great Civility, and Vertue, this
will ſoon wear off, provided it be not kept
up by the more Antient Gentry, which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56345:25"/>
happens, if they be not Slighted to
prefer theſe New men.</p>
               <p>But that infamy, which ſprings from ill
Actions, is hardly ever to be worn out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
every man that ſuffers, tho never ſo
juſtly, by ſuch a perſon, will be ſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
the memory of it, ſo that it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be forgotten.</p>
               <p>Beſides, men harden themſelves againſt
all Correction, and look not ſo much upon
their own deſerts, as the faults of their
Governours, and Conſequently become
worſe for their Chaſtiſement, till at Laſt
their Anger turn to Malice, and that too
is Advanced very frequently to a Contempt
of the Supream Governour, and ends in
Tumults, and Rebellion, Anarchy, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>But let a man's Eſteem be what it will,
when he ſets out, he muſt be as careful to
preſerve it by his Virtue, to which Candor
and Sincerity, Temperance and Chaſtity,
and all thoſe other Moral Qualifications
which make a good man, are of abſolute
Neceſſity; and that not onely in relation to
himſelf, but to thoſe he is to govern.</p>
               <p>For he is ſure none of his Vices ſhall be
conceal'd; all men will be prying into his
moſt ſecret Retirements, and will be as
Curious to enform themſelves of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
of his faults, as they are negligent
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56345:25"/>
of the greateſt they are guilty of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>And this is not all, they will from thence
derive arguments to perſwade themſelves
they may with impunity, and ſafety tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
the Copy, and imitate thoſe Vices
they ſee in their Superiors, and take it
very ill, if they find themſelves at any time
miſtaken; and if the truth might be
ſpoken without offence, I ſhould aſcribe
much of the deluge of Impiety, Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
Intemperance, and other Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Our Times to this, as to its proper
cauſe.</p>
               <p>For how can a Juſtice of Peace ſend
a man to the Stocks for Drunkenneſs, when
he is hardly well recovered of his laſt
Debauch, or puniſh a man for Prophane
Swearing, with forty Oaths in his mouth?
I could eaſily run this thro all the reſt, if
it were fit to do it.</p>
               <p>This too renders our Gentry Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
for the inferior people will ever En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
the ſplendor of their Wealth, if they do
not ſeem to deſerve it by their Prudence
and Virtue.</p>
               <p>And this too weakens our Government,
by abating that Honour which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary for its preſervation, and
gives too often the hearts and affections of
men, to thoſe that have no right to them,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56345:26"/>
and who imploy that Advantage to the
ruine of thoſe that have.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, if we are not reſolved to ruine
our Selves and our Families for ever, and
to become the moſt miſerable, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
of all men, we muſt forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
the Antient <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bravery, and
win the hearts of the People by Juſtice,
Chaſtity, Temperance, Courage and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
to a due Eſteem of us.</p>
               <p>And to this let us add a ſolid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
Piety, which may ſhine forth in
our Lives and Converſations with that
Luſter, that none may be able to doubt, or
diſpute the truth of it, and this, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe will entail that Glory, our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
left us, upon our Poſterity, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Monarchy, that gave it to us,
from a Second ruine; they that honour
God ſhall be honoured, and they that
diſhonour him ſhall be lightly regarded.</p>
               <p>But however, let all that are ſet up for
Magiſtrates as Lights upon a hill, be ſure
to ſet a good Example, and if not for the
ſake of Virtue, yet out of pure fear of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
avoid all thoſe Vices which render
them, and their Offices Contemptible.</p>
               <p>3. It is not only fit the Juſtice of the
Peace ſhould be a man of a Competent
Eſtate, and a Good Reputation, but of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56345:26"/>
Learning and a Good Education too.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Learning,</hi> I do not underſtand the
Utmoſt degree of it, nor all thoſe Parts
neither that may be of great uſe to men
of other Imployments, but ſuch a degree
of <hi>Learning</hi> as may fit a Man for Civil
Converſation, and the diſpatch of buſineſs,
and eſpecially ſuch Knowledg in the Laws
and Cuſtoms of <hi>England,</hi> as may preſerve
him from great and frequent Miſtakes.</p>
               <p>The Age we live in is full of Learning,
and the great Plenty of Books that come
every day into the World, have fallen ſo
thick in all places, that they have not
eſcaped the Soft Hands of Ladies, nor the
Hard fiſts of Mechanicks, and Trades-men,
and every man affects to ſeem well read
in Books, tho he hath not had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to converſe much with men; and
therefore if a Juſtice of Peace be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
well qualified in this Point, he
will ſometimes diſcover it, and that will
(if it have no worſe effect) betray him to
the Contempt of thoſe, who ought to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and reſpect him for his Place.</p>
               <p>But if he be ignorant of the Laws and
Cuſtoms of <hi>England</hi> in that vaſt variety of
buſineſs that belongs to him, he will never
be able to go thro with it, but with great
fear, or hazard of Miſtaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56345:27"/>
And being as ſubject to the force of the
Laws as other men, he will ſometime or
other meet with thoſe who will revenge
his Miſtakes with worſe then bad lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and ſeek a reparation out of his
Eſtate for the Errors of his Office.</p>
               <p>No man is born a Scholar, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what ever Learning a Man hath, muſt
ſpring from Education, and together with
it, for the moſt part, Civility and good
Behaviour is, or ought to be delivered,
which takes off that Natural Roughneſs
and Aſperity, which makes men unfitting
to converſe with others, much more to
govern them; and they that have not had
the happineſs to meet, or imbrace this,
ſhould do well not to Expoſe their unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
Humours, and Manners to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of others; who yet may be very
uſeful men in other Places.</p>

               <p>I Have hitherto conſidered the Juſtice
of Peace no further than, as a Man
and a Gentleman. But Bleſſed be God
for it, <hi>England</hi> is a Chriſtian Country, and
one of the beſt Parts of the Catholique
Church too, and therefore not only the
Natural, and Civil Capacities, and Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of Men are to be conſidered, when
Magiſtrates are to be choſen, but their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
too, and moſt Eſpecially.</p>
               <p>By this I do not mean in this place
whether they are Proteſtants, or Papiſts,
Phanaticks or men, who love the Church;
(tho I ſhall Conſider of this in due time,)
but whether they be good Chriſtians. For
many men account it an honour to them,
and a piece of good breeding, to Expreſs no
more reverence for God, and Religion, than
they do for a forſaken Miſtreſs, to whom
they pretend to have made Love only out
of Ignorance in their Youth, for want of
underſtanding better things.</p>
               <p>I do not intend neither in this place to
make an Exact Deſcription of the ſeveral
parts of Devotion and Religion, but I only
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56345:28"/>
conſider thoſe parts of it, which fit a man
for Government, which I humbly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
are theſe.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A Due Veneration of God.</item>
                  <item>2. A Love for his Service in himſelf, and
others.</item>
                  <item>3. A Good Eſteem for his Miniſters.</item>
                  <item>4. An Earneſt deſire of the Salvation of
all under his Care, and Charge.</item>
               </list>
               <p>As God is the Fountain of all Power, and
the Author of all Government, So he is
the Supream Governour, and Preſerver of
it, and by his Providence diſpoſes the
hearts of Men, as he thinks fit, and in his
Juſtice, and Mercy makes Retribution to
them according to their Deſerts, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
his Eyes are ever upon Princes and
Magiſtrates, to Reward them if they do
well, to Puniſh them if they do amiſs, and
abuſe the Power which he hath given them
for the good of Men, and his own Glory.
And thoſe men that have this Senſe of
him deeply imprinted in their hearts, will
ever have a great Veneration for him, and,
as occaſion ſerve, expreſs it by due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
that not only their Actions
(which are viſible to men) but the moſt
ſecret Motives of them, that lie out of the
reach of their Eyes, are open to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:56345:28"/>
Thoſe who Thus Reverence God ſhall
be ſure to have his Providence watching
always over them, to protect them in all
dangers, and direct them in all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
And he will by it ſtrike that aw and
fear of them into the hearts of the People,
that ſhall keep them in better Obedience
than all the force in the World will do
without it; and this will render their
Government Eaſy, and their Actions Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous.</p>
               <p>But on the Other ſide, how can any
man have the impudence to expect either
Protection, or Aſſiſtance from God, when
he knows at the ſame time, that he hath
not any reſpect in his heart for him?</p>
               <p>Nor in truth do this ſort of men do it,
but truſt wholly to their own Wit, and
Power, which always in the End deceives
them, and leaves them to the Scorn, and
Contempt of the World, God in his Juſtice
making this frequently the Puniſhment of
their Impiety againſt him.</p>
               <p>All men, that have any Senſe know it
ſo neceſſary that the People ſhould have
ſome Religion, and a great Opinion that
their Governours are Pious, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it there will be no poſſibility of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, that they who have expreſſed
no inward Veneration for it, have owned
a belief that it was a Crafty Invention
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56345:29"/>
Juggled up betwixt the Prieſts, and the
Princes of the World, to <hi>Keep the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in aw;</hi> which, tho it is falſe, yet it ſhews
at the ſame time, that theſe men are of
opinion, that it would be difficult, if not
impoſſible, to keep the People in a due Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
without it.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Machiavel</hi> would not have his
<hi>Lewd Prince</hi> without the opinion of <hi>Piety,</hi>
however wicked he really was. Now if
this baſe Hypocriſie be of ſo great uſe in
Government, which is deſtitute of the
bleſſing of God, and liable to be looked
thro Every moment, of what Uſe muſt
ſolid ſober <hi>Piety</hi> be, which will ſhine forth
in all that a man doth, or ſpeaketh, and
procure at once the Love, and Favour of
God and Man?</p>
               <p>2. This <hi>Reverence</hi> of God is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by a great, and conſtant Care to
<hi>Serve, and Worſhip</hi> him both Publickly in
the Church and Family; and Privately in
the Cloſet: for God is ſo great a <hi>Being,</hi>
that Nothing we can do but this, is of any
uſe to him, he ſtands in no need of us nor
of our Service, any further then as it tends
to our own good here, and hereafter; and
therefore it is ridiculous to pretend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there is a God, and live Wickedly,
without any regard to his Service, nay
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56345:29"/>
prate Fooliſhly, and Atheiſtically in all
Companies, as ſome do.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Juſtice of Peace</hi> of all men is to
be moſt religiouſly Careful to perform his
Duty, becauſe the Eyes of all are upon
him, and they will be ſure to follow his
Example if ill, and the Inconvenience will
not end there neither; they will within
a While revenge all their Piques againſt
him, which will be many, with Stories of
his Impiety, and Negligence, and from
thence argue, That he is a man of no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
the Conſequence of which is, That
he is not Maſter of any honour, or honeſty;
and ſo this diſhonour will at laſt fall upon
himſelf, and end in contempt.</p>
               <p>Nor doth his Care like, that of Private
men end, in his Family, tho it were well
if ſome extended it but ſo far, but he muſt
take care that all under his Juriſdiction do
it; For ſo much is <hi>England</hi> degenerated
from its Ancient Devotion, by reaſon of
the Diviſions amongſt us, that without
this, not onely the <hi>Conventicle,</hi> but the <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi>
will be better furniſhed, than the
Church; if Care be not taken by them
that are in Authority to Prevent it by a
Severe Search, and Puniſhment of theſe
Miſcreants.</p>
               <p>Nay, to that height of Impiety are we
grown, that if We truſt to the Oaths of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56345:30"/>
them, that are to inform us, even Perjury
ſhall be imploy'd to delude us, and the
Law; a ſtrange Religion this is in the mean
time, to make uſe of the Worſt of Crimes
to protect them, who pretend to be the
Children of God, from Temporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and with them, and for their ſakes,
all that will run into Debauchery. But
ſo it is, and nothing but the Care of the
Magiſtrate can prevent it; and if he be
not diligent to do his duty herein, he muſt
anſwer it to God, and Man.</p>
               <p>It is not many Years ſince a War raiſed
by theſe Religious men on that pretence,
deſtroyed our King, and brought our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
into the baſeſt Slavery, that ever fell
upon them; they may, if they pleaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this ſhall never happen again; but
if it doth, they can thank no body but
themſelves: and I am ſure they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expect reaſonably any Aſſiſtance
from God, nor Pity from Men, if it ſhould
be otherwiſe, becauſe they might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
it if they would.</p>
               <p>3. That men that have no regard for
God, and his Service, ſhould ſhew no Eſteem
for the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> is no great wonder; the
Conſequence is unavoidable: And as this
proceeded at firſt from the Other, So it
may be a good Means to Cure the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56345:30"/>
to teach the People not only to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God, and his Sanctuary, but to <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
his <hi>Prieſts;</hi> and here the Magiſtrate
may Contribute very much by his Example,
and Authority.</p>
               <p>But then this Reverence is not due to
all, who call themſelves Miniſters; there
are too many that are crept in amongſt us,
who are the Miniſters of Satan, Sowers of
Sedition, and Upholders of Schiſm, the
leſs the Magiſtrate reverences them, the
better it will be for him.</p>
               <p>But there is one Sort of Kindneſs too
commonly ſhewn to Clergy-men, that I
wiſh they would lay aſide; and that is,
their Inviting them to their Drinking-Meetings,
and almoſt forcing them, when
there, to pledge all the Healths, and go
to the Bottom of the Glaſs too at every
Round.</p>
               <p>I cannot imagine where the Pleaſure of
this lies, the Wine would be as eaſy, the
Company might be as brisk, and the Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
as pleaſing, if the Chaplain and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Miniſter
were Viſiting the Sick, or
Studying to improve himſelf. Nor can I
think they pretend to pleaſe God Almighty
by it, whileſt they render his Service con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
and the Prieſthood odious, and
infamous: For my part, I cannot believe
this can proceed from any other, than the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56345:31"/>
Devil, becauſe it ſerves no bodies turn but
his, and the Enemies of Our Church; and
I have ever obſerved, the Atheiſt, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
to be moſt guilty of it.</p>
               <p>The beſt honour that can be ſhewn to
a Clergy-man, is to remember he is more
immediately related to God, and out of a
due reſpect to his Character, to curb
thoſe little irregularities which at another
time a man might fall into, and indeed
nothing is more contrary to Virtue, and
Sobriety, than the Attempting to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch
them, whoſe Preſence ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
us from Exceſſes, and no Vice expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
them more then Inſobriety to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Rabble, and other lewd Men,
and certainly God will accordingly ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reckon with thoſe who thus diſhonour
him in his Miniſters, and beyond all other
men with Magiſtrates, if they be guilty of
it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have a ſort of men who
pretend to be deſcended from <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
and wear Green Turbans, to diſtinguiſh
them from the reſt, and if at any time
they happen to offend any of the other
<hi>Turks,</hi> they approach theſe Children of
their Profit with great reſpect, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
firſt very reverently taken off the
green Turban, and laid it by; they then
bang the Man without Mercy, or Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56345:31"/>
but we never hear they endeavour
to draw them into any thing Contrary to
their Law.</p>
               <p>4. The Ultimate End of all Religion,
is the attainment of the happineſs of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Life, and all that can be any way
ſubſervient to that end, ought to be ſo
uſed. And for this end did God Almighty
inſtitute all humane Society, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alſo, and hath ever ſince preſerved
them from Ruin. So that he Expects from
every Perſon that is placed in any degree
of Honour, a more immediate Care, and
Concernment for the Salvation of their
inferiors; and he that doth beſt diſcharge
his duty in this reſpect, may Expect to
meet the beſt Recompence from God here,
and hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grotius</hi> hath proved this ſo well, that I
will not attempt to do it after him, but
refer the Reader for that, to his Piece of the
<hi>Power of Magiſtrates in Sacred Affairs,</hi>
and purſue the Concluſion, of bringing
it as much as may be into practice. It is
certain then, nothing can be more accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God Almighty, than this; and his
Bleſſing is the beſt Reward any man can
pretend to, and the onely one which almoſt
a Juſtice of the Peace can Expect, and
which is really worth his thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56345:32"/>
There is nothing in the Next place will
ſo effectually leſſen his Cares, and his Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
as this; for if ever he can bring men
to a true ſenſe of this, they will afterwards
be eaſily governed, and it will make his
Office Acceptable and Delightful to them,
and his very Chaſtiſements will be thought
<hi>Kindneſſes,</hi> and be well reſented.</p>
               <p>But if men ſhould prove unreaſonable,
yet God would certainly undertake for
him and protect him from their Violence,
and reward his Virtue too, with the <hi>Euges</hi>
of a <hi>Well done thou good and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
and he ſhould thereby aſſure his
own Salvation however.</p>

                  <p>HAving thus diſpatched thoſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Qualifications I did propoſe
to ſpeak of, I come in the Next
place to ſpeak of thoſe Moral Indowments,
without which the other cannot well be
Suppoſed to be; the firſt of which I ſhall
mention, is a Prudent, and Wife Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of all his Affairs.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Reaſon</hi> diſtinguiſheth a Man from a
Beaſt,<note place="margin">Prudence.</note> So this <hi>Prudence</hi> is it which Exalts
one man above another, and directs him
not onely to what is juſt, but to what is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56345:32"/>
fit. <hi>Juſtice</hi> teacheth a man to give every
man his due, and <hi>Prudence</hi> directs him to
do it Seaſonably, and when, and where to
uſe Clemency, or Severity, as there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for it.</p>
                  <p>And in Executing all Penal Laws, this
is of great and dayly uſe, and makes thoſe
Laws a Bleſſing, or a Plague to men; and
indeed he that always imploys the utmoſt
of his Power, will ſometimes uſe the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Law againſt the equity of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prudence</hi> will alſo make his proceedings
Safe, and Regular, ſo that he ſhall not fear
to reflect upon what he hath done, nor
others to approach him, when he is to do
them, when they know before-hand, what
they may Expect from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prudence,</hi> and due Care in him to Search
every thing out that comes before him in
the Courſe of Law, will prevent his being
deceived, and the Coſequences of it, his
injuring others by that deception.</p>
                  <p>Next to Prudence I place <hi>Patience</hi> and
<hi>Induſtry,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Patience.</note> without which he can never
hope to attain his End, he muſt not expect
that either Party will at firſt frankly, and
ingenuouſly repreſent the truth of things
to him, one party will ſpeak a little too
much, and another a little too little, and by
this, and other Arts ſo diſguiſe the thing,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56345:33"/>
that, if he be not a man of more, than Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Patience, and Induſtry to Search it
out, he will be in great danger of Doing
great injuſtice.</p>
                  <p>Nor will the putting Parties always to
their Oaths do it, for many men have ſo
little ſenſe of them, that it is almoſt all
one to lie, and forſwear themſelves; but
yet giving them time, and croſs-Examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, or putting them one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
the truth will ſometimes appear
thro all their diſguiſes, and will well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
the loſs of a mans time if at laſt
he be enabled thereby to do Juſtice, and
promote Truth, and Honeſty amongſt
men.</p>
                  <p>But on the Other Side, the impatient
man is at the End of his buſineſs, before
he is well entred into it, and by making
too much haſt, is the longer before he can
end it; a great man uſed to ſay, <hi>Stay;
little, and we ſhall have done the ſooner;</hi>
and for the moſt part over-haſty Sentences
come to a review, by appeal, or otherwiſe,
and then a man's folly is diſcovered in the
face of the Country.</p>
                  <p>I would fain know of any man that ſits
in the Seat of Juſtice, how he would take
it, to have a Caſe of his own hudled up by
another man, without due Examination of
the thing and its Circumſtances, and ſo it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56345:33"/>
may be meet with diſappointment, and
diſgrace, where he did leaſt Expect it; and
when he hath once thought Seriouſly of
it, let him do, as he thinks ſit.</p>
                  <p>But it is not a dull Patience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Active <hi>Induſtry,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Induſtry.</note> that will do the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
he that ſtorms and rages may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
hit upon the right Caſe, and perhaps
more frequently than he, that neither
takes Care to enform himſelf of the Law
before-hand, nor of the fact at the hearing,
but hears with as little care, and unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as if he had nothing to do with it;
ſuch lazy men are totally unfit for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſhould be laid aſide, as faſt, as
they can be diſcovered, or rather be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
from ever coming into Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>But there is another Sort of Men, that
are as much too Active, and endeavour to
Search into things before the time, and
without any Neceſſity; and this ſometimes
brings great Miſchiefs upon them, for
which they are not much pityed.</p>
                  <p>Next to Induſtry,<note place="margin">Meekneſs.</note> 
                     <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and Humility
deſerve the Place, tho ſome men ſeem to
think the contrary, and that no Virtues leſs
become a Magiſtrate; The Character of
<hi>Moſes</hi> was, That he was the <hi>Meekeſt</hi> Man
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56345:34"/>
upon Earth yet no man ever knew better,
than he, how to reſcue himſelf, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
his Place from Contempt; and no
man ever had greater reaſon to carry it
with a high hand, who had God's Viſible
Preſence always with him to Countenance
him, his Miraculous Power to Defend him,
his Infinite Wiſdom to Direct him.</p>
                  <p>Rough, and rude Language never did
any man's buſineſs, nor ever will; they
may be feared, and hated more than other
men, who uſe it, but that will as often hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as help them. And when it is once
Known, men will either not regard it, or
contrive how to make their Advantage of
it, by inflaming the Angry Indiſcreet man
to ſuch a height, that he ſhall do, and ſay
he knows not what, or by Flattery, and
Aſſentation draw him to the quite Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Extreme. So that if in the End he do
Juſtice, it ſhall be by Chance.</p>
                  <p>When a Man is Kindly, and Civilly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it ſoftens him into repentance, and
makes him aſhamed of his offence, and
that diſpoſeth him to <hi>Amendment,</hi> and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
for time to come; and he that ſo
reforms but one man, has done a greater
work than he that Chaſtiſeth many; and
what ever the Event be, the Party goes
away well Satisfied with the Juſtice and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56345:34"/>
Candor of his Judge, which may work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him afterwards, tho it do not at the
preſent.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I never underſtood where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the greatneſs of calling a man, <hi>Sirrah,</hi>
and <hi>Rogue,</hi> at firſt ſight, lay. It is full as
eaſy to call him by his Name, or <hi>Friend,</hi>
and give him an aſſurance, that you are not
his Enemy, nor have any prejudice againſt
him; and then 'tis ten to one, if he do not
deal ingenuouſly with you, and tell you
the truth at firſt, and ſo ſave you the pains
and hazard of ſearching it out; and I
have ſeen many men ſo wrought upon by
it, as to prevent the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and Condemn
themſelves willingly to ſuffer the Penalty
of that Law, they had imprudently broken,
if it run not too high.</p>
                  <p>But on the Other Side, ill uſage doth
but harden men, and make them aſcribe
what they ſuffer rather to the ill Nature,
and Diſpoſition of the Magiſtrate, than
their own deſerts.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there is nothing that diſcovers
a man's mean Extraction, and ill breeding,
ſo much as ill Language; and it is a foul
diſgrace to a Magiſtrate, to ſeem to have
ever kept Leud, Mean Company, where
only rude Language is to be learnt.</p>
                  <p>The Sum of all is, it can never do any
good; and will certainly do much hurt,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56345:35"/>
and therefore is moſt carefully to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by every man that would preſerve his
Reputation, and do good in his place, and
the reſt are not worth the Inſtructing.</p>
                  <p>But yet neither is it fit to Countenance
ill men in their Villany, and Wickedneſs,
for that is to encourage inſtead of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and puniſhing them; but then let the
reproof be rational, and grave, ſuch as may
work more upon their reaſons, than fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and to it add the Severity of the Law,
and make them feel you are in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
with them; and this will make a man
more feared, and revered than Loud
Words without it. And to me it ſeems to
be a double puniſhment, firſt to Vent my
Fury in bad Language, and then to inflict
the Puniſhment of the Law upon him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pride</hi> is yet a worſe fault in a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
than <hi>Paſſion;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Humility.</note> for ſome men are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
paſſionate, but few men are Naturally
proud, and inſolent; and thoſe who are
ſo, are of all others not fit for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy.</p>
                  <p>One of the Worſt effects of <hi>Pride</hi> is,
to render a man uncapable of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and then be his abilities what they
can be, he muſt <hi>Needs</hi> fall into great Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;
no man can carry all the Laws of
<hi>England</hi> in his head, and always truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56345:35"/>
them without miſtaking. And then
if the man ſcorns the Informations of his
Equals, or Inferiors, he muſt Anſwer for his
Error, as the Effect of his Will. Whereas
if he Humbly ſeeks, and Meekly imbraceth
better advice, thô at laſt he miſtakes, he ſhall
be pitied by God, and Man, and is ſure to
ſave his Reputation, and the Comfort of
having done the beſt he could to prevent
the misfortune.</p>
                  <p>But a Magiſtrate is not only to regard
the Law, but the Fact; and this the wiſeſt
of Men muſt learn from others, who were
preſent, and took Notice of it. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Quality, and Number of the
Witneſſes is the thing more, or leſs to be
believed. And if a man will in his Price
Suppoſe he knows this, when indeed he
doth not, or believe he takes it right, when
he miſtakes the Matter, or the Witneſſes,
and will not ſuffer them to reinform and
direct him, he muſt needs do great Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
in the Concluſion, tho he Mean it
not. And he muſt anſwer for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Soloman</hi> ſaith, <hi>Only by Pride cometh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi>
Prov. 13. 10. And ſo it ever is,
Pride makes a man more apt to Miſtake,
and at the ſame time ſhuts the door upon
him, ſo that he cannot find the way out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
this makes him ſet himſelf to defend
his Error, as if it were a Caſtle, and take it ill
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56345:36"/>
that any man ſhould endeavour to diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
him. So that he that Never ſo Kindly
offers to inform him better, is ſure to meet
not better reward than Contention, Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs,
and ill uſage for the preſent, and
Scorn and Revenge for the future, which
either provokes men to ſeek the Ruine of
theſe Inſolents, or to give them up to their
own folly till that do it, and God in his
Providence doth for the moſt part haſten
on the Calamity.</p>
                  <p>But on the Other Side, there is nothing
more Lovely in the Eyes of God, or Man,
than <hi>Humility;</hi> and the Greater the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, the Greater the Luſtre of it; it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
a man from many Errors, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logizeth
for the reſt ſo powerfully, that it
is ſcarce poſſible not to forgive him, and
the Honour of it too Aſcends from the
man to his Superiors, and they are the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thought of for his ſake. It makes a
Government acceptable to the People, and
ſtifles Diſcontents (the Seeds of Rebellion)
in their infant ſtate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sobriety,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sobriety.</note> and <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> are two Virtues
that ſeem at firſt ſight, perhaps, more to
reſpect the Perſon, that is maſter of them,
than his Place; but yet they have for all
that a great influence upon the other, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the firſt of them. By which I Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56345:36"/>
Temperance in Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Intemperance</hi> hath Naturally ſome very
ill effects upon men, which indiſpoſe them
for Government. As firſt, it takes off the
Briskneſs, and Vivacity of Mens Minds,
and renders them dull, and heavy, and unfit
for buſineſs. Yet he that is to judge others,
will always ſtand in Need of the greateſt
of his Abilities, as I have proved before.
And therefore, if he be not ſo far in Love
with Temperance, as to preſerve his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
always in their Natural vigor, he
hath thereby unmanned himſelf; and it
will not be fit to ſet the Beaſt to Govern
others, when he is thus degraded by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Intemperance</hi> diſcharges the
guards, that <hi>Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Sobriety</hi> uſually
keep men under, and they become heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of all things, neither conſidering nor
caring whether they do Right, or Wrong,
Juſtice, or Injuſtice; as indeed how can an
intemperate Man, whileſt his blood is in a
ferment, be able to Conſider prudently
of any thing. All that can be ſaid for it,
is, That they are not always ſo; but tho
they be not, yet if a man is frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate,
it will in time change the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>
of his Blood, and Spirits, when he is not
actually diſtempered with a late <hi>Debauch,</hi>

at leaſt to ſuch a degree, as will make him
incapable of that curious Senſe, which is
requiſite in many Caſes for the finding that
truth, which is concealed from him, with
much Artifice, and Induſtry.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Juſtice of the Peace</hi> his principal
Care is to provide for the Poor; for he is
the only Perſon, to whom their laſt reſort
is, who have neither means, nor abilities
of Complaining to the Superior Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.
Now how can that Man be Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of their Miſeries, who is almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<hi>Gorged</hi> to the height, and is inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of all other Inconveniences, but thoſe
that ſpring from <hi>Satiety,</hi> and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
'Tis true, theſe are not leſs than
the other, but yet they totally render a
man uncapable to Underſtand and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them. It was the <hi>Rich mans</hi> faring
deliciouſly every day, that made him think
ſo little of <hi>Lazarus</hi> at his Gate, till the Tables
were turn'd, and then it was too late. And
Great Men would do well to remember his
<hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> in time, and abate ſomething
even of their Lawful Pleaſure here, that
they may be Excuſed from Suffering with
him hereafter.</p>
                  <p>To all this Add, what I have remarked
already, the irreſiſtible force of ill Example,
and the bad Effect it will have upon the
Government, by introducing Poverty, if
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56345:37"/>
it be not puniſhed in the inferior people,
and reproach and hatred, if theſe or ſuch
like Magiſtrates do it; and a man would
think a Small degree of Ingenuity might
prevail upon them to lay aſide their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,
or their Office, and not keep
two things ſo totally inconſiſtent each
with other.</p>
                  <p>Much of what hath been ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Temperance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chaſtity.</note> may be Applyed, and
is Naturally true of <hi>Chaſtity</hi> too; but I
have this further to ſay for it, The <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Nation is Naturally Chaſt, and all that
foul ſpreading uncleanneſs, which hath of
late over-run this Iſland, is of a foraign Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.
And it may be a great queſtion,
Whether it is a greater Infamy to a People
to forſake its Antient and Natural Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
or to imbrace foraign and Exotick
Vices? But there is no queſtion at all
whether this baſe uncleanneſs hath not
been propagated by the Contagion of ill
Example, and deſcended from the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to the Commonalty; and I have
known when Complaints have been
brought by Wives, againſt their Husbands
for Keeping <hi>Miſſes,</hi> when they were ſcarce
able to find Competent bread for their
own Families. The more have they to
anſwer for, who ſet them the ill Example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:56345:38"/>
This Crime is ever attended with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
and when it grows general, the
Poverty becomes ſo too; and ſuch Lewd
men can neither bear Want, nor betake
themſelves to any honeſt Courſe for the
redreſſing of it, but generally turn beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,
Thieves, Whiggs, Knights of the poſt,
and take up other ſuch infamous Courſes
as Naturally tend to the deſtruction and
imbroylment of our Government.</p>
                  <p>Moſt commonly thoſe who follow this
ill Courſe Long, are at one time or
other Snapt with that Filthy Diſeaſe.
And it is very rarely ſeen that they are
ſo far recovered out of it, as to have
afterwards any Children that Live, and are
healthy. So it tends apace to depeople us
who are already Exhauſted by <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
the <hi>Weſtern Plantations,</hi> and Leave us in
the next Generation, a prey to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
                  <p>All which are ſtrong Reaſons to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
heartily the baniſhing of this New
riſen <hi>Peſt,</hi> and ſhould make all Magiſtrates
diſcountenance, and puniſh it to the utmoſt
rigour; and above All things to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
careful, that they do not by their
Words, or Actions give the People occaſion,
to think, or ſuſpect they have any Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for it.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſome Juſtices of the Peace, if they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56345:38"/>
are to Examine an unfortunate Woman
about the Father of a <hi>baſe</hi> Child, will
deſcend to ſuch minute Circumſtances,
and behave themſelves ſo Extravagantly in
the mean time, as if they took much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in the inquiry, and Meant to make
the Criminal uncurable, by Extirpating
that Natural Modeſty, that might have
Cured her. Such men neither regard God
who is invoked by the Oath to be preſent,
nor the dignity, and honour of their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and do effectually teach inſtead of
Correcting the Crime.</p>
                  <p>I have Placed in the rear of all <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi>
and <hi>Honeſty</hi> in the Execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
tho they will deſerve to have been
the two firſt; but I hope by placing them
in the Concluſion, they will Leave the
ſtronger impreſſion on the Mind of the
Reader.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Courage</hi> is ſo neceſſary a Qualification
in Magiſtrates,<note place="margin">Courage.</note> that God himſelf never
omits it in his Charges to them; and
there is good cauſe for it. For they are
ſometimes to deal with Men Equal to
themſelves in all things, and at others
with their Superiors, and as the Nature
of Mankind ſtands, may juſtly fear hard
uſage for doing but their Duty. And yet
we have another difficulty that will try
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56345:39"/>
the moſt daring: we live in a factious Age,
and a Divided Nation, and a Magiſtrate
muſt ſometimes diſoblige not only ſingle
perſons; but great Bodies of Men united
for the carrying on ill deſigns. And we
have before our Eyes inſtances of many
great Families, that have been ruine or
impoveriſhed within the Memory of Man,
for their Loyalty, and Honeſty, and too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have Conſidered the ſame may happen
again; and this hath made the difficulty
the greater, by les'ning the Number of
them, that ſhould have overcome it.</p>
                  <p>But yet would men conſider Seriouſly
of it, this will never juſtify their Puſila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,
who have refuſed to ſerve the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
or not performed their Duty out of
Cowardiſe. For God himſelf hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſtand by them, and protect them in
the diſcharge of their Duty. <hi>Ye ſhall not
Reſpect perſons in judgment; but you ſhall
hear the Small as well as the Great; you
ſhall not be afraid of the face of Man, for
the judgment is Gods,</hi> Deut. 1. 17. So he
is pleaſed to own the Act, and is bound to
protect his own Miniſter, and he may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
rely upon him that he will; for he
hath ingaged his Veracity for it, whoſe
Power no Faction, how formidable ſoever,
can Maſter.</p>
                  <p>And yet if he ſhould Suffer a man to be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56345:39"/>
perſecuted for doing his Duty, Even that
is no ſuch diſmal thing, as is repreſented by
fancy, and deluſion; but this ſubject hath
been ſo Excellently treated of by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of <hi>Jovian</hi> in his <hi>Concluſion,</hi> that for
brevity ſake, I will refer the Reader to
it.</p>
                  <p>Of Evils, the leaſt is to be choſen; and
in the ſtate things are, we muſt ſubmit
our Selves, and Families, as Eternal Slaves
to theſe Factions, or defend the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt them, by a Couragious Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of our Laws. We have tryed their
Mercy, and Clemency, and found <hi>Solomon's</hi>
Obſervation true, <hi>The tender Mercies of
the Wicked are Cruel.</hi> We have felt the
Smart of being Loyal, and if we were ſo
treated for being obedient to the Laws of
God and Man, we may Expect as much
Mercy in other inſtances, as we pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>We have tried what could be done by
fair Courſes, and Conceſſions, and our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
tells us, nothing but an intire ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
at diſcretion will ſatisfie theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
Men; and this hath inſpired ſome
<hi>Beſieged Starved Places</hi> with a reſolution
to periſh bravely, but bleſſed be God we are
not upon ſuch terms yet with them. But
then this reproacheth our faint-hearted
Gallants, who dare not do their Duty
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56345:40"/>
whileſt they have the Advantage Clearly
on their Side.</p>
                  <p>The thing is indeed not only poſſible
but eaſie; for all Combinations againſt an
Eſtabliſhed Government, beſides the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, have the United Forces of
all good men againſt them; they are ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to many hazards, have no Authority
to Unite them, are, and ever will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful
each of other, and faithleſs too,
as occaſion ſerves, and one Paſſion prevails
upon another.</p>
                  <p>So that it is not Prudence, which makes
men timorous, but want of Conſidering
the Nature of things, together with Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
Diſtruſt of God, and Cowardize; and
if any man will aſpire to theſe Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and tamely purchaſe them with Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and Beggery, much good may his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
do him, and let no man envy his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                  <p>And as to the reſt, let them pluck up
their ſpirits, and with the Roſolution of
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, and Chriſtians bring under
this <hi>Hydra,</hi> this Many-headed Monſter,
and they may be aſſured the Event will
anſwer their Deſires, and will find that
the ſtrength of our Factions lies more in
our want of Wit and Will to Suppreſs them,
than in their own Ability to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
much leſs to bring under, and ruine
us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:56345:40"/>
But not only Combinations of Men, but
ſingle perſons have ſometimes over-awed
Magiſtrates, and made them not dare to
do their Duties; and here the fault is ſo
much the greater, as the Temptation is
leſs. For why ſhould a Juſtice of the
Peace, under the Protection of God, and
the Laws, fear a Wealthy Clown, or a
Ruffling Gentleman? Let him be but once
ſure what the Law, and the Matter of
Fact is, and he need not fear any man.</p>
                  <p>But, 'tis a great diſgrace to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
and a great diſhonour to Juſtice, to
have the Laws take none, but the poor
helpleſs offenders, whoſe very Innocence
may be eaſily trodden under foot, and the
great, and inſolent Offenders eſcape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Chaſtiſement. It were great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
rather to take the latter, than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
and tends more to the terror of ill
men.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that ſometimes theſe great
and rich Malefactors do find means by
their Wealth, and Friends to trouble a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of the Peace on ſome other pretence;
but this doth not often happen; God in
his Providence preventing it: and when
it doth, ought to be born, as other Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
which God ſends for Cauſes beſt
known to himſelf; and which, for the moſt
part, end very well for the Miniſter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:56345:41"/>
But on the Other Side, when a man
hath purchaſed their good will at the loſs
of his Reputation, by denying Juſtice, or
doing injury: he hath but rendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
more obnoxious to their injuries, by
ſhewing his fear of them, which makes
them yet more inſolent, and he hath made
God, and good men his Enemies to boot:
So that he is then become really miſerable,
and yet muſt Expect no bodies Pity, or
Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>So that all things Conſidered, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to truſt God, and rely on the Protection
of the Laws, and ſo to proceed to do our
Duty, without the leaſt Conſideration,
Whether the Party Complained of be a
Poor man, or a rich man, but according
to Gods Commandment, and Our Oath,
to do equal Right to both, which in all
probability will be as ſafe, and much more
honourable, and at laſt bring a man to
peace, according to that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,
Mark the perfect man, and behold the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right:
for the End of that Man is Peace,</hi>
Pſal. 37. <hi>v.</hi> 37.</p>
                  <p>There is another Fault, which is juſt
the oppoſite to this, and doth not ſo often
happen, yet ſometimes may out of too
much Pity, and Compaſſion, ill Placed,
and Worſe Expreſſed; and that is when
more regard is taken to the Poverty than
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56345:41"/>
Innocence of a man, contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Countenance
a poor man in his Cauſe,</hi> Exod. 23. 3. That
is, any further than there is Right, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for it.</p>
                  <p>I might perhaps not have mentioned
this, but that it hath been more frequent
here in <hi>England</hi> of late, than perhaps in
all the World beſides, Eſpecially as to our
Penal Laws; for every Townſhip with us
being bound to maintain its own poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
which way ſoever they become
ſuch; many men intereſt themſelves in
the Caſes of theſe People, and for fear
they ſhould become a Charge to the Pariſh,
connive at many of their Miſdemeanors, and
intercede with the Magiſtrates in others
for their non-puniſhment till for Want of
timely Correction for ſmall faults, and
thro hopes of impunity, they become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferably
Wicked, and are cut off by the
hand of Juſtice, or grow Inſolent, and are
a plague all the days of their Lives to the
Places in which they live. It is great pity
the power of inflicting Corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
inſtead of Pecuniary, ſhould not be
Extended further than it is, for that is the
way to meet theſe ſmall ill natured Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
As for Inſtance, Many of them
turn <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and never come at Church,
onely becauſe they are not able to pay
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56345:42"/>
Twelve pence for their abſence. And I
might inſtance in ſome other particulars,
but till this can be done, it is certainly
much better to run the Hazard of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
theſe men when they are reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than thus to ſuffer them to become
worſe, and worſe by impunity, till in the
End they become not only Extreamly
wicked, and troubleſome, but poor alſo, and
ſo the thing that was feared falleth upon
them, which might in likelihood have been
prevented by a timely Severity.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Honeſty,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Honeſty.</note> I underſtand that Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
Virtue, which in Scripture is call'd
an <hi>Honeſt</hi> and <hi>Good Heart;</hi> and includes
in it Sincerity in a man's <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Veracity,</hi> a ſtrong propenſion to do
good to all, and fair dealing, without fraud
or hypocriſie; which make a man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
Safe and Profitable, Eaſie and
Delightful, and was once the General
Temper of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, till Foraign
Vices, and the Laſt Rebellion altered it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sincere <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright dealing</hi> is an Excellent
quality in a private man,<note place="margin">Sincerity.</note> but ſo neceſſary
in a Magiſtrate, that without it, he will be
in danger to infect men, and make them
worſe, than they would have been, by
Converſing with them; for they will be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56345:42"/>
ſure to tranſcribe the Copy, and Out-do
it too; they will obſerve how he Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
and Deluded them, and they will
try how the ſame Arts may be made uſe of
another time, for their Advantage, againſt
him or any other Neighbour, as occaſion
ſerves, till they turn errant Knaves unfit
for humane Society, and good for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>But this Sort of Dealing is not onely
miſchievous, and hateful, but for the moſt
part unſucceſsful too; for men will ſoon
ſee thro the thin pretence, and diſcover
the inſincerity, that lurks behind it, and
then all their Care will be to Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it, and prevent the Cheat.</p>
                  <p>And where they cannot diſcover any
fraud deſigned, they will yet ſuſpect it,
and ſuch a man's Words will have no Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
with them; and as for his Actions,
they will Eternally, and reſtleſly turn them
and toſs them to, and fro in their Minds, to
find the Secret deſign of them, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Thouſand Surmiſes, and Jealouſies of
them, and in the mean time what ever
outward reſpect they pay him out of fear
or flattery, they will inwardly hate him,
and always ſtudy to defeat and Baffle him;
and this muſt needs make his Life uneaſie,
and unſafe, and his Actions unproſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:56345:43"/>
But on the Other Side, when a man is
Eſteemed an upright ſincere man, every
body will love and truſt him, and they will
interpret his Actions Favourably, and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly,
and what ever he doth, or ſaith to
them, will be regarded and revered; and
the more they try, the more willingly will
they truſt him, and rely upon his honeſty
as their beſt Security; and when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Bleſſing of God, and the Love
and Favour of Men, and good Succeſs to
Attend ſuch men, which very rarely ſail,
they will endeavour to be like them in
the One, that they may be ſo in the other
too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Veracity</hi> is a debt,<note place="margin">Veracity.</note> that all men who live
in Society ow each to others, our Souls
being not able to Communicate each with
others, by reaſon of the interpoſition of
our bodies, God hath given us ſpeech, as
a Means to Communicate our inward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
each to other for Our Mutual
Good, and Comfort.</p>
                  <p>But the Lyar perverts all theſe great
Benefits of Society, and turns them into
Poyſon, he thinks no man can ſee the
Contradiction, that is between his Thoughts
and Words, and from thence preſumes he
ſhall cheat his Neighbour, and give him
Chaſſ inſtead of Corn; but he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be deceived in the End; for all men
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56345:43"/>
have a Natural Logick, that will in time,
by Comparing one thing with another,
diſcover the Sophiſtry; and if they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
trap a man, they will never after
truſt or believe him.</p>
                  <p>Matters of Fact, and things that are
paſt, can never be made out but by teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
either by Writing, or Word of
Mouth; and According to the Credibility
of the Perſon that relates it, is the belief
Stronger or Weaker, that is bui't upon
that Teſtimony: So that here is another
great uſe of Speech, for when a man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the Doing, or Speaking of any
thing if he minds it, it leaves a Picture,
Impreſſion, or Repreſentation of the Words
and Things in his Memory, as in a Regiſter;
but then theſe Characters are viſible to
none but himſelf, and the uſe of Speech is
to repreſent them truly to others, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the man finds them; now the Lyar
in this inſtance plays the falſe tranſcriber,
fains things that he finds not there, and
changes and varies what he doth, Extends
it in ſome places, diminiſheth it in others,
is certain when he ſhould be doubtful,
and doubtful when he ſhould be certain,
and here and there interlaces Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Words, and Actions, of his own, and
then fathers them upon others, and all the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56345:44"/>
while relyes upon this ſingle ſecurity, That
no body, but himſelf can Search his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires,
and find out and prove the Cheat,
nay perhaps ſo often tells the Lie, that the
the falſe Story defaces the true, and at
length impregnates his fancy with a falſe
Conception, and he arrives at that height
of Folly as to deceive himſelf, and believe
his own lie to be a real truth.</p>
                  <p>And indeed for the moſt part the man
deceiveth none ſo much as himſelf; for by
one means or other, the Cheat is at one
time or other diſcovered, and very often
by himſelf, and his Complices; he that
tells a Story truly, is but like him that
reads a Paragraph carefully, which will be
the ſame, how often ſoever it be done;
but if he adds words of his own, and his
Memory fails, he will neceſſarily vary, and
obſerving men ſoon ſpy the diſagreement,
and diſcover the Cheat as plainly, as if they
ſtood behind him and ſaw every letter, as
well as he; and if he have Confederates,
it will be impoſſible to Concert before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
all the Circumſtances ſo minutely,
but that they will differ, and very often
Contradict one another.</p>
                  <p>And to all this muſt be Added, That as
God is a God of Truth, So he is the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
Enemy of Falſhood, and he is
the Searcher of Hearts, knows all things,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56345:44"/>
and is preſent at all places; <hi>his Eye-lids
try the Children of men,</hi> and he Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
their thoughts long before; and
amongſt the things that he hates, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates,
one is <hi>a falſe Witneſs that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Lies,</hi> Prov. 6. 19. And he hath aſſured
us, <hi>Chap. 19. v. 5. A falſe Witneſs ſhall not
be unpuniſhed, and he that ſpeaketh Lies
ſhall not Eſcape.</hi> And accordingly in his
Providence he frequently detects them;
and ſo if a man be not ſo fooliſh, as to think
he hath Wit enough to eſcape the Juſtice
and Providence of God, and the Watchful
Scrutiny of all thoſe men he converſes
with, (which is impoſſible) he muſt needs
Expect at one time, or other to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and then he will ſo far loſe his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
as not to be believed even when he
ſpeaks truth, and will (if no worſe betide
him) be hated and ſcorn'd of all men.</p>
                  <p>It befits Magiſtrates then, of all men, to
be very careful to preſerve their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
unſpotted from this Sin; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe the Law relies ſo much upon
them, that in many things their Teſtimony
is Concluding, and no man ſhall be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Contradict them. So that they are
intirely truſted with the Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of men; and the greater the Truſt,
the ſtronger the Obligation not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56345:45"/>
and the greater Infamy if they
do.</p>
                  <p>I include under the Name of <hi>Honeſty,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Beneficence.</note>
not onely <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Veracity,</hi> but <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence,</hi>
or a great deſire to do good to as
many as may be, which is an Excellent
Virtue in a private perſon. But ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary in a Magiſtrate, that it
will not be poſſible for him, without it, to
uſe his Power to that End, for which it
was given, the <hi>Good of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord</hi> Bacon <hi>ſaith very well in his</hi>
Eſſays, Power to do Good, is the true and
lawful End of Aſpiring. For Good Thoughts
(tho God accept them,) yet towards men,
are little better than good Dreams; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they be put in Act: and that cannot be
without Power, and Place, as the Vantage
and Commanding Ground. Merit and Good
Works, is the End of Man's Motion, and the
Conſcience of the Same is the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Man's reſt, <hi>Eſſay the XI. But this
Advantage of Place and Power is Naturally
apt to be corrupted in ill Natures, and to
degenerate into Inſolence and Violence,
and then it is like a Sword in the hand of
a Mad-man, terrible to all men that come
near him, and an inſtrument of miſchief.
Of ſuch men he ſaith a little before,</hi> Power
is a Curſe; for in Evil, the beſt Condition
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56345:45"/>
is Not to Will, the Second, Not to Can.</p>
                  <p>Now what can be more deplorable, than
for a man in Authority to be looked upon
as a Wild Beaſt, and to fill all places where
he cometh with fear and horror? to have
men approach him as they do a Viper,
with Caution, and a jealouſie of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured,
if they prevent it not. The conſtant
effect of which is hatred, in which the fear
of Miſchief ever ends.</p>
                  <p>But men approach thoſe that are ſamed
for much goodneſs, as they were Mortal
Gods ſent by the Great and Immortal God
into the World for the Good of Men; and
the Greater they are, the more Good they
expect and find from them, and are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and Angry with themſelves, if they
find they have deſerved, and feel
the contrary.</p>
                  <p>From ſuch as theſe no man need fear he
ſhall meet any other than fair Dealings,
without fraud, or hypocriſie. For he whoſe
higheſt Ambition is to do good, will have
an irreconcileable diſguſt to the other,
wherever he finds it. His Prudence will
ſet him above the Arts of Diſſimulation,
and make him ſcorn all Frauds, and Crafty
Deſigns, as ignoble and beneath him, things
which he can never ſtand in need of, and
would not uſe, if he did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:56345:46"/>
                     <hi>Honeſty</hi> is ſaid to be the beſt Policy;
and it Certainly is ſo: for if a man Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with his Superiors, it ſaves him the
trouble of Making many a hard ſhift, to
Excuſe, or Colour an ill Act, if with his
Equals, it begets him reſpect, and Wins
them to a Confidence in him; and from
his Inferiors it procures him Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.
To all which God commonly
adds his Bleſſing, and makes his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings
Proſperous; however, he is at
peace with himſelf, and ſuffers none of
thoſe Terrors of an Evil Conſcience, which
terrify other Men, when no other dare
accuſe, and Puniſh them; his Mind is quiet,
and Serene, and at reſt in all Events, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with what is paſt, and Unconcern'd

in God, and from men he doth not fear
that ill uſage, which he is not Conſcious

               <p>I Have now done with thoſe Moral
Qualifications, which I thought were
moſt Neceſſary to be diſcourſed of on this
Occaſion; And I come in the Next place
to ſome few Politick Conſiderations, which
I take to be abſolutely Neceſſary for the
good Execution of the Office of a Juſtice
of the Peace. Which are,
<list>
                     <item>A Competent Underſtanding of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of our Government, and Love
to it.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, Of the Nature and Temper
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> People, eſpecially thoſe
Under his Care.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, Of the Several <hi>Factions</hi> we
have amongſt us, and how to govern
them. Of all which I will diſcourſe
in Order.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>All the Governments that we meet with
upon Record, have been either by Single
Perſons, which are called <hi>Monarthies,</hi> or
by a Number of the better Sort, which
are ſtiled <hi>Ariſtocracies,</hi> or by the whole
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56345:47"/>
People, or their Repreſentatives, and from
thence are called <hi>Democracies,</hi> or <hi>Mixed</hi>
up of two or more of theſe, and are thence
called <hi>Mixed Governments,</hi> which, becauſe
they may be innumerable, take their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
from that Part of the Three I
have Mentioned, which is predominant in
the Compoſition. But I ſhall not Need
to be very Exact here, and therefore I ſhall
onely take Notice of two; <hi>Monarchies,</hi>
and <hi>Common-Wealths;</hi> which laſt do in
common ſpeaking include all thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
wherein many men have the
Supream Authority divided amongſt them
with Equal <hi>Power,</hi> and a Liberty of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monarchies</hi> have this Advantage, that
they are moſt Natural, and moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> were the Fathers of
Mankind, ſo they were the Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
in that Right: and to their Right
all the Princes in the World ſucceed, and
have the ſame Power they had, and ought
to Uſe it accordingly, as if they were the
Fathers of their Subjects. And their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ought again to pay them thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
that are due to their Fathers; the
ſame Love, Reverence, and Obedience, ſo
that Treaſon is an Unnatural<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Crime, and
Rebellion againſt a man's Prince, is flying
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56345:47"/>
in the face of his Father. Which no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocatin
on the Fathers ſide can juſtifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monarchy</hi> is not only the moſt Natural,
but the moſt Antient Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and moſt gerneral; look into all the
Parts of the World, and in the moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Times, you ſhall find they were Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by Kings; and this is Truth ſo
apparent in all Hiſtory, that I never met
with any Author of any Antiquity, that
contradicted it, nor I believe ever ſhall.
And amongſt all thoſe People that have of
late been diſcovered in <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
there is no other Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than Monarchy; and the ſame, and
onely that, is found in <hi>China,</hi> and all the
other Eaſtern Parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which have
been found out of late Years too; ſo that
it is very eaſie to find, and Name ſeveral
Nations who have lived under Kings ever
ſince the Flood, as the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
and many other; but it is impoſſible
to ſhew that Place, or People who have
been always Governed by a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
and as they have all ſprung out
of <hi>Monarchies,</hi> ſo all the Antient <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths</hi>
are long ſince ſwallowed up again
by <hi>Monarchies;</hi> and thoſe that remain are
in more fear of this, than of any other thing
whatſoever; which to me is a plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56345:48"/>
that Nature tends that way, which
may be repell'd, but cannot be extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>As it is the moſt Antient, and moſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Form of Government, ſo it is the,
beſt; all <hi>Commonwealths</hi> have either been
liable to Everlaſting internal Broyls, and
Commotions, Inſurrections, and Seditions,
or have been ſecured from them more by
the fear, and dread of the Power of their
Neighbours, than their own Conſtitution;
So <hi>Rome</hi> had no ſooner maſtered all her
Neighbours, and deſtroyed <hi>Carthage;</hi> but
ſhe fell into thoſe Wars at home, that
brought her under a Monarchy again: and
this was the fate of all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths,
ſo ſoon as ever they grew
rich, and powerful, they became inſolent
and unquiet at home, and troubleſome
abroad, and from thence fell into ſuch
Broyls, as made them a Prey firſt to the
<hi>Macedonian</hi> Princes, and then to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is obſerved, That all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
are forced to maintain themſelves
by much Injuſtice, and Ingratitude; it would
make a man loath the Name, to ſee how
baſely the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and other <hi>Grecians,</hi>
the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Carthagenians</hi> uſed their
Braveſt men, whom they commonly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56345:48"/>
to their Jealouſies in the End, leaſt
the Love of the People ſhould have Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
them to the Throne, and very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
without the leaſt cauſe given by them;
to their unthankful fellow Citizens. And we
have the like inſtances of a later date, but
I will ſpare thoſe few Commonwealths,
that are now in being.</p>
               <p>3. If a Commonwealth once degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
into Tyranny; and a Set of ill men
get the Power into their hands, 'tis ſcarce
ever reformed but with the ruine of the
Conſtitution; for thoſe ill men take care
to fill up all vacancies by men of the ſame
Faction and Temper to prevent oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
So the miſery of the Subject is as
immortal as the Senate. But in a <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
the death of a Prince in poſſeſſion,
gives them relief. As it is obſerved in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,
Hiſt. lib. 4. cap. 74. Vitia erunt, donec
Homiues: ſed ne<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> haec continua, et melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
interventu penſantur.</hi> As long as there
are men, there will be vices, but neither
will they be alwaies the ſame; and beſides
that, they will be Compenſated by the
Succeſſion of good men. The firſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all Forms of Government to feel
the Effects of Humane frailty; but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
he mentions, is only to be Expected in
Monarchy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:56345:49"/>
4. If a Commonwealth falls into a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
or Domeſtick War, or be very much
oppreſſed by internal Diſſentions, and
Factions, or an External force, they have
then no other means to ſave themſelves,
but the Submiſſion to a Temporary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch;
and of this the <hi>Romans</hi> may be
my inſtance, who in all ſuch Caſes choſe
a <hi>Dictator,</hi> who for the time was an Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Prince: and there was always found
a Neceſſity of ſomething like it in all the
reſt, tho they have another Name for it,
and at laſt the <hi>Romans</hi> fell into ſuch a ſtate,
that Nothing but their ſubmiſſion to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi>
could preſerve them from utter
ruine.</p>
               <p>For theſe and many other Cauſes, which
for brevity I omit, I have ever bleſſed
God that I was born in a Monarchy, and
a Subject to a Prince, who is ſettled in his
Throne by a long Succeſſion, and an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Right, ſo that no Mortal hath
any pretence againſt it.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Monarchies,</hi> ſome are Hereditary,
others are Elective; the former hath
many Advantages over the latter. As
firſt, That the Prince in poſſeſſion know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he ſhall be ſucceeded by his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
or near Kindred, is bound to ſeek the
Welfare, and procure the Love of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to the Utmoſt: whereas Princes that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56345:49"/>
have onely an Eſtate for life, are not ſo
careful in that particular, but uſe their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Advantage to the Enriching of their
private Families; or the Satiating their
thirſt after Pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Elective Kingdoms are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to many miſeries during the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum</hi>
which happens betwixt the Death
of one, and the Election of another Prince;
whereas in ours the King never dies, but
his laſt Breath conveys his Succeſſor to the
Throne, and leaves no ſpace for the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſing
of Factions, and the laying a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for Civil Wars, and the Competition
of Powerful, and Popular Men. So that I
will conclude with the Words of my laſt
cited Author, <hi>Minore diſcrimine Sumi
Principem, quam quaeri.</hi> There is leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in accepting, than chooſing a Prince.
And I cannot but think he that ſubmits
to the Providence of God in this caſe, is
in as fair a Way to be happy, as he that is
to truſt to the Prudence of a Company of
Factious great men.</p>
               <p>Some Kingdoms are Governed Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
and Arbitrarily, and others by Laws;
the firſt are liable to great hazards of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very ill treated, if a Prince of an ill
Temper, or little Prudence fall to their
ſhare. Our Princes have given us ſuch
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56345:50"/>
Security, as no other Nation hath; That
they will treat us well, They have Aſſured
us, that they will Levy no Taxes; but
what ſhall be freely Granted by us in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
That they will not Repeal any
Old, or Enact any New Laws, without the
ſame Conſent of their Subjects; That no
man ſhall be impriſoned long without a
Tryal; nor Tryed, and Condemned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Verdict of two Juries of Men of
the ſame, or a better quality. And tho our
Princes are not puniſhable for ill Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
yet all their Miniſters, and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
are. So that upon the whole Matter,
no Nation in the World is better Secured
than the <hi>English,</hi> from Extream oppreſſion,
and injury. We have a Set of Excellent
Laws in force, and are ſure to enjoy
them, till we are willing to part with
them; We have a Property in our Lands
and Goods, and can truly call them our
own, till we have forfeited them by our
own Miſdemeanor, and then we are ſure
of a fair Tryal, before the Law take them
away. Our Poor are Carefully, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provided for; in all urgent occaſions
We have Magiſtrates diſperſed all over the
Nation for our Security; and for the reſt,
our higheſt Courts are open four times in
the Year, where all men may have equal
Right, the Poor as well as the Rich; and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56345:50"/>
beſides, there come two of the Judges
twice in every Year into every County,
that if any man hath cauſe for it, he may
complain, and have Right done him. We
have four Seſſions in every Year, wherein
the Juſtices of the Peace, or a great part,
meet to determine what a few could not,
and by Appeals redreſs their Errors; and
there is not a Country Village but the
King hath an Officer in it to Secure our
Peace, and Apprehend Malefactors.</p>
               <p>Now a man would think ſuch a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as this ſhould be beloved by all
that knew, and had Lived in it; and
ſo it would without queſtion, if it were
not too ſtrict for ill men, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
upon their Neighbours Liberties, and
Fortunes, tho they pretend the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
And ſuch Men are not fit to be
truſted with any ſhare of the Government,
in order to promote their wicked purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>The Next thing neceſſary in a Juſtice
of the Peace, is a Competent Knowledg of
the Nature and Temper of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
People, eſpecially thoſe under his Charge.</p>
               <p>By the word <hi>People,</hi> I mean only thoſe
the Juſtice of Peace is to govern; for all
that are above that degree, are out of my
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56345:51"/>
Bounds, and need not be Conſidered by
me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>England</hi> being an Iſland, and lying Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to perpetual Changes of Winds, and
Weather, more than the Continent doth,
their Humours and Spirits are in perpetual
Motion; and this affects their Minds too,
and makes them very uncertain, and very
much given to Change, if thoſe that have
the Conduct of them, do not frequently
inculcate the danger of it, and ſeverely
puniſh thoſe that give occaſion to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of Commotions, that ſo this fear
may Counterballance this Natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Change.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood is very eaſily Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
and hard to be allayed, whileſt it is
in its fury. Eſpecially if it be inflamed with
Drink, and Exceſs, or exaſperated with ill
uſage, and Injuſtice. And that is the true
Reaſon why we need ſo many perſons to
<hi>Keep</hi> the <hi>Pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e</hi> amongſt them, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Laws to Secure it, and prevent Exceſs
in Drinking, and <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> which is the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of Quarrels, and the Nurſe of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.
And the great Care of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
ſhould be to Cure this, Firſt, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
all Menaces, or Threatnings, by
requiring Sureties of the Peace of them
that uſe them. Secondly, All Grievous
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56345:51"/>
Slanders, ſuch as tend to the Ruine of
mens Reputation and Livelihood, by Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of the <hi>Good Behaviour.</hi> Thirdly, All
Exceſs, by a Severe Execution of the Laws
againſt Tipling, and putting down thoſe
Alehouſes that ſuffer Diſorder, and Exceſs.
Fourthly, To be ſure not to give them any
occaſion to complain of Injuſtice, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
by an Exact Care to <hi>Keep to the
Rule of the Law,</hi> which will Juſtifie him,
and keep them quiet; for I have not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
but that they ſubmit patiently to
that Severity, which the Law impoſoth on
them, if they be once ſatisfied the Law is
ſo.</p>
               <p>3. What <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the <hi>Normans,</hi> is as true of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
If they be Governed Well, and Severely,
they are Valiant, and in great difficulties
Excel all other men, endeavouring to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
their Enemies: But if this be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they tear and deſtroy each others, for
they Love Rebellions, and Seditions, and
are ready for all ſorts of Miſchief. Let them
therefore be reſtrain'd with ſeverity, and
be forced by the Rein of Diſcipline to keep
the Path of Juſtice; for if this Wild Aſs
be ſuffer'd to go Unyoaked, they and their
Princes will be Overwhelmed with Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Confuſion; <hi>This</hi> (ſaith that Prince)
<hi>I have learned by much Experience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:56345:52"/>
4. But then they muſt be <hi>Governed
Well,</hi> that is, with Prudence, and Juſtice,
as well as with Severity; for it may be
there is no Nation under Heaven ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of <hi>Injury,</hi> and <hi>Wrong,</hi> as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
and whatſoever is not preciſely according
to Law, they will Eſteem ſuch, and when
occaſion ſerve, revenge it. But neither
can they bear too much Lenity, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
they grow inſolent, when they are
Flattered, and Courted, and never regard
thoſe that ſeem to fear them. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
therefore of the <hi>Conqueror</hi> is good, and
as fit for our Days, as if it had been given
but Yeſterday.</p>
               <p>5. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> are not more Couragious
in Viſible and Apparent Dangers, which
they never fear, than Timerous and Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of every thing they hear; the moſt
incredible ſilly Story in the World frights
them into Diſorder, and Confuſion, and,
without Examining the truth, or poſſibility
of the Report, they ruſh into Action, and
follow them that pretend to Lead them
out of thoſe difficulties; And of this we
had abundant Experience in the late Times,
and have lately had enough again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind
us of it; and herein the Care of the
Magiſtrate ſhould be, to puniſh ſeverely
the Spreaders of Libels, and falſe Reports,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56345:52"/>
and the Fomenters of Falſe deluſory fears,
and jealouſies.</p>
               <p>6. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> are very Religious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
and in the Times of Popery almoſt
ruined themſelves by their Liberality to
the Church, and Monaſteries; but the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of that being diſcovered at the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
they have ſince run to the other
Extream, and almoſt ruined the Church,
by tearing what they could from it; and
they are now as mad of running after eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
new Sort of Teacher, that pretends to
ſhew them an undiſcovered Way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as they were of the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryars</hi>
before; and this hath a miſchievous Effect
upon the State too, and will Eternally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
our ruine, till it be redreſſed by a
Conſtant, and Severe Execution of our
Laws againſt <hi>Conventicles,</hi> of which I ſhall
ſpeak more, when I come to Conſider our
Factions.</p>
               <p>7. In Antient Times the People were ſo
addicted to the Nobility, and fond of their
Gentry, that two or three diſcontented
Noblemen made nothing to bring an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
into the Field, and fight their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign;
but the Wars betwixt the Houſes
of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> having almoſt total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ruined, and Extinguiſhed the Antient
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56345:53"/>
Power of the Nobility. <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>7th</hi>
by Politick Laws. <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> by his
Violence, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
againſt the Great Men, and Condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centions
to the Populacy, have ſo turn'd the
Tide the other Way, that the People do
now as much Slight, and Undervalue them:
And to this the Factions in Religion have
contributed very much; for one of the
firſt Principles theſe Lanthorn men teach
their followers, is to deſpiſe their Betters,
and ſuſpect, and ſpeak Evil of their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
which Added to the Natural Envy
all men have for them who live in a more
ſplendid condition, bids fair for the Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of all our Gentry, and Nobility, if
they do not regain the Love of the People
by Virtue, and Extinguiſh theſe Factions
by a ſevere, and conſtant Execution of our
Laws, as I ſaid before; but however, this
they may be certain of, the Enemies of the
eſtabliſhed Religion are their Irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and Sworn Enemies.</p>
               <p>And this brings me to the third Thing
neceſſary to be known, <hi>viz. The ſeveral
Factions we have amongſt us, and how to
Govern them.</hi> Which I reckon to be three,
the <hi>Popiſh,</hi> the <hi>Puritan,</hi> and the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi>
Party; which is made up of Men of
all Religions in pretence, tho in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
they may be ſuſpected to have none.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:56345:53"/>
                  <hi>Popery</hi> was once the Sole Religion of
<hi>England:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Popery.</note> and altho they were well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to throw it off by the <hi>Exactions</hi> and
<hi>Oppreſſions</hi> of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in the
days of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> and King <hi>John,</hi> as
appears by the Complaints made of them
in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> and at
other times in Parliament; yet when <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the <hi>8th</hi> reſolved to Extinguiſh the Pope's
Supremacy by an Oath, many ſtuck ſo
heartily to it, that they Suffered Death, of
whom Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> was the Chief,
who had been Lord Chancellor of <hi>England;</hi>
and beſides, that Prince maintained the
greateſt part of the Popiſh Doctrine intire
to his laſt breath; <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Doctrine too; but he Lived not
long; and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> his Succeſſor threw
all things back again into their former
ſtate, and reconciled her Self, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Pope: Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> on
the other ſide, fallowed the Example of her
Brother, and ſettled the Religion, as now
it ſtands; but then theſe irregular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
kept mens Minds in great Suſpence,
ſo that they knew not what to think;
and ſome men had changed ſo often to
Comply with their Princes, that at laſt
they were aſhamed to change any more,
and ſo Continued Papiſts in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi>
time, tho they had been Proteſtants
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56345:54"/>
in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> Others
imbraced the Proteſtant Religion then;
with a reſolution to deſert it again, if the
Times Changed; but their Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſincere, and they died in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
when they never had any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to alter it with Safety. And many
thro Prejudice and Education, and for
Want of Means, and Ability to Examine
things, Continued in the Popiſh Religion;
but yet the greateſt part of the Nation
took up an hearty Averſion for it, out of a
deteſtation of the Cruelty they had ſeen
uſed in the Reigns of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> and
Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and of the Treacheries they
had ſeen practiſed againſt Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
whom they infinitely Loved and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired.</p>
               <p>And indeed the Length, and Proſperity
of her Reign, had in all Probability put an
End to that Faction in <hi>England,</hi> if two
things had not kept up their hopes, and
revived it.</p>
               <p>The firſt of which was their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of the <hi>Scots</hi> would
have ſucceeded her in the Throne, who
was true to them; and when this was Cut
off by her death (tho that was a long time
after,) yet they ſtill flattered themſelves
ſome other perſon of their Perſwaſion
would inherit her Crown, and put an end
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56345:54"/>
to their Sufferings: And the truth is, it is
the Nature of Mankind to hope for Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
aſſiſtances from God, eſpecially
when they ſuffer for Religion; and this is
it that maketh it ſo difficult to Extirpate
thoſe <hi>Factions</hi> that are built upon that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that tended to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<hi>Popery</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> was the <hi>Policy</hi> of
<hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the Aſſiſtance the Queen lent his
Subjects in <hi>Flanders,</hi> then in a War with
him; built ſeveral Colledges at <hi>Doway</hi>
and other places, for ſuch <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi>
as fled over to him out of <hi>England,</hi>
and endowed them with ſome ſmall Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
and theſe made it their buſineſs to
draw over as many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Youth
as they could, eſpecially of the Nobility
and Gentry, and there they bred them up
in an invincible hatred of the Religion by
Law Eſtabliſhed; and Others they ſent
over with Orders to preach up <hi>Popery</hi> as
much as they durſt; and had it not been
for this, there had been very few Papiſts
left at that Queens death, who reigned
44 Years.</p>
               <p>Tho King <hi>James</hi> were infinitely diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
by this <hi>Faction</hi> at his firſt coming
to the Crown, by the <hi>Powder-Plot,</hi> and ſo
made Severer Laws againſt them, than
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56345:55"/>
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did; yet neither were
they Carefully Executed in his, or his Sons
times, yet this <hi>Faction</hi> ſenſibly decreaſed,
and a great part of thoſe that remained
were ruined by the War; and the late
Plot in this King's time hath proved very
effectual to bring off many more from that
Opinion; ſo that by one means, or other,
it is become one of the moſt deſpicable
<hi>Factions</hi> in this Nation; and if the Blow
had been well followed, might perhaps
have been intirely ruined.</p>
               <p>Had Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Methods been
well purſued by all her Succeſſors, they
muſt in likelyhood have been Extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but there was an Odd ſort of Policy
taken up, which was to Slacken the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Laws againſt them, that
they might be a Counter-ballance to the
<hi>Puritan Faction;</hi> which produced two
great Evils. Firſt, They were ſo far from
lending us any Aſſiſtance againſt the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi>
that their <hi>Prieſts</hi> encreaſed the
Number of them by Preaching up their
Opinions, and Adding to them, as appears
by a ſmall Pamphlet called <hi>Foxes and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands,</hi>
which proved they were the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of Extemporary Prayers in Publick
aſſemblies. And by ſeveral other ſuch Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems
which they imployed againſt us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:56345:55"/>
Secondly, Theſe <hi>Diſſenters</hi> made it their
great buſineſs to inculcate into the Heads
of the Rabble an Opinion, That all the
Lenity, that was uſed towards the
Papiſts, proceeded from a Love to Popery;
which both made more <hi>Puritanes,</hi> than
there would otherwiſe have been, and
made them better thought of by the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſo that inſtead of Diminiſhing, or
Weakning that <hi>Faction,</hi> it encreaſed it, and
added reputation to it; and the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
made the ſame uſe of it, and drew over
ſome Weak, and Unſteady Souls to joyn
with them; ſo that our Enemies encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
on both ſides, but eſpecially the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters;</hi>
and this was all we ever did, or
can get by that Extravagant piece of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, the People will ever
entertain jealous thoughts, and be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
at all thoſe, that ever ſo little favour
the Papiſts, and ſo long as there is any
Number of them amongſt us, beſides all
the diſquiet they give us, the Factious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
will take hold of that pretence to
do us a miſchief, as time, and opportunity
ſerve.</p>
               <p>So I conclude it is the Intereſt and
Duty of all Magiſtrates, to put the Laws
againſt them Conſtantly, and Vigorouſly
in Execution, and eſpecially thoſe againſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56345:56"/>
ſending their Children beyond Sea to be
bred in the <hi>Seminaries,</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
where they learn more Malice and
more Skill, than they could do in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe this is a work of time, it
is their Duty in the interim to ſhew the
People two things; Firſt, That theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of Popery are not in any Capacity
of doing us any great miſchief, if we do
not contribute to it by our own folly they
being few in Number, and generally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Secondly, That the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are
never a Whit better, than the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in
many of their Opinions, or Practices, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe that relate to Government;
and that tho they have ever declaimed
moſt furiouſly againſt Popery, yet they
have always maintained under-hand a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with them, and they have
mutually helped one another to deſtroy
us.</p>
               <p>And even when the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> knew it
not, have they been influenced by Popiſh
Emiſſaries in diſguiſe, who inflamed their
fiery Spirits during our late Rebellion, and
drove them to that height of Fury, that
they Murthered their Prince, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand of their fellow Subjects with
unheard of Barbarity; and yet in the mean
time little thought whoſe Agents they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56345:56"/>
were, and now the Secret is diſcovered,
they purſue the ſame deſign, and lay all
that is paſt to theſe Papiſts, tho not one of
a Thouſand was ſo, as all the World knows.
It were more ingenuous to Confeſs their
Error, and forſake all thoſe Courſes, and
Principles, which gave the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
and encouragement to puſh them
on to ſuch Lewd, and Wicked Practices.</p>
               <p>Before I was <hi>aware</hi> of it,<note place="margin">The Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane Faction.</note> I am fallen
upon the ſecond <hi>Faction,</hi> which is the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane,</hi>
this was at firſt all of a piece, and
all <hi>Pure Presbyterians;</hi> but in the Reign
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> began to ſubdivide,
and in the Late Rebellion they Crumbled
into ſo many, that they have now no
common Ligament to Unite them, but
their hatred to the Religion by Law Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed;
and <hi>Presbytery</hi> which gave them
all life, is now one of the ſmalleſt, and moſt
Contemptible amongſt them.</p>
               <p>The Riſe of this was owing to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Perſecution; for many of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men,
eſpecially the Clergy, were by
the fury of it forced to flee into <hi>Germany,</hi>
where ſome of them ſettled at <hi>Geneva,
Zurick,</hi> and other Places, which had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<hi>Calvin</hi>'s Method of Diſcipline, and
ſo became in Love with the Novelty of it;
others ſtuck to that which had been ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56345:57"/>
here in <hi>England</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the <hi>6th;</hi> and this Cauſed a ſharp
Bickering betwixt them at <hi>Franckford</hi> in
the Year 1554, in which they that ſtood
for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy at laſt prevailed.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> dying ſoon after, theſe
too, got the ſtart of the <hi>Geneviſts</hi> in their
return, and the Queen, who underſtood
her own Intereſt very well, Settled the
Religion as now it ſtands; Knowing that
<hi>Presbytery</hi> was Calculated for <hi>Common-Wealths,</hi>
and deſtructive of the Rights of
Soveraignity and Monarchy. Yet She
Advanced many of theſe men to Deana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and inferior Dignities in the Church;
and they again ſo far Complyed with the
Religion Eſtabliſhed, as not to make any
open ſeparation from it, tho they were
ever, and anon Complaining of Ceremonies
and humane Impoſitions. The reaſon of
their Compliance was, becauſe they had
no great Party in <hi>England</hi> to back them;
and the Reaſons why the Queen bore with
them were, the Want of Learned men to
ſupply thoſe Places, their Zealous Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> which was then the
only <hi>Faction</hi> that was feared, and the hopes
many men had that in time they might
become wiſer.</p>
               <p>In the firſt 9. Years of the Queens
Reign, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> as well as the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:56345:57"/>
frequented our Churches, and Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and they began the Separation both
at once; and it is now apparent, that <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingham,
Coleman,</hi> and <hi>Benſon,</hi> three of the
firſt <hi>Puritan</hi> Separatiſts, were <hi>Roman Prieſts</hi>
in diſguiſe. As is undeniably proved by
Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs
of Separation,</hi> &amp;c. from that
Pamphlet I lately mentioned, called, <hi>Foxes,
and Firebrands,</hi> which was Publiſhed by
Dr. <hi>Nalſon,</hi> and is in his Firſt Voll. of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
Collections,</hi> reprinted; ſo that it is
probable, if theſe Romiſh Prieſts had not
puſhed things forward of Purpoſe to ruine
us by Diviſions, this Faction might have
expired with thoſe men that brought it out
of <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But however, there were two things
recommended it. The deſign of Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating
<hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> made all thoſe men fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it, who had a mind to the Biſhops
Lands, and had any hopes to poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of them, which were then Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
under the Queen, and ſome Country
Gentlemen. Secondly, The inferior Clergy,
who were ambitious, and well conceited
of their own ability, were highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be infranchiſed from the Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Biſhops, and with the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of two Lay Brothers, to govern all
at their diſcretion, and many of the Laity
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56345:58"/>
had a mighty conceit to be tampering
with Church Diſcipline, which the leſs
they underſtood, the better they thought
they could manage it.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Scotland</hi> Reforming at the ſame
time, the Queen (who preferred any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
before <hi>Popery</hi>) ſuffered <hi>Presbytery</hi>
to be ſettled there, tho, ſhe might, perhaps,
have prevented it at firſt. And the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
that from thenceforward was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Scots</hi> and Us, increaſed very
much the Number of Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>Having thus won Over in time a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Number of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to joyn
with them, and finding there was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
to perſwade that Queen to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettle
the Church again to introduce their
Diſcipline; and Perceiving they got ſmall
Advantages by Preaching, they fell a Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Libels againſt the Biſhops, and Church-Government,
and Ceremonies, inſolent Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
to the Parliament, and in Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine
manner held great Meetings of
their Party, and in them reſolved to ſet up
their Diſcipline without Law, and againſt
the Queens Will, and ſome of them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to raiſe Inſurrections in <hi>London,</hi>
and were hanged for it, and the reſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
in the High Commiſſion, and other
Eccleſiaſtical Courts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:56345:58"/>
So they got ſmall Advantage during
the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and not
much more in King <hi>James</hi> his time, his
Majeſty being perfectly well inſtructed
in their Principles, Practiſes, and Tempers
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Experience of what he
and his Mother had ſuffered by them; ſo
diſpairing of Prevailing by Art upon the
Crown, they Moulded themſelves into a
State Faction, and by recommending their
diſciples and favorers to the People for
Good-Commonwealth-men, hoped in time
to Force the Crown, to vail to the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Jeſus Chriſt, as they Blaſphemouſly
call'd their Diſcipline, by getting them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Houſe of Commons, by which
means they plagued King <hi>James,</hi> and at
laſt ruined his Son.</p>
               <p>But theſe Good-Common-wealth-men,
when they had got what they aimed at,
had no more mind to ſubmit to <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
than the King before them; and there
were ſuch a powerful Quantity of Under-Suckers
ſprung up, that it was not ſafe in
the Uncertainty they were then in, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
them; ſo <hi>Presbytery</hi> was laid aſide
firſt, and then perſecuted, in <hi>England,</hi> and
totally ruined in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi>
reaped the Crop of Advantage which
<hi>Presbytery</hi> had ſown in blood; and by
the Help of a general <hi>Toleration,</hi> there was
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56345:59"/>
as great a Swarm of ſeveral Religions in
<hi>England,</hi> as there was of Lice, and Frogs,
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> till at laſt the Land ſtank with
them.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Common-wealth-men</hi> too, fared
no better than the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> for when
by a long Series of Hypocriſies, Perjuries,
Treaſons, Bloodſhed, inſufferable Taxes,
Sequeſtrations, Plunderings, and Decima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they had almoſt ruined and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed
the Whole Nation, their own
<hi>General</hi> and Army at laſt turn'd them out
of Doors, and took poſſeſſion of the ſpoil,
and left them to ſhare the Sin, and Infamy
amongſt them: And ſo the Nation, after
a tryal of a brace of Tyrants, and half a
dozen Sorts of <hi>Common-wealths,</hi> returned
in the Year 1660, to the ſame ſtate it was
in before, under his Majeſty who now
Reigns, Whom God Long Preſerve.</p>
               <p>I have drawn this <hi>Narrative</hi> as ſhort as
ever I could, and by a Neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
I have been forced to Leave out
many Particulars fit for Magiſtrates to be
acquainted with, in order to the fully
underſtanding how deſtructive theſe
Mens Principles, and Practices are, both of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties, and Government,
and alſo of the Religion Eſtabliſhed, and
indeed of all Monarchies whatſoever: But
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56345:59"/>
if the Reader deſire further information, he
may have recourſe to the Piece I cited
above of Dr. <hi>Stilling fleets,</hi> and to Dr. <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin's
Hiſtory of Presbytery,</hi> who have
Learnedly treated, with others, of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
at large.</p>
               <p>All that I will infer from it, is, That
be the difficulty what it will, theſe Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
muſt be ſuppreſſed, and Extirpated, or
the Government and Peace of <hi>England</hi> can
never be Secured; We all ſee how Near
the brink of Ruine and Deſtruction they
brought us once before, and it is ridiculous
to expect the ſame cauſes will not produce
the ſame effects, if they be not Over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the Divine Providence, from which
it is in vain to Expect any aſſiſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
our Concurring endeavours as far as
we can or may.</p>
               <p>And this a man would think, were a
ſufficient Reaſon for the putting in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
all our Laws againſt them, who have
treated us ſo hardly without, and againſt
Law, and by all the Crimes that ever were
or can be perpetrated by men, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to deſtroy us; and he that can ſeriouſly
reflect upon all this, and yet believe that
they mean us no harm, muſt be left to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
the Miſtriſs of Fools, for better
information.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:56345:60"/>
But then the Reader may be pleaſed
to conſider, it muſt be a conſtant as well
as a ſevere Execution, that muſt do the
buſineſs, it is, as I ſaid, a Work of time,
and Factions in Religion are not to be
ſuddenly rooted out; except we would
depopulate our Country as the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
did by baniſhing the <hi>Moores</hi> all at
once, the ill effects of which they have
ſince found, but cannot Remedy.</p>
               <p>For if we be ſometimes Severe, and
at others Careleſs; the one will enrage
them againſt us, and the other enable
them to Execute their Malice upon us
at one time, or another; and it may be,
when we leaſt expect it, tho it is at all
times to be feared.</p>
               <p>For they are a Faction in our Boſomes
Strong, and Vigilant, who never did nor
will ſlip any opportunity to advance
themſelves, and bring us under, and they
will never want Monitors to incite, and
ſtirr them up againſt us, as long as there
is a <hi>Jeſuite</hi> in the World, that is Knave e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to diſſemble with God and Man,
and pretends he is one of their Party;
And they will never want aſſiſtants as
long as the Common-wealth Party is in
being, who can rely upon none but
theſe, for the Extirpating the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:56345:60"/>
So I come to the third Faction, which
is the <hi>Commonwealth Party,</hi> of which
I have been neceſfitated to ſay ſomething
before the Time, of which Faction I may
ſafely ſay, that it is of no Antiquity, for
in Antient Times, when ever any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
happened betwixt our Kings, and their
Subjects; tho they Depoſed, and Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſeveral of their Kings; as <hi>Edward</hi>
the Second and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and
Rebelled againſt others; yet they never
went about to deſtroy the Monarchy,
but ſet up the right Heirs, or others of
the Blood, in the place of the Dethroned
Prince; but for any Attempt to ſet up
a Common wealth, all our Hiſtories fail
us till the laſt Rebellion, and then upon
the Murther of <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, they
declared againſt Kingly Government,
and for a Government without a King, or
Houſe of Peers.</p>
               <p>Some have thought this was no part
of their Intention at firſt, but that they
came to it by the Event of Affairs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their Intentions, but he that ſhall
ſeriouſly conſider by what Steps and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
they brought things about and the
Principles of the chief Men that managed
their Affairs; can never think, that they
intended leſs when they began; tho they
were forced to conceal their deſigns
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56345:61"/>
becauſe the diſcovering them too ſoon
would certainly have defeated them.
And I have read, that one of them than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
God, that he had Lived to ſee a
Common-wealth ſettled in <hi>England,</hi> which
he had deſigned to introduce 30 years
before.</p>
               <p>And in the Cloſe, they did what they
could to have had Monarchy and the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Family abjured tho they failed in the
effecting it. <hi>Vide</hi> the ſhort View of the
Late Troubles, <hi>pag.</hi> 471.</p>
               <p>1. In the next place it is fit to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whence this hankering after a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
ſprung, and how it came to
infect the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; ſome have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
this to the more frequent reading
of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors, and tho
this might have ſome effect upon Tainted
Minds, yet it is a Cauſe too weak to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſuch an Effect. And therefore I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
aſcribe it, Firſt to the Presbyterian
Principles, for as they are exactly Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican,
as hath been made to appear, ſo
the Men who firſt took up, and drive on
thoſe Practiſes, were all of that Party to
a Man, or of thoſe that had ever mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
favoured them.</p>
               <p>2. In the next place, I reckon the
Neighbour-hood and Proſperity of the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> who having by War freed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56345:61"/>
from all Obedience to their Prince,
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> chiefly by the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> thoſe Souldiers that
had lived many years amongſt them, took
ſuch a fancy for a Common wealth, that
nothing could ſatisfie them without it,
and accordingly I have obſerved, that
moſt of the Officers that the Parliament
imployed in the beginning of the late
War, had been bred Souldiers in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. As the Papiſts ſend their Children to
St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and other places to be Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in an Averſion for our Religion; ſo
theſe Common-wealth Men ſend theirs to
<hi>Holland, Geneva,</hi> and other ſuch places;
from whence they return poyſoned with
Antimonarchical Principles, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſeeking opportunities to diſtaſte the
People with our Ancient Government.</p>
               <p>4. The diſcovery of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi>
brought a vaſt Wealth into <hi>Europe,</hi> much
of which falling into the hands of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, they grew Proud and
Ungovernable, eſpecially after King <hi>James</hi>
had put an end to the War with <hi>Spain,</hi>
and they had enjoyed a Peace of near
Thirty Years Continuance, and that Trade
and Peace, and Wealth, ſhould make men
Ungovernable is no new thing, as long as
the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were poor and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56345:62"/>
weak, they lived contentedly under Kings,
but when they grew Rich, and Powerful,
they threw off that Government, and ſet
up Common-wealths.</p>
               <p>Two things afforded them great oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
if not Temptations to it: The
firſt was, the Poverty of the Crown. The
Old Revenues were much impaired by
the Liberality, or Neceſſities of our Princes,
and no relief could be had but in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and there they knew ſo well how
to truck, that no <hi>Prerogative no Money;</hi>
They would not freely give, but ſell the
King Supplyes for Liberty; and they took
care too to increaſe that Neceſſity, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
the King in Wars, and then deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him Money to carry them on, and to
diſcontent the People at the ſame time at
the Unproſperous Events of them. Thus
the Crown grew every day poorer, and
the People Richer.</p>
               <p>Another thing was, the Factions in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which howſoever they were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,
one Party or other were diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and thereby diſpoſed to Wreak their
Malice on the Crown, by Electing ſuch
Men to ſerve in Parliaments, as were ill
diſpoſed to it. Whereas before, when
<hi>England</hi> was all of one Religion, it was
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56345:62"/>
ſcarce poſſible to pretend any thing, in
which the whole Body of the People were
Concern'd; So that theſe Animoſities in
Religion, ended in a Civil Faction, and
many Ambitious Men who cared for No
Religion, did yet make uſe of them, as tools
to Work their Ends upon the Crown.</p>
               <p>Two other things Contributed very
much to the effecting their deſigns. Firſt
<hi>Scotland</hi> led the Dance, and Rebelled upon
pretence of Religion; and altho the King
might eaſily have Conquered them by a
Battel, or Blocking up their Harbours;
yet being a Tender Prince, and unwilling
to ſhed the Blood of his own Traiterous
Subjects; he rather choſe to end the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy
by a Treaty; which gave them
time to Concert their Affairs with the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> of the ſame Faction, and that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
them with means to raiſe another
Army and enter <hi>England,</hi> which neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
the Calling of that Fatal Parliament,
which had like to have ruined the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
and Nation both at once.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts Rebelled at
the ſame time, and riſing ſuddenly, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred
100000 <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which ſo depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<hi>Ireland,</hi> that the King could have
no Aſſiſtance from it, the remaining <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:56345:63"/>
being hardly able to Subſiſt; and the
Parliament made another Advantage of it,
by perſwading the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to believe the
King had Procured this deſolation there.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>London</hi> lent the Parliament
Money, furniſhed them with Tumults to
Drive the King out of it firſt, and then with
Armies to force him back again; and too
many of the Gentry were Lazy, and would
not ſtir, timerous and durſt not, diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
and willing the Crown ſhould be
reduced, tho not ruined.</p>
               <p>But when they came to put the Project
in Execution, and after the ruine of the
King's Forces, to erect their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>England,</hi> there were other diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
that could not be overcome, their
own Army that had done their Drudgery,
would not be Disbanded, and they could
not force them. They had rid their hands
of one of the Three Eſtates that Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
our Parliament, the Spiritual Lords,
at firſt. And there was a parcel of
Lords Temporal, who for a long time
Acted with them; but at Laſt, being
not able to digeſt the Inſolence of the
Commons, ſtood off; upon which
they Voted them <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeleſs,</hi> and laid them
by too. So that all was then in the hands
of the Commons.</p>
               <p>They could not, or would not Diſſolve
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56345:63"/>
themſelves, in the ſtate things then were,
for then the whole Power would have
been in the Army, and Officers, who might
eaſily have prevented the Meeting of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Parliament, and the whole Nation
was diſſatisfied to ſee them divide the
ſpoil, and profit, amongſt themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any hope that any, but they and their
Relations ſhould partake with them in the
reward, as they had in the danger; the
Gentry were generally known to have
Wiſhed well to the King, and the Rabble
were to be pleaſed, by ſuffering them to
inſult over their Old Maſters, and the
Royal Party, tho Conquered, were not
dejected, and the Godly Party were fallen
in Sunder, and the <hi>Independents</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
their Sire, <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Commons were a Body conſtituted
of two Knights for every Shire, and two
Burg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſes for each Corporation; and the
Latter exceeded vaſtly the former in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
and tho this inequality had not been
much regarded Under the <hi>Monarchy;</hi> yet
now the Houſe of Commons was to be
made the <hi>Standing Senate</hi> of the Nation,
the Counties Would not indure it; if the
People had ſuffered any Grievance under
the Monarchy, they Complained in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and had redreſs. But Now
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56345:64"/>
they had no body to complain to but the
Commons, and they, when the Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
their own, Anſwered them with
Blows, and Death.</p>
               <p>So that what looked ſo prettily, and
eaſy to be affected at a diſtance, when i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
came to be tryed, was found impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and the moſt inſufferable Slavery in
Nature, and one fell to deviſe one Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and another another; but none would
do, and the Commons were not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt
of what had coſt them ſo many
Lives to purchaſe it, ſo the Sword deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
the Controverſy here too, and to
the general joy of the whole Nation, the
General, and Army-Saints ſent them pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Conſider, what they had done and
what they deſerved, but the Wealth they
had got by Villany, did yet afford them
ſome Conſolation in this World. As I
ſaid before.</p>
               <p>I have been as ſhort, as poſſibly I could,
and I have purpoſely omitted many things,
which ſhould otherwiſe have been ſpoken
that I might be ſo; and now with the
Readers Patience, I ſhall enquire whether
the deſign of extinguiſhing the Monarchy,
be really and totally laid aſide at this day:
to which I anſwer No.</p>
               <p>For firſt all the Principal Cauſes do ſtill
ſubſiſt, We have the ſame Religions, which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56345:64"/>
then we had, and they have the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and Diſpoſitions, and follow the ſame
Methods they then did; they Educate
their Children in the ſame Places, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the ſame ſort of Men to the
People they did before. But there are ſome
things, that ſtand in their way, which did
not then.</p>
               <p>1. His Majeſty hath a better Revenue
then his Father had, and this is a great
Block in their way, but they hope it will
end with his Life, and in the mean time
we know, what hath been done to Curb
him in that particular.</p>
               <p>2. His Majeſty hath a ſtrong Guard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in Pay, ſo that Tumults are not ſo
ſafe, eſpecially at <hi>White-hall</hi> Gates, as
heretofore they were, and this is the cauſe
the Nation have been told, that they are
Papiſts, and dangerous to the Liberty and
Property of the Subjects.</p>
               <p>3. The Militia of the City of <hi>London,</hi>
and the reſt of the Nation is in Truſty
hands, and no Rebellion can for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
be ſafely begun, and therefore the Chief
Officers are Traduced to the People, as
Men of Arbitrary Principles, favourers of
Popery, and Papiſts.</p>
               <p>4. The Miniſters of State are all repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the People, as <hi>French</hi> Penſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56345:65"/>
and Papiſts in Maſquerade. What
the meaning of this is, my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>
ſhall tell you. This is a ſure Rule, that if
the Envy upon the Miniſter, be great,
when the cauſe of it, in him, is ſmall;
or if the Envy be General in a manner,
upon all the Miniſters of an Eſtate;
the Envy (tho hidden) is truely upon
the State it ſelf. Eſſay the <hi>9th.</hi> But then
'tis not ſo eaſie to deſtroy them as it was
before, becauſe 'tis better known now.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are quiet, and
His Majeſty hath good Guards in both of
them to keep them ſo, whereas his Father
had none, and tho there have been dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Complaints of them, and divers At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
in <hi>Scotland</hi> to deſtroy them, by
the Covenanting Whiggs, yet it will not
do, there they are ſtill, and no body can
help it.</p>
               <p>6. The Nation hath a ſtrong Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
left of the Miſeries of the Late War,
the Blood-ſhed, Taxes, and Tyranny they
then groaned under, and his Majeſty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forget the Methods that were uſed to
deſtroy his Father, and Baniſh him, and
he will never give them <hi>leave</hi> to play over
the Old Game, and this was it, which
made the Late Conſpiracy to Murther
him, ſo neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:56345:65"/>
7. The Houſe of Peers have no <hi>mind</hi> to
be Voted down the ſecond time, and they
ſtoutly oppoſe what ever tends that way;
and the Diſſenting Lords have loſt the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
they formerly had, from the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Peers in that Houſe, and may proteſt
and complain, but could never carry one
Vote ſince; a manifeſt Argument, how
much the Puritan, and Popiſh Faction
ſtand in need of each other.</p>
               <p>8. The liberty of the Preſs was for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
years loſt, but ſince that reſtraint ended,
we have not wanted Seditious Pamphlets
to incite the People to another Rebellion,
which were written by ſome body for
ſomething and were bought up, and read by
vaſt Numbers of People, who in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
had no mighty Averſion for
them.</p>
               <p>The ſame Fears and Jealouſies have
been revived and buzzed induſtriouſly, into
the Heads of the People; but there is a
cerrain Act of Parliament, that makes it
dangerous to Traduce the King, as they
did his Father; but what no body durſt
ſpeak directly, they can ſlily inſinuate,
and avoid the danger of the Law at the
ſame time; and there are ſeveral other Acts
of Parliament, which have made the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of the Republicans difficult, which I
will omit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:56345:66"/>
Now, I ſay, conſidering all theſe Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that were not before, and that all that
were before are ſtill in being, and that
Men have naturally an Averſion for hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Neck-laces; I ſay, conſidering theſe
things, any man, that will, may ſee there
hath been as much done, as could be, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſetting up another <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi>
and more then the Gentlemen in 41
durſt do, till they have an Army to back
them, and if any man be diſpoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
theſe things come to paſs by chance,
and without any deſign, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why I ſhould diſturb the reſt of the
world, by endeavouring any further to
ſatisfie him, which in all probability is
impoſſible.</p>
               <p>But there is one queſtion behind ſtill,
and that is, What the Inferiour Magiſtrates
and Juſtices of the Peace, ſhall do to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
this Faction from attaining what they
aim at?</p>
               <p>1. To which I anſwer, firſt, take away
the Cauſe, and the Effect will follow,
the Puritan Principles, and Factions gave
Being to this, and with them it will fail,
but as long as they ſubſit, and are power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Common-wealth Party will be
ſo too, it is true that many forſake the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
in other things, but joyn with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56345:66"/>
them in this, but then they are falſe at
the heart, and have left the reſt, only
becauſe it was chargeable, being of that
Party, and are to be treated accordingly,
and never to be truſted.</p>
               <p>2. The People are frequently to be told
of the Miſeries they endured, during the
Late Times of Anarchy, and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that the Memory of them may not
be forgot in the next Generation; and by
what means the Nations became involved
in them, that they may not have the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of Re-acting the Old Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>3. The Government ought to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the People as it is; that they
may know their own happineſs, and live
obediently under it. A good Man would
not endeavour to ſubvert any Government
that were Eſtabliſhed, tho it were none of
the beſt, becauſe the Miſeries that attend
ſuch Changes, are greater for the moſt
part, then thoſe that are pretended to be
removed by them, but for us, to attempt
to pull down one of the Ancienteſt, and
beſt Conſtituted Governments in the
World, under which <hi>England</hi> hath flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
ſo many Ages, and to deliver our
ſelves up into the hands of a Company of
Ambitious Men, to be treated we know
not how, and Governed we know
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56345:67"/>
not which way, is perfect Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>4. <q>It is well obſerved in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and other Specious Things are
pretended; Nor did ever any man ſeek
a Dominion over others and to enſlave
them, but he made uſe of ſuch preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for it.</q> We have tryed theſe Men,
and by experience have found that they
are meer Pretences, and that there is no
ſweeter Liberty in the World, then to
live under a good Prince, and God hath
given us one to our hearts deſire, let us
not be ſuch Fools as to catch at ſuch ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
as they offer to us, and looſe the
real, and ſolid good things we do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</p>
               <p>5. The Throne is eſtabliſhed by Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 12. And ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
afford us many inſtances of good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that have been ruined by the Injuſtice
of their under Officers, when the People
have been inraged by them; Now every
Inferiour Magiſtrate may in this contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
much, to the diſappointing the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Deſigns of this Faction by doing Juſtice,
and cutting the Roots of all Diſcontents,
before they riſe to Aſſault the Throne, or
ſpread to undermine it. It is a common
Complaint, that we have excellent Laws,
but they are ill Executed. I know the whole
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56345:67"/>
fault of all this ought not to be aſcribed to
the Magiſtrates; but yet we are not ſuch
as we ought to be: If any ſhare of it lies
at our Doors, and if the Throne be made
odious and conſequently weak by our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults,
we muſt expect to ſuffer firſt, and
to bear the blame of it hereafter; our Oaths
will keep us from joyning in a Rebellion,
and our Loyalty make us obnoxious to
their Cruelty, which as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, is
the greateſt Crime amongſt Rebels.</p>
               <p>If therefore neither the Memory of
what is paſt, nor the ſence of what is
preſent, our own nor others experience
will prevail upon us, to prevent the ill
Effects we muſt in reaſon expect from the
Conjunction of the Puritan, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
Factions United, and Fermented
by the Popiſh; if we will ſtill reſolve to
try whether our Saviour's Rule is true,
<hi>That a Kingdom divided within it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtand,</hi> Math. 12. 25. then are we
ſuch men as deſerve no pity from God, or
Men whatever follow.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, if we would
buckle to the Work, and with Zeal, and
Induſtry, and Patience purſue it, by God's
Gracious Aſſiſtance, we might ſoon bring
under theſe two Factions, and in time Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
all the three, not by a deſtruction
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56345:68"/>
of their Perſons, but of their Pernicious
and Diſloyal Principles, and whoever hath
but the leaſt ſhare in this great work,
ſhall be bleſſed in this, and all ſucceeding
Generations.</p>

                  <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is a joy to the juſt to
do Judgment,</hi> Prov. 21. 15. And except
men take a joy in it, Judgment will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be ill done, if at all, eſpecially
by thoſe men who have no other reward
for it, then the ſatisfaction of their own
minds, and the ſenſe of having ſerved God
and their King and Country in a Station,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56345:68"/>
that brings them no perſonal Advantage.
We may ſay truly of the Juſtice of Peace
his Calling, that there is much Noiſe, and
no Wool, and as for honour, the better
he is the leſs he muſt expect it, in this
perverſe Generation. Envy and Ill will he
may be ſure to reap, but for any ſollid ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
unleſs what reſults from the
Peace of his own Mind, and the bleſſed
hopes of a Future Reward from God, the
Righteous Judge of Men and Angels, he
will find himſelf miſerably deceived in the
Event, if he at all expects it.</p>
               <p>And this is not the worſt of it neither,
difficulties he will meet, that will require
the utmoſt degree of Patience, Prudence,
Induſtry, and Attention to diſpel them,
and without Gods particular Aſſiſtance,
it will not be done at laſt, but inſtead of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Juſtice, he will do Injury, and Injuſtice,
and he will have cauſe to complain, <hi>Dum
falſum nefas exequor vindex, ſceleſtus inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
in verum nefas.</hi> Whil'ſt I purſued and
puniſhed an imaginary, and ſuppoſed Crime
in another, I have committed a real one
my ſelf, and this will be a great misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
even then when it is no fault, and
much more when it is.</p>
               <p>When theſe, and a thouſand other diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
which no man can foreſee, are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
it will I ſuppoſe be eaſily granted, that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56345:69"/>
he that is to encounter, &amp; overcome them;
had need have a ſtrong, and almoſt invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Love to Juſtice to enable him, and
ſupport him in his undertaking. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
if it were well conſidered, there is not
a greater inſtance of the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the Government of the World,
then that ſo many friends to Juſtice can be
found as there is, Men that Court and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe
her purely for her own ſake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other Dower, then that of Sorrow
and Vexation of Spirit, whoſe Buſineſs,
Pleaſures, Recreations, nay their very
Prayers, and Meals are interrupted by their
thankleſs, unprofitable, uneaſie employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and yet God for the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſweetens all this, and tyes them as
cloſe to it by the Cords of Love, as a Hen
to her Eggs, and Chickens, from which
ſhe can never reap any advantage.</p>
               <p>But then thoſe that are not ſo qualified,
ſhould in Prudence never attempt to meet
theſe Rampant Lyons, which they may
be ſure are in the way, and if any of
them will not conſider it before-hand, his
own experience will ſoon inform him of
the truth of what I ſay.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak not this to diſcourage any man
but to forewarn him, that he may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with a reſolution equal to the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
which only Love can inſpire; fear
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56345:69"/>
it is true hath ſometimes made Men Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
but then that is a forced Courage,
which will not laſt; lay the man a golden
Bridge, open him a way, and you may be
ſure never to be troubled more with his
Valour, or his Juſtice.</p>
               <p>But he that loves any thing purſues it
through Fire, and Water, and Death it ſelf
cannot extinguiſh the deſire. Tell him of
dangers, and he replyes, <hi>At contra Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentior
ibo,</hi> but I am reſolved to maſter
them. Theſe and theſe only are the fit
Men to ſerve in this Honourable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and may God Almighty bleſs and
reward thoſe we have, and ſend more
ſuch Heroick Souls into the Field, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance
Faction, and Vice, and to
protect Innocency, Religion, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>And to the reſt I ſhall offer two, or three
things to be thought of at their leiſure. Will
any man in his right Wits expect Peace
without Juſtice? What were the World
but a Hell of Miſery, and a Chaos of
Confuſion, if every man might ſay, and do
what he liſt? Were it not for the publick
Juſtice to terrify ſome, and cut off other
Malefactors, your Houſe would be a Caſtle
to you indeed, but ſurrounded with ſuch
dangers, that you ſhould neither eat nor
drink, nor ſleep in Peace and Security,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56345:70"/>
and the more Opulent your Fortunes
were, the greater would be the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to deſtroy and impoveriſh you; go into
the fruitful Countries of the <hi>Mogull</hi> in the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and you ſhall find vaſt Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Rich Soyl deſolate, and unhabited,
only for want of Country Magiſtrates,
to protect the good, and puniſh the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
for that Prince ſends but few Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
into his vaſt Provinces, and they
reſide in the great Cities, ſo that the Poor
and Remote have ſmall advantage by them,
and ſo would it be in <hi>England</hi> if all men
were of your minds. But you will ſay
there is no fear of that, but then you
ſhall be as accountable to God, and your
Country, has if it had really happened, for
tho man cannot puniſh theſe Sins of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
God can and will. But you muſt
gain Portions for your Children, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
your Eſtates, yes and your Sorrows
too, to ſee all your Labours end in Smoak,
a Civil War deſtroy that in an hour, you
have been carking for many years, and
your Beloved Daughter become the Prey of
a Lieutenant, or a Captain at the beſt, who
has nothing to Joynture her in, and takes
her and all the Thouſands you have ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
together for her, in part of payment
for the publick ſervice, or diſ-ſervice, as it
happens, and it may be your Grand-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56345:70"/>
may after all this have the honour
and happineſs to be Tapſters, or Oſtlers in
ſome great place. When if the Publick
had been better minded, your Daughter
and her Deſcendants might have been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
Theſe are no vain ſpeculations, ſo that
if men would conſider ſeriouſly of it, they
would love Juſtice, if not for it ſelf, yet
for the Conſequences of it.</p>
               <p>2. Next to the love of Juſtice impartiality
in doing it is to be conſidered, for it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to turn Juſtice into Worm-wood, and
Gaul, the beſt and ſweeteſt of things into
the bittereſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; and here ſo many by-ways
offer themſelves, that a Juſtice of the
Peace had need be a man of great Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and Integrity to avoid them, and
purſue the ſtreight Path of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Some Men have that Veneration for
Great Men, that they durſt not oppoſe
their Wills, or Humours in any thing, be it
never ſo unreaſonable, or unjuſt; and here
if a Controverſy happen between a poor
Servant, Labourer or Tenant, and the
Lord of the Mannor, or other Rich Perſon,
all the Arts in the World, all the ſhifts
and tricks imaginable are upon ſuch an
occaſion, to be muſtered up to prove the
poor Party in the wrong, and the rich
one in the right, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is Witneſſes (if he have
any that dare ſtand by him,) are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56345:71"/>
all his whole life is to be ſearched
into, to find a flaw in it, tho nothing to
the purpoſe; if the man ſtill ſtands ſtoutly
to it, and will not ſurrender at once his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
and his Caſe, hands and eyes are
lift up in Admiration at his Impudence; if
he ſpeaks one word for another, or indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
what had been better omitted,
then for a loud fit of Laughter to put him
out of Countenance, that the Legerdemain
may be better carried. If nothing elſe will
do two or three bawling Attorneys, muſt
be called into the buſineſs that the ſucceſs
may be aſſured, nay and it is well too if
Mr. Juſtice can excuſe himſelf from paſſing
a promiſe before hand, that he will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
in favour of the Gentleman.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould ſpeak all I mean upon
this Theam, it would look as if I deſigned
a Satyr or a Libel; But that is the furtheſt
thing in the World from my thoughts. I
do heartily bluſh, and grieve to think ſuch
things ſhould be done amongſt Chriſtians,
but that will not Remedy the Evil.</p>
               <p>Let ſuch men know then, that God hath
made both the Poor, and the Rich, and he
careth for both alike, and whoever he be
that ſhall thus abuſe the truſt repoſed in
him, ſhall ſooner or later be recompenſed
by him, according to his deſarts, and the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56345:71"/>
greater he be, the greater his Crime and
Puniſhment, for Mighty Men ſhall be
mightily tormented.</p>
               <p>And let him not think neither that his
Chaſtiſement ſhall not overtake him, till
he comes into the next World, which if
it were true, would be a ſilly Comfort, that
is, that he ſhould only be damn'd for it,
but it is ten to one if he meets it not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
his own Conſcience will at one
time or other reproach him for it, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Perſon he thus favoured, will ever after
repute him a poor low ſpirited Coward,
or a Knave, and however he may Flatter
and Careſs him for the preſent in ſhew, yet
Condemn, and Scorn him in his Heart,
and draw him along from one iniquity to
another, till he become odious, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
to all that know him, and the
poor injured Party will be ſure to revenge
his injuſtice, by telling the Story, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a while it will find belief, and then as
the poor are moſt numerous, he will have
many Enemies, and no Friends, for never
did any man purchaſe a friend by injuſtice,
and what the Effect of all this may be at
laſt, I leave to all men to conſider.</p>
               <p>It is almoſt the ſame thing to favour a
poor man, only becauſe he is poor, tho it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56345:72"/>
doth not happen ſo frequently, for if he
be in need, and neceſſity, thou mayeſt
draw thy purſe, and relieve him, but what
haſt thou to do with that, which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mans, the great Boy muſt not have
the little Boys Coat, becauſe it is fit for
him, or he hath need of it, but every
man muſt have what is his own, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
you may call it what you will, but
Juſtice it is not.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe two, there are two other
differences which may often happen in
thoſe that come before a Juſtice of the
Peace, he is to do Juſtice at home amongſt
his own Neighbours, and ſome of them
are his Kindred, his Friends, or their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
others are under his diſpleaſure,
and may have offended him or his, in
ſomething or other, and theſe two affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Love, or Hatred, are great Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Truth and Juſtice, and the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
took great care to prevent this obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
by ſaying, (<hi>Mihi Galba, Otho, &amp;
Vitellius, nec beneficio, nec injuria <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.)
Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi> were not
known to me, either by their injuries or
benefits, if they had, there might have
been ſome reaſon to have ſuſpected his
Relations of them, but this is much more
powerful in a Juſtice of Peace, or Inferiour
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56345:72"/>
Magiſtrate, then in an Hiſtorian, they all
hope their Writings ſhall live and be read
by all Men, and there can hardly be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
of that ſort impoſed upon the World,
but one or other by one means or other,
will diſcover it, or the piercing Wits of
Men will find it out from the very Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
themſelves, but thoſe things that are to
be done but once, and are often never more
thought of, are not of that Nature, and may
poſſibly never be diſcovered, or ſoon be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
as ſome men think; but this is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great diſception, when a wrong Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is paſſed, all men will make it their
buſineſs, to diſcover how it came to paſs, and
if there were any former kindneſs or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
tho many years before, will conjecture
that to be the Cauſe, eſpecially if the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
doth not give good reaſon for what
he doth, and they will ſuſpect it where it
is not too, and therefore it is good in thoſe
Caſes to do as little as a man poſſibly can,
without the Conjunction of others.</p>
               <p>For ſay a man could eſcape the Eyes of
all Mankind, (which is very difficult if not
impoſſible) yet he can never delude God,
he penetrates the bottom of our hearts,
and diſcovers our moſt ſecret inclinations,
and affections, and will ſurely puniſh us if
he finds they lead us to pervert Juſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:56345:73"/>
and Judgment, and beſides this Sin it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
in it Perjury too, for it is contrary
to our Oaths, and he that can hope to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
theſe two grievous Sins, will hardly
much regard any thing I can ſay unto him,
but muſt be left to time, and the Juſtice of
God, to learn the contrary.</p>
               <p>Reſpect of Perſons is in ſome ſort a
worſe and more fatal Crime then Bribery,
for both Parties may bribe me, but no
man can make himſelf my Kinſman, or
grow rich in a moment, and therefore it
is impoſſible to correct it, beſides it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that ſuch men are of a baſe uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Spirit, for there are degrees of Love
and Hatred, Hopes and Fears, and ſuch a
man will comply with one Party one day,
and another another day, without Juſtice
or Reaſon, as his Intereſt or Paſſions lead
him, ſo that no body is ſure of him, for
he will as the Scripture ſaith, offend for a
Morſel of Bread, that is, for any thing or
nothing, and therefore all men ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
them, as they would a Thief or a
Cut purſe.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of Partiality that
ſprings from things, ſome Men have a
kindneſs for ſome Vices or Factions, and
they love that in another, which they cheriſh
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56345:73"/>
in themſelves, and ſo if any Complaint be
made, they wreſt, and bend the Laws to
comply with their humours, and intereſts,
and ſometimes they ſtretch, and ſometimes
they ſhrevil, and ſhrink them up to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and this is direct Partiality; the
ſame Offence ſhould have the ſame Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
whoever commits it, and every
Offence that very puniſhment, which the
Laws have appointed and no other; and
if any difference is to be made, let it ſpring
from ſome Conſideration in the Perſons or
Things, and not from us, puniſh a poor
man according to his Offence, and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
and not according to your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
towards him, but if you diſcover any
ſuch thing within you, be ſure to curb it,
at leaſt to ſuſpect it, and puniſh your
Friends according to Law, and your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
ſomething leſs, if you muſt do it,
and ſo in relation to other things; a man
ſhould be moſt ſevere againſt his own Vice,
to ſhew the World he is not deſirous it
ſhould follow his example, tho when all
is done, the beſt way of Correction is for
a man to begin at himſelf, and having
formed his own Life according to Law,
and Reaſon, then to try what he can do
upon others.</p>
               <p>I will in the next place conſider thoſe
things that do moſt uſually hinder, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56345:74"/>
obſtruct the Execution of Juſtice; againſt
which a Magiſtrate ought to arm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
with an habitual and invincible ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and as often as occaſion ſerve, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it to the World that men knowing
his reſolution beforehand, may not dare
to tempt him.</p>
               <p>The firſt of which I reckon <hi>Bribery,</hi>
which is ſo frequent an Impediment of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
that both the Laws of God, and
Man have taken frequent notice of it,
and ſeverely threatned it, and it accordingly
is attended with great Infamy for the moſt
part if it meets no other puniſhment, and
the greater in a Juſtice of the Peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Perſons and things that come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him are of that ſmall Conſideration,
that he cannot in reaſon expect a Bribe in
his whole Life, that would tempt a man
of any Generoſity to do an ill thing. What
is half a dozen Chickens, or a Couple
of Capons to a Man of Worſhip? and
yet for ſuch pityful prices have ſome men
ſold their reputations, and laid themſelves
open to the ſcandal, and deriſion of the
World. It was a ſharp reflection that was
made upon them in Parliament, in the
<hi>44th</hi> year of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
when one ſaid, a Juſtice of Peace was a
living Creature, that for half a dozen of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56345:74"/>
Chickens will diſpence with a whole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
of Penal-Statutes. I believe as there
was not then, ſo there is not now, many
ſuch pityful Animals Crept unto the
Bench, and advanced to that Honourable
Imployment, but then the leſs the number
is, the more eaſily the Commiſſion might
be purged of theſe Vermin, who are a
ſhame to the reſt, and a great vexation to
all their inferiour Neighbours, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
to the Government.</p>
               <p>The ways by which Bribery is attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
are ſo various, that it is impoſſible
to enumerate them all, ſometimes the
Wife, the Children, the Clerk, are
purchaſed under-hand to recommend the
Caſe to the Juſtice, and obtain a promiſe
of him when he leaſt thinks of it, and ſo
if the man be eaſie, he is bribed and knows
it not, and in this Caſe the beſt way is for
a Man by his Actions to demonſtrate to
the World, that none of theſe have any
power over him, or can influence him this
or that way, and when men find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
deceived, they will give over thoſe
tricks, and be aſhamed they were ever
guilty of uſing them.</p>
               <p>Another Method is to offer their ſervice
as Labourers, at ſmall or no wages, upon
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56345:75"/>
urgent occaſions, and then theſe days
work are chalked up upon the Dorman,
or behind the Door, and wo to the
next man that gives the leaſt offence
to the Leather Breeches, his Worſhip
is obliged to give him a Caſt of his
Office too, in his turn, and he is hard
hearted and ungrateful, if he will not
gratifie the Clown with a little Injuſtice,
and Perjury, in exchange for his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Juſtice hath ſomething
to buy or ſell, and then the bargain is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with reſpect to his place, and what is
loſt, is to be made up with Advantage out
of the depending quarrel.</p>
               <p>If the Juſtice of the Peace be a Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Lawyer, then he ſhall have a Fee for
his Advice, which he is bound to defend
too into the Bargain, be it right or wrong
at the next Seſſions, or elſe he loſeth his
Client forever.</p>
               <p>Sometimes general Promiſes are thrown
out, ſuch as theſe, It ſhall be never the worſe,
or I will not be unthankful, and the like,
which are like empty Caskes thrown out
to entertain the <hi>Leviathan</hi> with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:56345:75"/>
In ſhort, to go about to enumerate them
all is impoſſible; And to preſcribe any
other Remedy againſt them, then a ridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id
and inflexible Honeſty, is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for this Winding Snake will creep
up and ſteal upon a Man by ſuch unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
ways, that it will not be in his power
to prevent its approaches, tho he may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſafely with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſhake off the
Viper into the fire, if it fix upon his hand,
and then the Expoſing thoſe that attempt
it, to the World, by telling the Story pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
will deter others from the like ill
Courſes, and a better remedy can no man
invent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Prepoſſeſſion</hi> have the ſame
ill Effects with <hi>Bribery.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prejudice and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion.</note> And indeed, <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery</hi>
aims at Nothing elſe, but to foreſtall
the Judgment, and if that follow from any
other cauſe, the effect is the ſame; it is
all one to the Defendant, if the Juſtice Sell,
or freely Surrender his Judgment to the
Complainant, if he find him diſpoſed to
Condemn him before he hath heard him,
credulous of what ever is objected, but
intractable and imperſwaſible on the other
ſide. So that <hi>Bribery</hi> and prejudice have
this in common, that they both blind the
Eyes of the Wiſe, and pervert the Words of
the Righteous, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 19. and of the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56345:76"/>
two, <hi>Bribery</hi> is the more Excuſable, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
becauſe there is ſome temptation in
it, but the other ſells his Reaſon for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is well obſerved by the Lord</hi> Bacon <hi>in

2. Parab. 17. The firſt information, in any
Cauſe, if it a little fix it ſelf in the Mind
of the Judge, takes deep root, and Wholly
ſeaſons and prepoſſeſſes it, ſo as it can
hardly be taken out, unleſs ſome manifeſt
falſhood be found in the Matter of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
or ſome cunning dealing, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
and laying open the ſame. For a
bare and ſimple defence, tho it be Juſt, and
more Weighty, can hardly compenſate the
prejudice of the first information, nor is of
force in its ſelf, to reduce the Scales of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
once ſway'd down, to an eqnal Ballance.
Wherefore it is the ſafeſt Courſe for a Judge,
that Nothing touching the proofs and merit
of the cauſe, be intimated before-hand; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
both Parties be heard together. <hi>Thus
far this great Man, who was once Lord
Keeper of the Great Seal of</hi> England. <hi>And
a Juſtice of the Peace is in much more
danger of being prepoſſeſſed than a Judge,
becauſe the Complaint is made at firſt
immediately to him, and he may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
be more eaſily approached, yea, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56345:76"/>
deceived too than a Judge, as being not
ſo well verſed in affairs, or prepared for
the Execution of his Office by his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore ſhould be the more
Wary and Jealous of himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes the prejudice is of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter
date than the Complaint depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and is ſometimes the fault, and at
others the misfortune of the Party: if he
have given juſt cauſe for it by his former
misdemeanors, and ill Life, then he can
blame no body but himſelf, and yet the
Juſtice ought not to condemn him in his
very thoughts, till he is clearly proved
Guilty; for the Worſt of Men may be
Wronged, and every man is ſuppoſed at
firſt innocent, and afterwards penitent,
till the contrary be ſhown, not by ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
but by proof. But alaſs, we live in
ſo Falſe and Slanderous an Age, that the
Fame of very Good men is often blaſted
behind their backs, and it is become a
common practice for men to blacken their
Reputation, whoſe Perſons or Eſtates they
deſign to Ruine; and for the moſt part,
more miſchief is done the Party by theſe
Under-hand Accuſations, which he can
never anſwer, then by all the direct proof.
And therefore the Juſtice of the Peace
ought to ſuſpect all informations that are
from the purpoſe, as Slanders, and deſigned
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56345:77"/>
for no other purpoſe than to prepoſſeſs
him with an ill opinion of the party.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid will in ſome degree
diſcover the Miſchief of <hi>Prejudice;</hi> but
there is this further in it. Reaſon is the
Light and Eye of the Soul; Now if the
Eye be ſimple, the Whole ſhall be full of
Light; but if it be darkened with prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
<hi>how great is that Darkneſs?</hi> Matth.
6. 23. and I may add, how incurable, how
inexcuſable too? It is certain we ſhall all
ſtand before the Tribunal of Jeſus Chriſt,
and whatever Judgment we here paſs upon
Things, and Perſons, ſhall be there review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and therefore it befits us to be very
exactly careful that we do not draw upon
us a juſt Condemnation from that moſt
Righteous and All-ſeeing Judge, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
our fellow-Servants thro Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
and Prepoſſeſſion Wrongfully.</p>
               <p>Nor let us ever think, that we ſhall
eſcape the cenſure of men, for they will
certainly at one time or other diſcover the
Cheat, and eſteem us according, as they
find cauſe, tho perhaps they will not dare
freely to tell us their minds, and if they
never ſhould, yet our Conſciences will
Accuſe us for it, and God in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
will take care to puniſh us for it,
and that it may be in the ſame way we
have offended.</p>

are as great hinderances to Equal, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Juſtice, as the other two; there is
no man ſo mean, but he may by Accident,
or upon Deſign, oblige his Betters, and beget
in them a good opinion of him, and moſt
men are naturally apt to do it before hand,

               <p>Nor can any man on the other ſide live
ſo innocently, as at all times to avoid the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſure

ſo that the Natural Conſequence is,
that a man in Authority, and Power will
have many pretending Friends, and if he be
not the more careful, as many real, or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Foes, and if his Love, and his Hatred
have any room left for their Activity in
the Execution of his Office, they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
him to many Inconveniences, and
Acts of Injuſtice, which he would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
have avoided.</p>
               <p>Whereas Juſtice ſhould in this reſpect be
blind, and not ſee the Parties, but the
Fact on one ſide, and the Law on
the other, and then with diſcretion,
and impartiality, without Favour or
Affection, Hatred or ill Will give to every
Man according to his Works.</p>
               <p>But in the State man is, this is ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
that if Reaſon and Religion be not
called in to our Aſſiſtance, it will not be
done, the man hath injured me, and
therefore another, is falſe Logick, but
yet ſo powerful, that it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to ſee the Fallacy, eſpecially
whileſt a Man is under the Dominion of
Anger, and Hatred, which are powerful
Paſſions, and the Argument is as weak the
other way; the man is an honeſt man, and
therefore would not do amiſs, or complain
without good Cauſe. Why, he is a man
ſtill, and ſubject to all the Infirmities of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56345:78"/>
Fleſh and Blood, and therefore I ought not
to ſurrender my ſelf blind-fold to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
but diligently ſearch out the truth.</p>
               <p>And indeed if men would entertain
low and humble thoughts of themſelves,
they would ſeldom be miſtaken, but if I
think my Smile, my Nod, my kind Word,
or Look, a mighty Obligation, and make
a Muſter of my Friends, by the Liſt of
my Flatterers and Admirers, I ſhall ſoon
have a large Roll, but they will in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
appear to be what they are like,
falſe Muſters in Peace appear in their
Ranks, and Files a full Body, but in time
of neceſſity, and need, be like the gleaning
after the Vintage, thin and of no uſe, and
every Act of Injuſtice I do, will diminiſh
the number of my Friends, even of thoſe
for whoſe ſakes I did it, and increaſe the
number and fury of my Enemies.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, Exact and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Juſtice is venerable, and lovely in
the ſight of God and Men, and even thoſe
that ſuffer by it, will when the ſmart is
over, love and revere the man that Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred

Magiſtrate ſhall in the end have fewer
Enemies, and more hearty Friends then
the other.</p>
               <p>If there were nothing but this to be

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56345:79"/>
all our Affections, and Paſſions, when
we ſit down in the Judgment Seat, and
Act as if we were then newly dropt from
Heaven, without Friend, or Acquaintance,

it is fit to ſend the Parties to ſome other

               <p>Covetouſneſs is another great hindrance

the Advice of <hi>Jethro</hi> to <hi>Moſes, That he

ſuch as fear God, Men of Truth, hating
Covetouſneſs,</hi> Exod. 18. 21. was very good
and thought fit to be recorded for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction;
and to the ſame purpoſe was
the Admonition of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of
Famous Memory, when ſhe adviſed the
Juſtices of the Peace, that they ſhould not
deſerve the Epethites of prowling Juſtices,
Juſtices of Quarrels, who counted Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
good Cheveſance; ſinning Juſtices,
who did ſuck and conſume the good of this
Common wealth: and indeed they that
are eagerly intent upon encreaſing their
own Eſtates, do ſeldom ſtick at any thing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56345:79"/>
that may tend to promote their great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
but employ as well their Authority,
as their Wits to that purpoſe, not caring
what the publick ſuffer, ſo their private Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
may be advanced by it, in order to which
any thing is to be done, or omitted.</p>
               <p>But ſuch men (if there be any ſuch in
Authority) ſhould do well to conſider
the grave advice of Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon, Serm.</hi>
the firſt, <hi>ad Magiſtratum.</hi> The Private
is not diſtinguiſhed from the Publick;
but included in it: and no man knoweth
what Miſchiefs unawares, he prepareth
for his private Eſtate in the end; whileſt
thinking to provide well enough for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he cheriſheth in the mean time, or
ſuffereth Abuſes in the Publick. And <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
in his Margin gives the reaſon; for
with the Publick, all the Wealth of private
perſons is either ſaved or loſt; ſo that the
moſt Covetous Man if he were not ſhort
ſighted, and half witted, would be the
moſt careful to preſerve what he ſo much
valued, even for his own ſweet ſake, by
preſerving the Publick.</p>
               <p>I know notwithſtanding it is impoſſible
to convince ſuch men of their Duty or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
the Advantage is preſent, the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is remote, and at a diſtance, and he
muſt make uſe of all opportunities to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
his Wealth, and let them that come
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56345:80"/>
after, or other men take care to ſecure
it.</p>
               <p>I wiſh therefore our Superiours would
now and then look over the Commiſſions

hinderers of Juſtice, as to the firſt, it

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Temper comprehends Patience, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Candour. It ſeems to me that
ſaying, Be quick to hear, and ſlow to
ſpeak, was made on purpoſe for a Judg,
no Direction can be apter, and no Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
becomes him better, and he that
would not be ſaid to have but one Ear,
methinks ſhould be aſhamed to have none,
and I appeal to your Lordſhips Experience,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56345:80"/>
if a patient attention accompanied with
indifferent parts, and a competency in the
Law, with a mind fairly diſpoſed for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
or Conviction, will not as to
uſe and common benefit, exceed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt
Knowledge, and moſt towering
Underſtanding, that is attended with an
impetuous haſt, either out of a glory of
ſpeaking, or too great a fulneſs of himſelf.
And for Humility, tho I will not ſay that
every impatient man is proud (becauſe
that may ariſe from other Cauſes) yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
proud man is impatient, ſometimes
of Information, alwayes of Contradiction;
and he muſt be violent to maintain his

               <p>Thus far that Great Man, whoſe words
I rather choſe to tranſcribe than to expreſs
my own thoughts, becauſe I expect they
will derive a great Authority from the
Speaker and Place, where they were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
and to my underſtanding they are
as fit, and more neceſſary for a Juſtice of
Peace, than for a Judg.</p>
               <p>How ill does it become a Migiſtrate
who is a Miniſter of God to the People for
Good, and ſhould be a Terror not to the
Good but Evil? to become ſo to all that
come near him, through his Impatience
and Fury, ſparing neither Equals nor Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
and very often flying in the Face
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56345:81"/>
of God Almighty, by his Irreligious and
Deteſtable Oaths, and Imprecations, which
are no unuſual effects of ſuch paſſions.</p>
               <p>God Almighty is ſaid to be ſlow to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and of great Kindneſs, and that he
repenteth him of the Evil, that is, the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
we have deſerved, when he is
juſt going to inflict it. It becomes then his
Miniſters to be like their Maſter, and to
be ſo far from being incenſed againſt the
Innocent, and thoſe that have not offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, as to pity, and treat fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the moſt provoking, and worſt Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Wrath of Man worketh not the
Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> Jam. 1. 20. No how
can it? A man that is of that fiery tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is like the Furnace in <hi>Daniel,</hi> not to
be approached without danger, if God
doth not reſtrain his fury; and he that is
not able to uſe his own reaſon, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
himſelf, will be leſs able to Govern
others.</p>
               <p>This is not ſaid that a Magiſtrate ſhould
be like <hi>Eſop</hi>'s Block, and ſuffer himſelf
tamely to be trodden on, no, he ought to
be a Terror to Evil Works, for he beareth
not the Sword in vain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. But
then let men fear his Juſtice, not his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Irregular hopes are full as bad, ſome
men do ill things by way of pre-emption,
they will comply with a Brother Juſtice
in any thing, though it be never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
that he may do them the like favour
at another time, or that he may at leaſt
not retaliate them with a miſchief, thus
they hope by Injuſtice to become more
powerful with their Equals, and more
dreadful to their Inferiours, than if they
ſhould always too ſtifly ſtand for Truth, and
Juſtice, they have obſerved that Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
makes friends, and that inflexible
honeſty creates a man many Enemies, and
inſtead of truſting to the Providence of
God for their Protection, they lean to
their own Wiſdom, but how unſafely, the
Event in the end will ſatisfie every man.</p>
               <p>Some affect Popularity, and they hope
by being remiſs and careleſs in their duty,
to acquire the love of the People, and
gain the Title of <hi>Moderate Men,</hi> a good
word; but of late much abuſed, but then
they are very often miſtaken, and if they
be not, what is Popular Praiſe but Words?
and they are nothing but Wind, a cold
Reward, and as for their Love it is more
fickle and unconſtant than the Wind, and
leſs to be truſted to, as they have found
by ſad experience in their diſtreſſes, that
have relied upon it, and yet when
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56345:82"/>
all is done, it is more often acquired by
Juſtice and Truth, than by a ſlaviſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
and Flattery, becauſe they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
jealous of the extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcentions
of their Superiors, and look
upon them as Deſigns.</p>
               <p>The laſt hindrance of Juſtice I ſhall
mention,<note place="margin">Laſineſs.</note> is Laſineſs, or a dull Inactivity;
Men undertake the Publick Service with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conſidering before-hand the difficulties
that attend it, and when they perceive it
troubleſome, and laborious to go through
with the Work, and that they ſhall reap
much ill Will, Envy, Reproach, Hatred,
and Diſcontent for doing nothing, but their
Duties, and no preſent Profit, they ſit
down diſcouraged, and like the weary
Pilot, commit the Boat to the Waves, and
the Winds, and let her drive at Random.
Such men ſhould conſider, that Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to the end is that which God
Crowns, and that man is born to trouble
as the Sparks fly upwards, and that there
is as many troubles at every mans heels, as
there is before him, only if he goes on
bravely, and reſolutely, and conquer them
that ſtand in his way, the other ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
overtake him, but if he yields, he is
ſure to be cruſhed betwixt them, and to be
deſtroyed ingloriouſly, and without pity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:56345:82"/>
Others look to nothing but the Credit,
Honour, and Reputation they ſhall gain by
it, and if they can acquire the Title of
Right Worſhipful, and have their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
ſtand bare-headed to them, they
have their Deſigns. Now this is ſuch a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyful
piece of Vanity and Folly, that it
were to be wiſhed (if there muſt be ſuch)
that they might be as lazy as is poſſible,
that they may do the leſs miſchief; but
then methinks the very fear of being
thought ſuch, ſhould rouſe all that have
but one Spark of true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Generoſity,
and make them ſtudy their Duties dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
and then perform it induſtriouſly
and thereby regain their Credits here,
and a more excellent Reward hereafter.</p>

only obliged, as they are <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men and
Gentlemen to this Study, but as they
have promiſed upon Oath to be Executors
of the Laws, and it betrayes a great ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
of Mind, or Irreligion, to ſwear
to do equal right to the Poor and to the
Rich, after their Cunning, Wit and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and after the Laws and Cuſtomes of
the Realm, and Statutes thereof made, as
the Form of the Oath is, and then never
concern themſelves to know what thoſe
Laws and Cuſtomes are, and to mind the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56345:84"/>
Statutes of <hi>England,</hi> no more then they do
the Edicts of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that which renders the thing
the more inexcuſable, is the great pains
and care many Learned Men have taken,
to make Collections of thoſe things, that
are moſt neceſſary for the Juſtice of the
Peace, ſo that no man can want a Tutor,
if he have but a Will to learn, and they
are written too with that Variety of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
that they will fit any mans humour,
who is not given up to ſloath and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p>I can never admire enough the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Mr. <hi>William Lambard,</hi> how nice
and curious he is in his inquiries into the
Origine of thoſe Powers, that are given to
the Juſtice of the Peace, and the reaſons
of them, his Brevity, and the Perſpicuity
of his Style, which makes him very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
tho there have been great Additions
of late, made to that Office by new Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
               <p>The diligence of Mr. <hi>Dalton</hi> is not leſs
to be valued, nor the Exact Method in
which he hath digeſted ſo great a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of things, which are again made more
valuable by the Additions made in the Late
Impreſſions.</p>
               <p>How Curious and Subtle is Sir <hi>Edward
Cook,</hi> in his readings upon the great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56345:85"/>
and other Statutes, which are of
great uſe to a Juſtice of Peace, becauſe
they will give him hints, and general Rules
for the interpreting, and underſtanding
thoſe Statutes he took no notice of, and thoſe
too that have been made ſince his death.</p>
               <p>What a Vaſt Variety of Reading and
Learning hath he ſhewn in the Pleas of the
Crown; and yet he hath ſo couched and
contracted it, that the Volume is but ſmall
tho the worth is in eſtimable.</p>
               <p>The Exactneſs of Mr. <hi>Poulton</hi> in his
Book <hi>De pace Regis &amp; Regni,</hi> is much to
be admired, where beginning at the root
of all publick diſorders, the corrupt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
hearts of men, he ſhews how they
proceed from one degree to another, till
Menaces, and Threatnings grow up at laſt
into Rebellions, and Treaſons, all along
proving what he ſaith by Quotations of
the beſt Law-Books.</p>
               <p>The Conciſeneſs of the Lord <hi>Hales</hi> in
his Pleas of the Crown,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Mat. Hales.</note> is not leſs to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
then his Integrity and Prudence,
in ſo contracting them.</p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Chamberlain</hi>'s Complete Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and Mr. <hi>Keebles</hi> Aſſiſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
want nothing but an induſtrious, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Age, to make both the Books, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
more highly valued, and indeed they
cannot be too much eſteemed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:56345:85"/>
And as for the Statutes, Mr. <hi>Keeble</hi>
hath done the Nation a mighty piece of
Service, in his Exact Re-printing of them,
in an excellent Table of his own, but
there is in my poor judgment one thing
ſtill wanting, and that is an Index, or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Statutes under thoſe Heads or
Titles, which the Juſtices of the Peace
have occaſion to uſe them by; which are
different from the Lawyers common places,
ſo that there ſhould be another Table on
purpoſe for the Juſtices of the Peace, which
might be drawn in a Sheet of Paper:
the only Perſon that attempted this to my
knowledg, is one Mr. <hi>Wa. Young</hi> in a ſmall
piece ſtiled a <hi>Vade Mecum,</hi> Printed at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
in 1660. In the beginning of which
is a Table containing about five Leaves,
which is of vaſt uſe for the ſpeedy finding
of any Statute that a Juſtice of Peace hath
occaſion to uſe, but yet it is imperfect not
only as to the New, but Ancient Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
               <p>There is another thing, which I have
wiſhed for, and that is an exact Collection
of all thoſe Caſes, which immediately
concern the Juſtice of Peace, in which
their power, or wayes of Proceedings are
called in queſtion, out of the Year-Books
and Reports, recited in the ſame order of
time as they are there, at length, without
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56345:86"/>
any abbreviations, and only tranſlating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuch as are in <hi>French,</hi> which
would be of great uſe.</p>
               <p>Now if a man ſhould attempt to read
all theſe Books which I have mentioned,
which relate to the Office of the Juſtice of
Peace (the Statutes expected, which are
only to be conſulted upon occaſion) it
were no very grievous Task, and yet he
might learn his Duty thence, without any
other or very little help from Books.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time it were to be
wiſhed, that ſome men could be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to read but one of the ſhort ones firſt,
and then one of the larger pieces, I mean
<hi>Dalton</hi> or <hi>Keebles</hi> Aſſiſtance, and then the
ſhort piece again to fix things in their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and if I were worthy to adviſe
them, it ſhould be Mr. <hi>Chamberlain</hi>'s, for
I take that to be the very beſt that ever
was written.</p>
               <p>As reading begins knowledg,<note place="margin">Obſervation and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</note> ſo Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and Practice fixes it, he that reads
without reflecting upon it at the time,
and noting diligently what may be uſeful
to him afterwards, loſeth both his Labour
and his time, many men complain of a
bad Memory, when the fault is their own,
they read careleſly, and take no pains to
imprint any thing upon their Minds, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56345:86"/>
then or afterwards, and then it were
a wonder if they ſhould remember what
they never conſidered, nor underſtood, but
read on and on and think upon ſomething
elſe.</p>
               <p>Others pretend they would read more
if they had a good Memory, this is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
only for Laſineſs, laying their own
fault upon God and Nature, for Memory
is a Natural Faculty common to men with
many other Creatures; but on the other
ſide if they would read more, and note as
they go they would certainly retain a part
of it, tho perhaps not ſo much as others
do. But then there is a third ſort of men
who pretend to have ill Memories, who
in truth never read at all, theſe belye their
Natural Faculties, 'tis true they remember
little or nothing, how ſhould they? the
Memory is but like a Store-houſe, in which
if nothing is laid up, nothing ſhall ever be
found, if what is good for nothing, ſuch
as is laid in will come out, and not be in
the leaſt amended there.</p>
               <p>Obſervation doth ſomething, but Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
is the great ſixer of Notions in the
minds of men, he that his a Natural Fool,
will yet by often going away learn it at
laſt, how much more men of Competent
Natural Parts, and ſuch only are fit to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
others? and the truth is, they that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56345:87"/>
have the ſtrongeſt Memories will yet in
time loſe their Notices of Things, if they
do not excite them by Meditations, and
Practice, and that ſort of knowledg I am
ſpeaking of, which is not Natural, but Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Reaſon, and depends not for the
moſt part upon the innate Principles, but
upon poſitive Inſtitutions, and agreed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
is moſt eaſily loſt, ſo that I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
obſerved the moſt induſtrious men are
the moſt skillful, and many men who read
little, but have been very much employed
in buſineſs, have by that learned more then
others have done by Books, only tho they
had better parts, ſo that a Man ſhall rarely
find a Man excellently Verſed in any Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
Knowledg, that hath not fixed it,
as well by exerciſe of it, as by Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Reading.</p>
               <p>Obſervation and Practice fixes,<note place="margin">Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> but it is
Converſation and Diſcourſe with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Experienced Men that extends
Knowledg, much reading dulls a Man,
but diſcourſe at once revives what a man
knows, and encreaſeth it by the Addition
of anothers Obſervations too, and diſpells
that Melancholy which attends retirement
and ſolitude: It confirms a man more in
his Opinion, when he finds another man
of the ſame mind, and rectifies his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56345:87"/>
before they become dangerous to
him, or to others.</p>
               <p>But then it muſt be with Knowing
Men, for no man can communicate to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that which he hath not, he may miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead
him, or confirm him in Error, and
ſo make his miſtake more fatal; but other
good he can expect little from him, except
it be the diverſion of his Chat.</p>
               <p>When the Perſon with whom we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
hath not only a Speculative, but a
Practical Knowledge too of any thing;
if he appear honeſt and diſintereſted, we
may rely the better on his Judgment, and
the little Stories, which he will be able to
tell of things well, or ill done, will ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dwell upon the memory, and fix things,
and at the ſame time rectifie the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
too. It was well ſaid by the Lord
<hi>Bacon, Set before thee the beſt Examples,
for imitation is a Globe of Precepts;</hi> and
for that end were Hiſtories written, that
one <hi>Generation</hi> might learn from another,
and take Example what to follow, and
what to avoid; and Diſcourſe is of the
ſame Nature, thô not ſo perfect.</p>
               <p>I may then juſtly deteſt their ill nature
and folly, who when they meet with Men
of Knowledge and Experience, and willing
to Communicate both to them, envy and
traduce them, and when they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56345:88"/>
elſe to ſay, think to make them
Odious, by ſaying, They love to talk, and
are conceited of their own Knowledge or
Abilities, and are Proud men; why, if all
this were true, it is better to be Proud of
Something, than of Nothing, and yet the
laſt happens ofteneſt; ſolid Knowledge
will make a man humble, when there is
nothing ſo conceited as Ignorance: and a
communicative Man is better company,
than a cloſe churliſh Nature, who values
himſelf upon the Ignorance of others,
which ſhall never be rectified by him.
And it is uſual for theſe men too, to learn
from them, whom they thus traduce.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I may juſtly reprehend them
who ſpend all their time in tittle tattle,
about their Currs, and their Kites, their
Debaucheries, and Recreations, or, which
is worſe, in defaming their Neighbours;
but if any uſeful Diſcourſe is begun, that
may tend to the Publick Good, or to make
them wiſer, or better, are ill at eaſe, till it
be ended, turn ſick, and are ready to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
their over-charged Stomachs.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, the Age in which we live, is
learned; but if this humour prevail a little
more, the next will not only be debauched,
but barbarous, and ignorant.</p>

               <head>SECTION VIII.</head>
               <p>THe End of all that knowledge I have
been diſcourſing of in the foregoing
Section is for Practice; for that makes
it truly beneficial, a Man had better be
totally Ignorant of all Laws, than to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
them to find ways to defeat them; that
ſo he may at once avoid the Directive, and
Coercive Power of them. But the Great
deſign of a Good Magiſtrate is a Prudent
Execution of them, by obſerving a due
Method according to Law. 1. In calling
the Parties. 2. In hearing them. 3. In
determining the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>It is an old, and a juſt Complaint, that
no Nation hath better Laws than this, nor
hardly any that executes them worſe,
and yet we are poſſeſt with an Hydropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
thirſt after more, the cauſe of which
is, that every man would be free himſelf,
and have another bound; but of what uſe
are the beſt Laws without ſevere Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
If we deſign nothing but oſtentation;
in my Judgment the Book of Statutes is
big enough all ready. We are almoſt in
the ſame condition with the Ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Nec vitia noſtra, nec remedia eorum
ferre poſſumus,</hi> we can neither bear our
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56345:89"/>
great and manifold Vices, nor the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of them.</p>
               <p>And it was the Obſervation of a Wiſe
man, <hi>Corruptiſſima Repub. plurimae Leges,</hi>
that moſt Laws were made, in the moſt
corrupted States. But then never was any
People amended with Ink, and Paper, and
Laws are no more, till they be put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
It was good Advice which <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
gave the Senate, that they ſhould not
teach the World by ineffectual Laws, what
Vices were too ſtrong for their Authority;
for which he gives this reaſon, That when
Men had once prevailed againſt that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
too, <hi>Ne<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> metus ultra, neq, pudor eſt,</hi>
there was neither Fear, nor Modeſty left
to amend them. If we think much to
Execute thoſe we already have, to what
end ſhould we deſire more? If we think
it burthenſome to Obey our old Laws,
why ſhould we deſire to encreaſe the
weight, except it be to ſhew by the breach
of more, how much we deſpiſe them?</p>
               <p>But as in the making, ſo in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Laws, there will be occaſion to
make uſe of much Prudence, and Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to make a dextrous Application of the
General Rule to the particular inſtance,
and to order the Buſineſs ſo too (if it be
poſſible) that the Offender may be Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and not Ruined; it is impoſſible to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56345:89"/>
give any General Rule, or Advice in this
Caſe, but it muſt be left to the diſcretion
of the Magiſtrate. Only the Saying of the
laſt Lord Chancellor will ever be found
true. <hi>Happy is that Government where men
Complain of the ſtrict Execution of the
Laws.</hi> And if I might preſume to give the
Reaſon it ſhould be this; Severity prevents
Offences, whereas too much lenity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth
them, and makes the Offender by
Cuſtom, and Time incorrigible.</p>
               <p>When a Complaint is brought before a
Juſtice of the Peace, his firſt care muſt be
to conſider diligently, whether the Caſe
be within his Juriſdiction; for it is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
thing for mean People to complain
to them in Caſes, in which they can afford
them no Relief, and it is much better to
conſider this at firſt, than when it is too
late; for then a Man hath betrayed his
ignorance, and indiſcretion, if there happen
nothing worſe.</p>
               <p>Some Men have a cuſtom to extend
their Power beyond the juſt bounds of it,
that they may have the more Buſineſs;
and others will not do what they might,
and ought, either out of fear, or ignorance,
or unwillingneſs to be Troubled; neither
of theſe are good. It is unſafe, and often
injurious too, to ſtretch the Juriſdiction
beyond its due bounds. And it is unjuſt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56345:90"/>
on the other ſide to deny Men the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the Laws, when it is in Our Power
to Right them: And therefore a Good
Magiſtrate will avoid both the Extremes,
and neither give his Neighbours Trouble
to no purpoſe, nor ſpare his own Pains
when he can ſerve his Country. And
herein he will ſoon find the great Benefit
of his Care to inform himſelf Exactly of
his Duty, without which, it will be very
difficult to determine whether he hath a
right to meddle, or no; and if he thinks he
hath, it will not be amiſs (at firſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
and afterwards in all doubtful Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes)
to conſult his Books, and ſo go on
or deſiſt, as he finds Cauſe. And the
Safety will ſufficiently Compenſate for
the Trouble.</p>
               <p>When he is reſolv'd to grant a Warrant,
it is an excellent Way to enter into a Paper
Book to be kept for that purpoſe, firſt the
Name of the Complainant, and of the
Party againſt whom the Complaint is
brought; and then the Complaint, in as
few words as is poſſible, and then read
them to the Complainant, that if any
Miſtake hath been made in the Names,
or thing, it may be rectified, and then
recite all this again in the Preface of the
Warrant; for I am utterly againſt all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Precepts (except it be in ſome few
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56345:90"/>
Caſes which ſeldom happen) it being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
to call a man to Anſwer to the
knows not what, when if the Caſe had
been Expreſſed, perhaps he could have
produced Witneſſes to have cleared his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
and ſo have prevented further
Charge, and Trouble; and Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi>
gives another good reaſon for it, <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the King's Writs do always expreſs
the Cauſe of Complaint.</p>
               <p>When the Warrant is once granted, it
is not fit to hold any further Diſcourſe
with the Complainant, or afterwards, till
both Parties appear face to face, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Prejudice, and Prepoſſeſſion; yet you
ſhall have many ſuch Complainants that
will endeavour to get a Promiſe from the
Juſtice of Peace beforehand, that he will
Determine the Caſe for their Advantage,
which is directly contrary to all Juſtice,
and Honeſty.</p>
               <p>Others are as earneſt to have the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
retornable before the Juſtice that
granted it, and no others, which ſhould
never be eaſily granted, firſt becauſe it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
in it a Tacit reproach of the reſt, as
not Men of Ability, or Honeſty. Secondly,
Becauſe it defeats the intention of the Law,
which hath made them numerous, that
every man might have an impartial, and
and indifferent Judge; and yet if there be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56345:91"/>
good reaſon for it, it may be done; But then
the Juſtice hath bound himſelf to be as
kind to the other Party as he can poſſibly
be, becauſe he hath deprived him of the
favour he might have found from another
Juſtice of the Peace.</p>
               <p>When the Defendant appears, read the
Complaint to him, and ask him what he
ſaith to it; and if he confeſs it, then there
will need no Proof; if he deny it, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to find out the Truth, as far as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
without Oaths to avoid Perjury, by
croſs Examining of all Parties, and if the
Truth can ſo be found out, the pains is
well ſpent, but if it cannot, Oaths muſt
be given.</p>
               <p>When the Matter of Fact is once ſtated,
then have recourſe to the Statutes, or
Books, as the Caſe requires, and read them
to the Parties, that the Law may paſs the
Sentence, for this inſtructs and ſatisfies
all Parties, and ſhews that you have done
them no wrong, and it is of great uſe too
to the Juſtice of Peace, and makes the
Statutes, and Books very familiar to him;
and gives him a good Aſſurance, that he
hath not done amiſs.</p>
               <p>Then Enter in the ſame Book the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of the Parties, the Evidence given,
and the Determination thereupon made, as
ſhort as is poſſible, and diſmiſs them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:56345:91"/>
Some may imagine, that this Keeping
of a Book is very troubleſome, but if they
would try it, they would find the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
when the Art of making ſhort En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
is once learned; and yet if it were,
the Uſe would out-weigh the Labour. For
Firſt, It inables a Man to anſwer for his
Actions many years after, which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
without it. Secondly, It prevents
forgetting his Buſineſs before it be ended,
which many do for want of it, who bind
Over men to the Seſſions, and forget the
Buſineſs before they come, and then can
give no reaſon for it. Thirdly, It inables
a Man ſometimes to diſcover his own Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
by an after-reflexion on his own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and the Reaſons of them. Fourthly,
He may at any time ſhew what Sentence
was paſs'd in any Caſe, by which I have
ſeen new Quarrels that were ariſing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.
And if juſt upon a Seſſions they
be all read over, he ſhall have a Proſpect
of all he hath done that Quarter; which
will be of great uſe. I know many of theſe
things are not of abſolute Neceſſity, but
upon Trial, I perſwade my ſelf, they will
appear ſo uſeful, that no man will repent
the Experiment, eſpecially no new Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
who is concern'd to be more careful,
becauſe he is more ſubject to Miſtake.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:56345:92"/>
The <hi>Statutes</hi> are ſo numerous, and
withal ſo variouſly Penned, that it will
be impoſſible to remember them exactly,
and ſo it will be neceſſary to Conſult
them frequently upon all Occaſions, and
in order to the ſpeedy finding them, the
Table I mentioned in the laſt Section will
be of great uſe, and the Juſtice, who takes
theſe Methods, will find the Benefit of
them ſo great in a ſmall time, that he will
never leave them; but the other and
ſhorter ways are ſo uncertain, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Error, that no man can avoid
committing fatal Miſtakes, who follows
them.</p>
               <p>In this Part of our Buſineſs Two things
are to be avoided, Unneceſſary Delays, and
Precipitated Haſt.</p>
               <p>There is very little difference betwixt
<hi>denying,</hi> and <hi>delaying</hi> Juſtice; only the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is leſs injurious, for then the Party may
go to another Juſtice, or deſiſt, without
much Expence of time, which is of great
value to Poor Men; whereas the making
them dance Attendance from time to time
to no purpoſe, may do them more Wrong
than that of which the complain. And
an Over-haſty Determination of a thing
before it be well underſtood, is no leſs
injurious; and therefore carefully to be
avoided.</p>

I will Conclude this Section with a few
Excellent Rules of the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Seek to make thy courſe Regular, that
Men may know beforehand what to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect:
but be not Poſitive, and Peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</item>
                  <item>2. Expreſs thy ſelf well when thou goeſt
from thy Rule.</item>
                  <item>3. Imbrace and invite Helps, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
touching the Execution of thy Place:
and do not drive away ſuch, as bring thee
Information as Medlers; but accept of them
in good part.</item>
                  <item>4. Give eaſie acceſs. 2. Keep times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
3. Go through with that which is
in hand. 4. And interlace not Buſineſs
but of Neceſſity.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I will only add this, that what I have
Written in this Section, is intended only
for the private Hearing in the Hall, and
no where elſe in the main; and that it is
offered to Conſideration, and not preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
as of Neceſſity.</p>

               <head>SECTION IX.</head>
               <p>AS the Juſtice of Peace enters his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
with the taking Three ſeveral
Oaths,<note place="margin">Of Oaths.</note> which are included in the <hi>Dedimus
Poteſtatem,</hi> viz. The Oath of Supremacy,
and of Allegiance, and that belonging to
his Office; So he hath very frequent Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
to Adminiſter Oaths to others in
the Execution of it; and therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
him to ſtudy well the Nature, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of an Oath, that he may Preſerve
himſelf, and others (as much as in him
lyes) from the Sin of Perjury.</p>
               <p>It might therefore not ſeem impertinent
to Diſcourſe ſomething of both of them in
this place, but that more Learned men
than I, have prevented me in it, and it is
impoſſible for Me to ſay any thing, which
hath not been ſaid before on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of which, I am rather inclined
to deplore the Miſeries of the Age, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in which we live; for it may be that
ſince the Creation of the World, there is
not one to be found in which Perjury and
Diſregard of the Obligation of all Oaths,
have taken ſuch Deep rooting, and become
ſo Epidemical, and General.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:56345:93"/>
If we inquire into the Reaſons of it, we
ſhall find two, which have contributed
eſpecially to it, Factions, and Irreligion.</p>
               <p>The Popiſh Faction led the Way,
and long ſince by Papal Diſpenſations
taught Chriſtians to play faſt, and looſe
with thoſe dreadful ties, which honeſt
Heathens revered, and trembled at; and to
Uphold their tottering Greatneſs, Decreed
at laſt, That <hi>Faith was not to be kept with
Hereticks;</hi> a Doctrine which they have
ſince moſt religiouſly obſerved, when it
hath been ſafe as they thought, whether
to their greater Infamy, or Dammage, I ſhall
not now inquire.</p>
               <p>The Diſſenters at length imbraced (in
the beginning of our late Confuſions) the
ſame Opinion, and being to undertake a
War againſt their King; were Neceſſitated
to abſolve themſelves from the Oath of
Allegiance they had made to him, and
afterwards the ſame Neceſſity brought
them to take the <hi>Covenant</hi> which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that Oath, the <hi>Engagement</hi> which
was contrary to both; and ſo on they went
Swearing Contradictions, and impoſing
them upon the People, till no body did
any longer regard what they Swear to,
and they became ſo Perſidious too, and
diſtruſtful of each other, that this Perſidy
and Perjury in which they had put their
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56345:94"/>
greateſt truſt by a juſt Judgment of God
upon them, ruined all their Deſigns, and
brought their Affairs into ſuch Confuſion,
that they were forced to Submit to His
Majeſty, and accept a Pardon from him,
whom they had abjured, but a few Months
before.</p>
               <p>But the Nation being once infected with
this Leproſie of Perjury, thô one cauſe
was gone, the War, yet the Factions kept
up the Diſtemper; partly to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt the Laws made againſt them,
and partly in hopes to make great uſe of it
in another Revolution, which they have
lived in Expectation of ever ſince.</p>
               <p>So they Minted new Doctrines, That it
is better to Truſt God (<hi>i. e.</hi> to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will be as good as his Word, and
Puniſh them for falſe Swearing) than
Man. That it was a leſs Sin (if it were
any) for a Man to forſwear himſelf, than
to betray a Godly Brother to the Wicked,
or to inform againſt him to his loſs.</p>
               <p>And as they taught, ſo they practiſed,
they took all Oaths, and kept none; And
if any body was ſcrupulous, and fearful,
they tried what Perſwaſion would do; if
that failed, they fell to cloſe Revenges, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famations,
Suits at Law on other Pretences,
and all the Ways they could, till at laſt
partly for Love, partly for Fear, they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56345:94"/>
brought incredible Numbers of Men to
Perjure themſelves for them.</p>
               <p>Thus our <hi>Ignoramus</hi> Juries, our Perjured
Conſtables, our Conforming-Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Miniſters, our Sacramentary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions
into Legal, and Spiritual Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
our Moderate Magiſtrates ſo call'd,
and our Journeyman Freemen were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p>So that by degrees things are now come
to that paſs, that no man can tell how to
truſt his Life, his Honour, his Fortunes,
to the truth of a Witneſs, or Jury; for
Men have learned to ſerve themſelves in
their private Concerns of the ſame Engine
that have wrought ſuch wonderful Effects
in the Publick; and the Contagion hath
ſpread it ſelf ſo vaſtly, that there is hardly
any ſecurity left.</p>
               <p>Nor have the Dreadful Judgments of
God upon the firſt Inventers, the learned
Writings, and Sermons of the conformable
Clergy, nor any thing elſe that could
yet be thought of been able to put a
ſtop to it.</p>
               <p>Nay the Atheiſm, and Irreligion, which
the Obſervation of all this impious Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hath produced, joyned with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery
of the Times, have given a great
increaſe to it; ſo that now not only the
demure Hypocrite forſwears himſelf for
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56345:95"/>
the Glory of God, and the Good of his
Children; but the Atheiſt, when there is
occaſion, doth it by their Example, for his
Own ſweet ſake, and his Friends.</p>
               <p>But what will be the Effect of all this?
Without Oaths there can be no Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of Juſtice, no Determination of
Controverſies, and without Truth, and
Honeſty in thoſe Oaths, there can be as
little Juſtice in the Event. That Perjury
that did a man a Kindneſs to day, may
ruin him to morrow, and in probability
will do ſo. Beſides, no man almoſt can
mannage a Perjury ſo cunningly, but that
it will be known, not only to God, but to
ſome Men, who will afterwards diſtruſt
and hate that Man to the day of his Death;
even the Party, for whom he did it, will be
forever after jealous of him. So that a
Man that is once guilty of this Sin, if he
be not proſecuted for it by Publick Juſtice,
will yet be infamous, and ſuſpected by all
his Neighbours; ſo that if Men were Wiſe,
thô they did not fear God, yet to avoid
the Hatred, and diſtruſt of Men, they
would avoid this deteſtable Sin of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
               <p>But if they could conceal it from the
Knowledge of all Mankind, can they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their own Conſciences too? no ſure;
and if they did but mind it, they ſhould
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56345:95"/>
find many, who have afterwards had ſo
deep and grievous a ſenſe of this Sin, that
they have put an end to their own Lives
to eſcape the fury of it, others have died
Diſtracted and Diſpairing, and thoſe, that
have recovered by the Mercy of God, have
yet many of them lived miſerable, unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
uncomfortable lives ever after.</p>
               <p>And after all this the Judgments of God
Almighty come up in the Reer with a
Vengeance ſo much more heavy as it is the
flower. It is obſerved by the Author of the
Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon (Chap. 14. v.</hi> 30, 31.)
that thoſe Heathens, who ſwore falſly by
their Idols, were yet for thoſe Perjuries
puniſhed by the true God. <hi>For it is not</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>the Power of them by whom they
ſwear: but it is the juſt Vengeance of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that puniſheth always the offence of
Sinners.</hi> If the true God ſeemed thus
careful to preſerve Religion amongſt Men
by avenging the Injuries, that were done
to falſe Gods by thoſe that worſhipped
them as true, which he often did in pity
to the deceived World, becauſe without
Religion Communities would degenerate
into Bands of Thieves and Herds of Beaſts,
each one preying upon another, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no more Faith, than Neceſſity could
enforce, (as is well obſerved by the Author
of <hi>The Life of</hi> Agathocles) than by a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56345:96"/>
neceſſary Conſequence he is much more
obliged to aſſert his own honour baſely
abuſed by Pretended Chriſtians, and we
may be ſure he will, for he hath never yet
failed to do it.</p>
               <p>How many Princes truſting to the Papal
Abſolutions have been deſtroyed by their
own Perjuries? what did the Emperor
gain by the breach of his Faith at the
Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> or any other Prince
ſince? what did our Diſſenters Gain by all
their Perjuries between 40 and 60? what
are they the better for all thoſe they have
procured or abetted ſince, is not the hand
of God againſt them in all they undertake,
defeating all their Projects, and Deſigns,
and making them every day more Odious,
than others?</p>
               <p>For my part, I do not fear that perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Projects will ever prevail, or do any
body any good: but the Crime being
ſpread ſo vaſtly, I fear a National Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a Calamity that ſhall be as general
as the Sin, and then no man will be free
from ſuffering the ſad Effects of it, thô
thoſe that have procured it, will ſmart
moſt by it; and this is enough to oblige
every good Man, that loves his Countrey,
(eſpecially all Magiſtrates) to ſtand in the
gap, and to prevent the further Growth
of it, as much as is poſſible by diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56345:96"/>
it, and puniſhing it too, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſerve.</p>
               <p>Some are of Opinion, this Sin might be
ſtopped by a ſevere Law againſt it, but I
am of another mind; and I heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
more innocent than guilty Men
would ſuffer by it, if we had ſuch a Law,
becauſe theſe wicked Wretches make Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to uphold one another, and will lay
things ſo well together, that it is almoſt
impoſſible to diſcover the Cheat; and then
as for Oaths to prove them, that they
never want; whereas good Men are not
ſo vigilant, ſuſpecting as little ill, as they
mean, and ſo would be more expoſed to
the force of ſuch a Law.</p>
               <p>But as for Publick Officers (eſpecially
Conſtables, and ſuch like) I wiſh together
with their Oaths they might be compelled
to enter a Recognizance of the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
with their Oaths, which if it were
but of ſmall value as X, or XX <hi>lib.</hi> it
would work much upon them, and in a
great meaſure put a ſtop to this Impiety;
for ſome that do not reverence an Oath
wou'd yet fear to forfeit their Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,
and in time Religion would return
and take away the neceſſity of ſuch double
Obligations.</p>
               <p>As for Private Concerns there is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
proviſion made by a late Statute,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56345:97"/>
29 <hi>Car. 2. Cap.</hi> 3. and the extending it
to a few more particulars might be very
uſeful; and till this can be done, Men
muſt commit as little, as is poſſible to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
Teſtimonies, by taking all things they
can in Writing.</p>
               <p>2. Another of the beſt, and moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
means that is left to ſtop this inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Perjury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is for Magiſtrates to
expreſs a great deteſtation of it, not only
by their words, as Occaſion ſerve, but by
their Actions too, by ſhewing themſelves
to be exceeding Careful not to do any
thing, that is contrary to their Oaths, and
ſometimes giving that for a reaſon of it;
for that makes a greater impreſſion upon
the Minds of Men, than any words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, becauſe it is at once a Verbal and
a Practical Declaration, and their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
will make it the more taken Notice of
and regarded.</p>
               <p>The Oaths of Supremacy, and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
are ſo frequently Adminiſtred,
that I need not take any further notice
of them here, but that which more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
concerns the Juſtices of the
Peace, is as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:56345:97"/>
YE ſhall Swear that as Juſtice of the
Peace in the County of <hi>C.</hi> in all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
in the King's Commiſſion to you
directed, you ſhall do Egal Right to the
Poor, and to the Rich, after your Cunning,
Wit and Power, and after the Laws and
Cuſtoms of the Realm, and Statutes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
made: and ye ſhall not be of Councel of
any quarrel hanging before you: and that
ye ſhall hold your Seſſions after the form of
the Statutes thereof made. And the Iſſues,
Fines and Amerciments that ſhall happen to
be made; and all Forfeitures which ſhall
fall before you, ye ſhall cauſe to be entered
without any Concealment (or imbefilling)
and truely ſend them to the King's Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer;
ye ſhall not let for Guift, or other
Cauſe, but well and truly you ſhall do your
Office of Juſtice of the Peace in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half:
And that you take nothing for your
Office of Juſtice of the Peace to be done, but
of the King, and Fees accuſtomed, and Costs
limited by the Statute: And ye ſhall not
direct, nor cauſe to be directed any Warrant
(by you to be made) to the Parties, but
ye ſhall direct to the Bailiffs of the ſaid
County, or other the King's Officers (or
Miniſters) or other indifferent Perſons, to do
Execution thereof. <hi>So help you God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:56345:98"/>
You ſhall do <hi>Egal</hi> right] the very way
of Writing which word <hi>Egal</hi> inſtead of
<hi>Equal,</hi> ſhews this Oath is of great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and that it hath been very carefully
Tranſcribed, when there have been ſo
much ſcruple made of changing a <hi>G.</hi> into
a <hi>Q.</hi> according to the Latin, and our preſent
Authography, and it would be a burning
ſhame to us, if we that are Sworn ſhould
be leſs careful of the Articles in it, than
the Clerks have been of the Letters.</p>
               <p>And that ye ſhall hold your Seſſions]
how they can Anſwer it, to God or Man
I know not, who reſide in any County;
or act as Juſtices of the Peace in it, and
yet never appear at any Seſſions by the
ſpace of many years together, without
any lawful excuſe, or hindrance, or thoſe
who come and take the King's Wages, and
before half the Buſineſs is done, betake
themſelves to the Tavern, leaving two
or three to finiſh, and conclude the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
ſo that if any Controverſie ariſe, it
muſt be left to another time, or ended as
it can, rather than as it ought, it is
true neither of theſe Diſorders can be
Puniſhed by the Court, but then it is
becauſe the Law ſuppoſeth, that Men
of that Quality will not need it, but will
religiouſly obſerve their Oath, ſo that
the fault is ſo much the greater; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56345:98"/>
it cannot be Puniſhed, but by God
only.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not make any more Reflections
on this Oath, becauſe this whole Diſcourſe
is but a kind of Commentary upon it, and
whatever I have omitted is taken notice
of by <hi>Lambard,</hi> and other Writers.</p>
               <p>But the Care of a Magiſtrate ends not
in himſelf, but is to extend to Others,
and therefore he ought to take great
heed, that he miniſter none, but Lawful
and Neceſſary Oaths. Secondly, That if
he find Men ignorant, he give them good
Advice, and ſharp Reproofs in caſe of the
leaſt failure.</p>
               <p>By Lawful Oaths, I mean ſuch as the
Laws, and Cuſtoms of <hi>England</hi> will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him to give; and therefore before
he take an Oath, he ought to conſider
whether he have Power to do it; for
thô he hath a great, yet he hath not an
unlimited Power as is manifeſt by that
Parentheſis which is ſo frequent in our
Statutes (<hi>which Oath the ſaid Juſtices are
by this Act Authorized to Adminiſter</hi>)
which is repeated almoſt, as often as a
new Power is given them, and for the
moſt part in theſe very words. And yet
I doubt not, but when good Reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
where ever they may Hear and
Determine, they may do it upon Oath
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56345:99"/>
thô the Statute doth not ſo Expreſs it;
for they are to take the beſt care they
can that they be not deceived in what
they do by falſe Information, to which
end an Oath may be ſometimes abſolutely
neceſſary.</p>
               <p>But Magiſtrates are not only to avoid
Giving Oaths in all Caſes where they
have no Authority; but alſo in as many
of the reſt, as they can; I have read that
the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Country-Magiſtrates which
are like our Juſtices of the Peace, Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
almoſt all Caſes without Oaths, and
yet (if they are not corrupted by neither
Party) will by Queries, obſerving the
looks of Men, when they Anſwer.
Laying things together, and comparing
one thing with another, and by making
all the ſeveral Parties tell the Story
one after another, or ſo much of it
as they know, by theſe, I ſay, and
ſuch like Methods, they will ſo pick out
the Truth, that no Oath could do it half
ſo well. Now I know this Way is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome,
and will take time, but it will
diſcover the Truth ſometimes, when Oaths
would not, and ſave the Perjury too, and
ſo is worth the while. And I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
alſo, that Men who are in Paſſion
one againſt another, do little regard the
Religion of an Oath, and yet their
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56345:99"/>
very Paſſion will diſcover the Truth
without one, if a Magiſtrate will have
but a little Patience, and give them time
and liberty of Speech: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
Men do generally revere an Oath
when they are quiet, and undiſturbed, and
a Magiſtrate may beſt give an Oath
when they are in that temper, and
rely upon the truth of what they ſay.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Oaths would not be given in
things that are not of ſome Moment; It is
good to hear what a Perſon can ſay
before he is Sworn, and if it be nothing
to the purpoſe, then not to Swear him
at all; but if it be, then to Swear him,
and bid him tell the Story the ſecond
time, and obſerve if he vary, by which
means the Truth may be often found
out.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is good to bring things into
as narrow a compaſs, as is poſſible by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving,
wherein the Parties agree, and
wherein they differ before any Oath be
given, and this will determine many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
without an Oath, the Parties agreeing
at laſt about the Matter of Fact; and
if it will not, that only in which they
differ is to be proved upon Oath, which
will be liable to leſs hazard of Perjury than
the whole.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:56345:100"/>
If the Juſtice of Peace obſerves the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
who is to take an Oath be ignorant, or
young, it is good to ſhew him the Nature
of it in ſhort plain words, and to tell him
the Danger, and great Sin of Perjury,
and how ſevere God is againſt it, and
for that purpoſe to Alledge the Third
Commandment, or ſome other ſuch
like ſhort place of Scripture, which
will have great effect upon untainted
minds.</p>
               <p>If he finds at any time after an Oath
given, that any thing is ſpoken that is
not truth by the Party Sworn, it is good
to give the Party a grave ſharp reproof
at leaſt.</p>
               <p>It is an uſual thing not to grant a
Warrant of the Peace, but upon Oath
that the Party who requires it, doth
not do it upon Malice, but purely out
of fear. Yet if it be well obſerved,
there will be found many Inſtances of
Perjury in that caſe. And therefore I
think it were much better to grant a
Warrant to ſhew cauſe why the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Peace ſhould not be granted,
and ſo Examine the pretended fear
when both the Parties are face to face,
than to purſue the old Method of
Swearing the Complainant, and then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Warrant abſolute; Eſpecially, if
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56345:100"/>
there be not a grievous hurt, or ſome
other apparent cauſe for it. I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
found by this way of proceeding,
that I have prevented Perjury, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
an Innocent, and ſometimes an
Injured Perſon from Vexation; for it is
no unuſual thing for ill Men to Swear
the Peace againſt others by way of
Prevention, when they have given
them too much cauſe to do it to
themſelves: and at other times by way
of revenge; when they have for good
cauſe been forced to find Sureties.
Now in ſuch inſtances as theſe, it is
good to prevent men from being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
forſworn, even when they are too
much diſpoſed to it.</p>
               <p>And when all this care is taken,
there will be many Perjuries commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
how much more when there is none
of it? But the Juſtice of the Peace when
he hath done what he could to prevent
it, may comfort himſelf, and believe
that God will not lay another mans
Sin, which he could not hinder, to his
Charge: but if he Swear men raſhly,
and without due precaution, he as well
as they muſt without doubt bear a part
of the blame in the ſight of God.</p>

               <p>AND now I have with the greateſt

all thoſe Particulars. I thought fit
to Diſcourſe on, in relation to my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and thô it might have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
done by an abler Perſon, yet never
did any man enter upon any thing with
more ſincere, and candid intentions for
the Publick good.</p>
               <p>And all that remains, is to perſwade
thoſe that are or ſhall be <hi>Juſtices of
the Peace,</hi> to reflect ſeriouſly upon what
I have Written, and then if they do not
approve of my thoughts, they may yet
give them occaſion of others, and in
all likelihood much better, and it may
alſo poſſibly excite ſome other Perſon to
do it better, and ſo oblige the World,
and me in the firſt place.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time, I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
all Magiſtrates, that they would
ſeriouſly conſider Three things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That they are the Miniſters of
God, and that is ſo honorable a Title,
that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great took much
Pride in it; but then it will become
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56345:101"/>
them, that Wear it to act as ſuch, for
God is a ſevere Judge of Unprofitable
Servants, and much more of ſlothful
and wicked ones, for whom he hath
provided a Puniſhment equal to the
greatneſs of their offence, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
they do him.</p>
               <p>And on the other hand, none ſhall
enjoy more happineſs in Heaven, than
they who have not only been good
themſelves, but have laboured to make
others ſuch, by governing them with
Prudence, and Diſcretion here on Earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of their King, and it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Diſloyalty, and Infidelity imaginable
to pretend to Serve him, and then Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
him to his People, and deceive
him in the Truſt repoſed on them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The People whom they are to
govern, will certainly riſe up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt them, if they miſlead or
miſuſe them; for thô perhaps they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help themſelves for the preſent what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
injuries they ſuffer, yet their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
is mighty; and with him is no
reſpect of Perſons.</p>
               <p>And when all this is ſeriouſly thought
of, I do not fear that they will treat their
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56345:102"/>
                  <hi>Monitor</hi> unkindly, who had no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
in this, than to make them happy
here, and hereafter, by expoſing thoſe
Vices that prevail more in general, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Men for want of Precaution, than out
of any Affection they have to them.</p>

            <p>O Thou who art the Soveraign Judg of the
World, ſeeing it hath pleaſed thee to call me
into the Number of the inferior Judges in it, Grant,
that I may adminiſter Justice truely and indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to the puniſhment of Wickedneſs and Vice, and
to the maintenance of thy true Religion and Virtue.
And, to that end, enlighten my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding, that
I may chooſe what is Juſt, and Right in thy ſight,
without reſpect of Perſons; and purſue the ſame with
Courage, and Induſtry. Quiet all Diviſions amongſt
us, that we may not hinder each other, nor diſhonour
thee by our Contentions. Set a Watch, O Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my Mouth, and a Door with a Guard about my
Lips. Give me a meek, patient, humble ſpirit,
that I do nothing through Strife, or Vain-glory,
but that I may patiently hear, and ſubmit to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of others. And finally, in all things direct
thy Servant into thoſe things which may tend moſt to
thy Glory, the good of thy Church, the Service of
our Soveraign, and the Peace and Happineſs of my
Country, that when I ſhall appear before thy Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to receive an an Eternal Sentence, I may not periſh
forever, but that thou mayeſt Remember me for
Good, and ſpare me in that day. Grant this, O
Bleſſed Judg and Saviour, for thy own ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
