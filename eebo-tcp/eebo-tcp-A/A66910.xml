            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Discovery of a Terrible PLOT Against HULL, BY The Assignes of the Lord DIGBY, many Papists, and others of the malignant Party.</head>
            <p>EVer since Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the King from His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties intended entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hull, there hath beene an intestine grudge against the said Act: the King affirming it to be no
<pb facs="tcp:65013:3"/>
lesse then Treason against His Royall Person, to repell Him from His owne possessions, and an high and unheard of affront to His Majesty. But the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unanimously voted to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and confirmed that Act, but as a faithfull service performed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Both Houses of Parliament; and it would perspicuously appeare in the face of the World, so farre distant from the suppository Impeachment of Treason, that it would rather be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly asserted an Act of Loyalty to His Majesty, and accommodation to the whole Kingdome. These words it seems could not be digested by the swelling and angry Stomackes of the Papists and others of the malignanr party. And the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> understanding the truth hereof was much incensed, and being with a seeming indignity exasperated, confirmed his resolution to vindicate the same (if by any politique stratagem it could be circumvented:) The Plot
<pb facs="tcp:65013:3"/>
was as nefarious, as prodigious, as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as suspitious, that they had clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly intended against Hull; Two Ships laden with strong provision of Armes, and other Ammunition, came by the Sea, under a pretended colour of Merchants Ships from the Indies, and the like: and they had also Spices and other things in the Ship, that their Plot might be concealed, and detected the better and with more oppertunity: and being searched, they had not suspected any thing, but that by great chance they perceived a Barrell or two of Powder, and making farther search in the said Ships, they found great store of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Armes, which they intended to have had executed at Night against Hull, if they had not been prevented: but they were apprehended immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and carried before the Mayor of Hull, who committed them to safe custody. Then besides, these 5 Papists went under a disguised color of a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mittee at York,
<pb facs="tcp:65013:4"/>
appointed by the Parliament to sit there, and under pretence also, that being threatned Imprisonment by his Majesty, they were constrained to fly thither for security, and th<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>refore desired them to open the Gates for them. But a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment man that was in Hull, viewing them, denied them to be Parliament men; whereupon they fled immediately, otherwise they had been apprehended. There was 100 Horfe, and 300 Foot lying in Ambush thereabouts: and if the Gates had been but once opened, they would immediately have assaulted the Towne. But God of his infinite mercy be praysed and glorified, who hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered all the Plots of those that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend evill, and my prayers shall for ever continue, that he may alwaies discover the same.</p>
