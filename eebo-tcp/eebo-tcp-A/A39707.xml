            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He puts off himself with his clothes, and never assumes himself agen (not so much as in the Tyring-house) till the Play be done. There is as much difference betwixt him and a common Actor, as betwixt a Ballad-singer
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54697:3"/>
and an excellent Musician; t'one onely mouthing it, whilst t'other artfully varies and modulates his voice; knowing all his graces even to how much breath he is to give to every syllable. He has all the parts of an excellent Orator, (animating his words with speaking, and speech with action) his Auditors being never more delighted then when he speaks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor more sorry then when he holds his peace. Yet even thên he is an excellent Actor still, not falling in his part when he has done his speech, but with his looks and gesture main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it still unto the heighth: imagining <hi>age quod agis</hi> onely spoke to him; so as whosoever calls him a Player does him wrong, no man being less idle, nor more imploy'd then he; his whole life being nothing else but Action, with onely this difference from other men; that as what is a play to them is his business, so what is their business is but a play to him.</p>

He visits them in their Chambers a nights (when they are going to bed) and a mornings e're they are up: nor can they be quiet in their Clossets for him. No excuse of business, sleep, nor taking physick, nor that ye are gone abroad (though you your self shud tell him so) can keep him out; no nor a Guard of <hi>Switz</hi> at door can do't, for he'l enter like a Witch by the chimney, or like a Spirit, the doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if he be thus troublesome at home, much more does he trouble them abroad, (where he thinks he has more liberty) for wheresoever you go, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows you like your shadow, and crouds himself into your Coach whether you will or no.

too much Passion to have any Reason for what he sayes, and heats and grows red hot present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with thunder in his voice and lightning in his eyes: impatient of contradiction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting every one; so as <hi>Faith</hi> that remove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From question of things he comes to question of names, and from thence to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naming them, so as by degrees at last he quite loses himself, and the state of the question too. And such as these they are who have so rent the Church with their hot Disputations, and made the breach so wide, as that which at first like <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> was onely divided by an individual Line, becomes at last the whole Heavens distant, by their indiscreet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the extremity of either Pole.</p>

They were much out of their way, who feign'd a Waggoner in Heaven, when with far more reason they might have feign'd one in Hell: for he is more churlish then <hi>Charon,</hi> and more exacting money for his fare.

Onely in this he is like <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> or the Charioter of Heaven, in that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes brings night with him to his journeys end. Nor has t'other (for all his twelve

Houses) so many Inns as he, to bait at on the way. Besides, he is more inexorable then the Sun; for <hi>Ioshua</hi> with calling to him once, could make him stay, which you can never do hîm, though you should call your heart out for't. In fine, he is a very tyrant when he gets you in his Waggon once, and sets as many Impositions on his passengers; amongst the rest he has one Tax call'd <hi>Drink-guelt,</hi> which he levies on the first four places in his Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon; and were you forty he promises unto you all.</p>
               <p>Now whether this be a <hi>Flemish</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> Waggoner, there lies the Riddle; onely thîs looks bigger and keeps more state, as one who may be one of myn <hi>Heers</hi> in time, whilest t'other will never be but one of the Rascal rout.</p>

What colour soever his Livery is of, he wears mourning Linnen still, and he and the Dog lie together, and are Correlatives. He swears and lies naturally, but steals nothing, onely all that he can lay hands on, and (if you lay not hands on him the sooner) runs away with it when he has done. Though for running it is the worst quality he has, in lieu of which he vaults up behinde the Coach as nimbly, and with as great facility, as an <hi>Ape</hi> or <hi>Tumbler</hi> behinde his master. For his Soul he has so little care of it, as he is alwayes giving it to the Devil; and has so little care of his Body too, as he is alwayes running to the <hi>Burdello,</hi> till at last one running mars another, and he's laid up in an Hospital, and there's an end of him.</p>

She knows no Judge but the Groom Porter, nor Law, but onely the Law o'th' Game; in which she is so expert as they appeal to her, as from subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Judges to the supremer ones. She loves Winter more then Summer, because it affords more Gamesters; and Christmas more then any other time, because there is more Gaming thên. She gives more willingly to the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, then poor Folks box; and is never more Religious, then when she prayes that she may win. She imagines she is at play even when she is at Church, and takes her Beads for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, her Prayer Book for Cards, and thinks she's shuffling when she turns o're the leaves.

And she would play like <hi>Nero</hi> with the Town on fire; or like <hi>Archimaedes</hi> when t'were a sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rather then interrupt her Game.

               <head>Character 9. Of a Curious Glutton.</head>
               <p>THe total sum of his life is in his Bill of Fare, and he thinks all <hi>Solomons</hi> wisdom consisted in nothing else, (he knew the nature of all Fish, Beasts and Fowl, and Herbs, Trees and Plants so well.) He counts the <hi>Italian</hi> the onely wise Nation for faring so deliciously as they do, and calling a Wise man <hi>huom de buon gusto,</hi> or one that has a good taste of things. He undertakes to tell you not onely what you should eat and drink, but also how you shud eat and drink it too; and is ready to snatch his <hi>Ruffs</hi> and <hi>Goodwits</hi> out of your mouth, when he sees you swallow them greedily and ravenously; and is mad if you drink not his <hi>Verdea</hi> or <hi>Frontinack</hi> as chickens do their water, with often lifting up your eyes to Heaven. For the rest he is of a good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quiet disposition, hating all disputes, since <hi>there is no Dispute of Tastes</hi>; and for disputes of Religion, so they allow but of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, he is indifferent for any one. His chiefest Religion consists in keeping a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54697:9"/>
                  <hi>Calendar</hi> of the Moneths and Dayes when se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Meats come in season, which he observes as devoutly as the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> do their Calendar of Saints. In fine, he thinks of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else as long as he lives, and when he dyes, onely regrets that Funeral Feasts are quite left off, else he should have the pleasure of one Feast more (in imagination at least) even after death; which he can't indure to hear of, onely because they say, there is no eating nor drinking in the other world.</p>

Mass done, he waits upon her to her Coach, then home where he dines; so as he makes his Body serve his Spirits, and not his Spirits his Body. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner he dresses himselfe agen for the <hi>Tour a la mode,</hi> where he falutes with good grace, and has the jolly rencounters on the way: Then to the <hi>Ball,</hi> where he utters such Douceurs and delicate Conceits, as 'tis a very Banquet for Ladies ears.
