            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST REVEREND FATHER in God RICHARD, by the grace of God Archbishop of Canterbury, one of his Maiesties most Honorable Privie Councell, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of the Vniversitie of Oxford, Primate of all England, and Metropolitane.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AY it please your <hi>Grace</hi> to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that although, being so little knowne to your Grace as I am, it may seem that I make over bold, so to present this Treatise ensuing: yet, as my selfe am persuaded, divers good reasons there be, that doe occasion me, so farre this once to presume on your Graces goodnes therein; both in respect of a former interest, and of the present matter besides.</p>
            <p>The former interest that now I speake of, is, that by the place that then he was in, your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces immediate Predecessor, had this Treatise in
<pb facs="tcp:7444:3"/>
his hands a good while together, many yeeres since; and to be his, if so it should stand with his Graces pleasure: and afterward, when hee saw his time, approued of the publishing of it, and so to doe at mine owne discretion. Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing (by occasion) I thought not so good, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> presently to doe, as to awaite a farther opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which then began to offer it selfe vnto mee. In the meane season it hath pleased God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to take him of from his labours and travells here, and thus otherwise to furnish the roome that he had. In which alteration, besides that no way I haue any cause to varie: I may not deny, but that now I finde iuster cause so to proceed, then I had in the other before.</p>
            <p>In the present matter besides, it is very plaine, that there is some question of it: &amp; then are such Treatise as are thereof, in bounden duty to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waite the censure of such other approued iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as to whome in such case it doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Wherein it having hitherto orderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to that wherevnto it is come already, it was meetest so to finish the course likewise: &amp; so actually to acknowledge, that arising here, &amp; hence proceeding, it was most to submit it selfe vnto, and to await your Graces censure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7444:3"/>It may be also, that even in godly pollicie (by our Superiors) it will be thought meete, to take some farther order to preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the evill, that so free a passage of that other course may seem to threa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten: &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the better opportunity that God hath give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your G. to such purpose, the lesse could I in any duty or reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue turn'd aside to any other.</p>
            <p>God long preserue your Grace among vs, to the glorie of God, to the good of his Church, &amp; to your owne comfort withall in him. </p>

               <pb facs="tcp:7444:4"/>3 When afterward the law was given to those that followed, though nowe that matter were made a great deale more plaine vnto them, than it was before: yet they also did as little finde what they had to doe therein; as did the others that had not the light that was given vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They were Hebrews themselves, &amp; the Law was given in their own mother-tongue: the Text it selfe must needs be very plain unto them, &amp; some (we may hope) were dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the study of it, &amp; that with vnfained desire to know it, and in the feare of God withal; and yet, it appeareth, they did not see this that we speake of Curious they were (for diverse of them) in many things else of lesse importance, which without any breach of the law of God they might haue omitted; but their diligence &amp; watchfull heeding of all those Books, words, syllables, letters, &amp; characters also (or the maner of writing thereof) &amp; even in the number of many words how oft they were vsed, did never yet (for ought that we find in any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) attaine vnto this.<note place="margin">Deut. 24.1.4.</note> In one place it is cleere (we speake now but of the Original, that is, of the Hebrew Text it selfe; &amp; not of the Translations that since haue beene in vse among vs) that <hi>Moses</hi> did no more but only make mention of an vsage that they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, of putting away their wiues on dislike, and marrying againe, he doth (I say) but only speake of it, and doeth nothing at all approue it vnto them, nor alloweth them so to do: and yet a sort of the learned of them in the time of Christ (and so belike of old likewise) did plainelie shew, that they did take it, that <hi>Moses</hi> had allowed them, or given the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their liberty so to doe.<note place="margin">Mat 19 7. Mat. 10.4.</note> Howbeit there is faire ods, betwixt a bare mentioning of an vsage among them (though then also he go not against it) &amp; to approue the same vnto them: &amp; in many other things, there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb facs="tcp:7444:5"/>
(at the least, as they might be chosen) but themselues would soone haue perceiued a lesser and a daintier diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence then this. And herein they haue the Text it selfe in plaine tearmes to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> over, in that which they would build vpon it; even the very words themselues chasing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from that persuasion of theirs.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">Lev. 18.18.</note>4 In another place indeed the words are for them, so far forth that they may seeme, to haue the sense with them also: namely, that there they are not forbidden, to take vnto them any more but one wife at once. For the words are but only of taking a sister to the wife that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> already hath: insomuch that it only may seeme to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; that is, a man to take vnto him a couple of sisters to haue them both in marriage together. But if the place had beene better considered, and conferred with other Scriptures, besides, then might they haue found, that the more likely sense of that place had beene to haue forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them, when any man had one wife already then to take another vnto her. For first, that thereby wee should be forbidden to take in marriage two naturall sisters, may seeme to be no part of the meaning: partly, because of somewhat that goeth a little before; and partly in respect of some other considerations that here wee haue in this place it selfe. That which goeth a little before, is, for that in the next verse but one before, it is forbidden to marry the brothers wife:<note place="margin">Lev. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>6.</note> which in equitie may serue for this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, to forbid vnto vs our wiues sister. Those considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that we haue in this place it selfe, are the reasons that here are given: and the limitation that is vsed therewith. The reasons are two: to afflict her withall; and to vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her shame vpon her. Which of all others doe least a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to naturall sisters, for that, if a woman could brooke

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, she could best away with her owne sister in those respects: the one, of that greater loue that by course of nature is betwixt those that are so neere; the other, for that such are (for the most part in all such matters) most familiarly acquainted also. The limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>so long as shee liveth,</hi> hath no place (without some harder construction of it) but only in this sense that now we speake of, for that by that former law of the brothers wife which is set downe without any such limitation, we are forbidden to match so neere, after death likewise. But then, that this other should seeme to bee the sense of it, is much more likely, both for that it doth so fitly agree to the institution of marriage it selfe at the first: and for that it is not, in the law, elsewhere forbidden generaly, to haue at once more wiues than one. Vnto kings it is;<note place="margin">Deut. 17.17.</note> but not generally vnto al: and of it might they haue reasoned, that if it were forbidden vnto kings (who, in divers respects, might most of all haue it allowed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) then were it much more forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to al others besides. If the maner of speech might be thought, iustly to hinder them from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing such a sense thereon, because the text nameth but <hi>a sister,</hi> though that kinde of speech may bee somewhat strange vnto vs, to carry such a meaning with it; yet was it not so vnto them, for that in their speech it was often vsed: as, of <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 26.31.</note> one swearing to another, of <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 26.3.5.</note> curtaines that are fellowes, of a <note n="c" place="margin">Ezec 19 23 &amp;. 3.13.</note> paire of wings, and of <note n="d" place="margin">locl. 2.8,</note> souldiers that march together in their aray. In all which (and in divers places besides, as Arias Montanus, and Tremellius, and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius haue noted) the Hebrew word is, <hi>brother</hi> or <hi>sister</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der therein doth require) for that which we say <hi>one another,</hi> or some such like, in things especially that goe by paiers, couples, or fellowes. So that in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

it is a wonder to see, that they never found their Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamie to be forbidden, when as yet notwithstanding the institution of wedlock at the first, and the proprietie of their own tongue did lead them vnto it: and an advised consideration of the place it selfe did so strongly hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, and chace them away from that sense that they would giue it.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Since which time, there is greater light bestowed on vs: eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on vs al generally, for al matters of learning; &amp; on many of vs, the knowledge of the Gospel also, in plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful I measure. And yet in this that now I speake of, we are almost as blinde as they. We doe not see but that it was allowed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to put away their wiues (in divers cases) and to marry againe: and make no question, but that in one case, Christ himselfe doth allow it likewise. And wee leane so much vnto this, that many of vs are almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, that the other also is no where forbidden vnto vs. At least in this place, we never finde it, notwithstanding the help that now we haue in the knowledge of the tong it selfe, &amp; whatsoever diligence we haue in weighing the Text, and in conferring one place with another: no, not when by other occasion (as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the question is, whether two sisters may be taken in wedlocke, one after another) we are specially vrged to looke into it. In so much that when as for that sense we are something crossed by those reasons and limitation that are ioined withall: yet doth that also helpe vs but little to find out the sense that now we speake of. Which for my part, I cannot see, wherevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we may rather ascribe, then to our own corruption of nature: being so much giuen (as we are) to that kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; and, our selues to haue change likewise. And the lesse marvel, when we haue such beames in our eies alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb facs="tcp:7444:6"/>
if we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so hardly see, that the bond of mariage should be of any such force vnto vs, as it is indeed.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Herevpon, when time was, and the present occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did so require, in a Sermon I breefly noted, that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, that in these our daies many doe take, of divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their wiues for adulterie and marying of others, had not such warrant in the worde of God as they thought that it had: and afterward, when that was hardly taken, I did more fully deliver the same in two other Sermons, only of it. Which then also being hardly taken by some, and not so fully allowed by others, as the truth of the doctrine might well haue expected: gathering thereby, that such were like to be the iudgement of others in that point also, and hauing good cause therein to extend that warning further, I thought good since, to write a little more fully of it, and so to let it goe forth vnto all. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore thou be married already, or art hereafter to enter into it, keepe vnitie now, and make thy choice so well as thou canst: and I, for my part, would never wish thee to conceiue any hope at all, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once that knot is rightly knit, thou canst afterward haue any vndoubted or certaine warrant, that for the adultery of thy wife (if it should fall out, that thy case should bee so hard) thou maist be at liberty to marry againe. For the farther open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which matter, I now refer thee to the Treatise it selfe. And so in the Lord I hartily bid thee well to fare.</p>

            <head>An Advertisement to the Reader.</head>
            <p n="1">1 COncerning this Treatice, wheras it is of such an argument, as wherein divers of great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning haue already dealt, and yet my selfe had done thus much therein many yeeres since (though I did never publish it til now) I haue thought it needfull, gentle Reader, to acquaint thee somewhat farther with either of them: both how it came to passe, that I also haue thus far entermedled therewith; and whervpon it was, that it hath (as it were) kept in til now. That I haue thus far entermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therewith, it arose first, out of the nature of the thing it selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but then, somewhat farther of, by occasion. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of these was, that a gentleman of those parts wherein most I reside, having such a purpose with him, and having already gotten (into a little paper-book of his) the handes of sundrie of the Preachers of those parts, came to me also therewith, and desired my hand likewise: his case there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that for adultery by his wife committed, he might sue the divorce, &amp; marry againe. His request I denied, &amp; gaue him some reason why so I did: but perceiving then, that I did not content him, a while after I wrote vnto him a few sheetes of paper of that matter; &amp; so rested all the passage that was betwixt vs. The latter of them was, that the most reverend Father (that in those parts then was) being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Visit, requested me to preach at the beginning of that his visitation: wherein, among other things more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prosequuted, I gaue a little touch to that point also; namely, that whereas divers were perswaded, that for adul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tery they might sue the divorce, and marry againe, &amp; some accordingly so did, if the matter were wel examined, that liberty would not (in my iudgement) be found, to haue any vndoubted warrant at al in the word of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There had beene a few yeeres before, of one family
<pb facs="tcp:7444:7"/>
(but indeed, one of the greatest in those parts) or thervnto appertaining, about fowre several persons, and those of some note besides, who had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so gotten divorce, &amp; were married againe. And besides those (who, it may be, had else where mo fellowes also, than that heady course any waie deserved) an other there was of more speciall reckoning tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they, who so got divorce against his wife also, &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried an other: on whose behalfe, on that my warning then publikely given, I found there was more dislike conceived, than might well arise on so easie a course, as (in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) then was taken. Wherevpon I then resolved, when my time should be to occupie that place again, seeing that little warning was thought so strange then, so to vnfolde the matter it selfe whence it arose, as that the Auditorie might better perceiue, there was some reason, why it was given. That time fell out to be some few months after; at which time I only dealt in that matter, and made two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of it: at that time shewing, that the said presupposed liberty, so to put away their wiues for adultery, &amp; to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againe, was altogither without warrant in the word of God; and, divers other waies, faultie besides.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Herevpon the matter began to worke: at home; &amp; abroad. At home, though most of the Auditory were glad to heare the matter opened so farre as it was, and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved wel of it: yet there wanted not also, who having some of their waies called into some question thereby, were much offended; one carrying himselfe so inordinatly ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that for it he was for a time committed. At which time (I meane, while that matter was in hearing, for which the party aforesaid was committed) there fell out this accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t also. The honourable Personage, who then was in chiefe place for the execution of iustice there, by occasion obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vnto me, that although such liberty had no warrant
<pb facs="tcp:7444:8"/>
in the word of God, yet did the lawes of our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try allow it whervnto I answered againe, that his H. might perceiue that was not so, for that neither those second wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were allowed any dowrie, nor their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be legitimate. His H. therin could not be said by me, but told me I was much deceived therein till some of the Councel (then present) told him, that it was indeed as I had said.</p>
            <p n="4">4 See now the good nature, &amp; plaine dealing of that Noble Gentleman, right noble in deede. A right learned man (and of good parts besides) of this our own countrie, had before imparted, on speciall suit, to the gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that before we spake of, his iudgement (in writing) of the same matter; not, by putting to his hand to the gentlemans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some-booke, as others before, nor in some few lines of his owne framing, which in such case is likewise vsed: but in a Treatice or Book, of iust volume (&amp; the most learned, that any yet, in that course, hath written) and so, with all of that sort, of special reckoning; even an vndoubted warrant to hold on the way that themselues so much affected, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed to be allowed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherein he is in deed more copious than others, to shew that many haue been of the same opinion: but in the principles or groundes of that whole building, the common reading and iudgment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, so far prevailed with him likewise, it seemeth, that so his resolution was nothing so sutable, to that learning &amp; iudgement of his, as otherwise it was like to haue beene. This Booke fairely written had the same gentleman (as I vnderstood) delivered to that Noble Personage, his Lord and Master, so to let him see, how cleere and warrantable that course was, that he &amp; others then were in. This Book did that Noble Personage cause one of his attendants the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fetch: and presently he gaue the same vnto me; as giving vp therewith, all the good liking, that of that opinion hee
<pb facs="tcp:7444:8"/>
had before conceived.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Abroad it so wrought likewise, that besides diverse others, one in the South parts (for this that we speake of, was done in Yorke) in the heart thereof, and one of the chiefe in those partes also, hearing in some sort what I had there of that matter delivered, sent vnto me to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with my notes: which I also accordingly sent; and heard, that there they were approued. But thereby and otherwise perceiving, that not only many of the learned were carried away with the oversight &amp; preiudice of those learned that were for that presupposed liberty, and with the revere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their persons (which indeed, in many good respects, was in great measure due vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) &amp; that some farther notice thereof was needfull to be given to others likewise: I therevpon gathered this present Treatise, and sent it vp to my Lords Grace of Canterburie that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was; to be published also, if so it should stand with his Graces pleasure. For the matter, his answere (I heard) was, that he was of the same minde himselfe: I heard likewise, that hee imparted the same to some others of special note, &amp; place; and that they were of the same minde also. But as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the publishing of it, that hee thought not good so to doe: yet giving no other reason then, but that hee would haue as few controversies in the Church as might be; and that others had offered a Treatise of contrarie iudgement which he had staied (that, of the learned mans that before wee spake of; and great golden meanes vsed, to haue had it allowed) and should then be thought partiall, if never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse he should haue admitted of this.</p>
            <p n="6">6 So there it lay for certaine yeeres, out of my hands: and I, having done my endeavor, to haue entered in by the dore of orderly proceeding; would not then attempt to clime in by a window of any inordinate course whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
<pb facs="tcp:7444:9"/>
Neverthelesse to make some vse of that time also, whereas that learned man that before I spoke of, had by occasion written a set Treatise of that matter affirmatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I thought good to acquaint him also, with that which I had conceived thereof negatiuely: and to that end both sent him a copie of that Treatise of mine, and by my letter sent withall, desired him to let me vnderstand, if hee found any thing therein that was not sound. The Treatise, &amp; my letter withall were both delivered: but the satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I received thence againe, was no more, but that, some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable time after, by another friend of mine, that Treatise of mine was sent mee againe, with this answere, that the partie to whome it was sent, saw no cause yet, said hee, to be of other opinion therein, then hee was of before; that other friend of mine in such sort advising and wishing me besides, as that thence I might easily gather, that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise it selfe was not so welcome, as I had hoped it might haue beene.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Speeding none otherwise there, then did I soone after put his Grace in mind, whether, as that kind of loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse began then to grow bold and heady, it were not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal dealing, to stay that which by good right might wel proceed, and was needfull too, for that which might not, and were not without danger besides. To that I had no answere, neither was it material I should: but I noted, that soone after there was some farther order taken for it, by publike authority. Others also of good reckoning, I heard, began openly to deale therein: both in one of their chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest assemblies of all this land; and, in exercise of learning, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Vniversitie it selfe likewise. Wherevpon taking occasion againe, to put his Grace in mind of that Treatise of mine, whether yet his Grace could not like of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of it, his Grace the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> readily sent it vnto me, with his
<pb facs="tcp:7444:9"/>
good leaue to publish it all: at which time there was an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impediment (which most did stay him) cleane remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But then me selfe was already advised of an other good opportunity, the benefit whereof, to the better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of it, my hope was then, that I might in reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time attaine vnto: &amp; therevpon thought it best, to stay it farther with me, till then.</p>
            <p n="8">8 In which meane time, some of the favorits of that liberty, by stealth or secret meanes, haue gotten a Copie of the Treatice of that learned &amp; reverend man aforesaid, to be printed and published: and, by such meanes as they haue vsed, haue dispersed, and imparted the same vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. By which inordinate course of theirs, there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but that diverse may bee endangered: as making no doubt, but that, as that indeed was his iudgement; so his learning, and their inclination meeting so fitly &amp; kindly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, the truth of the matter must needs be so also.</p>
            <p n="9">9 True it is, that many of the learned haue beene, and yet are, of that opinion, &amp; accordingly haue interpreted, &amp; yet doe, such Scriptures as they haue conceived to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine therevnto: but it is as true withal, that as many of the learned againe, if not far mo, haue beene, and are, of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion, and haue otherwise vnderstoode, &amp; yet doe, those Scriptures aforesaid. And as some other Territories or several Churches, it may be, there are, who are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that in such case divorce may be, &amp; marrying again: so is it as evident too that the governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this Church of ours, &amp; so of many others besides (if the same may not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceived of the whole generally) doth not allow it So that in truth if we go to the opinion or iudgement of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is no questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but that the matter is very hard to bee decided: but so far, as the more generall &amp; setled iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, may cast the balla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: as also in those Scriptures the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues,
<pb facs="tcp:7444:10"/>
which at the first sight doe seeme most properly to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain therevnto, we haue the same difficulty also, vnlesse we repaire vnto those others besides, as whereby we may see see, that such sense doth hardly agree to some other duties that are required.</p>
            <p n="10">10 The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troversie therefoe standing in such case as it doth, and so many being so ready to take fast hold of so plausible a liberty, and so little regarding so great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience as inseparably goeth with that opinion of theirs: as it was a cleere case with me before, that both the matter it selfe had need to be farther looked into, &amp; that people did need to be warned of the danger that was therein, so it is still; and so much the more now, as this inordinate course of theirs may bee more dangerous to many of our owne Country-men here. And so far as the occasion hereof did set it selfe a working in those Northern parts of ours, &amp; I therevpon accounted my selfe, in conscience and in dutie bound, to giue such warning as then I did: so far now, the like occasion being in these parts also so plainely given, I thought it my duty, to resume, or take vnto mee that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose againe; &amp; now to discharge that point of duty, so far at the least, as in my hands it should ly to do. But now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter is, among the learned, in question alreadie, and they are much more able, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I, that haue it in hand, &amp; in all respects very well furnished to such a purpose, that I may not seem, now to take part, but rather to respect, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> originally, the truth it selfe, I haue thought good to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the presse, that very coppy of that my Treatise, that was then (those many yeeres since) vnder the view, to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether with the Preface thereto, and the date thereof that it had before. So now I cease, and commend thee to God.</p>

            <head>THE CONTENTS OF THE TREATICE ensuing, according to the severall Sections thereof.</head>
            <p>THe Argument of the whole Treatise following: and, that there bee two sorts of places whereon those of the learned do rest, that are for Divorce or Adultery, a marrying againe, Sect. 1.</p>
            <p>What those places are whereon so they build. Sect. 2.</p>
            <p>How ready divers are, without any farther enquirie first made, to rest thereon. Sect. 3.</p>
            <p>That such as are of that opinion haue little ground-worke even in their Leaders, for that they are so much crossed by others as therein they are. Sect. 4.</p>
            <p>How doubtfull resolutions the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues also for that matter haue. Sect. 5.</p>
            <p>Vpon how weake reasons they haue growne to such resolution. Sect. 6.</p>
            <p>What Protestations they vse withall. Sect. 7.</p>
            <p>What we are to thinke thereof: namely, that where such things go with all, there is no likelyhood to finde any certainety of Doctrine whereon to build (especially, in so weighty a case as this.) Sect. 8.</p>
            <p>Briefly declared that those places do little helpe: &amp; that they do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mistake those two that seemed to be strongest for them. Sect. 9.</p>
            <p>How those places of Scripture are taken by them. Sect. 10.</p>
            <p>That, in such sort taking those places (it may well be) they did mistake them: both that of Deutrronomie. Sect. 11.</p>
            <p>And that other of Malachie also. Sect. 12.</p>
            <p>What our selues are to gather, on that their so taking of them. Sect. 13.</p>
            <p>In those places that most are for marrying againe, that they are so crossed by others, that those also are, likely to helpe them but little. Sect. 14.</p>
            <p>How farre they may be charged therein: namely, that their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes are such, as well may make their iudgement suspected. Sect. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7444:11"/>How weakely they reason in such things as are in question, and so of the substance of the matter it selfe. Sect. 16.</p>
            <p>How weakely they reason likewise in such things as are but acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie therevnto. Sect. 17.</p>
            <p>How weakly they reason on certaine other things also, as are of such a kinde or so neere vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as that thence they draw certain reasons also. Sect. 18.</p>
            <p>How, when they come the word it selfe, they much mistake it. Sect. 19.</p>
            <p>That on some places also they gather amisse: first Erasmus. Sect. 20.</p>
            <p>Then, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Beza also. Sect. 21.</p>
            <p>How weakly they do reason likewise on the authority of men. Sect. 22.</p>
            <p>That they haue divers inconvenient and hard speeches besides: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Erasmus (who, in this age of ours, was if not the first, yet the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test motioner of this matter) Sect. 23.</p>
            <p>Then also, certaine others of that company. Sect. 24.</p>
            <p>In the places themselues, first of that sense that they conceiue of them. Sect. 25.</p>
            <p>Then, what we may thinke to be their meaning in deed: and first of that in the fift of S. Matthew. Sect. 26.</p>
            <p>Then, of that other place in the 19. of the said S. Matthew. Sect, 27.</p>
            <p>In such doubts as may be conceived, that the Exception in such sense as we conceiue it, will nothing at all helpe them. Sect. 28.</p>
            <p>In the sense wherein they conceiue it, that it will helpe them but little also. Sect. 29.</p>
            <p>And in such case that they also must be very well advised, and take good heed what they do therein. Sect. 30.</p>
            <p>And that they doe nothing against any other Scripture, which they haue strong against them. Sect. 31.</p>
            <p>Nor against convenience neither, which in that case they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide. Sect. 32.</p>
            <p>That whereas the Apostle also permitteth the faithfull (by an infidell forsaken) to marry againe, that it also doth nothing helpe them. Sect. 33.</p>
            <p>The Conclusion. Sect. 34.</p>

               </note> I make no doubt of it, but that soone we may finde so good matter for the contrary part, that whosoever shall indifferently consider of it, he will not easily afterwarde thinke, that hee findeth in any of that opinion, matter of worth to drawe him backe to that perswasion againe. Which while we shall endevour to shew, because manie themselues being given to that fleshly libertie, doe never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse shrowd themselues vnder the iudgment of those learned that favour the same; therefore it shall be needful (the better to free them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that preiudice) not to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whatsoever weaknes wee finde in the iudgement of those that are for it: though otherwise they be (by verie good right) of that reckoning with vs, that we ought to vphold their credit, the best that we may. But because the truth ought to be much dearer vnto vs, and seeing it is a wonted pollicie in Sathan, by the principal men (so neere as he can) to hatch &amp; reare vp his errors among vs: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dearer the truth is vnto vs, &amp; the more wee should take heed, that we doe not beare with the error of any, the bolder may wee be in this case also, so farre-forth as the nature of the case shall require, to examine their iudgment, and not to spare for that smal discredit that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them may arise thereby. Which that we may do, with more perspicuitie vnto the cause that we haue in hand, I hold it best, that wee consider severally of those two sorts of places of Scripture that before we spake of, that so we may more plainely see how little warrant that perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath in either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: notwithstanding whatsoever helpe it hath in those learned,<note place="margin">What those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are, that be for divorce.</note> that are so much for it as they are.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In the former sort of places therefore wee are to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7444:12"/>
consider, not only of the places themselues that are by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the learned alleadged in defense of such divorce: but also how weakely that same perswasion is grounded on them. The places themselues are, some of them such, as most of the learned doe make little reckoning of them to confirme that doctrine to any: but others of them such as they do take to be of speciall force to that end; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly leane not a little to them. Those that are such as of which most of themselues do make little reckoning to confirme that point of doctrine to anie, are two: one, in Ecclesiasticus; the other, fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (in the vulgar Latin tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation) in the Proverbs of Salomon. That which is in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticus, is diversly read: but the effect is this, that it willeth the husband if the wife wil not be ruled by him, to <hi>put her away.</hi> But this booke is not Canonicall:<note place="margin">Eccl. 25.35.36.</note> wherevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as not many of themselues do seeke any helpe thereby, so we also will not waste any needlesse labour about it. The other that (in the vulgar Latine Translation) is found in the Proverbs, is,<note place="margin">Pro. 18.22.</note> that <hi>qui tenet adulteram stultus est &amp; insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piens</hi>: that is, he that keepeth with him an adulteresse, is a foole and vnwise. But because this also is not found in the Originall, and may be vnderstoode of such harlots as divers hold, but not by mariage, therefore as it is of no force in deed, so doe most of them relinquish also the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it: and therefore we likewise will not go any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against it. Those others that they take to be of special force to that end, and accordingly leane not a little vnto them, are divers, and all of them found in those Bookes that are Canonicall, and therefore not to be denied to be of sufficient authority so far as they go. But the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are to note therewith, that whereas there are 6. of them in all, 4. of them they accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of lesse importance. And chiefly rest
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7444:13"/>
in the other two. Those foure that are of lesse importance are of two sorts, some that hardly censure, that a Priest should marry with a woman divorced; others, that shew the goodnesse of God to be much greater towards them in that kind, then was theirs towards their wiues when so they offended. Those two that doe so hardly censure that a Priest should marry a divorced woman, are Lev. 21.7. &amp; <hi>Ezech. 44.22.</hi> whereof the former doth plainely forbid it:<note place="margin">Lev. 21.7.</note>
               <note place="margin">Ezec. 44.22</note> and the other doth greatly disgrace it also. For the former is, that the Priest (among others) may not marry with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>quae repudiata est à marito, quia co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secratus est Deo suo. &amp;c:</hi> that is, such a one as is divorced from her husband, because he is consecrated vnto his God. The latter likewise is, that the Lord promising such a Priesthood, as should diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walke in the ordinances that he delivered vnto them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things he reciteth that also, that <hi>repudiatas non accipient vxores,</hi> that is, that they should not take such as were divorced, to bee their wiues. Those two others that doe shewe the goodnesse of God to bee much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in that kind towards them, then was theirs towardes their wiues when so they offended, are the one of <hi>Is. 50.1.</hi> the other ost <hi>Ieremiah 3.1.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 50.1.</note> In that of Isaiah, the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, <hi>Ubi est libellus repudii matris vestrae, quodimiferim eam?</hi> that is, Where is that Bill of divorce with which I sent your mother away? meaning thereby, that hee had never put away his people nor cast them of: alluding to the custome that they had among themselues, divorcing away their wiues from them, which notwithstanding he had not done vnto them. That of Jeremie doth likewise allude vnto the same custome of theirs: and sheweth; that although such as had put away their wiues might not haue them againe: yet the Lord himselfe would be ready
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7444:13"/>
to receaue them. To that end he saith, <hi>Valgò dicitur,</hi>

Those two other that chiefly they rest on, are, the one in Deuteronomie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other in Malachie. That in Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie, as they doe alleage it, is,<note place="margin">Deut. 24.1.</note> 
               <hi>Si acceperit homo vxorem &amp; habuerit eam, &amp; non invenerit gratiam ante oculos ejus propter aliquam foe ditatem, scribet libellam repudii, &amp; dabit in manu illius, &amp; dimittet eam de domo sua.</hi> That is, If a man haue taken a wife and haue her, and she finde no favor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eies for some vncleannesse, he shall write her (or, as others translate, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let him write her) a bill of divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and put it in her hand, and send her out of his house. That of Malachie is much like vnto it, namely,<note place="margin">Mal. 2.16.</note> 
               <hi>Cum odio habueris, dimitte, dicit dominas Deus Israel,</hi> that is, Seeing thou hatest her (meaning his wife) put her away, saith the Lord God of Israel. By which they conclude that Moses first, and Malachie after, did in plaine words of the Text, in such case allow divorce vnto them.</p>

For as wee are all by course of nature giuen vnto sinne, and especially, vnto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, &amp; to the inordinate lusts of the flesh: so are there some (and those not a few) that haue afforded so hard en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement vnto that good spirit of God, whereby on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they should be preserved from so dangerous passions, that it is not of such to bee expected, but that, (hee not vouchsafing to tarry with them) easily they would settle themselues vpon any semblance, that should fit their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor whatsoever it were: which if it be so, then are we so much the lesse to marvel, if, as when meate is set on the table, men commonly vse to fal vnto that which best doth like them, and, the more that themselves haue their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makes possessed with vnholsome humors, ofttimes vnto that which is worst of all for them: even so in this likewise when diversity of opinions is broached vnto vs, then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to betake himself vnto that which best liketh him; and, the more that any as yet abideth vnder the power of error or sinne, the more to like the opinion of those, that best of all fiteth his inclination, though otherwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To see how farre they are crossed herein, wee shall neede to goe no farther, then to the plaine confession of one of themselues, <hi>Erasmus</hi> by name.<note place="margin">Erasmus. In 1 Cor 7. pag. 491.</note> Who immediatly after his very entrance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that speciall discourse of his, doth plainely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the generall iudgement of all Christendome to bee against that which he was then to propound, to be further examined. <hi>Scio,</hi> saith he, <hi>receptissimum esse inter Christianos, ubi semel coijt matrimonium, nullo pacto posse di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimi, nisi morte alterius.</hi> I know, saith he, that it is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall or most receaved opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all Christians, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marriage is once made, it can no way be broken againe, but only by the death of one of the parties. And as here, in generall tearmes he acknowledgeth the iudgement of the whole Church, or of all the people of God generally to be against that presupposed libertie: so, in the next sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence following descending to particulars, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth there likewise, that that is the iudgement both of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and of the old Latines,<note place="margin">Chrysosto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e</note>

The evidence (indeed) may proue tobe such, that neither the greater number of voices, nor possession of old, may stand against it: but vnlesse it be such, whosoever it is that would claime thereby, may looke for no more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it will be able, in equitie and truth to win vnto him.</p>

And his reason there, is, for that although marriage be the ordinance of God: yet for the circumstances therevnto appertaining, it hath diverse things that are to be governed by the positiue laws. <hi>Kem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisius</hi> likewise, writing against that part of the Councill or Chapter of Trent 1566.<note place="margin">Kemnisius.

So, his meaning is this, that although he account them al but one-eied men, that in such sort labour to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cile the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty offending vnto the innocent, that they haue but little care how to provide for the innocent also: yet neither is he of the minde of those, who account the innocent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bound, rather to put away his wife offending, than to be reconciled vnto her againe; and (that more is) doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so allow, much more of those that labour that attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than of those that labour to sunder them, without any hope of any restitution after.

but only by the way of comparison.

Those matters that are but acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie therevnto, and out of which he draweth some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons likewise, are the Scriptures therevnto appertaining: and the iudgement of others thereon. Of the Scripture he saith,<note place="margin">Pag. 505.</note> 
               <hi>videbam Scripturam hac in parte, vt pleris<expan>

                  </expan> esse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexam, &amp; ancipitem,</hi> that is, that he saw the Scripture to be in this point, as in many others, intricate, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: and therevpon (belike) accounted that he might bee the boulder to afford his patronage to this, when as hee thought that the Scripture would not bee against him therein. Out of the iudgement of others he chuseth out two severall considerations: one, that the olde and the new did not agree together; the other, that such things as were obiected by those that were of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary minde might easily be answered.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> For the former he saith, <hi>Vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam veteres interpretes doctissimos, à recentioribus dissidere</hi>; and for the latter,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that he saw likewise, <hi>ea quae obijciuntur, facilè posse dilui, citra nostrae religionis injuriam:</hi> and so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning from these (as I doe conceaue him) out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that it should be no new, nor absurd thinge for him neither, to dissent from others herein; and out of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that there were no danger of hurt to come thereby,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7444:19"/>
when as, by it, our religion should be nothing impaired. Those reasons of his that doe stand only by the way of comparison, are of two sorts also: some, that stand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of persons only; others, that compare the matter in quaestion with others not vnlike decided already. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are of two sorts likewise: the Church or whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the faithfull; and the Bishop of Rome, then the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Head of the same in earth among vs. From the Church he draweth two reasons: one, of the authoritie of it, that Christ did giue it; the other, of the good directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it hath by the Spirit of Christ her husband. For the former he saith,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Videbam quanta sit authoritas Ecclesiae à Christo tributa, cui dederit claves regni coelorum</hi>; and so, that she might well set it downe, by the authority to her committed: and for the latter, that hee accounted with himselfe, <hi>Ecclesiam habere sui sponsi Spiritum, ne<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

From the Pope, hee draweth other two reasons likewise: one, of a speciall good likelyhood, that he would be most willing to helpe in time of need: the other, of the abilitie or power that he conceaueth him to haue to doe good therein. Of the former of these he saith,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Videbam quàm esset ingens Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani Pontificis clementia, qui succurrat etiam iis qui apud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feros, citra periculum exitii aeterni, cruciarentur,</hi> thereon ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, that seeing his compassion is so greate towardes those that are none of vs now, it cannot be, but that much rather he wil help those that are so much neerer vnto him Of his praesupposed power, he reasoneth likewise two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall waies: one waie, out of the generall consideration of the whole; the other, out of a more speciall considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7444:20"/>
of it, as it hath beene imploied, and what force it hath had in matters of much like nature to this. Of the former he saith,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>Videbam hoc tribui Pontifici Romano, ut Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam &amp; Apostolicam doctrinam interpretetur, astringat, laxet, dispenset, &amp; iuxta quosdam etiam abroget aliqua in parte</hi>: so gathering thereby, that seeing it is so commonly giuen to the Bishop of Rome, not only to interpret the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but also to enforce the same somewhat further, and to let it downe againe when hee thinketh good, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit some part of it, as also to dispense therewith, and (in the iudgement of some) even to abrogate some part of it also; then need not he (as I doe conceaue him) be thought to importune him too much, that doth but comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this to his good consideration, &amp; no further neither the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe shall thinke good to deale therein. In the latter hee doth not only set downe the ground of his reason: but himselfe also addeth (more then before) what it is that he gathereth out of the same. The ground of his reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that he saw; <hi>per Romanum Pontificem person as reddi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiles, quos ne<expan>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> lex divina fecerat inhabiles</hi>: that is, that certaine persons were by the Bishop of Rome made vnable (to marry) whom neither nature, nor the law of God had made vnable. That which himselfe doth ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the same, is, that it seemeth to be <hi>eiusdem pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statis, hominis autoritate vetare ne coeat matrimonium; &amp; efficere, ut dirimatur matrimonium.</hi> That is, of like power that by mans authority mariage may bee prohibited to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and to bring to passe, that when it is made, it be broken againe. Those other matters not vnlike to this, decided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, out of which he bringeth some reasons also, are first the allowance of divorce by men of great reckoning: then also the breaking óf, both of espousals and mariage also, in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7444:20"/>
divers cases. For the former of those hee saith, <hi>Videbam viros olim probatae doctrine, sanctimoniae que,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>non fuisse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>territos Evangelij, Paulique verbis, quo minus admitterent divortium:</hi> and (for further confirmation of their doing) he addeth, <hi>videbam quaedam secus posse exponi, quam hacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus exposita sint.</hi> That is, that hee hath noted divers men in times past, of vndoubted learning and godlinesse, not to haue been terrified by the words of the Gospell, and of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> but that they haue (sometimes) admitted divorce: &amp; that certaine places (belike that seemed most against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) might be otherwise expounded, then hitherto they haue beene. (Which expositions if we may account the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those, that himselfe in that Treatice bringeth in, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the marking, whether most of those that are of that minde, doe not since themselues also vrge them vnto vs, as the truth indeede, without any great examining of them, how they stand with other Scripture.) For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the other two, espousals I meane, he saith that hee saw, <hi>ob professionem instituti humani, ob mutatum pallium, sponsum legitimum fraudari sua sponsa</hi>: that is, that for the profession of some ordinance of man, even for the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the attire, a man lawfully espoused or handfast, should be defrauded of his espoused wife. And for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he saw likewise in that age of his, <hi>matrimonium di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimi ob errorem personae &amp; conditionis, etiam consummatum coitu</hi>: and, <hi>ob lapsum in haeresim, etiam illud dissolvi, de quo du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitari non poterat, quin verum esset matrimonium.</hi> That is, that he had seene likewise, marriage to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted void, for the error either of person or condition, although it were consummate before with copulation: and that, for falling into heresie, such marriage also was held as broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which no body might doubt of, but that it was true mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7444:21"/>
indeed. In all which (these his last reasons I meane) it seemeth that his inference is, that if so many waies men make them so bold with that holy ordinance, to alter and dispose thereof in such liberty, as in these cases they doe: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may no body thinke much with him, for no more but propounding of that, which he taketh to bee much better warranted, even by the doctrine, and plaine wordes of Christ himselfe. That vpon these his aforesaid reasons he thought good to propounde this matter to bee farther thought on by others, and that therevpon hee doth no more but propound it neither, may sufficiently appeare both in the words that he vseth withall: as namely, when a little before his reasons, and in the ende of handling the matter it selfe, he saith, <hi>Haec tamen paucis libuit delibare, quo doctis a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the matter it selfe he saith,<note place="margin">Opusc. vol. 2. pag. 3.</note> that <hi>Nihil prohibet de istis quaeri &amp; divers as eoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sententias audiri, quos apparet veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis investigandae studio duci, modo publica authoritate recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis pertinaciter non obsistatur.</hi> that is, Nothing letteth, but that these things may be called in question, and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of those be heard, who seeme to be led with a desire to search out the truth, so that no stubborne resistance be made to such things, as are by publike authority alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy receiued.

I might not iustly doe it, because there were no cause so to doe. For the case being such as it is, they could write no more certainely, nor more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then they did so long as yet they did not espie how wrong they were, in some of the maine principles of it. So that in such case they are so far from the desert of iust
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7444:24"/>
reproofe, for not being resolute, but vsing great warines and limitation in all such speeches as thereof they deliver, that it rather deserueth right good commendations, that in a case so intricate, doubtfull &amp; strange (as they did take it) they framed their speeches so sutable vnto it: that as those speeches of theirs were sufficient tokens to all, how hardly themselues tooke vpon them to goe so far as they did; even so might they bee as good warnings to others, there to read with the better attention and judgement, &amp; not so much to imbrace the opinion that such haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, as to examine and ponder the reasons, whereby they suffered themselues to be therevnto induced. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be expected at the hands of all that are to leade others, that they be resolute in that which they teach: yet if at any time the case be such, that iust occasion bee giuen to giue in their iudgement of such things as yet are not (among the learned) so fully decided, then is there no more at their hands expected, then to deliuer their minde accordingly. In a firme, plaine, ready, &amp; beaten way, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer men are wont more freely to ride: yet if it be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with snow, rough, or stony, or yeeld any semblance of quicksands or miers, although in such case there are founde sometimes, that then also will ride freely enough; yet was it ever, and ever will bee accounted more wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in al such cases to be more warie. Examples here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue very many, wheresoever the Scriptures haue not so fully declared those thinges that neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse wee thinke are enough decided by them; as, at what time the Angels were made: or, when the matters are prophetical, and extend to a farther time then is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; as, the manner of Antichrist and of his comming to the Fathers of old, and of the calling of the Iewes and

Turks to the knowledge of Christ before the last daie, to vs now. Of which things (and some others besides) those that haue written (even the best of them all) may easily be found to haue divers ambiguous and timerous speeches: and yet notwithstanding are not therein to be hardly ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured neither, for that (as those matters are) there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more that iustly might be expected of them. And so to come to these others againe, as in right I might not seeke their disgrace thereby, as having no sufficient grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d worke vnto it: so God forbid, that if I had, yet I shoulde at any time haue that meaning with me, being as they are, not only partakers of the selfesame Grace with vs; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so such instruments to the advancement of the glorie of God, and so comfortable lights to all the faithful in these our daies, as that the Church of God hath seldome (if at any time) had, for those matters, a greater blessing. That other which is my meaning indeede, is, no more but to note, that seeing they are not, in that matter, more fullie resolved, there is no certainety (nor any great good likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood neither) for any to ground themselues vpon, that gladly would take vp that opinion with them. If we had found them so resolute in it, that, without any doubting, and without referring themselues vnto those that might see farther therein, they had flatly &amp; boldly pronounced, that it was the vndoubted word of God, though therein also (in accepting of it) we might haue beene deceived, as not looking vnto the matter it selfe, with our owne, but with other folkes eies: yet had that beene a more tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble error a great deale, and more easie (by many degrees) to be excused, especially to those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in such cases are (in many things) to depend vpon others, either for that they are otherwise imploied, than that they may giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7444:25"/>
to such reading as such matters require, or, if they may, yet haue they not that depth of iudgement, that such thinges require. But when as themselues, whome we are content to make our leaders therin, being in other things resolute inough, and as bould as Lyons, do not set downe their opinion in this, but with great warines, doubtfulnes &amp; feare, with so many cautions &amp; allegations, with such submissions and protestations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it would be no final wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der to me (but that I know, how inclinable to such things we are by nature) not only that any should bee so loose as to enter that course, but also that any should so much as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that such kinde of speeches should be likely to yeeld any such ground, as whereon a man that were willing so to do, might bee bold to build, and to make no doubt but that he had his warrant with him. We know wel enough (and in many other things strongly hold it against the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents of the Church of Rome) that we may do nothing at all but only that, for which wee haue some vndoubted warrant in the written word: and yet notwithstanding (I will not say that I wote not how it commeth to passe for that it is by our own bad inclination) wee are so farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched in this that finding great staggering in those that are the stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest for it, &amp; most forward in defence thereof, we neverthelesse conceiue, that therein we haue warrant enough. So easie a thing it is to bend those, that so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly crooke to such purpose already: &amp;, in the freedome we haue in Christ so quickly to take holde, of an vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable liberty of the flesh. But here we must take heed we forget not that is yet we doe not consider what it is that they bring but only, that whatsoever it be yet because the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues are no better resolved, therefore may no body be so bold as to build vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them.

And the truth is, that my selfe am so persuaded, as I haue already declared: &amp; haue no doubt, but that therein I am not wrong. But yet that is not the thing that now herevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I mean to infer, because I haue no need at all so far to vrge either their credite or learning therein. My purpose therefore is no more but this: to shew that such as think they haue warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enough in the word of god to put away their wiues for adultery &amp; to marry againe, for that so many of the learned (&amp; of the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as some do like rather to say, though in this there be no reformation at al) are of the same iudgement likewise; may neverthelesse finde hereby, that their warrant is not so sure, as they before had thought that it was. Vnto which (so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as we go no father the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so) we haue no need so farre to vrge them; but may wel enough content our selues with this, that those places are not so taken by all, but that there is, among the learned themselues, a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest diversitie of iudgment therein: leaving the deciding, or the over-ruling of the question it selfe, to fall out vnto those that shal haue the better part in it; and the desire of

It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for vs, vnto the purpose that now we haue in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, to be able to shew, that divers of the learned (and those of good accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t likewise) do not allow such help vnto them, as out of those places they thought that they had. Now, whether those that do allow it, or those that now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, are the righter, or neerer vnto the truth therein, that wil we not sticke to refer to a farther time to be farther decided (if neede be) among the learned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vrging it no farther at this present, but that it is not to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted an vndoubted truth, or a point out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, that any liberty was at any time given, by the law of God, so easily to put away their wiues, as those places im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, as hitherto for the most part they were delivered vnto vs. For so wil it plainely enough fal out, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the most of our learned that are for this kinde of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce and marrying againe, doe much the rather, as I doe take it, incline therevnto vpon supposal that <hi>Moses</hi> first, &amp; <hi>Malachie</hi> after, had allowed it for lesser causes vnto the Iewes (so inferring, that then those words of Christ, that are of that matter, might wel inough be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if Christs meaning therein had beene, that for adultery himselfe also did allow it vnto vs:) now finding, that it is not certaine, that any such liberty, was at any time; by any word of God granted to any, it is not vnlikely, but that themselues will be better advised of it, and rather search out some other meaning of those words of Christ, than to make him (as els they must be faine to do; and as after I trust to make it more plainely to appeare) both the first and the last in all Scripture, that ever allowed any divorce and marrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and the only man of al the Prophets that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp; of al the Apostles that followed after, vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Those reasons of theirs that now I speake of, doe most of them depend either on the things herevnto appertaining: or, on the authoritie or testimonie of others concerning the same. The things herevnto appertaining, are either the selfesame that are in question: or else certaine others, of such a kinde, or so neere vnto them, that from them they draw certaine reasons to these likewise. Of the selfe same that are in question, there are two sorts: one, that is of the substance of them; others, that are but accidentarie therevnto. That which is of the substance of them, is the nature both of adultery, &amp; wedlock it selfe in this respect. Out of the consideration of which because they doe so vsually reason, therefore it shall bee good for vs to note, both what reasons they are, and of what force wee may take them to be. The reasons that thereon they bring are

such as bind all vpon this, that the nature of Adulterie is such, as that it doth quite dissolue whatsoever band there was in marriage before: and that that was the cause, why Christ made his exception only of it.

For there are, if we mark, two sorts of bands wherewith they are bound the one to the other: one sort, that concerneth those parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that so doe ioine themselues together; the other, that concerneth certaine others, that ioine with them in that action likewise. Those that concerne the parties themselues, are two: one, of the husband; the other, of the wife. For though they both doe concurre in time, so neere as may bee: yet, both some little difference there is, such as it is (the one going a little before, and the other following somewhat after) and well they may bee severally considered, as distinct things in themselues; as when ships doe grapple together, and not by the grapple of either of them, but when each of them doe fasten their grapple on other. Those others that ioine with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, are, God himselfe, and his vicegerents on earth among vs: both which doe ioine in that action with them; and, when first they haue so tied them (and that, with a seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral band for either) then doe they tie them also with other bands besides, even with one severall band for either of them.<note place="margin">4. Bands.</note> And so commeth it to passe, that every party that is marryed, is, by the vertue of that marriage, bound fast to the other in foure severall bands: one of his owne; the second, of his yokefellow; the third of the magistrate, or of the Government vnder which they liue; and the last, of God, or of his holy ordinance. Wherevpon me think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7444:37"/>
that whatsoever it is, that may bee thought to bee of force to dissolue the band of matrimonie, had need to be such, as wherein the whole interest of all these parties, and of every of them, is to concur in full, and lawfull consent: or else, whatsoever is, or can be done, by either of those inferior parties, neither is it, neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it be of such force as to dissolue the whole band, which was knit not only by themselues (and by either of them, for their part several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) but also by others that are their superiors, and whose leaue first they must haue. Or otherwise, that it were in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect no better, but as if one should reason affirmatiuely from the part to the whole: that seeing one of the bands is by one party broken (and but so far neither as that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may) therefore the whole band is broken betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and now as loose as ever they were. Which how vitious it is, we may (as I take it) much better perceiue in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such like, wherein we are not as yet by preiudice so forestalled, nor our affections so blinded neither: in that band that is betwixt the Master &amp; the serva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For though the servant doe behaue himselfe as il as may be, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the nature of his service, either generally or spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in that which more properly is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto him; and whereby himselfe hath so far deserved vtterly to bee cast off: yet, if either the Master haue absolutely take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him into his service, and to doe for him without exception, &amp; not only for better, but also for worse, and much rather if God doe require, that as yet he cast him not off, or if but the lawes doe not allow him so to doe, in all these cases we may see some bond of duty, so farre as yet remaining and standing in force betwixt them, as that it were hard for any to iustify, that after such a lewd part of the serva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, now there were at all no band of that duty remaining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7444:38"/>
them. And the lesse there is to be said against it, but that in such sort a man might so reason against divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions besides (as of that which is betwixt Parents and children, and of that likewise that standeth betwixt the Prince and the Subiect) the more heed should bee taken, that no such gap should be opened to any, as wherby the looser sort, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they should get their desire in this, should cast about to obtaine the like in other things also of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter consequence. In which respect I do so much the more marvell that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Calvine, so iudicious a man as he was, &amp; being in so good a way vnto this consideration, as that time also he was, when he did set downe that iudgement of his, as before is declared: yet notwithstanding did not take the advantage or benefitof either of them, so as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee easily might. For in that place before recited, his words that goe immediatly before, are these: <hi>Sanctius est co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iugij vinculum, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vt hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> arbitrio vel potiùs libidine solvatur. Tamet si enim mutuo consensu sese conjungu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vir &amp; vxor, Deus tamen nodo indissolabili eos astringit, ne postea li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berum sit discedere. Additur tamen exceptio, Nisi obfornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem. Merito enim abijcitur mulier, &amp;c</hi>: that is, The bond of wedlocke is a thing more holy, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it may bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved when men themselues wil, or rather when their lust doth moue them vnto it. For although man and wife doe ioine themselues together with mutual consent: yet doth God (farther) tie them togither with a knot that cannot be loosed, that afterward they haue no liberty to part in sunder againe. And hitherto wel: but then he addeth, yet, saith he, an exception is added, Vnlesse it be for fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the woman is iustly cast óf who disloialy hath broken wedlocke, and so forth, as before. Wherein we see that he noted two distinct bonds in the parties the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7444:38"/>
consent, or that the man had bound himselfe to his wife, and the wife likewise to the man; then also, that God (aboue them both) had likewise ioined them togither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to part: and yet notwithstanding in the end he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the bond to be (wholy) broken by one party onlie, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing therein the iudgement of others, and vpon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, that such must be the meaning of those words of Christ, which afterward I trust to shew may rather haue some other meaning. Againe, put case that there were no band but one, even that alone wherewith the adulterous wife since, had before tied her selfe to her husband. Even in this case also me thinke it were harde for any to holde, that such lewdnes of hers, had altogether broken whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever band of mariage there was betwixt them: for that in such case it is so generally held by al, that whatsoever la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds the wife brought with her, they stil are the husbands, even by the vertue of that bond that was betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as otherwise when the bond is dissolved by death indeed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (if he haue no farther interest) he is to part with them likewise. So in such case the bond may in some sense bee accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to be broken indeed but rather, in respect of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers benefits that by her marriage shee might otherwise claime, than that the bond in it selfe should stand as broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnto them both generally, or to set them as loose, or as free to marrie againe, as they were before. And so doth <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmus</hi> himselfe afterward interpret one of those his spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of that kinde.<note place="margin">Nat.

So do we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him to be a Christian, that is of a wicked behaviour: &amp; yet is not his Baptisme abolished. In such sense did I saie that shee ceased now to be a wife, who (by her own lewd demeanour) had made her selfe vnworthie to be so taken. And therevpon bringing somewhat such like, both out of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and out of <hi>Ierome,</hi> he concludeth: <hi>ut igitur est vir non vir, vxor non vxor, ita est conjugium non conjugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi> that is, As therefore a man is not a man, a wife not a wife, so is marriage no marriage.

And thus for them all. One thing more in one of them there is, that needeth to bee warily taken, or else may easily breede a further error: namely, that Erasmus by those words of his, may seeme not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the ioining together of man and wife, to be of God,

with vs further therein, then now wee will allow that hee doth: this were no doubt but a weake collection, and in no wise to stand for any sound reason to vrge vs vnto it.

Now, of what force these reasons are, may soone be espied of any that will a little marke them: both that which standeth vpon the abuses going before; and those others that stand vpon the inconveniences that follow after. For as touching that which standeth vpon the abuses going before, as I haue noted so much already, that if so we should vse it, it would be but a weake reason to vrge any to be of that opinion: so in it selfe it is cleere indeed, that the abuses themselues were to bee amended, and by force of good lawes, or by good government to be taken away; and that no such liberty is to bee graunted for redresse thereof, as may not stand by vndoubted war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the word of God. So that, if they suppose this to be such which now they do vrge, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though they do require no more then iustly they may generally; yet therein they mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, that first they take such holde of this liberty, before they haue found it to be, by the word of God allowed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. The like may be said of the first sort of inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences also, such as concerne both the parties indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and of the last likewise, which were such as concerned others withal. But for the middle fort, such as concerne the innocent parties (which seeme to bee the strongest of all) although it cannot be denied, but that their case is hard and much to be pittied withall: yet, as themselues do gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that they cast no further to helpe them, then it may stand

with the written worde (and so are therein,<note place="margin">

So, for these reasons we are to suspe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d our iudgements awhile, vntil we see these two things: first that such liberty (of divorce for adultery, and marrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine) doth vndoubtedly stand with the word of God; then, that those other inconveniences (as they are called) are no such things as of duty should be sustained.

Paul himselfe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethwith intemperate widdowes, least they commit some further evill. Of what force these reasons of his are if now we examine, first as touching the opinion of those others (for such like matters as he presupposeth) that he brought in, the reason is sufficient to stop the mouths of those that so hold: but not to establish that point of doctrine it selfe. That the Apostles themselues, and the godly Fathers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, determined more plainely of divers things, then those that went before them had done, they had the word of God for them therein, and then not to bee reproued by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: but their doing therein may be no argument to moue vs to determine of this, but only so farre (which appeareth not yet) as we may accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that we haue the word of God to beare vs out in it. But whereas he shuffleth in (among the rest) divers things that they determined &amp; did against the word of God, we ought to be so much the more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in suffering our selues to be led thereby, whenas the rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son is of that nature, as buildeth on falshood, as well as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7444:44"/>
on truth. As for the liberty that we take in those speeches of Christ, we take none (in any doctrine that thereof wee hold) but such as standeth by good warrant of the word of God in other places, and then can that be no sufficient reason to moue vs, to do the like in this, for which (as yet) we finde in the word no warrant at all. And, though much be to be attributed vnto him: yet in this it may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that himselfe vnderstood not those places; else that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he would haue so reasoned on them. The perfection that Christ might seeme thereby, to commend vnto vs, was not to that ende so laid open by him to shew in how many things wee must be spared for our weakenesse sake; but plainely to shew vs, how wee ought to endeavor our selues to walke in that holy calling: and then doth it leese the force of the reason for which he brought it. Neither doth Christ therein teach vs so absolute perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in those points, but that some others also there are, of an higher degree then those, of which he speaketh no thing at all. As in his first example of doing murther, though hee forbid divers other braunches of that evil roote, yet neither doth he recite but a very few of them (to speake of) in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the rest: neither doth hee speake any thing of the contrary vertues, or great care that we ought to haue of the safety and good estate of others, which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are by the commandement also required. And so likewise in all the rest. So his purpose was not there to teach all perfection; but to giue them to vnderstand, that he was so far from setting them loose from that strict rule of life which the law prescribed vnto them, that he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much more of them by vertue thereof, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they did thinke they were bound vnto: and that doth hee content himselfe briefly to shew, by those few examples.

Those that are taken, as from the lesse to the greater, carry their owne weaknesse with them so plaine, that no body need (as I doe take it) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further to shew it: being able to shew, if need were, that one of them hath such a wem or gawl in it besides (that censure of his, of those his widdowes) that there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why it should be (in this light that now wee haue) of credit with any.</p>

he rested somewhat on the sense of nature: as perilous a guide in the matters that now we speake of, as (of those that are of some credit) a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could lightly otherwise haue chosen. For being by nature so much given as we are to the lusts of the flesh (and to haue variety therein) and to be avenged of such displeasures as are done vnto vs (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such, as touch vs so neere, as now we speake of) wee are not to looke for any other, but that we may be as easily blinded in this, if we leane to our owne iudgement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as in any thing else that can lightly befal vs. So that, in this especiallie, he should not haue rested anie thing at all on the sense of nature, but haue fought some better guid, whom he might more safely haue followed. Then also, how readily he taketh hold on that permission, even onlie for that it was permitted (not regarding how farre, not howe) though himselfe doe finde none other, but that it was only for the hardnes of their hearts: a sufficient burn; to haue discredited the vse of that libertie to all that are godly, or that haue any reasonable care, even of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet whereas he doth so readily take such hold thereon, it may seeme to argue, that his store o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise is but weake. Lastly, that after a sort abandoning these, if they should not be thought meete to serue, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hold of an other almost as weake: namelie, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was no punishment set down for it in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie of <hi>Moses,</hi> therfore it was after a sort, or in some sense permitted vnto them. And yet is it sufficiently knowne vnto al; that as in al other Policies whatsoever, even so in that of <hi>Moses</hi> also, there be divers things that are vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which there haue no punishment at al devised for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and therefore that we are not so to reason, that seeing it is not punished there (as neither it was to haue manie

That did Christ
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7444:47"/>
restraine only vnto the cause of adultery. And by and by after, <hi>Ergo suis Christus unam dunt axat causam indulget di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vortij.</hi> that is, Therefore Christ alloweth vnto his but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one cause of divorce. And in these (so far as yet I haue found) is his iudgement most plainely declared. In which it is good to note those two things: first that he buildeth for that matter on no other Scripture, but only on that exception; then, that hee so taketh that exception, that thereon he inferreth, that for adultery Christ himselfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth divorce. If he build vpon no other Scripture but only on that exception, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our busines lying within lesse roome, &amp; neerer vnto vs, we may so much the sooner find how it holdeth together that he gathereth thereon. If he so take the exception, that thereon hee gathereth, that Christ alloweth the husband to put away his wife for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either must the place it selfe be of that nature that it can haue no other sense but it: or, if it may haue some other besides, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is he to shew what reason he hath why the place should rather be taken as he would haue it, then as others haue taken it heretofore. Whereas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is evident (by the iudgement of most men, in the Church of God, who did otherwise take it) that the place may haue another sense, and yet himselfe, hauing shewed no reason which may stand for any iust proofe, that the Text must needs be taken in that sense that he would haue it, doth neverthelesse so enter vpon it, and will haue that to be the meaning of it hence is it, that for any thing that yet I doe see to the contrary, hee can hardly avoid the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of a forcible entry, or to looke for so much curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie at his adversaries hands, as first to graunt him, that that shall be the sense of the place. And then hauing gotten so much for divorce, that in such case the husband may vse
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7444:48"/>
the benefit of it, that is to put away his wife if so she haue sinned, then will himselfe inferre the other also (that then he may lawfully marry another) only by telling vs plainely, what divorce it is that he meaneth. For he saith <hi>Divortium interim appello,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ib. pag. 498.</note> not that, <hi>quo dirimitur domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca consuetudo, manente coniugij vinculo,</hi> but <hi>verum, &amp; quale solum illa novit aet as, qua licebat, à repudio prioris, alteram da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</hi> Whereby he giueth vs to vnderstand, that he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth such divorce as altogether breaketh the ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and not such as standeth by law all Christendome through (almost) if there bee no other cause but adultery only. Which two if we lay together, namely, that Christ alloweth divorce in case of adultery, and then, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce must also be such as giueth free liberty to marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the collection that he maketh on those wordes of Christ must needs be this, that Christ alloweth those that be his, to put away their wiues for adultery, and to marry againe: an opinion that is, notwithstanding al his submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and protestations before and after, more boldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched; then it is with any of his proofes that yet I haue found, or (as I am persuaded) ever shall, strongly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<note place="margin">Then, for his defense against o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> As touching the latter, that is, how, for his defense, he gathereth vpon those places that doe seeme to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, we are first to note, that some there are with which at all he doth not meddle, and yet are of special im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance against the opinion that he conceiued: &amp; then further we are to consider how he gathereth his defense out of those that he vseth. If some there be that hee med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not with, and yet are of special importance, then may we account, that his defense is so much the weaker: and those places that now I speake of are those two, the one of Deuteronomie, the other of Malachie, that I shewed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7444:48"/>
before to bee most likely to bee mistaken, in which the Hebrew in them both, &amp; the Septuagint also in the latter of them, do so frame those Texts to speake, as that to one that would haue cleered the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the doubts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, those also had beene as needefull to bee answered, as not many others more. Those that he vseth, are certain of those speeches, which (concerning this matter) were vttered by Christ: and certaine others of the Apostle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul. Those that he taketh of Christ are three:<note place="margin">Out of the words of Christ.</note> two of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in effect but one; but the other, a severall one by it selfe. Those that are in effect but one, are those two so well knowne places, in the first and nineteenth Chapters of the Gospell by S. Matthew. Where Christ doth so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine the liberty of divorce, restraining it vnto adultery only, as these men take it. Out of which how hee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for his defense, is a thing very specially worth the marking. For hee doth not now gather, as the residue do, vpon the advantage that is supposed to lie in the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but out of the whole restraint generally: gathering, that the doctrine which was there delivered, did draw so neere vnto the perfection of true Christianity, that if wee should exactly apply it vnto our liues, to make it a rule vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, we had need to vse some favorable interpretation of many things therein; or that wee had some dispensation to avoid the strictnes of it. For the former he saith,<note place="margin">Pag. 498.</note>

and only in divorce we are so austere, that wee doe even further restraine those words of Christ.

He there forbiddeth, to sweare at all. And with greater severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he forbiddeth that, then he doth divorce, &amp; with more words doth beate vpon it: and yet for the worth of a shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling we commonly swere, excusing our selues, that we are not (indeed) to sweare rashly. And why not as well, that a man, may not leaue his wife rashly? He forbiddeth to be angry: and we by &amp; by adde (the meaning to be, that wee doe it not) rashly. He forbiddeth to reproach any: yet we even beat, and slay also: &amp; then excuse our selues, that we doe it but to chastice him only, and not to hurt him. And so forth bringing divers other such instances or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples besides: and so concluding on them likewise. For the latter he addeth likewise,<note place="margin">Pag. 499.</note> 
               <hi>Si ut conditus erat homo, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severasset, nullum erat futurum inter vllos divortium. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus revocans suos ad pristinam innocentiam, non vult divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7444:49"/>
quia non vult duros corde: &amp; tamen Paulus indulget humanae fragilitati, relaxans saepenumero Domini praeceptum. Cur non idem facere possit Romanus Pontifex</hi>? that is, If man had continued as first he was made, there would the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue beene no divorce among them. Christ calling back those that were his to that former innocency, will haue no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, because he will not haue them to be hardharted: &amp; yet Paul beareth with the infirmity of man, releasing oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the Lords commandement. Why may not the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome do the same likewise? By which, I trust, it may sufficienly appeare, that he rested not on that suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed allowance of divorcing for adultery, but (over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that) accounteth the residue of that prohibition of divorce so streight, as that it were needfull for vs, either to haue some favourable interpretation for it; or at least to be dispensed with all for some part of it: and yet that in either of those his gatherings he hath one speciall slip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. For in the former, when he pleadeth for such favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable interpretation, the only force of his reasoning stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, as it were from the like, or else from the lesser vnto the greater. Which hee endeavoreth to confirme vnto vs by all those examples that there he bringeth, of which I recited but a few of them: shewing, that seeing we doe in such sort interpret them, as that wee doe not account our selues to be tied to the letter of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as indeed we doe for the cheifest of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; those that giue credit (that which he seeketh) vnto the rest, &amp; so may doe by good Divinity; the rest being none of our interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fruits either of the ignorance of those daies, or of the corrupt affections of flesh &amp; blood) we should in like sort, if not much rather, interpret that of divorce likewise, as his own words do plainly declare. But now the truth is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7444:50"/>
that that interpretation of ours which we giue of the rest sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth by authority of the word of God, &amp; that by other Scriptures we are forced so to take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as when there we are forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to sweare at al, &amp; yet elsewhere are taught to sweare by God, &amp; that it is a part of the worship that we must do him:) and that the interpretation that he woulde haue vs to make of the other, is not such as any other Scripture doth lead vs vnto; but such as al other Scripture directly crosseth as we do take it, and trust to make plaine ere we haue done. And then, if we haue Scripture for the one, but not for the other, howsoever that motion of his may savour well of great humanitie: yet wel maie wee doubt, that such stuffe would be but seelie Divinitie. In the latter likewise, besides that he chargeth S. <hi>Paul</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence ofttimes with the Lordes commandement (which would be hard for him to proue,) and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he seeth no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but that the B. of Rome might do so also (wherein he spake according to the manner of those daies, or els but offereth somewhat to ride him) he may seeme to gather, that Christ did no farther restraine divorce vnto his, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himselfe had anie farther meaning, but so far as their hardnes of hearts shoulde bee also abolished, that thereby they should not stand in need of that help to their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: which course if in other things also we should atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, sooner should we shew our selues to endeavor, rather to make our corrupt inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a rule to interpret the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vnto vs; than to allow, that the Scriptures should be a rule vnto vs, whereby to amend, or to call to the checke, whatsoever ill waies there are in our owne corruption. That which is a several one by it selfe, is that same that in the 19 of <hi>Matthew</hi> Christ also vttered, that it was not for man to put asunder, that which God hath coupled togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7444:50"/>
Concerning which he saith, <hi>Porrò quod obijcitur ex eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem loco, Quod Deus conjunxit, homo ne separet,</hi>

That (only) hath God coupled to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gither, that is coupled aright: &amp; that doth God (himselfe) breake a sunder that is wel put a sunder. In which course also he then in such sort proceedeth, that although he wel provideth that he wil haue no divorce to bee made by the parties themselues, nor by anie but onlie such as are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie for those matters: yet he plainely sheweth, that he would haue it to bee done for more causes than for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie, and yet that it also should be Gods doing too. <hi>Quod male,</hi> saith he, <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>glutinavit pueritia, quod vinum, quod temeritas, quod inscitia, quod male per lenas ac lenones,</hi>

yet when it is made, then is there no waie to vndoe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. In this therefore (pleading for so great a liberty to divorce, as hee doth) hee hath not only no Scripture for him, but now also even the most of those, that (in these daies of ours) are for divorce and marrying againe, flatlie against him: &amp; so, his gathering herein not only in truth, but also to them, who only shoulde haue the benefit of it, sufficiently weakened.

               <hi>Ne hîc quidem Paulus tractat mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam divortij, sed adhortatur pro illorum temporum statu, ut quae liberae sunt à conjugio, praesertim vidus (nam ad haru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam

Which assertion of his, besides that he hath not proved it, maketh little for him, for that though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle did not to that end speake it; yet nothing letteth, but that so it may be applied. That which is a several place by it selfe, is out of the selfe same chapter also vnto the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> where the Apostle requireth in the name of the Lord, that the wife depart not from her husband, and that the husband do not put away his wife: which, as himselfe saith, is <hi>locus omnium difficilimus,</hi> that is, the hardest place of them al. Concerning which his best answere is,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 503.</note> that S. <hi>Paul</hi> there doth not treate <hi>de gravibus flagitijs, quae crimen adulterij vel aequent, vel superent etiam: sed de levioribus offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, ob quas, apud Graecos potissimum, crebra fiebant divortia</hi>: that is, not of grievous crimes which were as great as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie, or greater rather, but of the lighter offences, for the which especially among the Grecians, there were ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> divorces made. Alleadging also a testimony out of <hi>Iuve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> of one that had, by such dealing, eight husbands in fiue yeares. And the reason that he bringeth, why hee taketh it that the Apostle spake but of lesser offences, he gathereth out of the reconciliation that there is mentioned: which notwithstanding prooveth it not; but leaveth it only on the credit of his owne iudgement. Which belike himselfe did somewhat perceiue, because hee rested not therein, but tooke hold of some others, and those also as weake as it: one, of difference of the sex, pleading that he gaue that

Imò cur addidit, quod non addidit Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus, Maneat innupta?

And more then that; why did he adde, which the Lord added not, namely, Let her abide vnmarried? Why doth hee forbid the husband to put any away, when as Christ himselfe alloweth to put his wife away, if she be an adulteresse? And thus much to shew, how Erasmus hath gathered, both for his conceiuing of that opinion at the first: and for the cleering of it besides, of those obiections which he saw might be made against it.</p>

And therefore is there none found as yet, that I knowe of, among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, either of olde or of late, which hath not allowed that adultery being proued, it is lawfull for the innocent party by divorce to put away the offender: but divers of them, hauing devised a distinction betwixt the separation from bed, and the dissolution of the band of marriage it selfe, doe by and by overthrow that, which rightly they did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of before, seeing that they doe not graunt liberty to marry againe, to those that are in such sort sundred. Of which opinion seeing even Augustine himselfe was, it is specially needfull to shew, with how strong reasons the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7444:53"/>
most learned Divines in this age of ours, haue clean wipt away all the arguments of the contrary side. And so, hee presently setteth in hand to answere those Obiections, that hee thinketh to stand in the way of that resolution. But first let vs see what proofe it is hee hath brought for his owne. Forsooth that Christ, for that hee saw that the law for stoning adulterous persons to death was despised, purposing to provide for the conscience before God, he therefore &amp;c. What haue wee here, but only his owne ghesse, that that was the purpose and meaning of Christ? Which if it were not, as then wee haue herein no proofe at all: so if it bee no more but doubtfull; for that hee might as likely haue some other meaning (which after I trust wil easilie appeare) yet then also this coniecture of his may not iustlie stand for any sound proofe neither, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for his worthines otherwise his iudgement may be had in special reverence. And it is not to be denied, but that that which he bringeth in immediatly after, of so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of al, in the allowance of Divorce for adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, doth much make for that iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his at the first sight; but then there is to be considered withall, both that they mistooke those places of the Old Testament, which they thought to allow of Divorce for lesse matters;<note place="margin">Deut. 24. c.</note> and that yet they did not allow of such divorce for adultery, as might dissolue the bond of marriage. For if they did so far mistake those places aforesaid, as that then they made no question, but that by the word of God divorce was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for lesser matters, then they might easily be of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that there was no doubt, but that much rather it was allowed for the greater: and in that they were so loath to allow, that even for it also the bond of marriage shoulde stand as broken, it may seeme thereby, that although they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7444:54"/>
had in minde those wordes of Christ, aswel as these, yet how plaine so ever M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Beza</hi> doth account the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they could not finde that so they might take them. Now that S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> was of that minde too, that doth weigh so much against him, as the credit of his iudgment standeth with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Whether therefore wee may be bold to account, that here among these plaine and resolute speeches wee haue any proofe whereon to stay our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences before God, or whether nothing could be spoken with greater perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitie, when as so many (and so quicke of sight) could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so finde it, that do I refer vnto others, &amp; thinke it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be pondred of such, as any way haue occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vse the benefit of sound iudgment therein. But belike M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> did not meane much to confirme, that to be the sense of the words of Christ that he had gathered (for that hee thought that matter cleere enough in it selfe) but hastned rather to answere such Obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as he found to be made against it. And so are wee also to see, how he contenteth himselfe therein. The Obiections therefore that himselfe acknowledgeth to be brought against it,<note place="margin">Then, in answering to certai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for vs, it shalbe sufficient to take the assay only of those that are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the word of God: and those are the verie same (and none other) that <hi>Erasmus</hi> before had brought, both for the places of Scripture out of which they are taken, &amp; for the order &amp; disposing of them; and, excepting the first, for the matter also. These therefore are likewise taken, some of them out of the words of Christ: &amp; some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, out of the Apostle S. <hi>Paul.</hi> And so belike wee haue al this while found nothing more in effect in the worde of God for this matter, than <hi>Erasmus</hi> had found at the first, when
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7444:54"/>
hee made the motion of it. Those places that are of the words of Christ are three:<note place="margin">Out of the words of Christ.</note> but the first two are heere also ioined togither in one and so do both stand but for one, &amp; the thirde for another by it selfe. Those two places of Christ that make but one, are those former places out of the 5. and 19. Chapters of S <hi>Matthew</hi>: but the Obiection that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Beza</hi> gathereth, is not like that which <hi>Erasmus</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered before, but varieth from it.

               <hi>Beza,</hi> on the other side, out of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie that he supposeth to be given by the one part of it, answereth an Obiection that out of another part of it is made against them.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7444:55"/>
if he that putteth away his wife, without the cause of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, maketh her to commit adulterie, it followeth (saith he, but let others iudge, whether it doe so or not) that hee, which putting away his wife for adulterie doth marrie an other, doth not make her to commit adulterie. Out of which againe it is gathered, that that which is there added concerning her that is put away, is not to be taken but with the Exception that is in the former mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, because otherwise the Lord shoulde contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or in one part of the sentence should go against that which he setteth downe in another. Which proofe of his though he do somewhat further backe against one thing that is in that place obiected besides: yet this is all the proofe that hee hath for this very point that nowe wee speake of. But, if we marke it, me thinke it wil soone shew it selfe to be a strange kinde of proofe. For, admit that the Exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that now we speak of, must needs imply (which notwithstanding wee doe not graunt, but avow it to bee the thing that lyeth in question betwixt vs) that for adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery a man might lawfully put his wife away: yet doth it not so necessarily follow that every one might so doe; or, that no case might be such, but that, if the wife commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted adultery, then might her husband lawfully divorce her from him. For it is sufficient for the truth of the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (even in that sense take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) if any case be such, as that for adultery it may lawfully be done. As, though we may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say (as the Scripture also in many places, in effect and meaning, doth, though not in the same tearmes) that God had no peculiar people for those daies in all the worlde, <hi>except the seede of Abraham,</hi> or <hi>out of that stock</hi> or race of his: yet doth it not follow, that all those were of that fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; but only, that he had none other besides. Whereas
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7444:55"/>
therefore that exception may bee satisfied with any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular (that, for adultery, as the case may bee, it may bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed) and yet he inferreth a generall vpon it, saying <hi>that he, that putting away his wife for adulterie, marrieth another, doth not commit adultery</hi> (for though the proposition, in those tearmes, be but indefinite, yet is it an vniversall by nature) hence doth it follow, that his proofe is of no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force, then an argument may bee that is taken from a particular vnto a generall, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the part vnto the whole: as, God for a time had no people in all the world to bee his peculiar people, but only the seed of his servant Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham: <hi>ergo,</hi> all the seed of Abraham were of his peculiar people. And therefore it is so much the more strange that Beza inferreth, that otherwise Christ had contradicted himselfe: as though it were any contradiction to say, that for adultery the case might bee such, as that the husband might lawfully put away his wife for it; and yet, that in some other cases he might not. His other Obiections, as they are the same that Erasmus had gathered before: so are they by him sent lightly away with the selfe same an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer that Erasmus before had giuen them. For vnto that other, of the words of Christ, that no man should part those whom God hath coupled together, whereas Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus before had said, that such were not parted by man but by God, Beza saith likewise, <hi>Concedo totum illud argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum  sed nego divortij propter adulterium authores esse homines, &amp;c</hi>: that is, I graunt, saith hee, that whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: but I deny that men are (to be accounted) the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of that divorce that is for adultery. So that, thus far, and so in the very answere it selfe that they made to this obiection, they both agree. But then in the confirmation of it they vary, M. Beza quite giving over that course that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7444:56"/>
Erasmus is in, and betaking himselfe to another. Erasmus building vpon disorders that were commonly committed in making of marriages; and M. Beza, vpon that law of God that adiudgeth adulterers to death, and vpon that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Christ. Wherein whether M. Beza hath bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his course or not, that I leaue to bee decided by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that will: but sure it is that therein he liketh not of that of Erasmus; in that himselfe hath taken another. For as touching that of Erasmus he saith plainly, that he doth not <hi>assentiriijs qui putant Magistratibus licere novas divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorum leges condere.</hi> that is, That hee doth not ioine in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion with them, who thinke that Magistrats may make new lawes of divorcements. And the proofe that he wil haue for his opinion in this (namely, that, not me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God must be thought to be the author of that divorce that is for adultery) is no more but this; <hi>Quum Dominus jam olim adeo expresse voluer it adulterio matrimonia dissolvi vt etiam adulteros morte punier it: &amp; postea rursum Christus consulens conscientijs propter Magistratuum negligentiam; adulterium acceperit, quum de divortio non licito dissereret.</hi> that is, seeing that the Lorde in times past, did so plainely declare that he would haue (even the band of) matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be dissolued by adultery, that hee punished those that so offended even with death: and after againe Christ providing for our consciences, hath for the Magistrates negligence therein, excepted adultery, when he treated of such divorce as was not lawfull. Concerning both which we plainely see the latter of them to hold no further, that that same exception of Christ may bee found to serue his purpose, which is the thing that is in question betwixt vs, and seeing himselfe knew that so it was, it may seeme that he doubted of the other also, when as hee went about so

hardly to help it in this. And the truth is, that in the other his reason holdeth but very weakely, that seeing God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that adulterers should be put to death, therefore the husband, if his wife haue that way offended, may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himselfe loosed now from the band of marriage that was betwixt them: because, as it is a generall rule with all the learned, so Erasmus himselfe his owne part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath set it downe in plaine tearmes, that, in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>dispicere quodagat is qui loquitur,</hi> that is, to consider what is the intent or purpose of him that speaketh,<note place="margin">Annot in. 1. Cor. 7. pag. 503.</note> is <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipua clavis ad intelligendam mysticam Stripturam,</hi> that is, the chiefe key to open vnto vs the secret sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And then it is plaine, that in that law the meaning of God was not, to shew when the married might accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t themselues to bee loosed of that band wherewith they were tied the one to the other: but how Magistrates should in such case execute his iudgements among their people. Againe, whosoever would so resolutely set down that the band of mariage were so cleane dissolued betwixt man and wife, only for that, when either of the parties are found to haue committed adultery, they ought by the law of God to die, they had need to be further advised, first as touching this prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t crime that now we speake of, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ought to be the determination of all estates for life generally (as when one hath that way deserued death, he that is in reversion should then account the right of the thing to be his, whether that the Magistrate and laws doe neverthelesse spare him his life or not,) and whether, such as owe any other duty besides, as children to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, serva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to their masters, and such like, might likewise in such case be allowed to account themselues discharged of it: and then, as touching some others besides, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7444:57"/>
men else haue deserued death, either by those lawes of God (as for blasphemy, prophaning the Sabbaoth, or whatsoever else) or else but by the lawes of the country wherein we dwel (though not against the law of God, yet further then it in those matters is wont to proceed) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in such cases we were to allow that liberty; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, what reason we haue to be so resolute in the one, &amp; so doubtfull in the other. These that are taken out of the Apostle S. Paul,<note place="margin">Out of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul,</note> are three likewise, but two of them (as in the others) in effect but one; the other, is of severall force by it selfe. These that are in effect but one, are those two before noted, the one in the seaventh to the Romans, that the wife is by the law bound to her husband so long as he liueth, the other out of the seauenth likewise of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to the Corinthians, tending to the selfe same ende in sense or meaning. And as they are in effect but one, so doth he giue in effect likewise one answere to both: to the former,<note place="margin">De Repud. &amp; Divort. pag. 110.</note> 
               <hi>Atqui Apostolus ibi non agit de causis divortij.</hi> that is, But there the Apostle doth not treate of the causes of divorce: and to the latter, <hi>Respondeo, Apostolum ibi non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere de divorij causis.</hi> that is, I answere, that the Apostle doth not there treate of the causes of divorce. But though this in generall bee the substance of his answere to both: yet he proceedeth somewhat further in either of them. To the former he addeth, first that which he thinketh, the Apostle at that time meant; namely, that he did as it were but catch or pluck to himselfe, <hi>ex coniugio similitudinem, quatenus id argumento proposito conveniebat</hi>: that is, A si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude out of wedlock, so far as it agreed to the purpose that he had in hand. Then also, both that the Apostle doth speake there, <hi>non de matrimonio per adulterium soluto, sed de matrimonio constante,</hi> that is, Not of such matrimony as is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7444:57"/>
dissolued by divorce, but of such as is still in force; and that a woman condemned of adultery may not bee said to bee vnder her husband, for that <hi>etsi adhuc is est superstes qui vir ipsius fuit, non est tamen amplius vir ipsius, nec ipsa potest esse simul mariti &amp; adulteri caro,</hi> that is, Albeit he were yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that was her husband, yet now he is her husband no more, neither can she be the flesh both of her husband &amp; an adulterer. To the latter he addeth likewise, both that he teacheth widdowes there, <hi>soluto per mortem matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio, posse bona conscientia ad secundas nuptias convolare,</hi> that is, mariage being dissolued by death, they may with good conscience marry againe: and that therein he had respect but to the vsuall and ordinary cause, praesupposing, <hi>inter fideles quibus scribebat, vix alia ratione quàm morte matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia dissolvenda,</hi> that is, that amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the faithful to whom he wrote marriage could hardly be dissolued but only by death. In the answere vnto both which, what haue wee else to ground vpon, but only his own opinion avouched againe; and here also but weakely confirmed? Hee saith the Apostle doth not here speake of the causes of divorce. Who saith that hee doth? What is that to the purpose, that of them he speaketh not now? By other occasion he speaketh that, which may shew vs, how vnadvised we are in this. And why should hee speake of that which was not? We praesuppose that divorce was, by the law of God allowed vnto them: and the latter Iewes, in the time of Christ, seeme much to be of the same minde also, though they might so say to some other purpose. But there was no such liberty giuen them indeed: and therefore we may not looke that the Apostle shoulde speake of it. And should we never suffer our selues to be better led, or our iudgements to be rectified by any Scripture, but only by

such as specially treateth of the matter wee haue in hand? If Sathan might so far prevaile, by any special ones amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs, he would not only depriue vs of a good part of that direction that wee haue by the word of God: but also might haue an easie way therein besides, to bring in, and settle, many errors among vs. When God spake to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses out of the bush and said.<note place="margin">Exod 3, 6.</note>

In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of them he addeth farther, that he doth but borrow a similitude thence, so far as belonged vnto the purpose he had in hand. What then? Could his reason be good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, vnlesse that same, from whence hee taketh the force of his reason, were sound it selfe.

In the latter, was it so needfull a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7444:58"/>
point to teach widdows in the Church of Corinth, after that the Gospel was now already received among them; &amp; that had a great part of their light from so many of the ancient people of God conversing among them (with whom such marriages were very common, the Gentiles also being little behinde them therein) that this sentence of the Apostle, which otherwise woulde serue vs marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous wel to giue vs sound direction in this, and in diverse such other matters besides, must so bee restrained to vvid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes only, that we, in this case, may not looke to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny benefit of it? Truely it is good to care for widdowes, &amp; it is a thing that is much commended vnto vs, not only in the word of God, but in all other good learning besides: but in al things there is a meane to be kept; &amp; widdowes themselues (it is to be thought) wilbe content, that wiues also haue all their due. Or did he so restraine those words of his, vnto that which was then most commonly vsed, that, for the matter now we speake of, he would not haue vs to take so much of our direction thence? Or did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle presuppose no farther on the behalfe of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as touching their holinesse and constancie in wedlock, but only that <hi>hardly</hi> or <hi>scantly</hi> they accounted wedlocke to be dissolved among them but only by death: or, if of the two, may not a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is careful to finde the truth, rather doubt, that this is but an hard &amp; a scant interpretation of this place of the Apostle? That which is of severall force by it selfe, is out of this chapter also of that Epistle vnto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where the Apostle saith, that not hee,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7:1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

agere de divortio sed de dissidijs quae propter simultates inter conjuges interdum oriuntur: adeo ut interdum una pars ab al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera secedat. Quod si evenerit, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vult Apostolus ejusmodi dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessione solvi matrimonium:</hi> that is, My answere is, that <hi>Paul</hi> did not here speake of divorce, but of such contentions or debates as arise sometimes betweene man and wife vpon hart-burning among themselues: so that sometime they depart the one from the other. Which if at any time it come to passe, the Apostle will not, that by such depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, matrimonie be dissolved betwixt them. He procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth somewhat farther, I grant, to confirme his iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therein, I meane, that this must be S. <hi>Paules</hi> meaning: and so me thinke he had need in deed. For otherwise, besides that the Text it selfe doth not in appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celead vs to that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>structio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (whatsoever it may do by implication, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are to see anon how himselfe doth gather thereon) it seemeth to me, that, in either of the Apostles dealing in such matters, we haue a great likelyhood, that this should be no part of his meaning. For it had beene a very great &amp; an intolerable disorder (and such as, not only the people of God, but eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the heathen also generally, did ever detest, vnlesse it were some speciall od loose persons among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that now &amp; then would not sticke to breake forth to such disorder) if that had beene in vse among them: and most likely then, that the Apostle woulde otherwise haue stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med against them, as he did for other matters, as for the variance that was betwixt them, &amp; for those disorders, in partaking that holy Communion, both which hee might lay to the charge of many of them, and for suffering that incestuous person, though hee were but one. Whereas therefore the Apostle is wont to be so round when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was given him, and gaue so good experience of it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7444:59"/>
in this Epistle also in divers things els, it may rather seeme, that seeing it were such a disorder, so easily vpon variance to breake of the bond of marriage betwixt them, that that was not the thing, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> there doth speake of, but some other thing that was more vsed &amp; more tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet not to be allowed neither; as, for the woman so to depart, or for the husband to put her awaie, either for adultery, or at the least vpon some great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or cause given whatsoever it was. Else I should hope, that among them, for any matter so apparantly so fowle, even among the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also, the Apostle should not haue neede to haue vsed the name of the Lord therein: or at least should thinke, as I said before, that he would haue set his instrument on some other tune, for a matter of lesse importance then it. Now the reason that himselfe allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, why he is persuaded that that is the sense of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, himselfe in this manner giueth in vnto vs. <hi>Hoc au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ita esse, manifeste indicant Apostoli verba, qui inquit in genere: Vir vxorem ne dimittito, &amp; vxor à viro ne discedito. Quid si enim adulterio peccarit altera pars, annon innocenti licebit saltem à nocente discedere? Relinquitur ergo verum es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se quod diximus, nempe, Apostolum de simultatibus &amp; rixis, non de vero divortio loqui: quod mirum est Augustino in mentem non venisse.</hi> that is, But that this is so, the wordes of the Apostle doe most plainely declare, who generally saith, or speaketh to all indifferently, Let not the man put away his wife, and let not the wife depart from her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. For what if either party shall commit adulterie, shall it not bee lawfull for the innocent party, at least to depart from the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der? So it must needs be true that we said, namely, that the Apostle did not speake here of true divorce, but only of contentions and brablings: which it
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7444:60"/>
is marvel that S. Augustine did never thinke of.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect. 22.</hi>
               </note> Whether these words of the Apostle do so plainely proue it or not let others iudge; for betwixt vs, I peceiue very well, that in no wise it can be decided. For what proofe hath it at all, but only which standeth on this principle, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent party may in such case at least depart from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? But what warrant any where haue we for that, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the old Testament or in the new? In policie, I grant and for the hardnesse of our harts it may after a sort bee tolerated among vs: and among the Iewes before: but where haue we otherwise any one authority for it, when it is rightly examined? Againe, as yet I see no cause to the contrary, but that a simple man might so strongly hold, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> especially the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t party had more iust occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to stay, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to go, that I think it might cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the most learned that is, to bring in any reasonable probability a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it: and much more, to evince it indeed, So strong is the charge, that all married couples haue taken vpon them, the one of the other; and so weake it is (setting our owne private affection aside) whatsoever it is, that as yet is brought to the contrary. And therefore I beleeue that himselfe did not wonder more, that S. Augustine never conceiued so much of it; then any indifferent one of his Readers will marvell that hee should make it so cleere a case as he doth.</p>
            <p n="22">22 Of those reasons of theirs that rely on the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of men,<note place="margin">How weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son on the authoritie of men.</note> we haue two sorts likewise: whereof some of them stand on the authority of those that in some sense may seeme to bee with them;<note place="margin">First, out of those that may seeme to bee with them.</note> and others againe, on the authority of those that are against them.

That such things sometimes haue bin done, he bringeth in two miserable examples: the one, that Pope Zacharie, in a case of incest allowed the innocent wife of the incestuous husband to marry againe; the other, that that <hi>Antonius narrat, sibi conspectum fuisse diploma, quo Ro: Pontifex dirimeb at matrimonium ratum &amp; consummatum,</hi> that is, Anthony reporteth, that he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom) let the reader co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider with me the thing it selfe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these be causes of sufficient importance (that then men would easily take occasion divers waies, to breake of and to marry againe) that the husband should be tied to a wicked woman, or that he should suffer either the griefe of the want of Children or the heate of lust all his life long, least he should be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of divers either vnwise, that hauing taken in hand such a course before as did not fall out well with him, he neverthelesse doth take it in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d againe (as though it were a shame, that hee which once had beene in a tempest, should goe to the seas againe, or he that had beene before deceiued in choice of his friend, should never admit any other into his friendship againe) or intemperate, or covetous, as though he rather desired to make his exchange of (more) beauty or (better) dowry the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his (so bad a) wife. Which course of his if any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should establish by law among them, it were hard to finde how it might bee avoided, but that for matters of marriage, &amp; all others thereto appertaining, some would all be cleane out of order. For first as touching so large a liberty of divorcing their wiues away from them, vpon any of those so many braunches of disorderly marriage, we may plainely see, that it would lay open a ready way to many divorces: for because those disorders are such, as that wee may conceiue no hope, that either they will or may be amended. So likewise for marrying againe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, if but the two first causes onely might bee allowed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7444:65"/>
soone should we see, that such a liberty, so freely graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, would be (by many) as freely vsed: but then, if the third should be added withall, that so oft as it would require, it should still be allowed a new and fresh marriage, and not beaten back to the former againe, then as we haue a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe in another matter, so should wee quickly finde it in this (to the shame of our faces that had so taught them) that but set a begger on horsback, &amp; we may be sure, that he will ride. Concerning both which, although it may be that if Erasmus had beene, derectly demaunded, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her he would haue allowed suchliberty or not, he would haue bethought himselfe better, &amp; in the ende would haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: yet seeing he hath fensed his speeches no better, but that in the heate of his reasoning for the other, hee hath so farre overslipped himselfe in these, that the reader may probably gather, that he was of that iudgement indeed, therefore must he now be content, that these also bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for part of his inconvenient speeches. Concerning the Scripture it selfe, he hath so many hard speeches of the same (such I meane as may be taken ill,<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it selfe.</note> and in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doe most incline therevnto) that it may seeme, that both he found that new motion of his to bee very much crossed thereby, and that hee could not quietly beare it, that so it should, and therevpon vttered those speeches of it: somewhat of the whole generally; but much more, of Saint Paule more especially. Of that which hee vttered of the whole generally, I haue noted no more but this, and that but only towardes the ende of his Treatice. <hi>Videbam Scripturam,</hi> saith hee, <hi>hac in parte, ut plerisque,</hi>

               <hi>esse perplexam &amp; ancipite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> That is, I saw that the Scripture was in this point, as in many others, intricate and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Of which, for this point, albeit he had some probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7444:66"/>
so to say, so long as those places aforesaide were so much mistaken, &amp; by so many, as they were: yet those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being duly considered, we may now plainly perceiue, that the Scripture is plaine inough for the negatiue of that Motion of his; and that al the hardnes and doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, is for his Affirmatiue only. Which might and should (I thinke) haue taught him, rather to haue suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that his doubtful motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than for it so hardly to speake of the Scripture it selfe. That which he vttered of S. <hi>Paul</hi> more specially is dispersed almost throughout this whole Treatice, especially while he answereth the places (after this manner) that are brought against that opinion of his. For in answering the fifth of <hi>Matthew, Non probat Paulus,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Pag. 499.</note> 
               <hi>digamiam: &amp; tamen, ob incontinentiam permittit, quod non audet exigere: satius esse judicans, nubere quàm uri.

And do we release nothing at al, of the hardnes or rigor of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce? In which speach of his the inconveniencie that I speake of, resteth especially in these two points: that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> allowed not of widdowes marriage; &amp;, that himselfe accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, that to allow of divorce no farther than it was then (which notwithstanding was as much, as any of vs may lawfully challendge) was too hard and rigorous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

And though he might haue made better choice then so, yet that also, in this case had little holpen, because it is not by them, that the estate of the question standeth, as now wee set it.

if he do it not. All which kinde of speeches I account in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient in two respects: first, because so they doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply (withall) a point of doctrine, more then they ought; then also, for that most of the Magistrats of all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are such, as, if it were wrong, yet could they not help it would they never so faine. That point of doctrine which those speeches do implie (withall) more then they ought, is, that the Judicialls of Moses should of necessity be obserued in our government also; or, that Christian Princes are bound to obserue the same: a point of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that divers are oftimes leaning vnto, but such as may not be vniuersally held (I meane, for all those Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als) neither is it further vrged by the better sort but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the equity of them, &amp; the negatiue plainely held by this Church of ours.<note place="margin">Art. 7.</note> That most of the Magistrates of all Christendome are such, as that, if it were wrong, yet could they not help would they never so faine, it is plaine enough in it selfe, for that they deale with no power over those that are vnder them, for lands nor goods, life nor lim, but so far as those lands by which they govern allow vnto them: &amp; that no lawes are allow'd to stand in force among vs, but only such, as wherevnto all the estates doe first condescend. And then, if the Magistrate (although it were a thing to be wished, and himselfe were, for his part so inclined also) be so little able to doe it, they do by such speeches, not onely farther charge him then there is on his part any cause, but also let downe no small part of his credit or honour among the people, which they should rather seeke to maintaine, knowing that the people are ready enough (of themselues) to thinke so meanely of their Superiors, that they need no such provocation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.<note place="margin">More spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Those that are more proper to certaine of them, are

But seeing <hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of divorce vnto a faithful woman, if for religion she be despised, and cast out by her vnbeleeving husband; and signifieth withal, that a brother or a sister may bee separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againe, not only in case of fornication and infidelitie, but also in others such like besides (for he saith, that a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or a sister is not brought into bondage in such things as these, where he vnderstandeth such like sinnes:) it doth plainly appeare by these, that Christ by the figure of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymia did largely take the name of fornication, &amp; that vnder the name of whoredome hee did include all such crimes, as were as great, or greater than it, and that he did exclude or shut out of the same but only the lesse, and his reason is, <hi>Qui enim posset Apostolus contra praeceptorem suum docere?</hi> that is, For how can the Apostle teach that, which

And of this matter he setteth two principal questions: the one, of detecting such a wife to the Magistrate; the other, of receiving her againe to favor. Concerning the former,<note place="margin">De Repud. &amp; divo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

And his answere (in effect) is, <hi>Magistratui inprimis indicare maritum vel ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem praecipue decet, ne dum praepostera charitate alienum pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum fovent, justam lenocinij suspitionem incurrant</hi>: that is, that right wel or chiefly it becommeth either the husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or the wife to complaine thereof to the Magistrate, least while they with a preposterous loue do cherish the fault of the other, they incurre a just suspition, that they are no better than bawds themselues. And being then farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whether we may not <hi>privatam injuriam condona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> that is, forgiue our owne private iniurie, hee so far inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleth
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7444:70"/>
the Common-wealth vnto it, &amp; maketh it to come so neere vnto Anabaptistrie, that he cannot allowe it: and he addeth in the end, <hi>Na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certè Christiana charitas malis non favet,</hi> that is, For certainely Christian charitie favoureth not (either evil things, or as I should rather take it) those that are evil. So likewise, being further vrged with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> that did not deale so hardly with <hi>Marie</hi> his espowsed wife, and that he was commended for that his moderate dealing, he answereth that it was but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in him, and that hee had no certainty of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that in that respect, he did the best, as his case was. But what letteth, but that a man might rather thinke, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> made no doubt of the matter (as then also himselfe had gon too far) but thought himselfe very certaine of it? then is this obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnanswered as yet. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Beza</hi> him selfe alloweth <hi>Ioseph</hi> thus much to put him out of doubte of the matter (if that may serue) that <hi>uterus eminens praeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantem esse demonstrat,</hi> that is, that her belly being growne so great as it was did plainely shew her to be with child: &amp; so, that he, <hi>ejus videlicet rei quae extra ordinem contigerat ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narus,</hi> that is, ignorant of that matter which had befalne her extraordinarily, might wel haue thought (&amp; without any doubting, with himselfe) <hi>omnino ab aliquo gravidatam esse,</hi> that is, that certainely (<hi>omnino</hi>) shee had by some body beene gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with child. So it seemeth (even by that which M <hi>Beza</hi> doth allow him) that he was nothing doubtful of it: but only that he was therin deceived. Again, being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pressed, that in this case also privat admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should go before, at least amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g friends, &amp; that rather the Church than the Magistrate (as themselues are wont to speak) or some certaine persons should bee first sought vnto, hee both liketh not of that neither, and bringeth in certaine

reasons to be assistant vnto him therein: but yet in the end addeth thus much withal, <hi>Dixi quid hîc mihi videatur. Suu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cui<expan>

In which point, when first hee hath graunted that many of our great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, both old and new, do little agree among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, and, in his iudgement, <hi>illos quidem nimium adversus nocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem rigidos, istos verò nimium faciles videri,</hi> that is, That one sort of them seemed to him to bee too rigorous to the partie offending, &amp; others to be over easie: yet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he so taketh against those that hee accounteth too easy, that little or nothing he differeth from those that he thought before too rigorous; rather shewing (and that rightly in deed) that the reasons whereon they grounded that auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of theirs were to weake to beare it, or, that, those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons did not so conclude; then that hee doth so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from their iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therein. For he findeth no more in them (in neither of those whome there he nameth, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, and Bucet) but only the negatiue, that the offendor may be retained (which he accounteth so great austerity) and yet himselfe, though in some case he doth qualifie the same, yet in some other hee draweth very neere vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7444:71"/>
His qualificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that, he doth not condemn him, <hi>qui ux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem resipis centem recipiat,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 115.</note> who receiueth his wife vpon her repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and againe, <hi>Deinde, vt modo dixi, non nego posse iterum admitti adulteram resipiscentem,</hi> that is, Moreover, as before I said, I doe not deny, but that an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteresse, if shee repent, may bee admitted againe. And elswhere he yeeldeth somewhat further also, as on other occasion before I noted. But as in this place hee yeeldeth thus much, so are we to note that he addeth withall that which doth (if it be marked) not a litle impeach that which is granted: and first, though there be repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance afterward found, in her that had committed adultery before; but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> especially, if the party offending as yet repent not. For though the adulteresse doe repent, yet first hee saith, that <hi>multae aliae justae causae esse possint, cur adulteram quantumvis resipis centem, in thorum rursus non admittat, qui tamen alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui illatam sibi injuriam ex animo condonavit</hi>: that is, that there may be many iust causes, why a man doth not admit his adulterous wife to his bed againe, though shee repent never so much, who yet notwithstanding from his heart forgiveth the iniurie that is done vnto him.

Beza here meaneth by the Church; and especially in respect of that liberty, that when the Church hath said what it will, then may these notwithstanding freely do as themselues thinke good. But before the adulteresse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, his iudgement is plaine, that the husband in no wise may receiue her againe: little differing from that <hi>rigour</hi> of those others before. For by another occasion speaking of receiuing the offender againe, <hi>ante resipiscentiae testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, before some proofe of repentance be giuen, he plainely saith that <hi>fieri non potest, quin sceleri faveatur,</hi> that is, that it cannot be done, but that wickednesse must needes be favoured. A sufficient token, that so to receiue an offender againe, hath at all no favour with him: and thereby also a sword giuen into the handes of those that are of that humor, to be long enough avenged on the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, til they may finde tokens (to their contentment) of true repentance. So haue wee hitherto partly seene, both how weake reasons they haue, and what inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent speeches (besides) they haue now and then interlaced among them.<note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the places them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: &amp; first that such is not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them as they would haue it.</note>

            <p n="25">25 Now to examine the places themselues (for the true sense and meaning of them) for the better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the order ensuing, wee are first to acknowledge, that when we haue gathered the meaning of them, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7444:72"/>
withall haue made it reasonable plaine, even out of the consideration of the places themselues, yet is it not vnlike<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, but that it will hardly sinke in the mindes of others, vnlesse some doubts be answered withall, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise will much prevaile with many: and therefore are we first to set downe the meaning of them; then, to consider of those doubts that seeme to be so strong against it. And to finde out the meaning of them, wee are first to set by that which is not: then, afterward to declare that which is. That which is not, being first set by, both the most of the busines will bee dispatched, and the other wil then more plainely appeare: but herein also wee are not barely to set downe the negatiue, that I meane vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; but also to adde some such proofe therevnto as may not well bee wanting from it. The negatiue that I meane vnto it is this, that whatsoever Christ by those wordes meant; yet this, in no wise, seemeth to bee his meaning therein, that thereby hee would giue them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, so to divorce themselues the one from the other. That which I thought needfull to ad therevnto, &amp; is not meete to be wanting from it, least so it should stand as a bare negation, resteth on two principall grounds: one, that Christ himselfe should not seeme to bee so favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto it; the other, that the nature of wedlocke doth not well beare it.<note place="margin">For that Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is not like to bee so favourable vnto it.</note> That Christ himselfe should not seeme to be so favorable vnto it, seemeth to be a cleere case, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well considered, for that we shall finde, that there was never any such allowed before, nor after neither: namely that for adultery men might so part with their wiues, as that therby theywere at liberty to mary others. In thenew Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we never thought that we had any such liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but only so far as these words of his would help vs. But
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7444:73"/>
in the old Testament we thought wee had many; at least those two: the one in Deuteronomie; the other, in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachie. And therefore so long as those stood in that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with vs, wee thought the sense of this Exception of Christ might well be, that hee allowed that liberty for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery to all, that was allowed by Moses and Malachie, for lesser matters, to the Iewes before. And indeed that collection had beene very good, for that both Moses and Malachie also wrote those things not of their owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate motion, but as they were therein directed by Gods holy Spirit, which spake by the Prophets. But now if we finde, that these also doe faile vs, then must wee graunt, that now wee haue none: and so consequently, that, if Christ in this exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath allowed that liberty vnto vs, it is such a thing as himselfe hath only done, and not one of his Prophets before, nor Apostles since. Which thing (for my part) I thinke would proue a strange assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that Christ in his holynesse should giue further liberty to that natural inclination of ours, then ever any other of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had done, before, or after. And for that matter wee neede go no further, then to themselues, that are for such divorce and marrying againe: and not vnto all them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that fewer wil serue our turne.

First therefore to begin with that in the fift chapter of S. <hi>Matthews</hi> gospell, there will it bee needeful, first to search out his meaning therein: then to answere one speciall Obiection that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to this place appertaineth.<note place="margin">The sense of the Place first set down</note> To search out the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Christ herein, we had neede to consider not onlie how we may safeliest take it: but also, what we haue to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce vs so to do. As touching the former it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied (neither is it, that I know of, by any) but that in that notable sermon of Christ on the Mountaine, calling his auditory from the loosenesse of those daies, among other things of that nature, he also tolde them, that whereas it had been <hi>said of old,</hi> that whosoever did put away his wife, should giue her a bill of divorcement, he now saide vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that whosoever did put away his wife except it be for fornication, should cause her to commit adulterie, &amp; that whosoever married her that was divorced, shoulde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit adultery also. Which words, as it seemeth to me, we may safeliest take in this only sense, that Christ did shewe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe thereby, at that time to seeke no more at their hands,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7444:75"/>
but only so far to restraine that liberty of divorcing their wiues, as that they did it but only for adultery: not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to shew that hee would allow that liberty vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but only that now he would so far restraine it. That which we haue to induce vs herevnto, I meane, so only to take it, and not to stretch it further, resteth on two principall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations: one, certaine circumstances of this present place; the other, such like in many other places of the Scripture besides. The circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of this present place, are two: one, of the time; the other, of the persons who were his Auditory at this present. The time was shortlie after that first he began to preach, having gathered manie of his disciples, and done such miracles, that now the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple began to resort apace vnto him. At which time Christ might wel thinke good, so far to beare with their weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and rudenes, as not to require (at that time) of them, the vttermost of that which rightly he might. His Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory consisted on two sorts: the common multitude; and those his disciples that then were. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon multitude we may very wel thinke to haue beene so rude then, that wel his wisdome might so farre forbeare them. The disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were of the common sort before, &amp; but lately come to Christ: and so consequently not vnlikely to bee almost as ignorant yet, as they were before; and almost as much wedded vnto such libertie, as in the loosenes of that time had growne vp among them, as the residue for the most part were. His Auditorie therefore consisting of such, it is no absurd thing to conceiue, that hee meant hereby to presse them no farther than so, and not to grant as allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whatsoever now hee thought good, to leaue out of the bounds, that so he named. As, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed sometime to take in some part of their land that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7444:76"/>
towards the land of others, though vpon some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all consideration they set not out their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ense so far as they might, yet doth not that by and by import, that they aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the rest, or leaue it to others. For in such case they may so take in that which in such sort they compasse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ense, that neverthelesse they doe not meane to disclaime in the other neither. So in this, Christ may in such sort restraine that loosnesse of theirs, within those bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds that there hee set downe: that neverthelesse there may bee much without them also, that hee will not allow vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the rule is good, that wee take good heed, how we doe gather any thing that is not said, out of that which is at any time said vnto vs. For, seeing it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God, not only to lead those, that seeke vnto him for the same, to all the parts of such holynesse and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as is accepted with him, but sometimes also, in an easier course to deale with the common sort, and so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine some things vnto them, that neverthelesse he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them further libertie out of the restraint, then hee can like of that they shall vse: it may very well bee, that Christ did not meane hereby to teach the vttermost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in that matter; but onely as Civile Magistrates doe, restraining such things as they hope they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, winking at others, and altogether passing over the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in silence, if they feare that they can do no good therein. And seeing it is graunted of all, that that presupposed law of Moses was political, what letteth but that this ofChrist may be so too? <hi>Zegedinus,</hi> one of those that is for divorce and marrying againe, doth plainely say it, though vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ende. <hi>Potest,</hi> saith he, <hi>&amp; hoc responderi, dictum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti de repudio,</hi>

And then, comming in such

sort vnto him, we haue therin cause enough to take heed that wee doe not account, that in such case needs it must be that Christ would giue forth any part of that which should bee an ordinarie doctrine in the Church: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that hee would frame them some such answere, as might be meetest for them, to requite them in their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.

Examples are many: but fewe will serue.<note place="margin">Ezech. 14, 1.8.</note> In the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament it is cleere, that when, even the Elders came to the Prophet, not in so good manner as they should, they were not vouchsafed any good answere: and when those Captaines with their Fifties in like sort came vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they receiued an heavier iudgement,<note place="margin">2.

In matters that are of the same kind that now we speake off, we shall need (I trust) no more, but only to note, how Christ himselfe directed his answers in such like cases; and namely, when either they tempted him: or whenas he questioning with them, they would not acknowledge the truth when they saw it. Of their tempting of him, we need go no further, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to these two: the one, of Tribute, the other, of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taken in adultery.<note place="margin">Mat. 22.15.22</note> In that of tribute it is plaine, that they went about to entangle him in his speech, as himself also did tell them, and reproue them for it. Wherevpon in such sort he framed his speech, as was sufficient, both to cleere himselfe, and to put them to silence: but yet not so full, for the doctrine therevnto appertaining. For though it be most true, that there he deliuereth that wee must giue vnto Caesar, the things that are Caesars, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the things that are Gods: yet both the doctrine is but generall, not shewing, whether that which they spake of be due or not; and that which might seeme to be brought in by him to conclude it, served rather to stop their mouthes then that they and others should thence haue gathered, that the Prince hauing set his sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p on the coine, it is as thence forward made his so absolutely ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that none others can haue any property in it. In that other,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.3.11.</note> of the woman taken in adulterie, as there also they came to tempt him, so they were accordingly served: first vouchsafing them no answere at all, but otherwise so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying

himselfe, as if he would by his doings teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it were as good to doe nothing, as to giue any good answere to them that came so vnto him; and, when that would not serue, but that still they vrged him to haue his answer (because they thought they had him now on their hip) then giving such an answere vnto them as choked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, and made them to bee glad to get them away. When he likewise did on a time so question with them, that they could not but see the truth, &amp; yet when they saw it,<note place="margin">Mat. 21, 23.27</note> would not acknowledge it (which was to shew by what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he did those things among them; which they prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded they would faine know of him) as then they plainely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraied themselues that they came to entangle him, and not to learn of him; so he likewise dealt accordingly with them, confounding them first in their owne devise, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> denying to giue vnto them any further answere. Those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two that I haue not yet found to be noted by others, do the one of them appertaine to this present time: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to a time that followed a little after. That which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to this present time, is to note, in what sense the Disciples tooke it. For if the disciples then did not so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Christ, as though he had by those wordes of his allowed the liberty of putting away our wiues for adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and to marry againe: then, of the two, I thinke that we also may safeliest take it, that hee graunted, no such allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance indeede. And that they did not so take it, but rather, that they might not part with their wiues in that case nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and much lesse marrie againe, it may seeme by this, that they accounted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to be so much streightned thereby, that therevpon they plainely said, that if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were so betwixt man and wife,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.10.</note> then were it good not to marrie at al. For presupposing that they were none of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7444:82"/>
the loosest sort for such matters, but that a reasonable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty might content them, it wil so fal out, that if they had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e words of Christ in that sense that these would haue them, they would then never haue accounted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be straightned thereby. For such as were of anie reasonable moderation, even among the prophaner sort, did yet account it liberty enough to be allowed, for adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie to put away their wiues, and to marry againe: &amp; we may wel perswade our selues, that the Apostles were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also much better than those: and therfore that if they had so vnderstoode Christ, they would not then haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved such hardnesse as they did in the married estate. And then, if the Apostles did so take the words of Christ, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither forbidding divorce and marrying againe, yea though it were for adultery also, even that only conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration may wel weigh with vs to conceiue better liking of that sense likewise, if it shoulde not over-rule vs rather. That which belongeth to the time that followed a little after, is, that when the Disciples, by occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it seemeth, of this his speech vnto the Pharises,<note place="margin">Mar. 10, 10 12</note> did aske him againe, concerning this matter, he then left out (vnto them) the Exception that he had vsed before, &amp; plainely tolde them, that whosoever should put away his wife, and marrie an other (not vsing the Exception of adulterie to these now, as he did to the Pharises before) he shoulde commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery against her, and so shoulde the wife likewise, if shee should deale so with her husband. Wherein I note a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest difference, in those to whom he hath spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in these two places: the former being the tempting Pharises; the others being his owne Disciples, and inquiring (as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, in that they were so troubled before) for their own better learning. Of which differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we need not to doubt,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7444:82"/>
but that Christ might wel take occasion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect. 28.</hi>
               </note> so far to varie in his speeches vnto them, as in those two places we see that he doth. And if now the question should be, out of whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these two answers of Christ, it were safest for vs to take our direction in all such cases, mee thinke, there should be no question of it, but that this his answere vnto his disciples apart by themselues, should be more likely to giue the sense to the other, than thence to borrow a sense for it selfe.</p>
            <p n="28">28 The doubts that I speake of,<note place="margin">Certaine doubts answe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, namely of the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it will not help them, in that sense that we doe take i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in shewed by di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vers other places.</note> that seeme to bee strong against the sense of these two places that nowe I haue gathered, are especially two: one, the Exception that is vsed in both; the other, that the Apostle, allowing either partie in some cases to marry againe before the death of the other, may seeme much rather to allow of this. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Exception that is vsed in both, we are to note that first if we take it in that sense which I haue already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it, then do themselues perceiue, that it doth helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing at al: but then, that they on the other side may probably challendge, to haue such a sense allowed vnto it, as wil somewhat favor them herein. If we take it in that sense which I haue already given it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues do then wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yeeld that it helpeth them nothing at al, for that so in the former he doth but beare with the rudenes or weak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of them: &amp; in the latter, vouchsafeth to giue them no better answere, because then they came not to learne, but only to tempt him, or to disgrace him vnto the people. And then, allowing this sense to rest vpon it, wee haue no hardnesse but only in this, how to reconcile that kinde of speech to stande with the sense that nowe wee speake of. Which in my minde may easily be done, if we note, that the Scripture according to the aforesaid rule of S. <hi>Basile,</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:7444:83"/>
when it speaketh of two things, as some way opposite the one to the other, doth oftentimes so deny the one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that neverthelesse it doth not thereby grant vs the other: as many Examples doe witnes vnto vs, both in the Olde Testament,<note place="margin">In the olde Testament.</note> and in the New. In the Olde Testament (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others) we haue one that concerneth Princes only: and more that concerne all others generally.<note place="margin">Deut. 17.17.</note> That which concerneth Princes onely, is, that their King is so plainely forbidden to take vnto him manie wiues, and to gather him much silver and golde. Where it is plaine, that both those are so forbidden to Princes, that they are not allowed to others. Of those that concerne al others generally, I haue noted a couple: one, that forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vsurie; the other, that forbiddeth to marry two si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.<note place="margin">Deut. 23.19.</note> That which forbiddeth vsurie, is, that they were so plainely forbidden to lende their mony on vsurie to their brethren: wherevpon it had been an hard collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to haue gathered, that to straungers they might, had they not had the same liberty in plaine tearmes allowed vnto them, as we see that it was in the next verse after; but yet in such sort (wee are to gather) as otherwise was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the law of God.<note place="margin">Ib. 20.</note> For there are wee thus to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, that in that place which concerneth their brethren, they were vtterly forbidden to take any vsury; or any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of advantage whatsoever: and in that other that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth strangers, that they were forbidden but only that which was vnlawfull or ill: &amp; not such as was not against the rule of Charity. The like whereof wee haue before, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. of which <hi>Lyranus</hi> noteth wel,<note place="margin">In Mat. 19.</note> saying, <hi>Concessit da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ad usuram extraneis, ne fratres gravarent. Sicut ergo, qui non dat ad usuram nec extraneo, nec propinquo, facit magis se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum intentionem Mosis: ita ille qui docet uxorem non di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittendam,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7444:83"/>
non dicit contra ejus intentionem, sed magis sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet &amp; perficit illius legis datae imperfectionem.</hi> That is, Hee granted them liberty to lend vpon vsury vnto straungers, that they should not be grievous vnto their brethren. As therefore he that lendeth not forth his money to any vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie at all, neither to the stranger, nor to his neighbor, doth better follow the intention or minde of <hi>Moses</hi>: so hee that teacheth, that a man may not (for any case) put awaie his wife, he speaketh not contrary to his meaning, but rather accomplisheth &amp; supplieth the imperfection of that law given. (Not seeing then, that <hi>Moses</hi> had in plaine words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that vnto them, which now we see, he did not, as before is declared.) But in this liberty that is so plainely giuen vnto them, of lending on vsury vnto strangers, wee may well take good instruction vnto the matter that wee haue in hand. For as they, though they had that liberty graunted vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet because it was otherwise so plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden, should therefore in that case diligently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what kinde; of vsurie it was that was so farre allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto them, or in what measure it was permitted; and not (at adventure) rush at any: even so in this likewise, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divorce is a thing so contrary to all Scripture general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if in this case we thinke that it is permitted, yet were it the duty of al that would take to themselues that liberty, first to make diligent inquierie, how farre that liberty of theirs might be extended, not crossing any other word of God thereby; and not so resolutely to determine, that supposing such a liberty is graunted, they therevpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude withal, that there is nothing against the course that they haue taken, to obtaine to themselues the inioying of it. In that which forbiddeth the marriage of two sisters whe are not only to consider of the place it selfe: but also
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7444:84"/>
of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bezaes iudgement thereon. The place it selfe is, that every one is forbidden, during his wiues life, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her sister also: a place so taken by the generall assent of all, that although it seeme to forbid it, but only during his wiues life; yet that no man thereon may gather, that it is allowed for any man so to marry, after his wiues death neither. But now if we looke somewhat further into it, we may finde that (in the iudgement of some, and those none of the meanest) the sister that there is spoken of,<note place="margin">Tremel. Iun.</note> is not meant of a naturall sister (that being in effect, and by the like forbidden before) but of any other woman;<note place="margin">Ib. 16.</note> as, when a man hath one wife already, yet to take another vnto her: as indeed those words in the Hebrew it selfe are divers times elsewhere so vsed (as they also haue noted) and divers other good reasons there are why rather wee should so take them. And then whereas the Turkes (and such other libertines of that kind) are wont to reason, that to haue more wines then one, is no where forbidden by the word of God in the old Testament (and the new they doe not much regard) and so take vnto themselues the freer liberty that way to offend, if now the iudgement of these (being more then any of the rest that I knowe of, haue found) may be of force to weaken that resolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of theirs (not indeed gainsaid much by others here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tofore:) what letteth, but that these also, if the exception that now wee speake of, may haue in the iudgement of some of the learned another sense, may well doubt of so resolute conclusion, as they make therevpon, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently not thinke their libertie so cleere now, as they haue presumed before that it was? M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bezaes iudgement on this place I haue rather noted,<note place="margin">M.

For moving the question, <hi>Cur igitur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies,</hi> saith he, <hi>in alta lege additur exceptio, illa vivente, nisi ut intelligamus, una demum sorore mortua, alteram ducere fas esse.</hi> that is, Why then (will you say) saith he, in that other law is this Exception added, <hi>while shee liuèth,</hi> but that wee may so take it, that when one sister is dead, then may we lawfully marry another, his answere is this: <hi>Respondet Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius eadem illa epistola, non temerè ex eo quod scriptum est, colligendum esse quod scriptum non est.</hi> that is, Basil answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the same epistle (he meaneth in his Epistle <hi>ad Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> which he cited a little before) that out of that which is written wee must take heed, how wee gather any thing that is not written. And then himselfe also addeth his owne approbation therevnto saying, <hi>Et sanè it a est quoties saltem id quod consequi videtur, vel absurdum est, vel alio lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, siue expressè sive tacitè damnatum.</hi> that is, And truly so it is, so oft at least, as that which seemeth to follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is either absurd, or, by some other place besides, either expresly, or by implication condemned.

expressum fuisse ab Evangelista?</hi> that is, The Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth that hee will bee with his Church so longe as the world standeth: may a man gather thereon, either, that when the world shall haue an end, he wil the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> absent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from them; or else, that that (limitation) was added in vaine? Ioseph had no carnall knowledge of the blessed Virgin, so long as shee was with child; doth it therefore follow, that either afterward hee had such knowledge of her; or else, that that (limitation) was to no purpose set downe by the Evangelist? In which iudgement of his we haue divers things (me thinke) right worthy the marking: some directly appertaining vnto the matter wee haue in hand; and one other besides, out of which wee may take some benefit also to that purpose, though it ly so farre of from the same, that few there bee that would so apply it. Those that doe directly appertaine vnto the matter that we haue in hand, are, the rule that he bringeth out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil: and his owne approbation of it. The rule that hee bringeth out of Basil is such, as that if hee will afford it in this cause so far vnto vs, as in that other he taketh it vnto himselfe, we may account our selues so fensed with it, for the matter that now we speake of, as that neither himself, nor any other shall easily bee able to bring any thing of force against vs. In those words of Christ let them take heed, how they gather out of that which is spoken, that which is not, and then I trust that in the matter our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention also will soone be ended. That which is spoken, is plaine, that no man may put away his wife, vnlesse it bee for adultery: but that for adultery a man may doe it, though they thinke that to be plainely implied; yet vnles that also, be either there, or somewhere else plainely said, let it then stand as not said as yet, and then let them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7444:85"/>
take heed, how they gather it out of the other. In his approbation of it we see that he doth not onely in plaine tearmes approue it: but also doth adde some examples vnto it. If we goe no further but only to the words of his approbation, we may see that as he alloweth of the rule generally: so doth hee account it more strongly to hold whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soever it is either absurd, or against some other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that should be gathered therevpon. If it be good ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, even that only, I trust, will yeeld as much as wee shall need. If it be stronger in those two cases, then how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it may be, that very few can account it a thing <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,</hi> that for adultery a man should be allowed to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his wife and to marry another: yet if they will put it to the triall of other Scripture, I trust themselues wil not deny, but that they haue none other for it; and that wee doe charge them, there is much against it. His examples doe altogether stand with vs, and are very strong against them, to bring them vnto a better iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and, howsoever the former of them is without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception (for the matter that now I am to deliver) yet for the other, I thinke they may not deny, but that to let goe the limitation in the latter of them, were not of so hard a consequence in the Church of God, as so farre to enlarge the Exception that now wee speake of. That one thing that lieth somewhat farther off, and yet is such, as out of which we may take some benefit also to this that I speake of, is, that notwithstanding M. Beza did (by this occasion) so specially looke into this place that nowe wee are in (I meane <hi>Lev. 18:18.</hi>) yet did hee never finde that, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shewed Tremel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ius and Iunins both, to haue noted thereon. Of set purpose he disputeth it to and fro: and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the authorities of S. Basil, Rabbie Solomon, S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7444:86"/>
and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Calvine therein; and conferreth it with some other Scriptures besides. And yet (being a good lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guist himselfe) he looked not so far into the proprietie &amp; vse of the tongue for that point, but that hee let a good part of his matter to slip him therein, which otherwise he would haue bin loath to haue missed. Wherein although hee may well bee excused, for that all generally (for any thing that yet I haue found to the contrary) were wont so to take it, and to make no question of it: yet thus much may we gather, to the purpose that now we haue in hand that if wee find, that in this God hath imparted to these a greater light in the Original, then to many others besides: then may it be so in that other place also that before wee had out of Deuteronomie, whereon was laid a great part of the foundation it selfe of that opinion. But if these had published that iudgement of theirs before (as it may seem that they had, or thereabout; for they published the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the Bible but 3. yeeres after this book of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bezaes) thenwas the oversight therein so much the more vnhappy, for that then there was come abroad good meanes to amend it. In the new Testament we may bee the shorter,<note place="margin">In the new Testament.</note> because that M. Beza himselfe hath alleaged a couple of good importance to that end if they bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, and we will lay but two more vnto them: one, of another speech of Christ; the other, out of the Apostle S. Paul. That other of Christ, is, of not comming thence, vntil the vttermost farthing be paid. That of the Apostles is,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.26. 1, Tim, 3, 2.</note> that a Bishop must be the husband of one wife. In both which we may see, that something is in such sort to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, as that the opposite is not to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted thereby to be gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted: in the former, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is not so denied til then, that it may be thought to bee affirmed,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7444:86"/>

               </note> that it is not so denied to a Bishop, to haue mo wiues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one, that it is allowed to others to haue.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues do grant) hath a great shew to be against it; and we nothing doubt, but that it is against it in deed.</p>

How far it is that it may stretch to their helpe, may soone be said: namely, no more but only this, that in some case it were not ill, or at least might be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, that for adulterie the party innocent might breake of and marry againe.

For though the residue of the proposition be a general Negatiue; yet the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is neither general, nor negatiue neither; but particular, and affirmatiue too.

several branches thereof (at least many of them) may bee indifferent, and are according to the circumstances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto appertaining, to be adiudged. As in the Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, they all forbid, but only two of them, the fourth and the fift. In those eight therefore that do forbid, there is no special branch to them appertaining that can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, but is cleerely vnlawful (no braunch I meane, of that part of it that is Prohibitorie: for every of them doth imply the commanding part withal; as those two likewise that first command, do also imply that which forbiddeth;) as also in those two that Commaund there be many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which may be indifferent, till some such circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces shalbe added therevnto, as shall cast the ballance the one way or other.

And so consequently, so long as no farther or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was specially taken, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were careful not to tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse against the same, had no way at al, but to make far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquierie, in what manner he should keepe it holy: &amp; then to follow the rule prescribed. And so in this, seeing there is nothing said but generally, that for adultery a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may put away his wife and marrie againe (for that sense now for the time, for reasonings sake, wee are to admit) therefore whosoever would bee loath to offend therin, he had neede more specially to inquire, in what case, &amp; in what manner, it might be done for adultery also. For hee
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7444:87"/>
that saith, that for it, it may be done,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect. 30.</hi>
               </note> doth not say that in al cases, and howsoever it may be done, so that once the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of adultery be therevnto given: but as he granteth that in such case there is a farther libertie than in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, so doth he likewise by the same though closely, yet necessarily require, that if himselfe do not more speciallie declare what it is, then that there be farther inquirie after it. And then in this case, though the meaning of Christ in that Exception had beene, not to deny, but that for adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery such liberty might bee allowed, yet might no man in his owne private case presume any farther thereon, than elsewhere in the word of God, he should finde the same warranted vnto him: &amp; there is none of those that follow it (if themselues be honest, and haue any iudgement) but that do adde such limitation &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions vnto it (as partly we saw before) as we may safely gather thereby, that they do not account it allowed indifferently, or, at large vnto all. So that, though this sense were allowed vnto them, so farre as the words themselues should require: yet so also were it like to fall out, that very few of them should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to shrowde themselues vnder any iust protection of them.</p>

               </note> nowe are they to be put in minde of the other: namely, what it is wherevnto themselues are to yeeld, if they would haue any benefit of this latter sense of the Exception. And that may they plainely perceiue to require these two things: first, that they bee not too hasty to take vnto themselues that libertie, but that seriouslie they advise them selues vvhat they doe therein; and, when they are advised of it, how far then they are to forbeare it. That they bee not then to hastie to take that liberty, but that well they
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7444:88"/>
advise themselues what they doe therein, as themselues may see that they ought so to doe: so haue they good provocation vnto it. Themselues may see that they ought so to doe, even by the nature of the thing that they haue in hand. For being so doubtfull as it is, being by many of the learned, so plainely and resolutely gainesaid, even co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense will in such case teach any, that they ought to take good heed to their doings, and not at adventure to intrude themselues into that, which as yet they finde not to befall vnto them. The provocation that they haue therevnto, is in such examples as of that matter wee haue: and in the experience that wee haue likewise of the great displeasure of God to divers of those, that haue neglected that point of duty.<note place="margin">What exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they may haue, so to doe,</note> The examples that we haue are many, but few will serue to shew vs the way that in such case we are to follow: even David alone, if we heed him well; but we will adde some others vnto him besides. With David it was an vsuall thing, in matters of difficultie, not to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle at all, neither one way nor other, vntill hee had first sought to the Lorde, and thence had taken his direction: and that not only in the time of his trouble; but also, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was to enter into the possession of his Kingdome. In the time of his trouble we haue good instruction of this kinde in his example, first in helping certaine others: then in recovering a losse of his owne. Those others were the inhabitants of Keilah,<note place="margin">1, Sam, 23 12.</note> whome the Philistines at that time beseiged. Whereof when tidings were brought vnto him hee first inquired of the Lord, whether hee should goe to help them or not, though it seemeth that himselfe would otherwise very gladly haue done it:<note place="margin">Ib. 16.</note> and, when his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did cast some doubt of peril therein, hee then inquired of the Lord againe, before he would proceed therein. In
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7444:88"/>
Keilah likewise, when he had delivered the Cittie, and in reason might thinke, that now among them he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himselfe reasonable safe: yet, vpon some doubt that himselfe conceiued, that as then hee saw a storme to bee growing,<note place="margin">Ib. 9.12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> he would not rest on his owne reason and good deserts therein; but inquired of the Lord againe, and so escaped a speciall danger. That losse of his owne that he was to recover, was, that whilst hee and the companie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attended Achish King of Gath, to haue gone with him to battaile against Israel (a very great oversight in him) his owne Cittie Ziklag that the King had giuen him to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourne in, was by the Ama lakites take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his absence, their wiues and children, and all that was therein taken away,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.5, 6</note> and the Cittie it selfe consumed with fire. Whereat his company were so greeved at their returne (for they went not forward in that voiage, but were discharged and sent home againe, God providing much better for him) that when they found what losse they had therein, especially of their wiues &amp; children, they were so impatiently gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therewith, that they thought to haue stoned David their Captaine, as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were inraged against him.<note place="margin">1.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was to enter into the possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his kingdome, he observed (a wonder to see) the selfe same course.

            <p n="32">32 That if there were no Scripture against it, yet that it were not convenient for vs,<note place="margin">The Inconve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nience there of to be such at that onely should stay vs</note> I take it to bee, though dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by some, yet so generally graunted almost by all, that whatsoever inward conceipts divers may nourish (for the common corruption of nature in vs, worketh, in that kind, strong &amp; strange fancies in many) yet outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, very few, or none of them all, will seeme to deny it. But then the truth is, that they pretend to haue this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning withall, that thereby they would occasion the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate to punish that sinne by death, so to make an end of this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwixt vs: or else, that on him should rest the blame of such inconvenience. First therefore it shalbe good to consider, how inconvenient the thing it selfe would be among vs: then, how little cause there is, vnder such pretense,<note place="margin">How many waies it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient.</note> so far to take that liberty vnto them. How inconvenient a thing it would be with vs, may soone ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, first in respect of the Publike cause of all: then in respect of certaine private persons besides. In respect of the publike cause of all, it would be an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>venient thing with vs, partly for that we haue already taken other order amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs: but especialy, for the disorder that would come in vpon vs thereby. The other order that wee haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy taken among vs, is that part of the forme of our sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization of marriage, whereby each partie is directed to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7444:92"/>
take the other <hi>for better, for worse:</hi> which being the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall act of vs all, alloweth no particular persons so farre to breake it, or to call it in question, but that it concludeth such doing to be more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any such may well set abroach among vs. The disorder that would come in vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is, that it would open too wide a gap to al disconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted couples, to breake of, and to marry againe to their better liking (so long as we should haue no stronger restraint of that sinne among vs) and rather to commit the sin it selfe, being so easily punished with vs as it is, then otherwise to liue all their whole life in so great dislike. Those private persons, in whose respect it were inconvenient also, are, themselues, and others. Themselues cannot liue therein, but at the least in doubtfull estate, not onely before men, but also before God: or rather, as notorious sinners, in the iudgement both of the most and the best. Those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of two sorts: some, that are blemished; others, that are incumbred thereby. Those that are blemished thereby, are both those second wiues of theirs, and the children that by them they haue: the former of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounted no wiues but only adulteresses by law; and their children illegitimate also. Those that are incumbred thereby, are partly those to whome their lands or goods should of right descend, who by such dealing should haue their right very much incumbred: but especially, those discontented couples that before we spake of, who by a few such examples would be so tempted to doe the like, that hardly would they bee able to walke vprightly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. How little cause there is,<note place="margin">No iust ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuse vnto the in this that the Magistrat doth not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish adultery with death.</note> vnder pretense of that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, to the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Israel, that the Magistrats there were appointed to punish adulterie with death, to defend their owne vsurpation of that liberty, as though
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7444:93"/>
thereby they might driue the Magistrate to take that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der here also, or else himselfe to beare the blame of it may sufficiently appeare in this, that themselues cannot but knowe, both that as yet wee haue not that law among vs: and that there is no greate likelyhood neither, that ever wee shall hereafter haue it. If as yet wee haue it not, then must wee needs forbeare that liberty that now wee speake of, or else quickly bring all (for those matters) to greate confusion. That wee are not likely hereafter to haue it neither; it resteth on two principall groundes: one, the vnwillingnesse of all men generally to yeeld therevnto, though otherwise wee were never so free vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; the other, that wee are already intangled by one certaine let that is in the way. If all men generally bee so vnwilling to yeeld therevnto, though otherwise we were never so free vnto it (as most men will not sticke to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; and may appeare in the Israelites also, in that though it were so specially inioined to them, yet doe we not reade, that I remember, that ever it was put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution among them) then, though the Prince himselfe would bee willing, yet in what part of the world should wee find a people, that (the most parte of them: for such must they be, that any where lightly are allowed to make a law) would be ready to ioine with him therein? That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let wherewith we are already intangled, is the liberty that we take to our selues (and haue in some cases establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the same by law among vs) of marrying children, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially Wards, &amp; of making other disorderly matches in disparitie of yeeres, or condition, for landes or goods. Al which, so long as they sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (&amp; they are not likely yet to fall) are likely enough, so to intreat for their owne estate therein, that it is not likely that the other shall ever get in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7444:93"/>
any foote among vs. If then it be not likely, that ever wee shall haue any such law, then the same reason that doth teach vs to forbeare that praesupposed liberty of ours vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we haue such law established, should teach vs likewise, altogether to forbeare the desire of helping our selues thereby, when as wee are likely, never to haue it (in any good manner) allowed vnto vs. And then, what else maie we thinke that perswasion to be, but a special fetch of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, to bring in some special confusion, &amp; to work much mischiefe among vs? And if there bee so great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie hanging thereon, not only the wise of the world do resolutely determine, that of two evils, the lesser is rather to suffer a mischiefe in some few particulars, than while they seek to relieue them, thereby to bring in an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to all: but even the Apostle also hath plainely tolde vs, that though things may bee lawfull,<note place="margin">1. Cor 6.12.</note> yet if they be not expedient or profitable, in that case also they are not to be attempted by vs; and besides hath given in himselfe an example of it. As Christ also (no doubt) himselfe,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8.13.</note> by the selfsame rule, governed himselfe in many of his speeches and actions: and in effect prescribed the same vnto others.

So that, although the exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might haue such sense, as to import, that in some case it might so be: yet, both we must needs be wel advised of it; &amp; we must take heed that we never do it, either whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those aforesaid Scriptures may not wel beare it, or so oft as there is anie so greate inconvenience that hangeth thereon.</p>

That which belongeth to this that now we speake of, resteth but in these two points: one, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection that is gathered thereon; the other, the answere
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7444:94"/>
that may be given it. The Obiection that is gathered ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is this: that seeing the Apostle doth so plainely allowe (in case of infidelitie) that if the partie that doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, wil forsake the partie beleeving, that in such things a brother or sister is not in bondage, or, must of necessitie be forced, to liue without the help of wedlock, therefore if in this the bond of matrimonie may bee so broken, that the party forsaken may marry againe, it should seeme to be much more likely, that by adultery the bond should be much rather broken. For answere wherevnto, I thinke we need no more but this, that there is not the like reason in the one, as in the other: whether wee respect the offense that is committed, or the inconvenience that redoundeth vnto the other thereby. The offense that is committed,<note place="margin">The eases not like, and wherein they differ.</note> is adultery, a very foul and great sinne, both odious to God, and exceeding grievous to man, even intolerable almost vnto many: in that forsaking that the Apostle speaketh of, an vtter breaking óf of the knot of wedlock that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, so far as in that partie doth lie. The former of which sometimes proceedeth but of infirmitie: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them, is an hatred to Religion it selfe. Though therefore the Apostle allow the forsaken partie to marry againe, especially, when it is for hatred of the Truth, and where the other hath broken of already from the bond that was betwixt them: yet it may be, he would not allow (or at least it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not hence be gathered, that <hi>he would allow</hi>) of marrying againe, where the party offending hath but only sinned against that holy ordinance, and therein was not purposed, nor yet is, to breake of from the other, and when that sinne (it may bee) was done by infirmitie also, and much provoked by some inordinate dealing of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The inconvenience that redoundeth vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7444:95"/>
partie thereby, is by such forsaking much greater (in this kind) then is that other of committing adulterie. For by such forsaking it commeth to passe, that the partie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken is altogether deprived, not onely of a comfortable fruition of the good things of wedlocke, but also of the things themselues: of that needfull preservation from sin; of children likewise, and mutuall help. But it is not so by adulterie, for that the innocent partie, notwithstanding it, may haue all those of the offendor in some tolerable measure, though not in so good, and comfortable maner, as were expedient: he may haue that needfull help to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue him from sinne, and to accomplish divers of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; and propagation of children likewise. If hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take the benefit of anie such helpe of the other that hath beene so vnfaithfull vnto him, that is like enough to proceede but only of such perturbation of mind as some way casteth how to reveng, or cannot yet digest so great a displeasure done vnto him: which, indeed, is iustly deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the offendour; but not iustly entertained by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent partie, for that he which hath forgiven vs more, hath willed vs also, for his sake to forgiue. And therefore such perturbation is to be remoued or at least bridled: &amp; not any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipt thereon to be nourished, that now there can no such help be had of the partie offending. His chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (I graunt) may be somewhat doubtful, whether they be his or not: but that is so general a case withall, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must rather hold themselues contented with that general determination of law that by marriage doth make them theirs, (which also is their own act too) then suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be so carried away from the opinion that they are theirs, by such suspition as il likelyhoods may easily breed. Else, if any will needs be so peremptorie, let them
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7444:95"/>
first shew, that their own discent is vtterly void of all sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of any such blemish, before they deale so strictly with others. Albeit therefore the Apostle allow of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying againe, to such as vtterly are deprived of all such good things as by marriage God ordained for men: yet is there no reason, why any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should therevpon gather, that the like liberty were likewise to be graunted to those that may haue the vse of those things in some tolerable measure, but so far as their owne troubled affections doe hinder them of it.<note place="margin">An other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For many there are (and those of special account withal) that allow of no divorce, but onlie for adulterie (and thinke that those that go any farther, do make themselues wiser than their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster) nor of marrying againe, but onlie in that of adulterie, and in this of being forsaken: others againe, that allow both of divorce and marrying therevpon for divers other causes besides. In which extending of that libertie, there are of those that professe and teach the Gospel, that maie wel be doubted to go over far: as on the other side the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists generally are for divorce so very liberall, that they without questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stand in great need to be better shod for their so far over-reaching therein. But of this matter I meane not to treate: which would be sufficient it selfe to occupie another Treatice much greater then this. The thing that now I meane to deliver, is no more but this, that whereas the Apostle doth so plainely insinuate that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7444:96"/>
the party that is in such sort forsaken may marrie againe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect. 34.</hi>
               </note> and then doeth not altogether relie on that case neither, but taketh in some other withall, hence, it seemeth, may best be decided, in what cases it may be permitted to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry again: so that the rule be not in this point exceeded, to graunt it to such, as haue such vse of marriage already as need requireth. For we doe not here finde that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth allow it to any, but only to such as otherwise were altogether deprived of it: and though hee take in <hi>such</hi> like withall, yet must we therein haue a good eie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the originall or patterne giuen, and not account any like vnto it, but only wherein the one of the parties is as much otherwise deprived of the vse or benefit of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, as in the case that the Apostle himselfe hath put. For howsoever divers such there may bee, or at least some few, wherein it may be allowed to marry againe: yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that hauing none other Scripture for it but this we haue then no warrant at all to goe any further, or to extend that liberty to any other besides whatsoever.</p>

Now we see, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those others, but even these also do giue vs over, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to yeeld vs any help therein. Which divorce had they graunted vnto vs, wee had made no doubt at all, but they had in like sort allowed to marry againe: but now finding them so strong in the former; wee haue at all no hope of the latter. Even Christ also, we thought, did make no stay, not only at divorce (so it were for adulterie:) but, in that case also, not at marrying againe. But now wee see not, with what face wee may looke for any such liberty at his hands, when as we doubt it would fall out indeed, that if he should graunt so much vnto vs, hee should graunt vs more therein, then ever any other of his servants did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or since. Whereas therefore, his words may indeed haue another meaning, and such as agreeth with much other Scripture, wee doe not see, but that well, may wee doubt, that such sence as agreeth with much other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a great deale more likely to bee his meaning, than that which standeth alone by it selfe, and hath nothing else in all the Bible neither in the old Testament, nor in the new, that accordeth with it. Being thus strongly held of by the Scriptures, or rather cleane abandoned by them, when therevpon we returne againe (as passing loath to be cleane put downe in this, if any way we might see how to help it) to that sorie helpe that remaineth, the iudgement of certaine of the learned, before remembred, to consider somewhat better of them, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If we looke somewhat further into them, then doe we in like sort finde, not only that therein they goe against the vniversall opinion of all others therein (that long hath stood in the Church of Christ, even fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, for the only truth of that point of doctrine) and against the practice in gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this Church of ours, and of all others almost besides: but also, that themselues giue vs in so weake reasons why they thought good to side themselues to that opinion, &amp; such Protestations withall, the better to obtaine to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused for that they goe so farre therein; and when they are in the matter it selfe, so many of their proofes for that they affirme so very slender, and so inconvenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t speeches withall (boading such impatiencie, that they may seeme to arise of the weaknesse of the cause it selfe) that if wee well advise our selues what comfort it is that there wee haue gotten, wee hardly finde any thing throughout the whole that will afford vs any one peece of warrant, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine any such conceit, for never so smal a portion of time, or to giue it so much as one nights lodging. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine then wil be none other but this, that our selues are carried so strongly away, with our owne vnbridled affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (with an hote desire, either of change, or of revenge and sometime with both) that it was an easie matter, for parcialitie and error in others, to settle vs in that conceit, we being loath (for feare of disturbing our peace therein) to fall to any iust examining of them.

we may so far abandon all fleshly lusts, that thereby wee grow not to bee so foule staines in the Church of God, nor so perilous examples to others: especially those, that haue an vnfained care to serue him indeed, or, no more but professe the truth of the Gospell.</p>

            <p>THis former Treatice being thus finished, yet is there one thing more (gentle Reader) that farther I am by late oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, to impart vnto thee: nothing at all appertaining to the matter before; but only for that it lighteth on the time of the publishing of it. The matter is no more, but this.</p>
            <p>I haue already divers times heard, that certaine of the favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of <hi>R. P.</hi> (the supposed Author of the <hi>Resolution</hi>) would not beleeue that I had made any answere vnto him for such matters, as hee, in the preface of his second edition of the same (which was, 1585) had charged me withall. And for these, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented me selfe to let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnderstand, that I had answered him many yeeres before: as it is knowne wel enough I had done (so far as an whole Impression might serue to witnes it) now about twentie yeeres since.</p>
            <p>But now of late I perceiue, that himselfe also doth not take with his Answere, or will not be acknowne of it: &amp; this doe I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that nowe (a fewe daies since) I finde, that having set forth that Book again, but about two yeeres past (namely, 1607) and having altered it againe from that it was before (but the first, it may be, will ever proue the best) he nevertheles chargeth me a fresh, with many of those stale matters, answered so manie yeeres past already; but maketh no mention of that mine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</p>
            <p>Seeing therfore I came to the knowledge hereof, when this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was yet vnder the Presse, I thought it good herewithall to wish this to be marked, that seeing that answer of mine was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth and published, in the yeere of our Lord 1589; &amp; that since I never heard any thing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him of the same, &amp; that now he wra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gleth a fresh about some of those his stale matters again,
<pb facs="tcp:7444:100"/>
and so grosly (though warily enough on his own behalfe) dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth mine Answere to them and the rest: that all good &amp; order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealing (of such a kind) was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> somwhat far to seeke in him.</p>
            <p>I make no doubt, but that there (in that mine Answere) he noted much more to be obiected, than any way hee was able well to answere (especially, the great vncleannes of all that crew ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally; their bad dealing with the Fathers; and so many slips of his owne withall:) and that therefore he would rather see, if, for a flourish, he could not cull out something of his former matters to gibe at againe, to be in lew or steed of some iust Reply, so long expected. But plaine dealing is ever the meetest for all those that stand for the truth and so base shifting, much more sutable to the desperate weaknesse of the cause that he hath in hand.</p>
            <p>And if any man shall lay therevnto his bold promise of those other two parts, of that which now he calleth his <hi>Directorie,</hi> &amp; therein how many yeeres he hath beene hammering about it, &amp; yet could never get out of the first part neither, and the seconde time made it worse than before (even in the iudgement of his owne favourits:) the lesse that this third time also he hath nowe againe answered their expectation, the more may such a man see, what hope he may nourish in himselfe, as touching those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But me selfe conceived long since (and so did reasonable plainely tell him) that it was not in him to doe, as then he did beare the world in hand: namely, to frame such other two parts, as should be of that argument, and yet sutable to that, which hee had elsewhere borrowed to the first part of it.</p>
            <p>An other there is, one <hi>Radford</hi> by name, a fowle of that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who in certaine discourses of his of other matters, publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the yeere 1599, hath beene something chattering against me likewise, in the quarrell of his fellow <hi>R. P.</hi> before: &amp; yet none otherwise but like to himselfe. Of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> notwithstanding I haue alreadie said something<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> somewhat more specially, in a larger
<pb facs="tcp:7444:101"/>
Discourse of mine, which now (God willing) next vnto this, &amp; so but a few daies hence, I trust, is to come to the Presse: and so saie I no more of that matter now. Yet that no man deceiue his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation therein, both it is but towardes the end of that larger Treatice: and, as hee, in those his other discourses doth no more, but as it were, by the way, take his pleasure on me; so I likewise, following the suit, or, in such like manner, doe giue him his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</p>
            <p>So now againe (gentle Reader) I commend thee to God.</p>
