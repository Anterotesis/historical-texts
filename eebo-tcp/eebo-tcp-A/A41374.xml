         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HAving well conſidered the worth of theſe witty ſayings, I ſhall not hold
a Candle (as it were) to the Sun, by writing an Epiſtle, the work in it
ſelf being a Store-houſe of excelent uſe both for Wit and Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Apophthegm</hi> 1. Afflictions cannot be eſteemed with wiſe and godly men any
argument of ſin in an innocent perſon, more then the impurity of wicked men
is amongſt good men any ſure token of innocency.</p>
            <p>2. That in the direct worſhip of God himſelf we ought to be guided by the
word of God, and not otherwiſe, but in the form and order of Ceremonies,
that indeed is ſolely left to the Church.</p>
            <p>3. When the King firſt entered the Caſtle of <hi>Ragland,</hi> the Marqueſs kiſſed
the Kings hand, and riſing up again he ſaluted his <hi>Majeſty</hi> with this comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
My Lord, I am not worthy: the King replyed unto the Marqueſs, my
Lord, I may well anſwer you again, <hi>I have not found ſo great faith in Iſrael,</hi> for
no man would truſt me with ſo much mony as you have done: to which the
Marqueſs replyed, I hope your <hi>Majeſty</hi> will prove a Defender of the Faith.</p>
            <p>4. Prepare for war when thou prepoundeſt for peace, otherwiſe thy peace will
be hardly obtained, or too highly prized, whatever thy firſt Article be, let diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding,
be the laſt. A cunning Curre, though he wag his tail will ſhew his
teeth, the beſt Treaty is with a drawn ſword, and the ſafeſt peace is concluded
under a Buckler.</p>
            <p>5. When King <hi>Charls</hi> had made his repair to <hi>Raegland,</hi> after the Battell of
<hi>Naſeby,</hi> taking occaſion thank the Marqueſs for ſome money lend his <hi>Maieſty,</hi>
the Marqueſs returned his <hi>Majeſty</hi> this anſwer, Sir I had your word for my
money, but I never thought I ſhould be ſoon repaid, for now you have given
me thanks, I have all I look for.</p>
            <p>6. The lower ſort of people are deſirous of novelties, and apt for change
weighing Government with the ſcales of their own fortune, they are too ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of evils in preſent, to fear worſe in future, let ſuch know they move in
their particular orbs, not in the common ſphere, and that the alteration in the
heavens make no ſtar greater, which way ſoever the change moves, a Cobler
ſhall be but a Cobler ſtill.</p>
            <p>7. It is a Princely alchimy out of neceſſary wars to extract an honourable
Peace, and more beſeeming the Majeſty of a Prince to thirſt after Peace then
Conqueſt. Bleſſedneſs is promiſed to the Peace-maker, not to the Conqueror.
It is a happy State whoſe peach hath a peacefull hand, and a martiall heart, able
both to uſe peace, and to manage War.</p>
            <p>8. His Majeſty being very well grounded in the true Proteſtant Religion, in
a Diſcourſe concerning Sectaries, ſaid truly, That there were but two good
ſentences in a Sectaries Sermon, the firſt of neceſſity good, which is the Text,
the ſecond by conſequent, which is the end, and thereby an end of an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>9. Sir <hi>Henry Bard,</hi> who was Lord <hi>Bellamount,</hi> coming into the Hall of <hi>Rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and ſeeing ſo many Tables furniſhed with food, and feeders, ſware that
his Majeſty had a plot to deſtroy that Family firſt, in borrowing all the old mans
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97250:2"/>
money, and then in coming thus to eat up his victuals: which his Majeſty hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſmiled at: but the Marqueſſe asked the man who made the relation unto
him, of what Garriſon the Lord <hi>Bellamount</hi> was Governour; it was told his
Lordſhip, that he was Governour of <hi>Cambden</hi> houſe; the Marqueſſe replyed,
that when the King had done as he ſaid, that then his Majeſty might go to his
Garriſon, and there he might have <hi>Cambdens</hi> Remains.</p>
            <p>10. There be three ſorts of Government, Monarchical, Hiſtorical, Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical,
and they are apt to fall three ſeveral wayes into ruine. The firſt by
Tyranny, the ſecond by Ambition, the laſt by tumult. A Commonwealth
grounded upon any of theſe, is but of ſhort continuance, but being wiſely
mingled, either guard the other, and makes the Government exact.</p>
            <p>11. In the war, the King came to a Caſtle, and told the Lord thereof, that he
thought not to have ſtayed with his Lordſhip above three dayes, but his occaſion
requiring a longer ſtay, and conſidering that it was a Garriſon, and that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
might be ſpent by ſo great a preſſure, was willing his Lordſhip ſhould
take what proviſion the Countrey would afford for his preſent maintenance,
and recruir: to which his Lordſhip anſwered, <hi>I humbly thank your Majeſty,
but my Caſtle will never ſtand long, if it leans upon the Countrey, and I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be brought to a morſell of bread, then any morſels of bread ſhould be brought
in to entertain your Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. Sir <hi>Thomas Somerſet,</hi> brother to the Marqueſſe of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> had a houſe
which they called <hi>Troy,</hi> five miles from <hi>Ragland</hi> Caſtle: this Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> being
a compleat Gentleman of himſelf, delighted himſelf much in fine Gardens and
Orchards, whereby the benefit of art the earth was made ſo gratefull to him at
the ſame time, that the King happened to be at his brothers houſe, that it
yielded him wherewithall to ſend his brother <hi>Worceſter</hi> a preſent, and ſuch an
one as the time and place conſidered was able to make the King to believe, that
the Soveraign of the Planets had new changed the Poles, and that <hi>Wales,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
and outcaſt of the fair Garden of <hi>England,</hi> had fairer and riper fruit then
<hi>England</hi> bowels had on all her beds, this preſented to the Marqueſſe, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe
would not ſuffer to be preſented to the King, by any other hand then
his own, in comes the Marqueſſe at the latter end of Supper, led by the arm,
with a ſlow pace, expreſſing much a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> gravity, with a ſilver diſh in each
hand filled with rarities, and a little basket on his arm, as a reſerve, where making
his obeyſance, he thus ſpeaks, May it pleaſe your <hi>Majeſty,</hi> if the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
could have been rob'd to have entertained your <hi>Majeſty,</hi> I think I had
but done my duty; but I muſt do as I may, if I had ſent to <hi>Briſtol</hi> for ſome
good things to entertain your <hi>Majeſty,</hi> that had been no wonder at all, If I had
procured from <hi>London</hi> ſome goodneſs, that might have been acceptable to your
<hi>Majeſty,</hi> but here I preſent your <hi>Majeſty</hi> (placing his diſhes upon the Table)
with what, that came not from <hi>Lincoln,</hi> that was not <hi>London,</hi> that is not <hi>York</hi>
that is to be, but I aſſure your <hi>Majeſty,</hi> that this preſent came from <hi>Troy:</hi>
whereupon the King ſmiled, and anſwered the <hi>Marqueſſe,</hi> Truly my Lord, I
have heard, <hi>That corn now grows where</hi> Troy <hi>Town ſtood,</hi> but I never thought
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97250:3"/>
there had grown any apricocks there before. Whereupon the Marqueſs replyed,
any thing to pleaſe your <hi>Majeſty:</hi> when my Lord Marqueſſe departed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
one told his Lordſhip, that he would make a very good Courtier, the
Marqueſſe ſaid I remember I ſaid one thing that may give you ſome hopes of me,
<hi>Any thing to pleaſe your Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. The firſt night his <hi>Majeſty</hi> came into <hi>Ragland</hi> Caſtle, the King deſired
to ſee the great Tower, where his Lordſhip did uſe to keep his Treaſure, his
<hi>Majeſty</hi> ſpake unto Doctor <hi>Baily</hi> then ſtanding by to fetch the Keyes; he ran
down to the Marqueſſe and acquainted him with the Kings pleaſure, who would
needs bring them to the King, and ſhew him the Tower himſelf: when the
King ſaw the Marqueſſe bringing the keyes himſelf, he thus ſpake unto the
<hi>Marqueſſe,</hi> My Lord, there are ſome men ſo unreaſonable, as to make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that your Lordſhip hath good ſtore of gold yet left within this Tower,
but I knowing how I have exhauſted you, together with your own occaſions
could never have believed it until now I ſee you will not truſt the keyes with
any but your ſelf: to which the Marqueſſe made this reply, Sir, <hi>I was ſo far
from giving your Majeſty any ſuch occaſion of thought by this tender of my
duty, that I proteſt unto you, that I was once reſolves that your Majeſty ſhould
have lain there, but that I was loath to commit your Majeſty to the Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. When the King firſt entred the gates of <hi>Ragland,</hi> the Marqueſs deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Majeſty the keyes according to the ordinary cuſtome the King reſtoring
them to the Marqueſſe, the Marqueſſe ſaid, I beſeech your <hi>Majeſty</hi> to keep
them if you pleaſe, for they are in a good hand, but I am afraid that ere it be

            <p>15. King <hi>Charls</hi> coming to <hi>Ragland,</hi> when the tall Cedar of our <hi>Lebanon</hi> was
brought ſo low, and thoſe Sycomores flouriſhed when the Royal Oak was in the
fall of the leaf, it happened that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> was at Bowls upon <hi>Ragland</hi> Caſtle
Green, a place proudly ſituated, where after he had ended his Recreation, his
Majeſty was pleaſed to delight himſelf with obſerving the Countrey round about,
it happened, that one <hi>Prichard,</hi> the Kings partner at bowls, preſuming more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his good bowling, then good manners, continued that familiarity that
ſhould have ended with the rubbers, ſhewing the King where his houſe ſtood,
and told his <hi>Majeſty</hi> he muſt look through the wood, and he might ſee a white
thing, and that was it: moreover acquainted his <hi>Majeſty</hi> what the Lord of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>
had adviſed him, <hi>viz.</hi> to cut down ſome of thoſe trees, that the houſe
might plainly be diſcerned from the Green, whereby his Lordſhip when he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a good bowler might make a ſign, and ſo have him at a beck: to which the
King replyed, Mr. <hi>Prichard,</hi> let me give you better adviſe, put up more trees
where the trees are ſo thin, that my Lord of <hi>Worceſter</hi> may not ſee thy houſe at
all. The Marq. of <hi>Worceſter</hi> ſuppoſing the King had dreamed of this greedineſs,
of purchaſing all the Land which was near unto him, ſhewed his Majeſty a row
of trees, and told the King, that beyond that row of trees ſtood a pretty Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and becauſe he would not have <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard to be an eye-ſore to him,
he had planted thoſe trees to hoodwink his eyes from ſuch temptations.</p>

            <head>Apophthegms of the Earl of Worceſter.</head>
            <p>1. The Marqueſs had a mind to tell the King as handſomely as he could of
ſome of his (as he thought) faults, and thus he contrived his plot againſt the
time, that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> was wont to give his Lordſhip a viſit, as commonly he
uſed to do after dinner, his Lordſhip had the book of <hi>John Gower</hi> lying before
him on the Table, the King caſting his eye upon the book, told the Marqueſs,
that he had never ſeen it before, O ſaid the Marqueſs, it is a book of books,
which if your Majeſty had been well verſed in, it would have made you a King
of Kings, Why ſo my Lord, ſaid the King? Why ſaid the Marqueſs, here is ſet
down how <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> brought up and inſtructed <hi>Alexander</hi> the great in all his
rudiments and principles belonging to a Prince; and under the perſons of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> he read the King ſuch a leſſon, that all the ſtanders by were
amazed at his boldneſs, and the King ſuppoſing that he had gone further then
his Text would have given him leave, asked the Marqueſs, whether he had his
leſſon by heart, or whether he ſpake out of the book: the Marqueſs replyed, Sir,
if you could read my heart, it may be, you might find it there, or if your Majeſty
pleaſe to get it by heart, I will lend it you upon theſe conditions, 1. That you
read it, 2. That you make uſe of it: but perceiving how ſome of the new made
Lords fretted and bit the thumbs, at certain paſſages in the Marqueſſes diſcourſe
he thought a little to pleaſe his Majeſty, though he diſpleaſed them, the men
who were ſo much diſpleaſed already proteſting unto his Majeſty, that no man
was ſo much for the abſolute power of a King, <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> deſiring the book out
of the King he would ſhew him one remarkable paſſage to that purpoſe, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that place, that had this verſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A King can kill, a King can ſave, A King can make a Lord a knave, And
of a knave a Lord alſo.</hi> Whereupon there were divers new made Lords ſlunk
out of the room, on which the King ſaid, At this rate you will drive away all
my Nobilty.</p>
            <p>2. The Marqueſſe travelling, was as he thought ſurprized by enemies, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the top of a high mountain, by the advantage of the ground, he could
ſee the enemy marching off another way, at which ſight the Marqueſs dwelt
with his eyes a little longer upon that object then the L. <hi>John Somerſet</hi> his
Son thought convenient, whereunto the Marqueſs anſwered, <hi>O Son, I love to
ſee my own danger, eſpecially when it is marching off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Earl of <hi>Worceſter</hi> travelling towards <hi>Ragland,</hi> at a certain Inne in a
poor town, where he lay, by the careleſneſs of ſervants left behind him 1000 l.
in Gold, being hid under a bench, and forgot to be taken away, the money was
never miſſed untill they came to their journeys end at night, and it being told
my Lord that ſo much was miſſing, and where they had left it, my Lord made
no other words of it but theſe, You talk of a cheap reckoning, but I never paid
ſo dearly for a nights lodging in all my life: who would think that a man
ſhould leave ſo much money behind him in ſuch a lowſie Inn? On that ſtood by
at that time told the Marqueſſe, that it was a hundred to one if ever he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>d
of his money again, it was ſuch a beggerly houſe, O Peace, ſaid the Marqueſſe,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97250:4"/>
if they will not be known of the mony, you ſhall ſee it will be a brave Inne in
a ſhort time: this mony was ſent after, and very honeſtly reſtored, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the meſſengers hands that came for it. Being brought unto the Marqueſs,
there was much wondering at the honeſty of the woman of the houſe, others
praiſed the whole town ſeeing it was generally known. The Marqueſs told
them, <hi>It may be the town never ſaw ſo much mony before, and therefore they
knew not what to make of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The Earl of <hi>Clamorgan,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Worceſters</hi> eldeſt ſon, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with divers of high rank and quality, as they were on their journey for
<hi>Ireland,</hi> quartered in the town of <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> a Sea Town in <hi>North Wales,</hi> where
they were entertained with diſcourſe at the Table, by ſome of the County
Gentlemen, who informed them of the falling of an old <hi>Welch</hi> Propheſie at
that very time and place, which was <hi>viz.</hi> That there ſhould come a magpy,
and build her neſt in the Crown, then ſhould come a Jackdaw, and beat away
the magpy, and after that there ſhould come a Buzzard, that ſhould beat away
the Jackdaw, and then there ſhould be ſeen no Crown, but that of thorns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Kings head, at laſt there ſhould come a Band of men from a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and take away the thorns and then the Crown ſhould appear again: this
they ſaid, was thus hitherto accompliſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> Over the gate of <hi>Carnarvan</hi>
Caſtle, there was the picture of King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, in full proportion,
with a Crown upon his head, there did come a magpy, and did build her neſt
in the ſaid Kings Crown, and a Jackdaw did beat away the magpy, and the
Buzzard the Jackdaw: this we aſſure your honour to be true; for all
our Townſmen have obſerved it. Dinner being ended, they all went
unto the Caſtle gate, being greedy to ſatisfie their eyes with the ſight,
as well as their ears with the Relation; where being come they beheld the
ſight, the neſt being diſordered by the fighting of the combatants, and the
materials of the neſt made ſuch a mournfull aſpect, as if they had been Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
pleated upon the Kings head. The Earl of <hi>Clamorgan</hi> could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the ſight but ſtraightway commanded the neſt to be pulled down, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls
of which was ſuch, as never any bird builded her neſt with, <hi>viz.</hi> White
thorn: the ſtory being related to the Marqueſs of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> after ſome pauſe
he ſaid, that is the nick-name, which the Roundheads uſe to give the Biſhops:
and none about him gueſſing at his meaning, he ſaid, as I take it, they uſed to
call the Biſhops magpies, whom they reproach for building their neſts in the
Crown, then came the Presbyterian Jackdawes, and beat them out, and
the next thing that you ſhall ſee, will be the Independent Buzzards, which
drive them away, and who comes next God knows: but asking further whether
it was an open or an Imperiall Crown, anſwer being made that it was open,
<hi>O then,</hi> ſaid the Marqueſs, <hi>that was the reaſon the Kings Crown was too open,
had it been cloſe at top with the Croſſe over head, ſuch unlucky birds could never
have come there to have built their neſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>Antiſthines</hi> being asked of one what learning was moſt neceſſary for mans
life, anſwered, <hi>To unlearn that which is nought.</hi>

7. The Marqueſs talking of an old drunken fellow, who having uſed his body
to diſorder in drinking all his life time, at laſt giving it over, preſently dyed,
Oh ſaid the Marqueſs, <hi>If you take a brand out of the fire, that is throughly burnt
it will fall in pieces, but if you let it ly there ſtill, it may remain a pretty while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>8. During the Siege of <hi>Ragland,</hi> there came a Musket Bullet in at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of the withdrawing room, where my Lord was uſed to entertain his friends
with his pleaſant diſcourſes after Dinners and Suppers, which glancing upon?
little Marble pillar of the window, and from thence hit the Marqueſs upon the
ſide of the head, and fell down flatted uppon the Table, which breaking in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the Pillar, made ſuch a noiſe in the rome, that the Counteſs of <hi>Glamorgan</hi>
who ſtood in the ſame window, run away, as if the houſe had been falling down
upon her head, crying out O Lord, O Lord, but finding her ſelf more afraid
then hurt, ſhe returned back again, no leſſe excuſing her ſelf, as ſhe was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to call it rudeneſſe to her Father, then acknowledging her fears to all the
company: to whom the Marq. ſaid, Daughter, you had reaſon to run away when
your Father was knockt on the head, and pauſing ſome while, and turning the
flatted bullet round with his finger, he further ſaid, <hi>Gentlemen, Thoſe who had a
mind to flatter me, were wont to tell me, that I had a good head-piece in my youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
dayes, but if I do not flatter my ſelf, I think I have a good head-piece in my
old age, or elſe it would not have been musket proof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. There was a young and beautiful Lady, who was ſhewing the Marqueſſe,
that the Colours that hung on ſuch a Tower, was one of the Curtains of her bed.
To which he replyed, <hi>Madam.</hi> I would you would ſet the little boy that uſes
to ſtand behind that Curtain, on the top of that Tower, that we may ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no he would drive away all thoſe men with his Bow and Arrows. To
which the Lady replyed, <hi>Cupid</hi> never raiſed a ſiege in his life, but he hath taken
many a ſtrong hold: Then ſaid my Lord, I ſhall tell you how you ſhall make
yours impregnable. How my Lord ſaid the Lady? He ſaid unto he, Whatſoever
you ſee a handſome young man be ſure you ſhut your eyes, or elſe he will take

            <p>10. The Marqueſs was one day reading of us a Lecture of patience in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity: amongſt the reſt of thoſe witty Sayings which came from him, he told
us that there was nothing ſo bad, but it was good for ſomething; for ſaid he

               <hi>11. When it was told the Marqueſs, that ſome would warrant him that if he
would, he might be Duke of</hi> Somerſet, <hi>he made them this Reply,</hi> When I was
E. of <hi>Worceſter</hi> I was well to live, ſince I was a Marq. I am worſe by one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand pounds, and if I ſhould be a Duke, I ſhould be an arrant Beggar;

               </gap>any things were requeſted of the Gen. by the Marqueſs, and being as he thought
himſelf happy in the attainment, his Lordſhip was pleaſed to make a merry Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
to the General, as he was taking his leave, <hi>viz.</hi> in the behalf of a couple
of young Pigeons, which were wont to come to his hand, and feed out of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,
in whoſe behalf he deſired the General that he would be pleaſed to give
him his Protection for them, fearing the little command that he ſhould have
over his Souldiers in that behalf. To which the General ſaid I am glad to ſee
your Lordſhip ſo merry. Oh ſaid the Marqueſs, you have given me no other
cauſe; for I reſolved to undergo even the worſt of evils you were able to lay
on me before ever I took up Arms for my Sovereign, therefore wonder not that
I am ſo merry.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> asked of <hi>Apollonius</hi> what was the cauſe of <hi>Nero's</hi> ruin; who

wind up the ſtrings too high, or let them down to low.</p>
            <p>14. Some men have ſo much of the Serpents ſubtilty, that they forget the

replyd, what my old friend Claret? Nay, give it me in ſpight of all Phyſicians
and their Books, it never ſhall be ſaid, that I forſook my friend for to pleaſure

            <p>18. When it was told his Lordſhip not long before he dyed, that leave was
obtained by the Parliament, that he might be buried in <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle, within
the great Chappel, and wherein divers of his Anceſtors ly buried, with ſome

            </p>
            <p>19. The Marq. being weak in body, and told by ſome friends, that when he
was dead they would Petition for mony to bury him, He replyed, Then will they
appoint thoſe to diſpoſe of the time and manner of my burial, and you ſhall ſee
that they, being it is ſo near the good time, will cauſe me to be buried
