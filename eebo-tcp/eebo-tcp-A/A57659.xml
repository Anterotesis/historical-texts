            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There is a twofold love, to wit, in the Creatour, and in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Gods love is twofold, inherent in himselfe, and this is eternall as himselfe, therefore hath no father nor mother; Or transient to the creature. This love was first
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99553:44"/>
seen in creating the <hi>Chaos,</hi> and all things out of it; therefore they said that Love was engendred of <hi>Chaos</hi> without a father: and when they write that <hi>Zephyrus</hi> begot <hi>Cupid</hi> of an egge, what can it else mean, but that the Spirit of God did manifest his love in drawing out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and confused egge of the <hi>Chaos</hi> all the creatures? The love of the creature is twofold, according to the twofold object thereof, to wit, God and the creature: that love by which wee love God, is begot of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> that is, God; and that uncreated beauty in him is the cause of this love: and because the maine and proper object of love is beauty (for wee doe not love goodnesse, but as it is beautifull) and it is the object that moveth and stirreth up the <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

                     </note> passion, therefore <hi>Venus</hi> goddesse of beauty is still the mother of <hi>Cupid</hi> or Love, which notwithstanding hath many fathers, because this generall beautie is joyned to many particular qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which causeth love in men according to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and dispositions: some are in love with wars, and count military skill and courage a beautifull thing, so this love is begot of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi>; others are in love with eloquence, and think nothing so beautifull as that, and so <hi>Mercurie</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are parents of this love: some love Musick, and so <hi>Apollo</hi> begets this <hi>Cupid</hi>; and so wee may say of all things else which wee love, that there is some qualitie adherent to beautie, either true or apparent, which causeth love in us: Now that love which all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have to creatures of their own kinde, in multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by generation, is the childe of <hi>Vulcan</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>; for it is begot of their own naturall heat and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beautie: by beauty I mean whatsoever wee account pleasing to us, whether it be wealth, honour, pleasure, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99553:44"/>
                     <hi>Amor qui desinere potest, nunquam fuit verus.</hi> Hee hath wings, for love must be swift; hee is blinde, for love must wink at many things, it <hi>covereth a multitude of sins</hi>; hee is naked, for amongst friends all things should be common, the heart must not keep to it self any thing secret, which was the fault that <hi>Dalila</hi> found in <hi>Samsons</hi> love: he is crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with roses, for as no flower so much refresheth the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and delights our smell as the rose; so nothing doth so much sweeten and delight our life as love; but the rose is not without prickles, nor love without cares: the crown is the ensigne of a King, and no such King as Love, which hath subdued all creatures; rationall, sensitive, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative, and senselesse have their sympathies. The image of a Lionesse with little <hi>Cupids</hi> playing about her, some tying her to a pillar, others putting drink into her mouth with an horn, &amp;c. do shew how the most fierce creatures are made tame by love: therefore hee hath a rose in one hand, and a Dolphin in the other, to shew the qualitie of love; which is swift and officious like the Dolphin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable and sweet like the rose: his arrowes doe teach us, that Love wounds deeply, when wee cannot obtain what we love: some of his arrowes are pointed with lead, some with gold; hee is wounded with a golden arrow, that aims at a rich wife, and cannot obtain her; to be wounded with leaden arrowes, is to be afflicted for want of ordinary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which wee love: and so his burning torches shew, that a lover is consumed with griefe for not obtaining the thing loved, as the wax is with heat: <hi>Ardes amans</hi> Dido; <hi>Vtitur infoelix; Coeco carpiturigne, Est mollis flamma medul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99553:47"/>
Hence cunning engines and workes, are called <hi>Daedali machera, Daedalaea opera.</hi> 3.

They that give themselves to unlawfull pleasures, with <hi>Pasiphae,</hi> shall bring forth that monster which will devoure them. 5. <hi>Daedalus</hi> made this labyrinth, and was cast into it himselfe; so the wicked are caught in their own nets; and fall into the pit which they dig for others. 6. <hi>Daedalus</hi> was guiltie of murther, therefore is justly pursued; for murther is never secure. 7. <hi>Icarus</hi> is justly punished for refusing to hearken to his fathers counsell, a good lesson for all children. 8. Let us take heed of curiosity, pry not too much into the secrets of God, lest wee have <hi>Icarus</hi> his reward: for all humane reason is but waxen wings. 9. Here wee see for the most part that young men are high-minded and proud, but pride alwayes hath a fall. 10. Astronomers, and such as will undertake to fore-tell future contingencies, or will take upon them such things as passe humane power, are like <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carus</hi>; they fall at last into a sea of contempt and scorn. 11. The golden mean is still best, with what wings soever wee flye, whether with the wings of honour, or of wealth, or of knowledge and speculation; not to flye too high in pride, nor too low in basenesse. 12. If wee will flye to Christ with the wings of faith, wee must not mount too high in presumption, nor fall too low in desperation. 13. Wee see by <hi>Pasiphae,</hi> that a dishonest and disloyall wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will leave no means unattempted to fulfill her lustfull and wanton desires. 14.

away by strangers; and wee see that the poor are more beholding to rich men in their death, then in their life. 5. <hi>Hecate</hi> is called <hi>Trivia,</hi> because shee hath the charge of high-wayes; because the high-waies are discernable by the Moon-light, which in the dark are not easily found out; and because the high-wayes are barren or fruitlesse: hence <hi>Hecate</hi> is said to be a perpetuall virgin. 6. <hi>Hecate</hi> was said to affright and terrifie men; by which I suppose the Poets meant, that fear and terrours proceed from an evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. 7. <hi>Hecate</hi> was the name of a cruell woman, who delighted in hunting, and in stead of killing or shooting beasts, murthered men: sure shee had been a fit wife for that mighty hunter <hi>Nimrod.</hi> 8.

The Romans used to worship <hi>Mercury</hi> within the Citie, but <hi>Hercules</hi> without; to signifie, that by strength and policie they maintained their Empire; at home they used eloquence and policie; abroad, strength and industrie. 12.

Children &amp; young men were not permitted to swear by <hi>Hercules</hi> but bare-headed, and abroad in the open air; perhaps to make them the more wary and fearfull in swearing, and to strike a greater reverence of an oath in them. I wish our children and young people would learn the like reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the true God when they take his name in their mouths. 16. They used in old times to offer the tenth part of their goods to <hi>Hercules,</hi> therefore the tythe was called <hi>Herculana,</hi> and they that offered this, were said <hi>Pollucere Herculi</hi>: But <hi>Tertullian</hi> complaines (in <hi>Apoll.</hi>) that the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99553:68"/>
Gentiles cosened their God, promising to him the tenth, but scarce offering the fourth part of that. Are there not too many Christians now, who prosesse much, but practise little; not caring how they serve God, so they may serve him at an easie rate; who would willingly go to heaven so they may save their purses? 17. The new married bride was wont to be girded with a girdle having a strong knot, called <hi>nodus Herculanus,</hi> an Herculean knot; in signe of secunditie, because <hi>Hercules</hi> in one night begot 50 sons of <hi>Thespius</hi> his daughters. But wee know, that it is the Lord only who doth open and shut the wombe, who maketh the barren to rejoyce. 18. Whilst <hi>Hercules</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, he was slighted, and persecuted; but being dead, he was deisied, and placed among the Stars, he was solemnly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon, he had temples and altars erected, holy dayes dedicated, Priests called <hi>Poli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, the driver away of evill: when any thing fell out well, it was though to be so by <hi>Hercules</hi> his meanes; hence arose these proverbs, <hi>Amico Hercule, Dexiro Hercule.</hi> They used to carve or paint him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their dice in the habit of a King, whose cast was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted luckie; hence arose that phrase, <hi>Hercules Basilicus,</hi> for good luck. Rich men gave the tenth of their goods, to <hi>Hercules</hi>; this they called <hi>Polluctum,</hi> and they thought thereby to prosper. They called the richest, and most sumptuous and capacious things by the name of <hi>Hercules</hi>; as, <hi>Herculea coena, Heraclia pocula; balnea Herculana, lecti Herculani, Hercules hospitatur</hi>: By this we see the foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the world, in persecuting, hating, and murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these men, whom afterward they honor, and adore. Thus it sared with the Prophets, Apostles, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; of this Christ accuseth the Scribes and Pharisees, for building the tombes of the Prophets, and garnishing the sepulchres of the righteous, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.19. 19.

                  <p n="4">4. Some by <hi>Juno</hi> understand the Moon, therefore they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her <hi>Lucina</hi>; and painted her with beams about her face, sitting upon lions, holding a scepter in one hand, and a spindle in the other; by which I think may be meant both her light and operations: for the Scepter signifieth domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and she bears rule over the humid bodies; hence shee is called <hi>Fluona</hi>: the spindle which properly belongs to one of the <hi>Parcae</hi> or Fates, may shew us, that the Moon hath a great influence upon our lives: and her sitting upon lions may signifie, that her moist influence doth temper and moderate the fiery and cholerick heat of our bodies. And
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99553:76"/>
because the moisture of the Moon is a great help to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate child-bearing, therefore shee was called <hi>Juno Lucina,</hi> as the goddesse that did help to bring forth children to the light, and for this cause shee was called upon by women in their labour: <hi>Juno Lucina fer opem.</hi> 5. I think <hi>Juno</hi> may be the embleme of an honest, carefull, and frugall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron; for shee is commonly painted sitting, to shew, that a woman must not be given to gadding shee hath a scepter and a pair of sheers in her hands, for shee must both rule her family by her authoritie and discretion, and shee must clothe and feed them, which is intimated by the platter in her hand, and sheers with which shee shears her sheep: she is clothed with a goats skin, to signifie her frugalitie, which is a rare thing to finde in the women of this age, whose excesse in apparell are badges of their pride and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury: shee is crowned and girded with vine branches, to shew her fruitfulnesse; to which <hi>David</hi> alludes, when hee saith, <hi>Thy wife shall be like the fruitfull vine upon the walls of thine house:</hi> shee treads upon a lionesse, as all honest and laborious matrons should do; to wit, subdue lust and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse: shee is armed with a lance and a target; for a matron should have a sharp tongue to reprove, and the tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of modestie to keep off all lascivious assaults and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. 6. By <hi>Juno</hi> may be meant the air, which that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture sheweth, wherein she holds thunder in the one hand, and a drum or cymball in the other: shee wears a party<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured garment, and is attended by <hi>Iris</hi> the rain-bow, by <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> also, which are two fair meteors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saging serenitie: the fourteen Nymphs which <hi>Virgil</hi> gives her, are so many exhalations begot in the air: her holding of a pomegranite in one hand, and a cuckow upon her scepter in the other, shews the serenitie of the air in which the cuckow, that sings onely in the spring, takes delight; and the fruits doe prosper in a temperate air: That the rain-bow is ingendred in the air by the reflex of the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams upon a waterish cloud, is manifest; the diversitie of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99553:76"/>
whose colours is caused by the light shining upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall parts of the cloud, some being thicker, some thinner, which the Poet shews in that verse,

and whereas the learned Poet makes <hi>Juno</hi> petitioning <hi>Aeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> to send out the winds against <hi>Aenaeas</hi>; hee shews, that the wind is something else then the bare moving of the air, and that it is an exhalation raised out of the earth and waters, without which the air could not be so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently moved. 7. <hi>Juno</hi> was the goddesse of marriage, therefore called <hi>Pronuba,</hi> and <hi>jugalis</hi> from <hi>jugum,</hi> or the yoke that was put over the new married couple. There was at Rome an altar dedicated to <hi>Juno juga,</hi> in the street called <hi>Jugarius,</hi> because at this altar they were joyned, and here their feet were fettered; whence the Poet calls marriage <hi>Vinela jugalia</hi>: but because they thought her power not sufficient, they joyned an help to her, whom they called <hi>Hymen,</hi> and the god of marriage; in one hand hee bare a torch, in the other a red vail called <hi>flammeum,</hi> with which the bride was covered to hide her blushing: these two might signifie the two properties that ought to be in women; to wit, fervent love represented by the torch, and modestie shadowed out in the vail: and it is observable, that when the parties who were to be married offered sacrifice to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> they flung away the gall behind the altar, to shew that in marriage there ought to be no gall or bitternesse. 8. I finde that <hi>Juno</hi> had her education from the hours, and was nourished by the Ocean and <hi>Thetis,</hi> or as some say, the sea-Nymphs; to shew, that Navigation, and Time or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity beget riches; or that the airy exhalations are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got of, and nourished by moisture. 9. As <hi>Juno</hi> signifieth

the air, <hi>Vnlcan</hi> was her son; because the fire is begot of air oftentimes: But as <hi>Juno</hi> signifieth wealth, <hi>Mars</hi> was her son; for wealth begets quarrels, pride, and warres: But as <hi>Juno</hi> was the goddesse of marriage, <hi>Hebe</hi> was her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; because in our you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Some call her the daughter of the Sun, because perhaps shee hath her light from him. 2. The Poets give her a partie-coloured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garment,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99553:83"/>
to shew her various aspects; and doe sacrifice black bull to her, to shew how black and horned shee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears after the change. But to declare her brightnesse in the full, they gave her a coach drawn with white horses: and whereas they ascribed four horses to the Sun, but only two to the Moon; by this they intimated, that the Suns motion is far swifter then the Moons, in respect the or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They held her to be both male and female, because of her active quality of heat, and the passive qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of moisture: therefore men did sacrifice to her in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens apparell, and women in the habit of men. Her masculine power is seen in moving the inferiour bodies: her feminine in receiving light. 4. <hi>Luna</hi> is the same with <hi>Lucina,</hi> because by her light and influence <hi>shee</hi> helpeth child-birth: shee is painted with a torch in one hand, and arrows in the other, to shew the servent and sharp pains of women in child-birth; and that shee is the light and torch of the night: shee is painted sometimes with wings, to shew the swiftnesse of her motion; and sometimes all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a vail, I think, to intimate her eclipses and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritie in the conjunction. The Egyptians in their hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphicks represented the Moon by a white skinned man having an hawks head, to signifie, that the Moons white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or light proceeded not from her self, but from the Sun, of which the hawk was the embleme, and dedicated to the Sun, either because of her high flying, or quick sight. 5. The Romans used to wear half-moons upon their shoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And perhaps from the Romans the Turks have borrowed the same custome of wearing half-moons in their colours. 6. The Moon in her eclipse looketh red, and the foolish Gentiles thought that it was for shame she looked thus, as

blushing at the madnesse of the witches, who thought by charms to bring her down from heaven, according to that,

Indeed, if the Moon could blush, shee would be much ashamed at such madnesse, as also at many other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties committed in the night-time: but the true cause of her rednesse is the mixture of her own light with the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the earth; or rather, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith, (<hi>Exer.</hi> 62.) because she is in the point of the pyramide not far from the first beams of the Sun; and situated in the second beams, which are the species of the first beams, as the first are the species of the light.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. MArs was called the god of warr, he was the first that found out military discipline; he was borne of <hi>Juno,</hi> because wealth begets strise and warrs; <hi>Thero</hi> or fiernesse was his nurse; for fierce and salvage dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are most given to quarrelling: therefore he was said to be bred in the cold Northern countries, for the Northen people by reason of abundance of blood, and excessive drinking, are most given to strike and contention. He was worshppied in Lemnos, where men were sacrificed to him, to shew the crueltie of souldiers, and of that place in particular: his companions were fear, and anger, and clamor; for these do inseparably accompany war. Therefore terror and feare were the two horses that drew his chariot, and <hi>Bellona</hi> his sister with a bloodie whip did still wait upon
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99553:85"/>
him: for this cause the woolfe, of all creatures most savage, and the ravenous vulture, and the watchfull dog, and the chattering pye, and the cock also, which is a warlike and quarrelsome bird, were all dedicated to him. The Scythians dedicated onely to <hi>Mars</hi> temples, altars, and statues, and to no other gods, because they delighted in wars, and by rapine, spoils, and oppression of their neighbours, they maintained their own estate; hence <hi>Mars</hi> was said to be born in Thracia, to shew what a warlike nation that was: and because the horse is a warlike creature, therefore hee was sacrificed to <hi>Mars</hi>; and his chariot was drawn by horses in ancient pictures, hee himself sitting on high in his compleat and terrible arms, both offensive and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive: <hi>Fame</hi> having her body and wings full of eyes, ears, and tongues, sounds the trumpet before him, to shew that warres oftentimes follow upon evill reports. And because the Romans would intimate how much they detested ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill warres in their Citie, they would not suffer the picture of <hi>Mars</hi> to be painted on their gates and private doores, but in stead of him the picture of <hi>Minerva</hi>; and for <hi>Mars</hi> his picture, they thrust out of the Citie, to be painted upon the doors of countrey mens houses abroad: for by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining warres abroad, they kept peace at home. 2. By <hi>Mars</hi> the Gentiles understood the Sun, as appears by that picture of <hi>Mars</hi> adorned with the Sun beams, and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently worshipped in Spain: or rather the heat and vigour of the Sun, which heateth the blood, and occasioneth strife and warre, as may bee seen in cholerick and hot constitutions: and because such hot temperaments are prone to Venerie, hence the Poets saigned, that <hi>Mars</hi> lay with <hi>Venus</hi>; and withall to shew, how much souldiers are given to Venereall lusts:
<q>At non ad Venerein nocturnaque praeliae tardi.</q>

                  <p n="3">3. Not without cause doe the Fathers laugh at the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, who made <hi>Mars</hi> their god, that was both a murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as also unjust, impious, mad, and persidious, as <hi>Homer</hi>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:99553:85"/>
describes him; who was detained a prisoner by <hi>Vulcan</hi> for his adultery, and was wounded by <hi>Diomedes.</hi> This is that god from whom the Romans bragged they had their originall, whom they made the patron of their Citie, and dedicated the first moneth of the yeer to him, assigned to him certain priests whom they called <hi>Salii,</hi> and many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honours: I wish that Christians, who professe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the disciples of the Prince of peace, did not too much worship this impious god of war: wee erect not temples and altars to him abroad, but wee doe this in our hearts; wee doe not sacrifice to him horses alone, but men also, even those for whom Christ died: so that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lemnos nor Thracia did more adore him, then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians doe. But however the Gentiles worshipped him, yet <hi>Homer</hi> tels us, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> hated him: I am confident that the true God, whose name is <hi>Jehovah Shalom,</hi> the Lord our peace, hates and detests warrs among brethren of the same faith; for hee breaks their bows, knaps their spears in sunder, and burns their chariots in the fire. I wish with S. <hi>Austin,</hi> that it were as certain there were no warre, as it is certain that <hi>Mars</hi> is no god: <hi>Vtinam quam manifestum est quod non sit deus, tam non sit bellum</hi>: Lib. 7. <hi>de Civit.</hi> cap. 14. But so long as pride, ambition, covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and malice reign among us, so long <hi>Mars</hi> must be worshipped by us. 4. <hi>Mars</hi> is described by the Poets as a great enemie to <hi>Minerva</hi> the goddesse of wisdome and arts; wee see by experience how true this is; for wisdome, arts, learning, justice, and true pietie are trampled upon in time of warre. 5. <hi>Mars,</hi> who by <hi>Homer</hi> is described the swiftest of all the gods, was caught in a net by limping <hi>Vulcan,</hi> the slowest of them all; <hi>Tardus velocem assequteur</hi>: let men run never so swiftly in wayes of wickednesse, yet slow-paced vengeance at last will overtake them: <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro antecederuem s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

wickednesse done so secretly, which is not made obvious to the all-piercing eye of the Almighty. <hi>There is nothing so secret that shall not be revealed,</hi> saith Christ. 7. <hi>Mars</hi> was absolved from the murther which hee committed in the Areopage, a place where the Athenian Magistrates used to judge; to let us see that the smallest homicides are punished in time of peace, whereas the greatest and most horrible murthers goe free in time of warre: As <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> complained of theft, so may I of murther; <hi>Parva furia puniuniur, magna in triumphis aguniur</hi>: small murthers are punished, great ones are honoured with triumphs. 8. <hi>Mars</hi> was conceived of <hi>Juno</hi> by touching a flower: what is more specious to the eye, and yet what more frivolous then a flower? By this wee may see, that rich and potent men have specious pretences for their warrs; but when they are sifted, they prove no lesse frivolous then a fading flower. 9. <hi>Vulcan</hi> bound <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> together, but <hi>Neptune</hi> got them to be loosed; I think they meant by this, that lust is caused by the heat of youth; but given off in old age, which is cold and moist, represented by <hi>Neptune.</hi>

Or this fiction may shew, that they who are born when <hi>Mercurie</hi> bears rule in their Horoscope, are ingenuous, and eloquent, and nimble also both in their wits and fingers; for hee was a notable thiefs, who stole from <hi>Admeius</hi> his oxen, from <hi>Apollo</hi> his arrows, from <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> his tongs, from <hi>Venus</hi> her girdle, from <hi>Neptune</hi> his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and would have stole <hi>Jupiters</hi> thunder too, if hee had dared. 2. Hee was the finder out of the harp or lute, hee taught the Egyptians all arts and sciences, hee taught men to leave their rudenesse, and become civill and religious: therefore they make him still to be waiting upon the gods, especially upon <hi>Jupiter</hi>; I think, to let us see, that learned and wise men should be entertained in Princes Courts, and such as are eloquent and ingenuous. 3. They write, that hee sucked the brests of <hi>Juno</hi>; to shew us, as I suppose, that <hi>Juno,</hi> that is, rich and potent Princes ought to be the nursing fathers, and nursing mothers of learned and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent men. 4. They used to paint <hi>Mercuries</hi> picture on their doors, that hee being the god of theeves, might keep off other theeves from their houses: a goodly religion, that punisheth men for theeving, and yet adore him for their god, who was the author and patron of theeves and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99553:87"/>
theeving. 5. They called him the son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to shew, that eloquence, sciences, and ingenuous arts are the gifts of God. 6. They made him winged both in his head and feet, to shew the swiftnesse and various motions of the planet <hi>Mercurie,</hi> and the nimblenesse of their wits, tongues, and fingers who are born under that star; as also the nimble force and power of eloquence in moving mens affections. 7. Hee killed (by <hi>Jupiters</hi> command) many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed <hi>Argus</hi>; to shew, as I conceive, that Princes by the tongues of eloquent Oratours are able to tame and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the many-eyed multitude, which are sooner brought in subjection by tongues, then by swords; therefore the tongue was consecrated and offered in sacrifices to <hi>Mercury:</hi>

For this cause they gave power to <hi>Mercurie</hi> to appease storms and tempests: for as <hi>Neptune</hi> seeleth the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous seas; so doth <hi>Mercurie</hi> or eloquence pacifie a stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and tempestuous State. 8. I finde that sometimes <hi>Mercurie</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> were painted together, to shew how needfull the tongue and hand are to beget wisdome, the one by speaking, the other by writing; and that all Common-wealths stand in need of eloquent men, and ski<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I finde, that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi> is painted in some pictures not onely with winged head and feet, but also with a purse in his hand; to shew, that hee is the god of gaine, which is not got but by diligence, expedition, and wit: hence hee is painted with a goat and a cock by him, to shew that as vigilancie, whereof the cock is the embleme, is required in a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and in him that will be rich; so likewise must hee venture, and overcome all difficulties, as the goat that chambers up the highest rocks. Or is it be true that the goat breathes not with his nose, but with his ears; then by this may be meant, that from the mouthes of Oratours the mindes of the rude multitude are fed, and live by the ears; and to shew that vigilancie and fagacitie are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in those that will be rich, eloquent, and learned: <hi>Mercurie</hi> was worshipped in Egypt under the shape of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubin,</hi> with a dogs head. 11. <hi>Mercurie</hi> may signifie the Sun, for his wings may represent the Suns velocitie; his killing of <hi>Argus</hi> may shew, that the Suns appearance puts out the light of the Starres to us, which seem to be as so many eyes of heaven. The Sun seems to look upon us with a threefold aspect, pale, red, and blew; the first presages rain, the second windes, the third sereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; therefore it was perhaps, that they painted <hi>Mercurie</hi> with three heads upon a square stone, to signifie the four parts of the world, or the four seasons of the yeer. And to shew that the Sun never grows old, or decayes in strength, they painted <hi>Mercurie</hi> alwayes young, beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and cheerfull: and perhaps that picture of <hi>Mercurie</hi> like a youth carrying of a ram, may signifie that the Sun

seems to grow young, and makes the world look youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, when hee enters into the signe of the Ram in the Zodiack. 12. Because hee was held the god of speech, therefore they made him also the god of bargains and sales; hence hee was called 'A <gap reason="foreign">

Or else this may shew, that ignorance signified by the night, and wealth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the Ocean, which enricheth the neighbouring lands, are the causes of wickednesse, and this the occasion of Gods just vengeance. 3. <hi>Nemesis</hi> is called the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Justice, because God punisheth none but when hee is justly provoked thereunto. Hence some have thought <hi>Nemesis</hi> and Justice to be the same; which they paint like a virgin of a truculent aspect, quick-sighted, sad, holding the ballance in the one hand, and a whip or rods, with a hatchet in the other, to shew that Justice must not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, but pure from bribes and by-respects, terrible to the wicked, quick-sighted in finding out the hidden truth, of a sad aspect, for justice or vengeance doth not punish with delight: the rods and hatchet shew the diversities of punishments according to the diversitie of sins: and sometimes she is painted naked, sitting on a square stone, because Justice must be open, not hid, square and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, not moveable and unconstant. 4. <hi>Nemesis</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times described to us with wings, and a crowne on her head, standing upon a wheele, with a cup in her hand on which are engraven the Ethiopians: The wings show the celeritie and swiftnesse of Vengeance pursuing after wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men; the crown signifieth the command and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Gods justice in the world, on which were carried Stags, and small pictures of Victorie with palms, to shew that Justice or Revenge keep men in awe, and make them fearfull, and that the same Justice is a Conquerour or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor over the world; the cup with the Ethiopians shew that Vengeance can overtake a sinner, though hee run to the remotest parts of Ethiopia; the wheele signifieth the world, which is subjected to the feete of Justice. 5. By <hi>Nemesis</hi> the Sun may be meant; therefore the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians placed her above the Moon, by which is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

As by the Suns heat and light the earth is beautified and made fruitfull; so it is by Justice that States and Kingdomes flourish and prosper. 6. <gap reason="foreign">

The Gods are said to be feasted by <hi>Oceanus,</hi> either to confirm that opinion of some, that the stars are fed by the vapours that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise out of the sea, and are converted into clouds; for the stars being of a fiery nature, are tempered by these moist va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, as they think; this was the Stoicks opinion, which is resuted by the Aristotelians, and is touched by <hi>Virgil</hi> Aen. 1.

Truth was never changed into so many shapes as now, for every fond opinion is taken up and maintained for truth: but the more opinions prevail, the more should wise men lay hold on truth, and hold her fast, till she return to her owne shape. 11. <hi>Tethys</hi> was the wife of <hi>Oceanus,</hi> perhaps they menet by <hi>Tethys</hi> the Mediterraen Sea and other bayes, which were so united to the Ocean, as man and wife; by which union the Mediterrane abounds with Fishes, and so do the other bayes or armes of the Sea. 12. <hi>Thetis</hi> was also the Sea, and married to <hi>Peleus,</hi> because perhaps he was much addicted to Navigation: In their marriage all the gods were present except the goddesse Discord: it were happy if she were absent from all other marriages. 13. <hi>Glaucus</hi> was a Fisherman, who in winter had a way to catch Fish, which others had not; he was also an excellent swimmer and diver under water: being at last drowned or devoured by some great fish, he was by superstitious people held for a Sea-god; from such weak and foolish beginnings hath ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry received its increase: so <hi>Phorcus</hi> king of <hi>Sardinia</hi> being drowned by <hi>Atlas</hi> in a Naval fight, was by his people made a Sea-god; in like manner <hi>Ino</hi> who was called also <hi>Leucothea,</hi> and <hi>Matuta,</hi> being both drowned, were made Sea-Gods;

As on <hi>Vesta</hi>'s altar burned two lamps, which if they went out were not to be kindled again by any earthly fire, but by the celestiall heat of the Sun; even so there should burne and shine on the altars of our hearts the two lamps of love, to wit, the love of God, and of our neighbour; which being extinguished, cannot be kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled againe but by the celestiall fire of Gods Spirit, which descended upon the Apostles in sirie tongues. 4.

Upon the top of <hi>Vesta</hi>'s Temple stood the image of <hi>Vesta</hi> holding little <hi>Jupiter</hi> in her armes, because it was said that shee fed <hi>Jupiter</hi> in his infancie; it is the earth indeed that feeds us all, both rich and poor, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and beggars. 6. When all the other gods move abroad in their chariots, onely <hi>Vesta</hi> is said to stay at home, or to remaine unmoveable in <hi>Jupiters</hi> house; by this they meant, that of all the simple bodies, the earth onely remaines unmoveable in the midst of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters</hi> house, that is, in the air, which doth encompasse her round about. 7. <hi>Vesta</hi> taught men at first to build houses; therefore shee was held the chiefe of the houshold-gods: and it may be shee taught them to wear clothes also, therefore shee is called <hi>Vesta a vestiendo:</hi> or because shee is the earth, shee may be so called, in that the earth is clothed with grasse, flowers, plants and trees: and indeed shee is our mother that feeds us, therefore called <hi>Pales</hi> the goddesse of fodder; and shee clothes us also, hence shee is called <gap reason="foreign">

It was a wise act in him to thrust out the eye of the drunken giant <hi>Polyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and by this means to free himselfe and his fellows under the sheeps bellies from being devoured by him in his cave: If wee be wise, and clothe our selves with innocencie, wee shall escape any danger, especially if with wisdome and innocencie wee joyne sobrietie; for sober <hi>Vlysses,</hi> though weak, mastered the drunken giant <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> though incredibly strong. 7.

As hee shewed his courage in going down to hell, so his wisdome was seen in returning thence: Afflictions and crosses is the hell through which Gods children must passe; therefore wee had need of Christian magnanimitie and wisdome, that we may overcome the many difficulties thereof. 9. Hee shewed the part of a wise man in stopping the ears of his fellows that they might not hear the inchanting songs of the <hi>Sirens</hi>; and caused himselfe to be bound fast to the mast, that hee might not have power to goe to them: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very wise Christian should stop his ears from hearing the entising songs of sinfull pleasures, and should bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the cords of reason, that hee may not be drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the sea of shame and confusion. 10. Hee did wisely in sailing between <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi> to keep the middle way, for so hee escaped the danger of both: It were happy if wee had this point of wisdome, not to come too neer the rock of presumption on the right hand, nor of desperation on the left. 11.

But in this life is no perfection; wise <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysses</hi> committed some acts of folly; as when he falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused <hi>Palimedes,</hi> and sacrilegiously robbed the temple of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and carelesly suffered his men to look into the bag where the winds were bound up by <hi>Aeolus,</hi> and to kill the cattell of <hi>Sol,</hi> which caused both his long navigation and shipwrack, in which hee lost all his fellows.
