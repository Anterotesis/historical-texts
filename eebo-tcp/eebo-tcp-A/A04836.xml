            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

offred a literal violence, setting our mouths
against Heauen, like Cannons planted for
Battery, to discharge nothing but Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
against the <hi>Lord of Heauen and Earth,</hi>
from whence we purchase a lucklesse vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,

the Seales of Gods loue to Mankind
are affixed. Seales so authenticke, that they
need no hand to signe the Instrument. This
word like a loud Herauld proclaimes the

Deliuerance.</hi> Tis Gods fashion (saith Saint
<hi>Ambrose) Non respondere nomen sed negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>

<hi>He shall,</hi> or <hi>he will deliuer.</hi> From which I
only note vnto you, that Gods fauours are
not circumscribed within the limits of any

all Places at all Times, and in euery Tense,
wherein the Grammar can forme, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8464:7"/>
inuoke it. Wee must not so interpret
the word, as if his <hi>Deliuerance</hi> lay yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Promise, not wrought, nor performed
amongst vs; as if it were only future, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
but not come, <hi>He shall deliuer:</hi> nor yet
<hi>Liberauit, He hath deliuered,</hi> take it as a past
act now out of Date, which he hath once
done, but wil no more. Though his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
stand as single Presidents, recorded
to haue bin once done, but disauowed for
euer being done againe, as doth the Deluge
after which God is said to repent Him, and
then contracts with Man neuer to destroy
him againe by water; yet his Mercies are
Leading cases, which God is well content
we should still vrge: They are Patternes
by which <hi>Hee</hi> is often pleased to worke.
Like fruitfull Copies that multiply
by Imitation, they disperse themselues
through all successiue generations of
Time. And though men allow it not,
God giues vs leaue to draw his fauours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Example, emboldning vs to prescribe
vpon his goodnesse; bidding vs bee assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that if <hi>He</hi> did formerly bestow his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings

<hi>God</hi> of Succession, as well as of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers;
vnto whom if his hand of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
were liberally extended, it is not closed
to vs. His mercy is not shortned, nor the
<hi>Arme of his Deliuerance</hi> reseruedly <hi>shut vp

Deliuerance in all Sexes, wrought by the

For Egypt was figuratiuely the Captiuitie

so sweetens the bitternes of
<hi>Death,</hi> that enamoured on the Ioyes it

this thought shall abate the horrour
