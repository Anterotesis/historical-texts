         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A common Lyar who will believe, and a continual Thief who will truſt; but poor <hi>England</hi> hath been plagued with both in their Governouts; who have broken all Oaths, Covenants and Acts of Parliament; and contrary to the truſt repoſed in them by the Good People of the Land, Tyrannically wrought into their own hands other mens Eſtates and Lands; Yea, ſuch Lands, as they pretended ſhould be for the vſe and benefit of the Publick, have they converted to their own private coveteous ends. Oh! how <hi>England</hi> groaneth under the burthen of Treaſon, Rebellion and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ! How is the Countrey charged, and Trading decayed, by ſuch treacherous, Rebellious cruel Governours, who who changes Government as they pleaſe, and forces the good people of the Land to obey them; Drawing out Armys from one place to another, marching up and down the Land for the accompliſhing of their own ends, their Honours and Opinions, to the utter undoing of many thouſands for want of Trading, in City and Country. The cunning Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer has no work, the Shop-keeper languiſheth, all Arts and Sciences is decayed. We may ſay, that ſince the breath of our Noſtrels has been gone the Marriner mourneth, the Marchant languiſheth; the Marriner for his practiſe, the Marchant for his goods, and the Owner for his Ships. Miſery and Callamity hath beſet us, and will ſwallow us up, without ſcme remedy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, How many have enriched themſelves by the ruines of Noble perſons, and the ſele of the late Kings Lands: ſuch Members of the ſtump are known better then they ought to be truſted; but how to have theſe Lands again from ſuch perſons, for the Common-wealth, a <hi>King,</hi> or ſingle perſon is not difficult, if Law and Juſtice might be put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution againſt the Committee of Safety, for their opreſſion, Treaſon, and Rebellion. Firſt, for comming in a Hoſtile manner with Horſe and Foot, upon what pretence ſoever, to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> not to demand 5 Members, but to bringforth, and to diſſolve that which they themſelves did bring together, and did acknowledge to be a Lawful Parliament, and received Commiſſions from them, and drew out an Army againſt <hi>Sir George Booth</hi> to maintain them ſo to be, to the loſs of blood and lin bs, and the great impoveriſhing of the good people of this Nation; for leſſe guilt of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Murther and Rebellion, then might be found in our Governours.</p>
            <p>KING <hi>CHARLES</hi> had 3 Kingdoms rent from him, and his Life alſo, and with him the Lands and Lives of moſt honourable perſons, whoſe Lives are much lamented for by the poor of this Nation, for their wonted charity, to cloath their backs, and feed the bellies of the poor, who is ſo much oppreſſed by <hi>Englands</hi> Tyrannical Governours; For theſe things our hearts are faint, and for theſe things our eys are dim; But ſhall <hi>England</hi> die to preſerve ſuch Tyrants to live, to deceive and deſtroy the good People of this poor Nation, to make their own Intereſt ? Woe unto us, men hath ſhed and loſt their blood upon ſuch mould which hath brought forth Weeds, to poyſon and famiſh them rather then fruits to feed them. Our Governours hath often pretended themſelves to be men fearing God, and of tender Conſciences : and therefore did alow Liberty of Conſcience, And we find alſo, that they have taken to themſelves Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty enough, and have made their Conſciences wide enough to ſwallow up the poor of this Nation, ſaving only ſuch which are guided by the fame Spirit; which Spirit hath declared it ſelf by the fruits thereof, which hath been to make uſe of the Lives and blood of men, to accompliſh their own covetious ends; and that which adds to our miſery, is that from men we can expect no Reformation, Hippacrites are ſo mixt together in this Nation. If we have a Free choyce in this Nation for a Free Parliament, though we know that to be moſt Legall, and the eys of the whole Nation is upon it, and does deſire it for to be inſtrumental for to bring in Commerce and trading in the Nations, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move burthens and opreſſions, and to take off that Iron Rod off our Backs; but we never had, and we fear never ſhall have, ſuch free and full trading as <hi>England</hi> had, when all Chriſtian Princes ſent Embaſſadours to a Single perſon, which was a power to Treat with. But for our changes, neither <hi>Prince</hi> nor Peaſant can have faſt hold with them, who hath been the ruine of poor diſtreſſed and diſtracted <hi>England</hi>; yet, although we can put no more confidence in man, yet in the Mercy of God, we have hope, that He which for our ſins hath thrown us down, in his due time will raiſe us up; and that he who hath ſo wounded us, will heal us with that plaiſter that ſhall heal us. <hi>Se be it.</hi>
