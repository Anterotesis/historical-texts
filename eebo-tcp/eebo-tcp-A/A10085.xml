            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight honorable, and worthily renowmed Lords, such is the mutabilitye of times vnconstant motion: as that things wel done cannot challenge, to themselues, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of their euent, nor without suspect of euill (misconstrued inputation) build their hope. And when the wel meaning actions of mighty men cannot (in perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent stability) stand cleared from the after-rays'd-vp misty Meteors which may encomber them: what then shoulde I expect (being no other then pouerty it selfe) but that this work, by me aduentured should with my self dangerously run vpon vncertaine hopes? although the vprightnes of my conscience vowes, I haue not herunto bin lead by any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inuectiue spleen or turbulent affection: only a priuate consideration made me thinke, that it might now be a time in which the praise of honours worthines might haue his place, and not any longer by a violent imposition be taxed with vndeserued euill. It were inhumane tyranny, to forbid the vertues of the dead to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended: and no lesse cruelty to charge the deceased with vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted offences.

For plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus his affirmation sayth: that it is no part of a wise man thence to drawe credit to himselfe, from whence proceedeth discredit to his friend.

            <p>When honor and vnstaind nobility, by ill aduise and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate thoughts, vntimely falls into some daungerous accident: then though the lawe, in robes of iustice armd, with quick pursuite doth follow euils amisse: yet should no minde on such dependance dwell: as if his wisht<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for time of triumph were imbrac't, when he might glory in honored vertues fall: and like a lumpe of proude degenerate brasen insolence, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the gall of enuie, hate, and malice steept, scornefully impugne the honor of a Lands renowmed noblenesse. God, with my soule, an vncontrowled witnes beare: I not desire to speake against the iustice of the lawe, nor any honorable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate in place of Councel or of gouernment: only my words may neerly glance at such whose proud demeanour, &amp; insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

And now, my honorable Lords, when I looke back vnto my owne vnworthinesse, my Muse doth sound retrayte, and bids me stay the further occurrence of some other thinges, which wold most willingly be issuing forth. And for this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worke already done by me, with lowe submission I intreate your pardon: and do solemnly protest, that the vnfained loue I beare vnto the late Honorable, and yet still honored Earle of Essex, hath with an ineuitable force caused me to make this briefe description of his life and death. And though I desire to be freed from a Poets name; yet because the musick of a mourning verse doth best consort with sorrowes passion, I haue made choyse thereof, in hope your L L. will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to excuse my vnpolisht, rough, vnsmoothed Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. My greatest studie with religious care hath sought to build my words vpon the ground of truth: &amp; hauing brought my labor to an end, I knew not better vnto whome to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the same, then to your Honors. Not for my sake then, but for his, whose vertues I desire should liue, be pleased to receiue this well meaning worke into your loues protection: and thus, with all submissiue humblenesse, a souldier humbly throwes his liues seruice at your Honors feet.</p>
