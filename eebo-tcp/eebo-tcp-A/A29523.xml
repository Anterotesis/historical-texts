            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>a faithful saying,</hi> worthy to be credited, to be believed. So it was by the <hi>Fathers</hi> under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> who beheld it only a far off in the Promise: though they dyed before they received it, yet they believed it, living in the faith of it, and dying in the faith of it. <hi>These all dyed in the faith, not having received the promise,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. speaking of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> who died in the <hi>faith,</hi> as firmly believing that Promise concerning the <hi>Land of Canaan,</hi> which God had made to them; so that great promise concerning the <hi>Messia,</hi> who was to come into the world: whose day <hi>Abraham</hi> is said to have seen, (as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our tells the Jews) <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 56. In this <hi>faith</hi> they <hi>lived,</hi> and in this <hi>faith</hi> they <hi>dyed.</hi> So fully were they assured of the truth thereof, that they were not afraid to take their death upon it, to <hi>dye in the faith of it.</hi> So certain was this saying to them, who beheld it only in the promise. Whereupon it was, that the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> speaking of this, of Christs coming into the world, he speaks of it, as a thing already done: <hi>To us a Child is born, to us a Son is given,</hi> Isa. 9. 6. How much more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> certain then may it be unto us, who look upon it in the performance, not as a thing to be done, but done. What was promised to them, is made good to us; what they looked and waited for, we have received.

So as the Apostle might well say, what here he doth, <hi>This is a faithful saying,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I shall not spend time in confirmation<note place="margin">Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about with a cloud of witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</note> of this truth, which among Christians were but a needless labour.

To this truth, <hi>gave all the Prophets witness;</hi> so <hi>Peter</hi> tells <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 43. And to this truth gave all the <hi>Apostles</hi> witness. The one testifying that it should be done, the other that it was done. To this truth gave all those <hi>Types</hi> under the Law witness, being all <hi>Shadows</hi> of this <hi>Substance.</hi> To this truth have all the Saints of God in all ages of the world given witness. All that ever were, before the Law, under the Law, under the Gospel: Some, and many of them, sealing it with their blood; all of them, pawning and adventuring their souls, their everlasting happiness upon it. Now if <hi>two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> be sufficient to establish a <hi>word,</hi> (which with men ordinarily they are, as that Text tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 16.) how much more such a <hi>cloud of witnesses?</hi> Never was truth more confirmed then this truth, <hi>The Doctrine of Salvation by Christ, that Iesus Christ came into the world to save sinners.

And what was it that they did hear? why that which their forefathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to hear, but could not. <hi>Many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Righteous men, have desired to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them,</hi> Verse 17.

They indeed heard of his Coming, that he should come; and believing it, they were made happy by it. But the <hi>Disciples,</hi> who saw Christ in the flesh, they heard and saw that he was come. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving what they saw and heard, this made their eyes and ears, blessed and happy. No Doctrine, no Tidings, (as I said) can make

Seeing that Christ was come into the world upon this Errand, how did they rejoyce at it, a whole <hi>Quire,</hi> an <hi>Host</hi> of them, meeting together, and singing that Heavenly <hi>Anthem,</hi> that <hi>Hallelujah</hi> that we have, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Praising God, and saying, Glory be to God in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, on earth peace, good will towards men!</hi> How much more joyous then should these tidings be to the Sons of men, for whose sake, Christ is come into the world? Great cause have they to rejoyce at the hearing of it. So did <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithful, by faith apprehending that Christ should come, <hi>Seeing his day,</hi> (that is, his coming in the flesh) <hi>he rejoyced at it,</hi> (as that Text forecited tells us, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 56.) And the like, ought all Christians, being his Children, to do. Hearing of this blessed day, that he is come, they are to entertain this good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings with spiritual joy, rejoycing at it.</p>
            <p>And as with <hi>joy,</hi> so with <hi>gratitude</hi> and<note place="margin">With <hi>Gratitude</hi>

               <hi>thankfulness.</hi> Thus did <hi>Zacharias</hi> entertain these glad tidings, as we find it in his Song, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 68. Where Prophesying of what he saw to be then nigh at hand, the coming of Christ, and setting forth this great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Salvation by Christ, he breaks forth into that holy and affectionate Gratulation, <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he hath visited and redeemed his people: and hath rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up a Horn of Salvation, (i. e.</hi> a Mighty Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) <hi>for us in the house of his Servant</hi> David, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And with like affection we find the blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> the Mother of our Lord, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining these tidings, <hi>Verse</hi> 46. of that <hi>Chapter,</hi> where she breaks forth into her <hi>Magnificat; My Soul doth Magnify the Lord, and my Spirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour.</hi> Such is the <hi>Acceptation,</hi> that this <hi>saying,</hi> this Doctrine here in the Text, is said to be worthy of.</p>

               <hi>Iesus</hi> (saith the Text). Two Names given to the world's Saviour. The former his Name of Office, <hi>Christ;</hi> which word (as the Hebrew <hi>Messias</hi> also doth) signifieth <hi>Anointed.</hi> So we find him often called, <hi>the Anointed, the Anointed of the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 35.

               <hi>his Father,</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith of him, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 27.) being ordained and appointed by him to a threefold Office, <hi>Sacerdotal, Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Regal;</hi> to be a <hi>Priest,</hi> a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and a <hi>King</hi> to his Church; and indued with a fulness of all Graces and Abilities, for the discharge thereof: Having the Spirit pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon him, <hi>Given unto him not by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> (as that Text hath it) <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 34. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Q.</hi> 2. How he came.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A. For Answer, we may take notice of diverse <hi>comings</hi> of Christ mentioned in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Of which there are three most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, His coming in the <hi>Flesh,</hi> His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Spirit,</hi> His coming in <hi>Glory.</hi> His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Flesh,</hi> to take our nature upon him. <hi>Every Spirit that confesseth, that Iesus Christ is come in the Flesh, is of God,</hi> 1 John 4. 2. His coming in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to dwell in the hearts of his people, to have a sweet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62640:14"/>
with them. <hi>If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in unto him,</hi> Rev. 3. 20. His coming in <hi>Glory. Behold, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with Clowds,</hi> Rev. 1. 7. <hi>Behold, I come quickly,</hi> Rev. 22. 12. I come to Judgment. Now, it is the first of these which we meet with here in the Text; The coming of Christ in the <hi>Flesh,</hi> his taking the nature of Man upon him, that, in that nature, he might execute the Office, and do the work, of a Mediator. Thus he came.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. But <hi>from whence</hi> came he?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 3. From whence he came.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A. That is the third enquiry, which we find not expresly resolved in the Text, but implyed. So it is, in every <hi>Motion,</hi> and every <hi>Mutation;</hi> there are two terms, the <hi>terminus a quo et ad quem,</hi> In a journy, a man cometh from one place to another: In a change of condition, a man passeth from one state to another. So was it here, Christ in his Incarnation, <hi>he came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> So that Antient Creed tells us. And it is no other then what Christ himself tells his Disciples, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 27. <hi>I am come forth from the Father.</hi> So he did according to his <hi>Divinity,</hi> as the <hi>Son of God,</hi> which yet, is warily to be understood. Not that he thus came from Heaven, by any locall mutation, any <hi>change of place;</hi> for as <hi>God,</hi> he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in essence, filling all places in Heaven, and Earth, (as the Lord himself tells us, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 24.) and so could not properly be said
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62640:15"/>
to leave the one, or come to the other. But onely by a <hi>change of state.</hi> So it was, that for a time, he divested and disrobed himself (as it were) of that Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, which he had with his Father, before the world was, (of which he speaketh, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 5.) putting on the nature of man, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into a personal Union with <hi>his</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, <hi>being manifested in the flesh,</hi> (as the Apostle expresseth it) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>last.</hi> Thus he came down from Heaven, <hi>humbling Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, taking upon him, the form of a Servant, and being in likeness of man,</hi> (as we have it) <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. Thus, as to his Divinity, he may be said to have come from Heaven. <hi>The second man, is the Lord from Heaven,</hi> (saith the Apostle, speaking of Christ, who in regard of his Godhead, was of a Celestial Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47. But in respect of his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,</hi> as <hi>Man,</hi> he may be said to have come from the <hi>womb</hi> of his Mother. There did he lodg for a time, the wonted time according to the course of nature; which being expired, he came forth, as the rest of the Sons of men do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 4. And <hi>whither</hi> did he come?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 4. Whither he came.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A. That is the last Particular; which the Text resolves, <hi>He came into the world. I am come forth from the Father, and am come into the world,</hi> (saith the Text forecited) <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 28. that is, into this inferiour world: where, for a time, as <hi>man,</hi> yea, as <hi>God-man</hi> he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62640:15"/>
and conversed with the Sons of men, dwelling with them. <hi>The word was made flesh, and dwelt amongst us,</hi> John 1. 14. Thus you see his <hi>Iourny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As briefly of his <hi>Errand.</hi> Where we shall<note place="margin">2. Christs Errand.</note> take notice of those two things; For <hi>what</hi> he came, and for <hi>whom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. For <hi>what</hi> it was that he came; which<note place="margin">For what he came: to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</note> was, that he might be a Saviour of the world, <hi>He came into the world to save it.</hi> This was the proper end of his first coming. To this end did God his <hi>Father</hi> send him. <hi>We have seen, and do testify, that the Father sent the Son, to be the Saviour of the world,</hi> 1 John 4. 14. And to this end, He himself came, making this his Design. <hi>The Son of man is come, to save that which was lost,</hi> (saith He of himself) <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 11. Not to <hi>Iudge</hi> and <hi>Condemn</hi> the world. This was neither his <hi>Fathers</hi> design, nor <hi>His:</hi> Not his <hi>Fathers, God sent not his Son to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved,</hi> John 3. 17. Not His, <hi>I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</hi> This indeed, shall be the end of his Second <hi>coming,</hi> to judg the whole world, and to condemn a great part of it; but the end of his first <hi>coming,</hi> was to save it. This was the thing, which he properly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly intended. True it is, he was, and is an <hi>occasion</hi> of the falling and perishing of some. So old <hi>Simeon</hi> tells <hi>Mary,</hi> Luke 2. 34. <hi>Behold, this Child is set for the fall and rising</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62640:16"/>
               <hi>again, of many in Israel.</hi> And the like the Apostle St. <hi>Peter,</hi> (taking it from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isay</hi>) saith of him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8. where speaking of <hi>Christ,</hi> he calleth him, <hi>A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence.</hi> But this is onely by <hi>accident,</hi> through the unbelief, and disobedience of those that will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Him, (as he there giveth the reason of it).

So he was by those whom he looked upon as his own people: <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not,</hi> Joh. 1. 11. The people of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who were God's own peculiar people, whom he had chosen out of all Nations of the World, (<hi>You onely have I known</hi>); yet so ungrateful were they, that when this Son of God, being sent by his Father upon such an Errand, came to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his service unto them, they would not receive him, they would not acknowledge him to be the <hi>Messias.</hi> Thus was this <hi>living Stone</hi> (the Foundation-Stone) <hi>though chosen of God and precious, yet disallowed of men,</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4.) <hi>He was despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grief; and we hid, as it were, our faces from him, he was despised, and we esteemed him</hi>

Thus was he sleighted through the whole course of his life. And in the end of it how-abused? Crowned with Thorns, Buffeted, Spit upon, and after Crucified; suffering that painful, shameful, accursed Death of the Cross. Now, all this he foresaw before he came into the world, as he foretold it when he was come into it.

All the comfort that I can from hence give unto them, is only this, that there is a possibility of Salvation for them. Herein are they one degree more happy, or rather less miserable, than the Devills and damned Spirits, which being cast into the Prison of Hell, are there fast bound in those <hi>everlasting chains of Darkness, reserved to the judgement of the Great day,</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Iude,</hi> set forth the condition of the fallen Angels, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Iude</hi> v. 6.) in a desperate conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on past praying for, shut out from all hope, all possibility of Salvation. So is it not as yet with you, you obstinate sinners. How soon it may be so, that you know not; going on in your sinful wayes and courses, you may be surprized and snatcht away by Death, (as many daily are) and that will cut off the thread of your hope, putting you into the like condition, beyond all possibility of Mercy. But as yet, I shall not wholly shut the door of hope against you. Some hope as yet you have, though not so long as you continue such. Living and dying without Repentance there is no hope for you.

               <hi>Doctrine</hi> concerning his Coming into the world, by troubling our selves or others with needless and useless Questions, over-eagerly contending about, what cannot certainly be determined. Of these, let me take notice of two or three.</p>
            <p>1. Such is that Controversie concerning the <hi>time of his coming:</hi> When it was that he came into the world, that he was Born, upon what <hi>day,</hi> or in what <hi>week,</hi> or in what <hi>month;</hi> which, though it hath been by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heads, with all possible Industry, search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into, and by some over-eagerly debated; yet can it not be certainly determined.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62640:25"/>
God hath thought fitting to be concealed from us (upon what account, I will not say:) And therefore, Be we not overcurious in our enquiries after it. Let it be enough for us (which we are sure of) that a time there was; a time precisely set down, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his Coming; and <hi>when that fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son</hi> (as the Apostle tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4.) This is <gap reason="foreign">

So as there is none other Name under Heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved, (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells the <hi>Iews, Acts</hi> 4. 12.); no other way or means appointed by God for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

               <p>More genuinely. <hi>Paul</hi> saith here of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that he was the <hi>first</hi> of sinners; <hi>Primus non tempore, sed magnitudine,</hi> (so the Author aforesaid, and diverse others, after <hi>Augustine,</hi> rightly resolve it:) the first not in <hi>time,</hi> not<note place="margin">* <hi>Quid ergo est</hi> primus? <hi>antecedens omnes, non tempore, sed magnitudine</hi> August. <hi>in</hi> Psalm. 70.</note>

                     <hi>Q. Paul</hi> was now an eminent Saint.</note> How could <hi>Paul</hi> say and think thus of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that he was the <hi>chief</hi> of Sinners? When he spake this, he was a <hi>Iustified</hi> person, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his sins pardoned, and forgiven him; and this he was assured of.

               </p>
               <p>To this it is Answered; <hi>Paul</hi> here speaks<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A.</hi> He speaks of what he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> not of what he now was, but of what he had been: Not of what he now was by <hi>Grace,</hi> but what by <hi>Nature,</hi> and what by <hi>Practise,</hi> before such time as the Grace of God met with him. True it was, there was now a great and wonderful change wrought in him; he was not now the same man that sometime he was. <hi>Now I live,</hi> (saith he) <hi>yet no more I, Gal.</hi> 2. 20. No longer that <hi>Saul</hi> which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore he was, but much changed, and alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! So was that other <hi>Saul</hi> (King <hi>Saul</hi>) of whom we read, how that the <hi>Spirit of God coming upon him,</hi> (the spirit of Prophecy) he was <hi>turned to another man,</hi> (as <hi>Samuel</hi> tells
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62640:34"/>
him it should be done to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 6.) And so was this <hi>Saul</hi> much more, whose name was altered from <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Paul;</hi> giving him, and others, to take notice, that he was now <hi>turned to another man,</hi> wonderfully changed from what he was. Such a change there was in him, in respect of his quality and condition. He who was a <hi>sinner,</hi> a great sinner, was now a <hi>Saint.</hi> He who was a <hi>Persecuter,</hi> was now a <hi>Preacher,</hi> an <hi>Apostle.</hi> But this was the work of Grace in him. So himself looked upon it; <hi>By the grace of God I am that I am,</hi> (saith he) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. That he was Called, Justified, Sanctified, that he was a Preacher, an Apostle, this he ascribeth all to Free Grace; not to any thing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, nor to any thing that he had done. Of himself he was a sinner, a great sinner: and such he should still have continued, had not the Grace of God met with him, &amp; wrought such a change in him. So that here, reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his former condition, looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself as he was before his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he maketh this free and ingenuous confession and acknowledgement, That he was a great Sinner, I, the <hi>chief of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

was <hi>Paul,</hi> (or <hi>Saul,</hi> for that was then his Name) then a Debauched, Scandalous, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, Impious Person? Not so; his Life and Conversation was not tainted with any foul Vice, or sinful Enormity. No, clean otherwise; his life was then unblamaeble, nay very strict and regular; He had then a respect to the <hi>Law</hi> of his God; yea, a more than ordinary Respect, being <hi>zealous</hi> for it, a zealous Professour, and a zealous Practiser of it. And that not only for the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> part of it, wherein (as he tells his <hi>Galatians</hi>) he was a great proficient, beyond others of his time: <hi>Ye have heard</hi> (saith he) <hi>of my Conversation in time past, how I profited in the Iews Religion, above many of my equals in my own Nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the Traditions of my Fathers,</hi> Gal. 1. 14.

               <p>More genuinely then (in the Third place) <hi>Paul</hi> was the greatest of sinners in his own apprehension: Being best acquainted with

But for his <hi>own sins,</hi> these he was well acquainted with, his eyes being fully opened, and having a great measure of Light, which breaking forth into his Soul, he had now a full discovery of them, so as he was powerfully, and thorowly convinced of them: hereby he was made throrowly acquainted, as with the <hi>Streams,</hi> so with the <hi>Fountain;</hi> as with the several Acts of sinne which he had perpetrated, and committed, so with the fountain of corruption from whence they Issued: And both these he took notice of in himself, which he could not do in others. As for the outward <hi>acts</hi> of sinne in others, these he might either see, or hear of; but as for the <hi>fountain</hi> of Corruption, that mass and <hi>body of sin</hi> in them, that he could not be privy to. Thus was he better acquainted with himself, than with others; and with his own sins, than theirs: having a more clear, and full sight of the one, than of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62640:42"/>
other. So he had, whilest (as I said) he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the one <hi>near hand,</hi> the other <hi>afar off.</hi> Now things which we behold near hand, we behold them in their full proportion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as things seen at a distance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seem much less than they are.

Whereas the <hi>Moon,</hi> though one of the least of Stars, yet seemeth far to exceed them in Magnitude, because not so remote, but nearer to the Earth than they. So was it with <hi>Paul</hi>'s sins; they were nearer to his eye, than the sins of others, and therefore seem'd greater to him, than the sins of any other.</p>
               <p>Besides, they were <hi>set off</hi> (as I may say)<note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Pauls</hi> sins set off by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Gods Mercy shown to him.</note> by the greatness of that Grace and Mercy which he had tasted of.

And surely <hi>Paul</hi> having <hi>obtained Mercy,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of those <hi>exceeding riches of Grace,</hi> which God had <hi>shewn to him in his kindness towards him in Christ Iesus,</hi> in the Pardoning and Forgiving of his sins, &amp; receiving him into so great Favour; this made his sins to appear unto him so much the more sinful. Even as it is with a <hi>Traytor</hi> having plotted Treason against his <hi>Prince,</hi> against his <hi>Person</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and being Convicted of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62640:43"/>
condemned for it, if his Prince out of his special Grace shall please, not only to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his Crime, but to receive him into Grace and Favour, admitting him to some place of trust and nearness about his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: certainly, if there be any ingenuitie in such a person, this cannot but make him see the foulness of his Errour, and make the Treason seem more horrid unto him, than ever the Rigour of the Law, if Executed upon him, would have done. Thus was it with this our Apostle. <hi>Paul</hi> had taken up Arms against Christ, and against his Church, shewing himself a <hi>Rebel,</hi> an enemie to his Person and Government, exercising all the Acts of Hostility that he could upon his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and that for his cause, whom he thus Maligned, that he would even have pulled Him out of his Throne, if his power would have reached unto it. Now, this sin Christ pardoneth unto him, giving him his Pardon under Seal, assuring him of it. And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so, but he receiveth him, into special Grace and Favour with himself, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as a Servant, a Servant by Office, admitts him to a place of near attendance, preferring him to the highest Office in his Court, to be an Apostle, a chief Apostle, conferring many great and signal Favours upon him: No wonder then, that he having now a true <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Ingenuitie</hi> in him, (such is the Spirit of God) should look upon his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62640:43"/>
former course as most vile, most sinful, and that he should thus deeply charge himself to be the <hi>chief of sinners.</hi> The Story tells us of <hi>Peter,</hi> how, when at his Masters Command, after so long labour in vain, <hi>having</hi> (as he saith) <hi>toyled all the night and taken nothing;</hi> he had again cast in his Net, and thereupon, haled such a wonderful draught of Fishes; hereupon beholding the Power of Christ, who hereby shewed that he had all the Fishes of the Sea at his command; <hi>When he saw it, he fell down at his knees,</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord,</hi> Luk. 5. 8. <hi>Peter</hi> was a sinful man before, and he knew himself so to be. But now, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Power and Soveraignty of his Lord and Master, thus wonderfully manifested, this makes him reflect the more upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and so wrought in him, a greater, a deeper apprehension of his own vileness, his own sinfulness. And thus was it with this our Apostle St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Having had greater experience, as of the Power, so of the Grace and Mercy of Christ, than others, in pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him as a firebrand out of the flames, in working so great a change in him, this mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to reflect the more strongly upon his former course, and breeds in him a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er apprehension of the heinous and horrid nature of his former Practises, causing him to charge himself so home as here he doth, to accuse and condemn himself as the <hi>chief</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:62640:44"/>
                  <hi>of sinners.</hi> Thus, he saw his own sinfulness, more than the sinfulness of others, being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with his own sins, then with the sins of others.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Paul</hi> felt his own sins.</note>
               </p>
               <p>2. And again, as he <hi>saw</hi> them, so he <hi>felt</hi> them. As for the sins of others, he might <hi>see</hi> them, or <hi>hear</hi> of them, but he could not <hi>feel</hi> them. His own he both saw and felt. Seeing the foul and horrid nature of them, he also felt the weight and burden of them, which he did not of others. And this again, made him think his sins greater than the sins of any other. <hi>Cuique gravissimum suum onus,</hi> (saith <hi>Aretius</hi> upon it).

his own. Even thus was it with the blessed Apostle here. He had without question, heard of the sins of others, and he saw them to be great sins; I, but he feeleth his own. He had felt the burden of his former sins, and he still felt the weight of that body of sin, which he yet carried about with him.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A gracious Soul, is a frequent Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to its self,</hi> frequent in reflecting upon it's own sinful wayes and courses. It is the speech of the Church, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 12. <hi>Our Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them.</hi> And the like may be said of every truly penitent sinner; his Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are with him, and as for his Iniquities, he knows them. Taking special notice of them, he is frequent in remembring of them. So was it with the man after God's own heart, holy <hi>David,</hi> whom we shall find fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently striking upon this string. His sins were ever and anon in his eye, so as he took notice both of the number and nature, the multitude and magnitude of them. Thence are those passionate complaints of his which we meet with, that his <hi>Iniquities were gon over his head,</hi> Psal. 38. 4. That they <hi>were more than the hairs of his head,</hi> Psal. 40. 12. Thus did he keep a remembrance of them, even of such sins as were long before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62640:45"/>
So he did of the sins of his <hi>youth,</hi> which we find him deprecating, earnestly begging of God, that he would not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them, <hi>Remember not the sins of my youth,</hi> Psal. 25. 7. thereby shewing, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had not forgotten them, he remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. So he did some sins in special, as <hi>viz.</hi> that foul sin of his in the matter of <hi>Uriah;</hi> that sin was never out of his sight. <hi>My sin</hi> (saith he, speaking of that sin) <hi>is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before me,</hi> Psal. 51. 3. It was ever in his eye and thought.</p>
               <p>I, but it may be said: <hi>David</hi> at this time<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Not only in time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress.</note> was in great trouble of mind for that sin. And no wonder then, that he should remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that which he could not forget; that sin of his, lying so heavy upon his Conscience. And as for his condition at that time, when he complained so of his sinnes, that they were <hi>gon over his head,</hi> he was then under a great distress, under some soar Affliction, <hi>the Arrows of the Almighty stuck fast in him, and his Hand pressed him soar,</hi> (as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38. 2.) And so was it with the <hi>Church</hi> in the place forecited; she was at that time in great calamity and distress, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Judgments of God for her sins, (as she there sets it forth in the verses fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 9, 10, 11.) Now, no wonder that their sins should be brought to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance at such a time. <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren having been for three dayes in ward, then
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62640:46"/>
they remembered the evill that they had done to their brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21. And no wonder if the <hi>Church,</hi> lying under so great Calamity; and <hi>David</hi> in so great distress, such affliction of Body and Spirit; should remember and call to mind their sins. What great matter is this? Who would not do it at such a time? <hi>In their Affliction, they will seek me early,</hi> (saith the Lord of Rebellious <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> the people of <hi>Israel</hi>) <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. verse last.</p>
               <p>To go further then; God's Saints have<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A.</hi> But in the most quiet conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> been frequent in remembring their sins, not only whilest God hath set them before them, and made them to <hi>possess</hi> them, (as <hi>Iob</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of himself, <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 26. <hi>Thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth,</hi> that is, Thou bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est them to my remembrance, by dealing so severely with me. Not only at such times, when <hi>their iniquities have took hold of them,</hi> so as they have <hi>not been able to look up under them,</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> there saith of himself, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 12.) But when all things have gone well with them, after such time as they have su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the pardon of their sins, have been assured of their Reconciliation with God, and so have injoyed a quiet and comfortable condition in all respects: Yet, even then, they have been much in reflecting upon their sins, in calling them to mind upon all occasions. For an instance hereof, we shall
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62640:46"/>
need no other then this our Apostle. <hi>Paul,</hi> upon his Conversion, he had all his sins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and that Pardon sealed up in his Soul, so as he was fully assured, that all the wrong that he had done unto Christ and to his Church, it was now forgotten in Heaven, and should never be charged upon him. His Cognizance hereof, he expresseth in the verse next but one before the Text, <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. <hi>I was</hi> so and so, (saith he) <hi>but I obteined mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> (which he repeats again in the Verse after the Text, <hi>Vers.</hi> 16.) that is, to have these, and all other my sins pardoned and forgiven to me. This was <hi>Paul</hi> now assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, that God had blotted out all these sins of his, out of the Book of his Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, so as they should never be charged upon him. Yet for all this, he himself can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forget them. Upon all occasions he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon them, and takes occasion to speak of them. So we may see it in those obvious Texts, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 4. <hi>chap.</hi> 26. 10. 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 8. and so here again in this Chapter, as in the 13. <hi>verse,</hi> so again in this Text, where the mentioning of sinners, causeth him to reflect upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to remember and consider, what a one he was before his Conversion. And thus fareth it with truly penitent sinners, how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God upon their Repentance, blots their sins out of his own Book, and casts them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind His back, remembring them no more
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62640:47"/>
(as he promiseth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 25.) yet doth he not blot them out of their book, the book of their Remembrance, nor cause them to cast them behind their backs. Still They remember them, and cannot forget them.</p>
               <p>True, (you may say) where the sins have<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Not only such as have been scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> been foul, gross, and scandalous sins, hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and horrid sins; no wonder now if they stick by a man, and be often brought to his remembrance. Such were <hi>Davids</hi> sins in the matter of <hi>Uriah, Adultery</hi> and <hi>Murder.</hi> And such were <hi>Pauls</hi> sins in blaspheming of Christ and persecuting his Saints, crying-Sins. No wonder if such sins as these did stick by them, &amp; were ever before them. But this is not the case of all. Some and many there are, who do not stand guilty of any such sins, their lives have been more innocent and blameless, they have been kept from such foul &amp; gross evils. What? are they also to have such a frequent remembrance of their sins?</p>
               <p>Surely, Yes. There being (in the Ist. place)<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A.</hi> Few but have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into some such sins.</note> few or none but at some time or other, have fallen into some such fins, as they have cause in a special manner, to remember all their dayes. However, (2dly) they have a <hi>body of sin</hi> in them, which they carry about with<note place="margin">All have a <hi>body</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> in them.</note> them, a mass of corruption, strongly enclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to evil, which is continually ready to break forth, if it were not by a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power restrained. Besides, (3dly) they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62640:47"/>
have many secret <hi>inordinate lusts,</hi> which,<note place="margin">Many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate lusts working inwardly</note> though they do not break forth into the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act, yet oft times they have inward workings in the Soul. Now these require a frequent reflecting upon, to be often had in remembrance. So they have been by the Saints of God. <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> was an holy man, sanctified in his Infancy, as the Angel tells his Father <hi>Zacharias</hi> of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>He shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mothers womb; Sanctified</hi> (as <hi>Ieremie</hi> is said to have been, <hi>Ier.</hi> 1. 5.) <hi>before he came forth of the womb.</hi> A Saint from his birth. And such, questionless, he was in his life, holy and blamless, free from grosser evils, yet was not he unmindful of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his nature, and the errors of his life. So much may be collected from that speech of his, to our Saviour, who tendring himself to his <hi>Baptism, Iohn</hi> tells him, <hi>I have need to be baptised of thee,</hi> Mat. 3. 14. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Ego necesse habeo,</hi> (as <hi>Beza</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slates it), it is not only expedient, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for me, that I should be baptised of thee. And why so? why, that by Him he might be washen from all fins, Original and Actual, which he had then in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
               <p>But I shall not need to seek for any other<note place="margin">All these <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</note> instance than this in the Text. This blessed Apostle, he was much exercised and taken up, not onely with the Remembrance of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62640:48"/>
these grosser Sins committed before his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, but even with the Sight and Sense of his present Corruption, and daily Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. So much we may learn from his own mouth: as elsewhere, so especially in that Seventh of the <hi>Romans;</hi> where (not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonating any other, but speaking of himself) we find him passionately bewailing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning his condition; not in regard of the Evils of his former course, but of his daily Infirmities, his sinful <hi>Omissions</hi> and <hi>Commissions,</hi> ver. 15. <hi>What I would, that I do not; but what I hate, that I do:</hi> ver. 19. <hi>The good that I would, that I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.</hi> And so out of the strength of <hi>Corruption</hi> working in him, and sometimes prevailing against him. <hi>I finde</hi> (saith he) <hi>a Law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me,</hi> ver. 21. <hi>I see a Law in my Members, rebelling against the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity to the law of Sin, which is in my Members.</hi> Thus was this precious Saint much taken up, not onely with reflecting upon his former sinnes before Conversion, but with consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his present condition. In the sense and apprehension whereof, he therebreaks forth into that passionate complaint, Ver. 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, Who shall deliver me from the body of this Death?</hi> And so here in the Text, <hi>Iesus Christ came into the world to save Sinners, of whom I am chief.</hi> Not onely <hi>was,</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:62640:48"/>
but <hi>am,</hi> a Sinner, a great sinner still. Thus were his sins ever before him; sins before Conversion, and sins after Conversion. And so is it in measure with every Gracious soul, being truly Penitent for sin; it cannot forget it, it is frequent in the Remembrance of it.</p>
               <p>And it cannot be otherwise, the <hi>Eyes</hi> of<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinner hath his Eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</note> such a one being (in the First place) <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened. The man whose eyes are open</hi> (saith <hi>Balaam</hi> of himself) <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 3. Meaning either his Bodily eyes, which being closed whilst he was in a Trance, were now opened; or rather the eyes of his Mind, which were now opened, to behold, and fore-see those fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture events, which before were hid from him, and others. It may be applied to every true Convert; Every such a one is <hi>a man whose eyes were shut, but now they are open:</hi> the eyes of his Understanding being opened, to see the true Nature of Sin, and to see it in himself; to see the sinfulness of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of his Life.</p>
               <p>2. And his Understanding being thus En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, <note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>Hearts;</hi> deeply affected with the Sense of those Sins, whereof they were by <hi>Peter's</hi> Sermon convinced. And so in measure are all true Penitent Sinners. Being convinced of their Sins, they are in like manner af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with grief and sorrow of Heart for them. Now that which goeth near a mans Heart, maketh a deep and firm impression upon the Memory, so as it cannot easily be forgotten.</p>
               <p>These, and many other Reasons might be given, Why a Regenerate person should be so mindful of his <hi>own</hi> sins: and that more than the sins of <hi>others.</hi> The sinnes of others, however they both may, and ought to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a Christian, upon the seeing, or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; yet they come not so near the Heart, they make not so deep an Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon the Soul, as a mans own Sinnes do.</p>

sinner? How many then are there, who may from hence be convinced, that they are none of this number, being such, as seldom, or never, reflect upon their own sinfulness; or, if they do, they do it not in a right way and manner. Of these, I shall reckon up four or five several sorts.</p>
               <p>1. Some there are, and many, whose <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Such whose <hi>Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> were never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened</note> 
                  <hi>were never yet awakened,</hi> their eyes were never yet opened to see their own sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, the sinfulness of their natures, and errours of their lives. Such a <hi>dead sleep</hi> hath seised upon them, that nothing will awaken them. Notwithstanding that their <hi>sins,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (it may be) crying sins, cry loud in their ears; yet they hear them not. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the <hi>Iudgments</hi> of God against those sins, and against them for them, have been by his Ministers thundered out in their ears, enough to shake and rend the most rocky heart; yet they stir not them. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, that their sins have taken hold upon them, and broke forth upon them in many terrible and remarkable Judgments, pointing out their sins unto them; yet they affect them not. Still they go on in their way, being stupid and sensless, never brought to consider the state and condition they are in; never brought to fix a serious thought upon any of their sins, though never so foul, never so open and scandalous. Others see them, the world cryeth shame on them, yet
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62640:50"/>
themselves are not at all touched with the sense of them. Such a <hi>dead sleep</hi> (as I called it) is fallen upon them. And well may it so be called. When a man cannot be awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by hallowing in his ears, by pricking, and pinching, and smiting of him, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude he is in a desperate <hi>Lethargie,</hi> a dead sleep. And is not this the case of many stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Souls among us? <hi>Word, Threatnings, Iudgments;</hi> Word Pronounced, Threatnings Denounced, Judgments Executed; yet all stir not them. Still they lie in sin, go on in sin without sense, without remorse, never reflecting upon themselves, upon their hearts or lives, to consider the evil of them. This is that which the Lord complaineth of in the people of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> Jer. 8. 6. <hi>I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright, no man repented him of his wickedness, Saying, What have I done? Every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the Battle.</hi> Such was their general securitie and stupiditie! none of them had any remorse, or touch at all in their Consciences for any of their sins, so far forth, as but to think once seriously with themselves, What it was that they had done; But like a fierce headstrong horse, which hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sound of the Trumpet, and seeing or smelling the Battle a far off, doth with much violence, notwithstanding what his Rider can do to hold him in, in a full Carier make towards it, and rusheth into the midst of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62640:50"/>
it. Such was the eagerness of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the pursuit of their sinful wayes and courses. And so is it with too many every where: Whatever can be said or done to them, yet still they will hold on their course, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can bring them to a serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the evil thereof. So far are they from that tenderness of Conscience, which was in this our blessed Apostle, and is to be found in measure in every regenerate person, (who having <hi>tender hearts</hi> (as <hi>Iosiah</hi> is said to have, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 27.) the least hint is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bring their sins to remembrance) that nothing will stir, nothing will awaken them. Certainly a fearful state, a desperate condition, a clear evidence, that they are (as the Apostle saith of his <hi>Ephesians</hi> before their conversion, <hi>Ephes</hi> 2. 1.) <hi>dead in tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes and sins!</hi>

Happily, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearing of some powerful Sermon, upon the feeling or fearing of some terrible Judgment, their consciences have begun to be awakened, and thereupon their sins have begun to stare them in the face. They have been in measure convinced of the evil of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62640:51"/>
their former wayes, and have felt some hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of conscience for them. But hereupon what do they? why presently do what they can to get their consciences a sleep again; take all the courses they can to charm their sins, to silence and stay the clamour of them, or to stop their ears against them, that so they may never hear more of them. To this end they even study the Art of <hi>Oblivion</hi> and Forgetfulness.</p>
               <p>1. Shunning, as much as may be, all means<note place="margin">1. <hi>Shunning</hi> all means that might awaken them.</note> that might disquiet their consciences, by bringing their sins to their remembrance. Upon that account declining, as much as they can, a searching, and a <hi>Powerful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</hi> A thing, which they can by no means endure. <hi>What have I to do with thee, thou man of God? Art thou come to call my sin to remembrance?</hi> It is the speech of the <hi>Widow of Sarepta,</hi> speaking in a passion to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eliah,</hi> 1 King. 17. 18. So it is: the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> of God, his <hi>Ministers</hi> powerfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing the Word, denouncing the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, they bring the sins of wicked men to their remembrance, and therefore they cannot away with them. This it was, that made <hi>Ahab</hi> to decline <hi>Micaiahs</hi> Ministery and to hate his person; because (as he himself giveth the reason of it), he <hi>did not prophesie good concerning him, but evil,</hi> 1 King. 22. 8. He would not flatter, and smooth him up in his sins, (as the rest of his false Prophets did)
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62640:51"/>
but dealt plainly with him, being to him a <hi>faithful Remembrancer,</hi> to put him in mind of them. And this it was, that made <hi>Faelix</hi> so weary of hearing <hi>Paul's</hi> Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 25. <hi>Paul</hi> preaching to him of <hi>Righteousness, and Temperance, and Iudgement,</hi> (a subject which he liked not to hear of, being conscious to himself of his own flagitious and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Life) put him into a <hi>trembling fit,</hi> his Conscience beginning to be awakened; which he could by no means endure. And is not this the case of some, and too many amongst us? Being desirous to lull their Consciences asleep, and to go on in their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ways &amp; courses without disquietment, they thereupon baulk, and, as much as may be, decline the powerful Ministry of the Word; at least, not enduring that their <hi>darling sins</hi> should be medled with. <hi>I charge you, O ye daughters of Hierusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my Love till he please,</hi> (saith the <hi>Spouse</hi> concerning her <hi>Well-beloved</hi>) <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 7. And the like charge could some be content to give to the <hi>Lords Watchmen,</hi> the Ministers of Christ, That they should not stir, or disquiet their Beloved Lusts; which if they do, they cannot bear, they cannot endure it at their hands. <hi>Herod</hi> could be content to hear <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> and in many things <hi>he heard him gladly,</hi> (as it is said of him, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 20.) but when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to meddle with his <hi>Herodias,</hi> telling
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62640:52"/>
him (as he did, <hi>ver.</hi> 18.) That <hi>it was not lawful for him to have his brother's Wife;</hi> now this must not be endured, <hi>Iohn</hi> must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to the Prison, and at <hi>Herodias</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest have his Head cut off, (as the Story there sets it forth). Such is the Genius of too many every where (I wish there may be none of them found among you), they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely decline all wayes and means, which might bring their sins to their remembrance.</p>
               <p>2. And on the other Hand, they make<note place="margin">2. Using means to put their sins out of their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</note> use of all kind of <hi>Opiates;</hi> use all the means they can devise, or think of; to put and keep their Sins out of their Remembrance. To that end, either with <hi>Cain,</hi> falling to <hi>building of Cities,</hi> Gen. 4. 17. they plunge themselves into all kind of Worldly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; or with <hi>Solomons fool,</hi> running into the <hi>house of Mirth,</hi> Eccles. 7. 4. betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to merry Jovial company, give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to the following of Vain Sports and Recreations; seeking, by this means, to drive away the Evil spirit of an awakened Conscience, and to drown the noise and clamour of their Sins; even as those <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> are said to have done the cryes of their Children, which they Sacrificed in the Vallie of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> with the noise of Drums, or other Instruments, (from whence it had the name of <hi>Topheth,</hi> coming from the Hebrew word <hi>Toph,</hi> which signifieth <hi>Tympanum,</hi> a <hi>Tymbrel,</hi> or <hi>Drum</hi>). Now these are far from
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62640:52"/>
                  <hi>Pauls</hi> disposition here in the Text, who was willing to take all occasions to put him in minde of his Sins.</p>
               <p>A Third sort there are, who have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">3.

Even so is it with them, in acting and committing of Sin, they forget the sins which are Behind, the sins of Youth, and the sins of Riper age, which, it may be, they have been formerly convinced of; and they press forwards to the making up of the full measure of their Iniquities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:62640:53"/>A Fourth sort there are, who do, it may<note place="margin">4.

Now, it may be, they cast some glances upon their Sins, looking upon them as the fewel that have kindled this Fire. Even as that <hi>Widow of Sarepta</hi> did in the Text even now cited, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 18. Her son being Sick, and the Prophet coming to her, now she remembreth her Sin, which she apprehended might have brought that threatned Judgement upon her and hers: <hi>Art thou come unto me</hi> (saith she) <hi>to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> call my Sin to Remembrance?</hi> But no sooner is the storm over, but they cast their sins behind their backs again, remembring them no more; in times of Prosperity, never so much as thinking of them. In this, like some bad Debtors, who never think of what they Owe, but when they are under Arrest, or at least see the Sergeant.</p>
               <p>To these, yet adde another sort, worse<note place="margin">5. Such as remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them but are not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for them.</note> than all the former. They, it may be, do look back, and call their former sins to their remembrance; but how? not remembring them as they ought to do; not looking upon them as <hi>Sins,</hi> to repent of them, and to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62640:53"/>
be humbled for them, to shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themselves for them; but only (it may be) as <hi>tricks of youth,</hi> (as they call them) and so making light of them. Nay, it may be, remembring of them to <hi>Boast of them,</hi> to Glory in them, (as those <hi>Idolaters</hi> are said to do of their <hi>Idols, Psal.</hi> 97. 7.) or pleasing, and tickling themselves (as it were) with the thought and remembrance of those sins, which now they want opportunity, or ability, to act over again. Of all the rest, these are the worst.</p>
               <p>Now to speak a word or two to all of these,<note place="margin">A word to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> in special to those <hi>secure sinners,</hi> such as go on in a course of Sin, never reflecting upon themselves, and such as are so far from this frequent Remembrance, that they (as I said) <hi>study the Art of forgetfulness,</hi> account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it their happiness to forget their Sins; and consequently cannot endure to be put in minde of them: Let all such but seriously consider these two things, which will serve to convince them of the folly and madness of this their Course.</p>

they cannot be Blotted out, they cannot be Forgotten.</p>

In Gods book, the book of his Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</note> members of his Natural body, <hi>In thy Book are all my members written,</hi> Psal. 139. 16. so may a Wicked man say of his sins, The members of that <hi>body of Sin</hi> in him, they are all written in Gods Book, the book of his Remembrance. There are the <hi>Names</hi> of all Gods <hi>Saints</hi> entered, as the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> tell us, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>A book of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his Name.</hi> And there are the Names of all wicked &amp; ungodly men entred: And, as their <hi>Names,</hi> so their <hi>Sinnes.</hi> Every particular Act, with every particular Circumstance, being all come up into Remembrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.

So they shall be with God: however they themselves may forget their own sins, and the world may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them; yet God, whilest his Justice is not satisfied, He will not, He cannot. What a folly then is it in them, to go about to forget them, so long as God remembers them? Were it so, that they could blot them out of their own <hi>Book,</hi> the book of their <hi>Conscience;</hi> yet as long as they stand upon Record in <hi>God's Book,</hi> what will this avail them?

maketh his prayer to God, that he would <hi>blot out his Transgressions,</hi> Psal. 51. 1.

All that men can do in this case, is but to keep this book <hi>shut,</hi> (which for a time haply they may); but to blot out what is written in it, this they cannot do.

                  <hi>the use of such means,</hi> as whereby he ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily effecteth this work. The chief whereof, is the publick <hi>Ministry of his Word.</hi> Hereby doth God open the eyes of poor sinners. <hi>Paul,</hi> was sent by <hi>God</hi> unto the <hi>Gentiles</hi> upon this Errand, <hi>To open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, from the power of Satan unto God, that they might receive forgiveness of sins,</hi> &amp;c. (as the Lord tells him) Act. 26. 18. And how was he to do this? Why, by his Preaching, his Preaching of the Word to them. Herein are God's <hi>Ministers</hi> his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments</hi> (as he was) in doing of this work, in <hi>giving sight to the blind;</hi> in making men to see and know their sins. This is the work which the Lord putteth his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> upon, <hi>cap.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>Son of man</hi> (saith he) <hi>cause Ierusalem to know her Abominations.</hi> And this is the work of God's <hi>Ministers</hi> his <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> (as <hi>to shew unto man his uprightness,</hi> of which <hi>Elihu</hi> speaks, <hi>Iob</hi> 33. 23; so) to <hi>convince</hi> him of his <hi>sinfulness.</hi> And therefore, that you may come to see and feel this; at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon this <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, and that with care and Conscience, that you may hear what God will say to you by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. Not being offended at them, when they come to touch upon your sins, as <hi>Ahab</hi> was with <hi>Michaiah, Herod</hi> with <hi>Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> and <hi>Foelix</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> (of whom I spake before); but, Be willing to hear of them, that so you may be convinced of them, and

brought to remember them in a truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential way. This for the former sort, such as never yet knew, what it was to remember their sins aright.</p>
               <p>In the second place, for them who have<note place="margin">2. Penitent sinners excited to a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their sins.</note> remembered them, and seriously repented of them, let them also be excited, <hi>frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reflect upon them.</hi> It is a mistake, if any shall think (what our <hi>Antinomians</hi> of late time did) that when once a man hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his sins, and sued out his pardon for them, he should then cast them behind his back, so as to remember them no more. Our Apostle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he had repented of his sins committed before his Conversion, his Infidelity, Obstinacy, Blasphemy; his opposing of Christ, and Persecuting of his Saints. Being hereof convinced in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way, by a Voice from Heaven; Christ himself calling unto him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi> Act. 9. 4. he had seriously repented of them. And he had su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his pardon for them, having it under Seal, being assured that he had <hi>obtained Mercy</hi> (as here he declares it once and again, in the verse next but one before, and the verse after the Text): Yet, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this, upon all occasions (as you have heard), he is ready to reflect upon those sins, and to call to minde his forepast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Let it not then content any of us, that we have remembred our sins, that we
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62640:61"/>
have been humbled for them, and that by believing on Christ, we have obteined the pardon of them, but still take all occasions to reflect and look back upon them, to call them to minde again. Specially our <hi>special sins,</hi> which have been of greater magnitude then other. So the Lord tells his people <hi>Israel</hi> they should do, when he was <hi>pacified towards them for all the evil that they had done,</hi> then, they should remember it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>vers.</hi> last.</p>
               <p>Why, but it may be said, <hi>To what purpose</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Two <hi>Questions</hi> resolved.</note> 
                  <hi>is this? or, What benefit shall a Christian reap in so doing.</hi> Here are two <hi>Queries,</hi> to which I shall return Answers severally. In which Answers we shall fall in, with divers <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Motives,</hi> which will be of use, to press and set on the <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the former. <hi>Wherefore should a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a penitent sinner should do this?</note> 
                  <hi>do this?</hi> Having once repented of his sins, and sued out the pardon of them, Why should he disquiet himself in calling them to mind again, in rubbing over an old soar? I Answer, this a Christian is to do upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse accounts, for diverse <hi>Ends,</hi> and <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:</hi> Instance in 4. of them.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>For the making sure of his Repentance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>A.</hi> For the making sure his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> that he may know it to be sound and true. All Repentance is not true Repentance. It is with <hi>sins</hi> as with <hi>wounds:</hi> Wounds may be skinned over, and yet not healed; Sins may be sorrowed for, yea, and absteined from,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62640:61"/>
yet not truly repented of. To this end therefore, a Christian should be frequent in reflecting upon them, to see whether he hath truly repented of them or no. Even as a man, by rubbing and chafing of the soar, he trieth whether it be healed or no; even so by this means, a Christian may come to judg of his Repentance, whether it was sound or no, by calling his sins to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, rubbing, and pressing them, (as it were) by a frequent reflecting upon them; which doing willingly, it may be to him an evidence that it is so. A wound that is only skinned over, will not endure the handling; the touching of it, puts the patient to pain. Where men cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to have their sins touched, by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or others, to be put in minde of them, it is an evidence those sins are not healed, never truly repented of. Sins healed, will endure the touching. Upon this accompt, Christians ought to be frequent in reflecting upon their sins, for the assuring of the truth of their repentance.</p>
               <p>2. And as for the assuring, so (2dly.) for<note place="margin">2. For the <hi>renewing</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing</hi> of it.</note> the <hi>renewing and increasing</hi> of it. It is a mistake, if any shall think Repentance to be onely one particular act, the work of an hour, or a day, or the like (as <hi>Papists</hi> look upon their <hi>Penance</hi>). No, it is an habitual work, the work of a Christians life-time, and so to be frequently renewed. A work which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62640:62"/>
can never do too much, or yet enough Certainly, he that thinks he hath repented <hi>enough,</hi> never yet repented <hi>aright.</hi> In this sense, the Repentance of a Christian may be called, <hi>Repentance to be repented of,</hi> because not so perfect as it ought to be. Those, who are the greatest proficients, and have made the greatest progress in this work, yet they fail in this as in all other duties, falling short of repenting as they ought to do. And therefore ought to take all occasions for the renewing of their repentance; and to that end, they are frequently to call to mind their former sins, that they may mourn over them afresh, renewing their former sorrow for them.<note place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of sin, though bitter, maketh way for sweet joy.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Which, however it may have some bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness in it for the present, yet it will make way for great <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> to the Soul. So it is, the <hi>joy</hi> of a Christian ariseth out of <hi>sorrow,</hi> sorrow for sin; and ordinarily it is proportioned to it. As it was with <hi>Eliahs Sacrifice,</hi> 1 King. 18. 33. 38. after he had caused <hi>water</hi> in great abundance, three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, to be poured about the Altar, then came forth the <hi>Fire.</hi> Thus, after a Christians sorrow for sin, his joy ariseth. And as the one is increased, so oft-times is the other. The Harvest answereth the Seed time. <hi>They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy,</hi> Psal. 126. 5. Never a truly penitential tear, that the remembrance of sin draweth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62640:62"/>
from the eye, but ordinarily God answers and recompenceth it with a suitable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of joy and comfort to the Soul.</p>
               <p>In the 3d. place, Christians are to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent<note place="margin">3. To get assurance of the pardon of them.</note> in remembring of their sins, that they may <hi>get assurance of the pardon of them,</hi> that they may get their <hi>pardon Sealed</hi> up unto their Souls. A pardon, is not ever as soon sealed as granted. A Christian may have his sins pardoned in Heaven, yet not so in his own Conscience, wanting the <hi>assurance</hi> thereof. And upon this accompt, he ought to have his sins frequentlie in his eie. Upon this accompt, among other, he is daily to <hi>pray for the forgiveness of them,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth us to do in that <hi>form of prayer</hi> which he hath given us, where this is one of the six <hi>Petitions, Forgive us our Trespasses,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not onely our <hi>daily sins,</hi> (as we pray for our <hi>daily bread</hi>) but all the sins of our lives past, that so we may still gain a further and clearer evidence, and assurance of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of them. This use <hi>David</hi> made of his sins being ever before him, it put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earnest seeking of the assurance of his pardon, that, that cloud being dispelled, the light of God's countenance might come to shine upon his Soul; which he earnestly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for in that <hi>Penitential Psalm</hi> of his, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>Make me to hear the voice of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> vers. 8. <hi>Restore unto me the joy of thy Salvation,</hi> vers. 12. Thus are Christians to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62640:63"/>
reflect upon their sins, that they may get the pardon of them Sealed.</p>
               <p>4thly, and lastly, Remember them, that<note place="margin">4. To get them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>healed.</hi>
                  </note> they <hi>may get them thorowly healed;</hi> that they may be freed and delivered, as from the <hi>guilt,</hi> so from the <hi>power</hi> of them. A <hi>disease</hi> may be cured, and yet there may be some relicks of it in the bodie; which, if not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, may incline it to a Relapse. Thus, a <hi>sin</hi> may be repented of and pardoned, and yet there may be some remainders of it in the Soul, which, if not looked unto, may break forth again. And upon this accompt a Christian is to remember it, that he may get strength against it. Such use also <hi>David</hi> made of his sins being ever before him, it putteth him upon seeking unto God, that he would <hi>throwly wash him from his iniquity, and cleanse him from his sin,</hi> Psal. 51. 2. freeing him both from the guilt and power of it: And that he would <hi>create in him a clean heart, renewing a right spirit within him,</hi> vers. 10. And, that he would <hi>establish him with his free Spirit,</hi> vers. 12. Thus are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to have a frequent eie upon their sins, as <hi>Patients</hi> have upon their <hi>soars,</hi> to see that they may not break forth again.

Now the Remembrance, as of former <hi>Afflictions</hi> which he hath lain under; so of former <hi>Sins</hi> which he hath fallen into, will be of special use to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it, to make it keep so. This effect it had in and upon this our <hi>Apostle,</hi> (as you have heard.) The remembrance of his former Sins made him Vile in his own eyes. This it was that made him think and speak so mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of himself, to account himself the <hi>least of</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:62640:64"/>
                  <hi>the Apostles,</hi> unworthy to be one of that number,; the <hi>least of Saints,</hi> nay, <hi>less than the least of them,</hi> (as the Text hath it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 8.) <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>I persecuted the Church of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 9. Thus it was: As the <hi>Buffetings of Satan,</hi> (of which he speaketh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.) those temptations wherewith he was exercised after his Conversion; so the remembrance of his former <hi>Sins</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before his Conversion, was to him of great use to keep him from <hi>being exalted above measure;</hi> a thing which by reason of the many and great priviledges now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him, he was subject to, and in danger of. Thus God sometimes suffers his <hi>Chosen Vessels,</hi> those whom he purposeth to make some special use of, and to confer some signal Favours upon, to fall into some great Sin, or sins, haply in their Youth, it may be Afterwards, that so the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them may be a means to keep their Spirits in a humble frame and temper, from being inordinately lift up in them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them as the <hi>Peacocks black Leggs</hi> are vulgarly conceived to be unto him; which looking down upon, he presently letteth fall his <hi>proud Plumes.</hi> Here is the <hi>first</hi> of those <hi>Benefits,</hi> which a Christian may reap from this reflecting upon his Sins.

               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:62640:65"/>2dly. As it will be of great Use to make<note place="margin">2. To make Men thankful.</note> men Humble, so <hi>Thankful.</hi> As Humble in themselves, so Thankful to their <hi>God.</hi> A <hi>fruit</hi> naturally growing upon this <hi>Branch.</hi> Remembrance of former sins Repented of, and Pardoned, it calleth to mind two things; <hi>Gods Goodness, our own Unworthiness.</hi> Gods goodness in <hi>sparing</hi> of us; not taking us, as the <hi>Scribes and Pharisees</hi> tell our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> that <hi>woman</hi> was, whom they brought before him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the very Act of sinne, and so bringing us to answer (as they did her) before His Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, for those Sins which we wanted Grace, and space to Repent of. Nor yet onely sparing us, giving us a time to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but also <hi>working that Repentance</hi> in us, and, upon our Repenting, <hi>Pardoning them;</hi> and instead of punishing us according to our deservings, conferring many special Graces and Favours upon us; of all which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the least of which, we were altogether unworthy. Both these, the remembrance of former sins calleth to mind. And so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it cannot but be a special means to raise up the Heart to a Thankful apprehension, and acknowledgment thereof. Of such Use was it to this blessed <hi>Apostle,</hi> as we may take notice from the 12. &amp; 13. verses in this Chapter, where calling to mind his former sins, he presently breaketh forth into bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and magnifying of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> for his
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62640:65"/>
rich Grace and Mercy towards him; <hi>I thank Christ Iesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ministry, who was before a Blasphemer, a Persecutor, Injurious: but I obteined mercy.</hi> So again, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. Having here confessed himself to be the <hi>chief of sinners,</hi> and after declared what God had done for him, how he had <hi>made him a Patern to all that should hereafter believe on him;</hi> he thereupon in the next words breaketh forth into that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Gratulation, <hi>Now, unto the King Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Immortal, Invisible, the only wise God, be Honour and Glory, for ever and ever, Amen.</hi> Thus, the reflecting upon our sins after that we have obteined Mercy, it will be a means as to cause us to take shame to our selves, so to give glory to God, the Glory of his Grace and Mercy in sparing us, in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, and conferring so many undeserved favours upon us. It will be of special use to make us <hi>thankful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And (3dly) as <hi>thankful,</hi> so <hi>watchful,</hi> watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<note place="margin">3. To make them watchful over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> over those and the like sins. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of dangers formerly escaped will make men the more warie, they will take heed how they come nigh that fire, in which they have before been burnt or scorched, or that precipice from which once they fell, or passing that way wherein they have fallen among Thieves. Thus, Christians having their sins in remembrance, and mainteining
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62640:66"/>
in their Souls, a sight and sense of them, it will be of special use to them, to make them more cautelous &amp; wary, to take heed of all the occasions of them of coming near unto them. As for the Soul, that hath banished the sense and remembrance of it's sins, it careth not, what sins it rusheth upon and runs into. <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he saith of them, <hi>that being past feeling,</hi>

                  </gap>aving cast away all sense of, and sorrow for sin, they then <hi>gave themselves over unto lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness,</hi> Ephes. 4. 19. The best way then to be kept from sin, is to maintein the sense of it in the Soul. To which end, the frequent reflecting upon sins past, will conduce much. By this means it was, that <hi>David kept himself from his iniquitie,</hi> (as he saith he did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 23.) from the sin which he was most inclined to, by having it frequently in his remembrance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and lastly, The frequent reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">4.

What is the cause, why <hi>Hypocrites</hi> are so quick-sighted in espying, and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in judging and censuring of others?

Surely, were men more busied at home, more taken up with remembring and considering their own failings, their own sins, what they have been, what they have done, they would be more pittiful, more tender-hearted towards others. It is the Apostle's Argument which he putteth into <hi>Titus</hi> his mouth, willing him to make use of it, in disswading Christians from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too censorious towards their Brethren, or any other whosoever, but to induce them to deal tenderly and gently with them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 2, 3. <hi>Put them in mind</hi> (saith he) <hi>to speak evil of no man,</hi> (that is, wrongfully, or causlesly, whether by aspersing of them, or detracting from them), <hi>to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men;</hi>

Not that I would have Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to stand continually poring upon their sins, so fixing their thoughts upon them, that their hearts and spirits should be inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately dejected, and cast down in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them. This God requires not, neither ought Christians to give way to it. <hi>David</hi> was a man, much in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his sins, yet, he would not give way to such soul-dejections and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietments, for which, we find him check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62640:67"/>
himself in those two <hi>Psalms,</hi> 42. and 43. where we have the same Expostulation thrice repeated, <hi>Why art thou cast down, O my Soul? Why art thou disquieted within me,</hi> &amp;c? Christians, should not so look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their sins, as that they should give way to such dejections of Spirit, as may render their condition uncomfortable to themselves and unserviceable to others. In this case, that of the <hi>Preacher</hi> takes place, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 17. <hi>Be not over-much wicked,</hi> that is, <hi>judicio tuo</hi> (as <hi>Iunius</hi> expounds it), in thine own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension and judgment. In such a sense it is, that in the verse there foregoing, he biddeth us not to be over-righteous or over-wise; <hi>Be not Righteous over-much, neither make thy self over-wise;</hi> that is, do not think thy self so to be. So, here in this verse, which is subjoyned as an <hi>Antitheton,</hi> set in opposition to the former, <hi>Be not over-much wicked, viz.</hi> in thy own apprehension. And let<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> me applie it unto you, (I mean all, and only such as are trulie penitent sinners); Be not you in this sense <hi>wicked over-much,</hi> stand not pore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much upon your sins, sorrowing over them, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, the <hi>Heathen</hi> did over their dead, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>as have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no hope.</hi> Onely upon occasions call them to remembrance, making use hereof, to those ends and purposes which I have now spoken of.</p>

Call we our selves then every one of us to account for our sinnes this day, humbling our selves in the sight and presence of God for them, that so, we remembring them, God may be pleased graciously to forget them, and forgive them, so as not to charge them upon the Head of the Nation. In doing hereof, we shall much promote the service of the <hi>Day;</hi> and much help forward the <hi>great business</hi> both of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> which is now in the hands of the <hi>Great Council</hi> of the Land. Certainly the great Stumbling-blocks that lie in the way of Mercy, they are the Sinnes of the Nation. O Let every of us, put to our hands this Day to the removing of them, by taking out of the way, as much as we can, the sinnes of others, Humbling our selves for them, and seeking the Pardon of them; however our own sinnes, by calling them to mind, Humbling, Shaming, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning our selves for them; withal, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them away in the full purpose and resolution of our Souls, never more to give entertainment to them. <hi>Thus wash we, and make we our selves clean, putting away the evil of our doings from before the eyes of our God,</hi> (as he requires his People to do, <hi>Isai.</hi> 1. 16.);

And then do we, what in the next words he allowes them to do, <hi>Come, let us Reason together, &amp;c.</hi> begging from him Mercy for our selves, and the Nation, being hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and comfortably assured that the Lord will smell a Sweet savour of rest from this our <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and that both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> shall find it the best service we could perform unto them, which the Lord enable every of us to do.

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For Answer, Know we that the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of Sin, is either unto <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Man.</hi> The former, to <hi>God,</hi> either <hi>publickly,</hi> or <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately;</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:62640:70"/>
the latter, to <hi>Man,</hi> either <hi>secretly,</hi> or <hi>openly. Secretly,</hi> either to the <hi>Ministers of God,</hi> or to other <hi>private Christians. Openly,</hi> which is either <hi>Regular,</hi> injoyned by the Church, or <hi>Occasional</hi> and <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi> All these wayes Sinne is confessed and acknowledged: And all these wayes a sinner truly Penitent will be ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his sinnes.</p>
               <p>1. In the first place unto <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Unto <hi>God</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>sonne</hi> in the Gospel, upon his return to his Father, at his first meeting with him, after that his father had expressed his father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affection unto him, presently he breaks forth into a humble acknowledgement of his sinnes unto him, <hi>Father I have sinned against Heaven, and in thy sight,</hi> Luke 15. 21. This is the first thing that a poor sinner doth, when once he is brought home unto God, and hath in any measure tasted of his Grace and Mercy, he presently falleth down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him, in an humble acknowledgment of his Sinnes unto him. This will he do at his <hi>first Conversion,</hi> and this he is ready ever after to do upon all Occasions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing his Acknowledgements of sinne, as sinnes themselves are renewed. So did <hi>David; I acknowledged my Transgressions,</hi> (saith he in the Text forenamed) <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 3. And to whom was it that he acknowledged them? Why, firstly and principally to his <hi>God,</hi> whom he had offended. So he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62640:71"/>
it in the verse following, <hi>Against thee onely have I sinned;</hi> that is, against him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and properly: And therefore to him it is that he acknowledged his Sinne. So he elsewhere declareth it, Psal. 32. 5. <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged my Sinne unto Thee, and mine Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity have I not hid; I said I will confess my Transgressions unto the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> And this will every truly Penitent sinner readily do. Apprehending how he hath offended and provoked his <hi>God</hi> by his sins, he will be ready to acknowledge them unto him.</p>
               <p>And this will he do (as I said) both <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Both publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </note> and <hi>Privately. Publickly,</hi> joyning with the Congregation in the publick confession and acknowledgment of Sinness; and that both in Confessions <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>extraordinary.</hi> And as Publickly, so <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,</hi> when there is no other witnesse but God and his own Conscience, then will he be ready to acknowledge his Sinnes. And that again, both in his daily, and ordinary Prayers, as also at other times of extraordinary Humiliation. All these I might show you, how they have been both <hi>injoyned</hi> and <hi>practised;</hi> injoyned by <hi>God,</hi> and practised by his <hi>Saints.</hi> But I shall not dwell upon this, the Text lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me rather to that other kind of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, which is before, or unto, <hi>Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus true Penitents will be ready<note place="margin">2. Unto <hi>men</hi>

                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:62640:71"/>
to acknowledge their Sinnes. And that (as I said) sometimes <hi>Secretly,</hi> sometimes <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Secretly,</hi> or <hi>Privately,</hi> either unto the<note place="margin">1. Secretly, or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately.</note> 
                  <hi>Ministers of God,</hi> or unto <hi>private Christians,</hi> viz. at such times as they are by them charged with their Sins, and in a friendly way Admonished of them, or Reproved for them. In this case, (for I speak not now of that Confession of Sinnes, which is after a sort extorted, and drawn from a man by, or through trouble of Mind, and Conscience, in which Christians not onely may, but ought (when other means avail not) to repair either unto the <hi>Ministers</hi> of God, as most fit for such a purpose, being his <hi>Interpreters;</hi> or else to some wise and faithful Friend that is able to minister a word of Advice and Comfort to them, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and discovering their Sinnes unto them; even as the <hi>Sick man</hi> doth his secret troubles to his <hi>Physitian</hi> or <hi>Chirurgion.</hi> I speak not of this now; but onely of the Acknowledgement of Sin unto others, when it is charged upon them by way of <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi> or <hi>Reprehension.</hi> In this case (I say) the Soul that is truly Penitent for sin, will be ready to confess, and acknowledge it. So was it with <hi>David, Nathan</hi> no sooner cometh unto him, and chargeth his sin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, discovering to him the heinous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it, but presently he makes confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62640:72"/>
of it. <hi>I have sinned against the Lord,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 13. This would not <hi>Saul</hi> do. When <hi>Samuel</hi> cometh unto him in the like way, charging him with that act of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of his, in <hi>sparing Agag &amp; the best of the spoil,</hi> contrary to God's expresse Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; he was far from any such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous acknowledgment; but doth what he could to hide it, as we may see, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 13, 14, 15. Thus, wicked and ungodly men, being charged with their sins, they will either hide them by denying them, or defend them, or excuse them, or extenuate them what they can; it may be, falling out, and quarrelling with the persons that shall strike upon this string, medling with their sins. So did <hi>Cain</hi> with God himself, when the Lord came to him, and asked him where his Brother was, whom he had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he replieth, <hi>I know not: Am I my Brothers keeper?</hi> Gen. 4. 9. First, seeking to hide his sin, then quarrelling with his <hi>Maker,</hi> who came to charge it upon him. And even so are some (too many) ready to deal with the <hi>Ministers</hi> of God, when they come to touch upon their sins, whether publickly or privately, they are ready to quarrel with them about it, as if they took too much upon them. So did the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> upon whom the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other their great sins that they were guilty of, chargeth this as the chief, <hi>This</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:62640:72"/>
                  <hi>people are as they that strive with the Priest,</hi> Hos. 4. 4. They would endure no reproover, no, though it were a <hi>Priest,</hi> or <hi>Prophet,</hi> a Minister of God, that had Authoritie from him, to do what he did. Thus are some ready to oppose the Ministers of Christ, who, though they be their spiritual <hi>Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> yet they will not endure that they should meddle with their diseases; which if they do, it may be they will ever after hate and maligne them, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did <hi>Micaiah.</hi> And hating them, they will smite them with their tongues, and be ready to contrive what mischief against them they may. So did the <hi>Iews</hi> against their <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self sets it forth, <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, &amp;c. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.</hi> So is it with presumptuous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But it is far otherwise with those that are truely penitent. They being in themselves convinced of their sinnes, they will be ingenuous in the confessing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of them, when they are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon them by way of Admonition or Reprehension, whether by the Minister of God, or any other.<note place="margin">2. Openly and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And as they will be ready to do this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and privately, so also <hi>openly</hi> and <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely.</hi> And that<note place="margin">1. In a Regular way.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>In a Regular way,</hi> if called thereunto,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62640:73"/>
and required to do it by the <hi>Discipline and Authority of the Church.</hi> Thus did that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous Corinthian:</hi> being Excommunicated for that great sinne of his, he manifests his repentance, by acknowledging of his sinne, and by his abundant sorrow for it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, lest he should be surcharged and swallowed up therewith, the Apostle will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Church to forgive him, to receive him to Communion, and to comfort him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. And such a confession and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of sinne, sinners truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, (where the Censures of the Church are rightly dispensed according to Christs Institution) neither ought to be, nor yet will be, averse from, but ready to submit unto, that so they may give satisfaction to the Church, by the <hi>confession</hi> of their <hi>Sinnes,</hi> and <hi>profession</hi> of their <hi>Repentance,</hi> which they have, by their evil Example, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and scandalized.</p>

And in this kind and way, we shall find sinners truly penitent, to be forward, and ready, to acknowledge their sins: And, that both <hi>upon their Conversion,</hi> and <hi>after it.</hi>

To that purpose, compiling and penning that <hi>Penitential Psalm,</hi> Psal. 51. Which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and delivered to the <hi>Chief Musitian,</hi> (as the Title of the Psalm informs us), that by him it might be published in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and there ever after kept, and so be not only a <hi>Testimony</hi> of his Repentance to the Church in that present age, to which he desired to give Satisfaction, but a <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of it in all succeeding Ages, to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>And what <hi>David</hi> the Father did, the like<note place="margin">Solomon.</note> did <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son after him.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62640:74"/>
Book of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> wherein, he freely and ingenuously confesseth before all the world, the vanity and sinfulness of his former ways and courses. Thus did these two Kings, doing that voluntarily, which no power upon Earth could have compelled them to.</p>
               <p>And the same, did this our Apostle Saint<note place="margin">Paul.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul.</hi> Having been before his Conversion, an open and bitter Enemie to the Truth, speaking evil of the Doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and doing all the mischief that he could, to all that professed it; being Converted, and brought home to Christ, he was ever hereafter an <hi>Ingenuous Confessour.</hi> Having his former sins ever in his <hi>eye,</hi> he had them also (as I may say) at his <hi>tongues end,</hi> ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and acknowledg them upon all occasions. This we find him doing at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> before the <hi>Chief Captain,</hi> in a great and promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Assembly of all sorts of persons, <hi>I persecuted this way unto the death</hi> (saith he), <hi>binding, and delivering into prison, both men and women,</hi> Act. 22. 4. &amp;c.

Thus did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess his sins by word of mouth.</p>
               <p>And the like he did by <hi>Writing,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them under his hand, making a publick Record of them, that all the <hi>Churches</hi> of God might take notice of them. This he doth in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 9. and to his <hi>Galatians,</hi> Gal. 1. 13. And so here in this Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in this chapter, where we find him not onely making a <hi>general Confession,</hi> which he doth in the <hi>Text,</hi> charging himself to be the <hi>chief of sinners,</hi> but <hi>particularly,</hi> pointing out his sinnes what they were, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. <hi>I was a Blasphemer, a Persecutor, Injurious,</hi> &amp;c. Thus free and open was <hi>Paul</hi> in these acknowledgments, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding who or what they were, that took notice of these his consessions, whether Friends or Enemies, Good or Bad; nor caring how often he made them: taking all occasions to do it, as if he had thought he could never do it often enough.

the sinnes have been private, and secret, yet the acknowledgement of them ought to be publick, where the <hi>glory of God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it.

This was <hi>Paul's</hi> case in the Text. This acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his was <hi>spontaneous,</hi> and voluntary, he being induced thereunto by no other respect, but onely out of his desire to <hi>take shame to himself,</hi> and <hi>give glory to God.</hi> In special, the glory of his <hi>Grace,</hi> which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been so gloriously manifested in, and upon him, in receiving so great a sinner to Mercy, he desireth to take all occasions to extol and magnifie. And to that end it is, that he maketh such frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his sinnes; making such open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions and acknowledgements of them.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62640:76"/>
And upon this ground great Sinners spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, having tasted of the like Mercy in pardoning their sinnes, they will be ready upon all. occasions to acknowledge them, that so they may declare, and set forth the riches of Gods Grace exercised towards them. <hi>Come, and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my Soul</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) Psal. 66. 16. And thus a Penitent Sinner having tasted of saving Mercy, in the pardoning and healing of his Sinnes, he will be ready ever-after, to declare, and set forth, what God hath done for his Soul. To which end, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is offered, he will be forward in the confessing and acknowledging of his Sinnes.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>What kind of Acknowledgement is that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 2. What kind of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is that the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</note> 
                  <hi>which he maketh?</hi> That is the second Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion propounded. A Question of great consequence and importance, and that for the differencing and distinguishing of this from other false, and counterfeit Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements. Even wicked and ungodly men may, and sometimes do, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, confess and acknowledge their sinnes. So did, <hi>Cain; Mine iniquity is greater than it can be forgiven,</hi> (so our Margin readeth it, following <hi>Montanus,</hi> and others) <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13. So did <hi>Pharaoh; I have sinned</hi> (saith he to <hi>Moses</hi> once and again) <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 27. 10. 16. So did <hi>Saul. I have sinned against</hi>

                  <hi>the Lord</hi> (saith he to <hi>Samuel</hi>) 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 24. And so did <hi>Iudas. I have sinned in betraying innocent Blood,</hi> (saith he to the <hi>Chief Priests) Mat.</hi> 27. 4.) And the like, meer carnal men will sometimes be ready to do. Being charged, and pressed by the Ministers of God, or others, especially when the Hand of God lyeth Heavy upon them; now they will be ready to assent unto what <hi>Paul</hi> here saith of himself, confessing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be sinners, great sinners; yea, the <hi>chief of Sinners.</hi> Thus we may sometime meet with <hi>Pauls words,</hi> coming out of the mouths of those, who never knew what <hi>Paul's spirit</hi> meant. They will, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, acknowledge their sinnes, who never knew what it was to Repent of them. How then shall we distinguish betwixt the one, and the other? The acknowledgement of a sinner truly Penitent, and that which cometh from a spirit of Hypocrisie in a wicked, or carnal man?</p>
               <p>In Answer hereunto, let me present you<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A.</hi> Five Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a true acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> with some few <hi>properties</hi> of this sincere Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, whereby it may be discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that which is false and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit. In all which I shall still have an eye to the <hi>Confessor</hi> here in the Text, this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Apostle, illustrating each particular from his practice and example.<note place="margin">1. It is Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Free.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The acknowledgment of the true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sinner is (first) <hi>Voluntary,</hi> and <hi>Free.</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:62640:77"/>
So it is; though <hi>injoyned,</hi> yet not <hi>extorted,</hi> not constreined. Such is the <hi>Hypocrite's</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement for the most part: extorted and drawn from him against his will, either by some <hi>Iudgement of God,</hi> present or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, felt or feared; or by the <hi>Rack of a tormenting Conscience.</hi> Such was <hi>Pharaohs</hi> confession to <hi>Moses,</hi> drawn from him (as water is out of a Still, or Lymbick, by the fire put under it) by the Judgements of God, which he and his people lay under. And such was <hi>Iudas's</hi> confession to the Chief Priests, extorted from him by the rack (as I said) of a tormenting Conscience. In such cases, even the worst of men will sometimes confess and acknowledge their sinnes, which at other times, when their condition is quiet, and prosperous, they will hardly be brought to do; Like a man that is sick, being at Sea, and so emptieth his stomack freely; but no sooner comne a Shoar, but he is well again, and all is quiet. But it is otherwise with the <hi>True Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent.</hi> In acknowledging of sinne, he is a <hi>Volunteer,</hi> doing what he doth (as <hi>Peter</hi> would have <hi>Ministers</hi> to <hi>feed their flocks,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 2.) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>not by constraint, but willingly.</hi> Such are Gods People in all the services they do unto Him, or for Him; they are a <hi>willing people. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy Power,</hi> Psal. 110. 3. When God exerciseth his power,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62640:78"/>
the power of his Grace, upon a poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, changing and renewing him, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him home to himself, then he cometh unto him willingly, freely pouring forth his Soul before him in a voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and acknowledgement of his Sinnes. Willingly confessing unto <hi>God,</hi> and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly unto <hi>Men.</hi> And this he is ready to do, not onely in times of Distress, but even then when his condition is, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, most Comfortable. Such is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement which here we meet with in the Text. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he uttered these words, he was in a quiet and comfortable condition; under no distress, whether out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or inward, in body or mind; yet even then he remembred his sinnes, and remembring them, he acknowledgeth them. Which also, (as I have shewn) he was ready to do upon all occasions, at all other times. His readiness, and forwardness herein, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisesting, that these his Confessions were not extorted, but voluntary. <hi>Extorted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions</hi> (such as those upon the Rack) are seldom true; ever suspicious. True con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and acknowledgement, whether to God, or Man, will be free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</p>
               <p>And so (in the second place) <hi>Ingenuous</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Full.</note> 
                  <hi>and full.</hi> Such is not the <hi>Hypocrites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</hi> If he be drawn to an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his sinnes, yet therein you shall
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62640:78"/>
find him, for the most part, very <hi>partial,</hi> and <hi>sparing;</hi> as much as may be, conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and <hi>hiding</hi> them. Even as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith of the <hi>Sluggard,</hi> Prov. 19. 24. <hi>He hideth his hand in his bosome, and is loath to put it forth, to bring it to his mouth.</hi> Thus deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> with his <hi>sinnes:</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, his darling sinnes, he hideth them in his bosome, concealing them as much as may be, loath to bring them to his mouth, to bring them forth by an open acknowledgment of them. Where he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hide them, he will endeavour to <hi>excuse</hi> them; varnishing, and colouring them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with some fair and specious pretences. Where he cannot excuse them, he will seek to <hi>extenuate</hi> them, that they may not seem so great and foul as they are. Where he cannot excuse, or extenuate them, he will endeavour to <hi>evade</hi> them, by shifting them off from himself to some other. So little ingenuity is there to be found in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions. All these we shall find in that acknowledgment which <hi>Samuel</hi> drew from King <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. The Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, to charge upon him, that foul act of his, in sparing <hi>Agag,</hi> and the best of the Spoil, contrary to Gods express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; he first thinketh to hide his sin, by courting of the Prophet, and by his avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and boasting of his Obedience: <hi>Blessed be thou of the Lord,</hi> (saith he) <hi>I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi>

When this would not serve his turn, but he saw that his sinne was discovered, and found out, the Prophet convincing him of it, by too plain an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>What meaneth then this bleating of the Sheep in my ears, and the lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But see still how he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to mince and extenuate it, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that what he had done, he had done it through fear; <hi>I transgressed the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord and thy words, because I feared the people,</hi> &amp;c.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, when he could no longer plead, <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> he pleadeth his <hi>Pardon</hi> of Course (as it were): <hi>Now therefore,</hi> (saith he) <hi>I pray thee pardon my sin,</hi> Vers. 25. So far was <hi>Saul</hi> from any <hi>Ingenuity</hi> in this his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession! And so shall we still find it with <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> in their confessions and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments. Seldom or never is it, that they will deal plainly and simply, whether with <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Men</hi> in this case. But deal with both, as <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> did with the <hi>Apostles,</hi> Act. 5. 2. <hi>They come and bring the price of their possessions, which they had sold, and lay it down at the Apostles feet, But they kept back part of it.</hi> Thus dealeth the <hi>Hypoerite</hi> in his confessions. Being, it may be, drawn to it, he will come and bring his sins, and lay them down as it were
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62640:80"/>
at the feet of God and Men, in a seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humble confession and acknowledgment of them, but it is with some Reservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; still he keepeth back part of them, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and concealing some sins, or at least some Circumstances. But it is otherwise with the truly <hi>penitent sinner.</hi> He will be <hi>Ingenuous,</hi> confessing his sinnes, and not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, laying them open before God and Men, in their own colours; so giving Glory to God, and taking shame to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Such a <hi>Confessour</hi> was this our <hi>Apostle.</hi> In his confessions and acknowledgments how ingenuous was he? So we find him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing not only those sinnes wherein he was <hi>Principall;</hi> as, his procuring Letters from the Rulers, to Persecute the Saints, and his Executing that Commission to the full, with great fury and rage, yea, going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, which he sets forth (as I have shewen you) to the full, in those Texts fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 19. &amp; 26. 10; but even those, wherein he was any wayes <hi>Accessarie:</hi> As his consenting to the death of some of the Martyrs; <hi>When they were put to death, I gave my voice against them</hi> (so it there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the Text last named). And in particular, concerning the <hi>Proto-Martyr Stephen. And when the blood of thy Martyr Stephen was shed,</hi> (saith he) <hi>I also was stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by, and consenting to his death, and kept the rayment of them that slew him,</hi> Act. 22. 20.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62640:80"/>
Thus was he ready to confess what ever he had done in way of opposition against Christ, wherein he had had a hand or finger, been either Principal or Accessarie. So ingenuous was he in his acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi> And such will the acknowledgment of the truly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinner be, Ingenuous and Full.</p>

Such, for the most part, are the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments of Hypocrites, and of meer Carnal persons. They will (it may be) sometimes take up <hi>Paul's</hi> words here in the Text, confessing and acknowledging, that they are sinners, great sinners, but this is only in a general way, not with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon any particular sinne or sinnes, that they charge upon themselves. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, not unlike to King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who had <hi>dreamed a dream,</hi> and was much troubled about it, but when his <hi>wise Men</hi> came to ask him what it was, he could not give them any accompt of it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 5. Even so faieth it with many poor carnal wretches. In time of sickness, they will then (it may be) pretend at least to great trouble of minde for their sins, breaking forth into confessions and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they are sinners, great sinners, (the case is ordinarie): but come to ask them, What particular sinne or sinnes, they

are that trouble them, that lie so heavy upon their Consciences, this they cannot tell. Now, as for such a confession of sin; it may be looked upon but as a Dream, a Delusion, no true Confession. True Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession will be <hi>particular.</hi>

This is the confession of a true penitent sinner: though the tongue may utter that confession i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> general tearms, yet the heart even at the same time parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularizeth, having an eye to some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sinne, or sinnes, from which that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession immediately ariseth, and without which, it could not be a hearty confession.

               <p>And such again is the confession of the<note place="margin">4.

So may the Confessions of <hi>Papists,</hi> for the most part, be looked upon, which they make to their Priests, striking their hands upon their Breasts, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>Mea culpa, mea culpa; My sinne, my sinne;</hi> whilst their Hearts (it may be) are not affected with what they make shew of. And such, and no better, it is to be feared, are the acknowledgements of some, and not a few among us, in the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes, which they make in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Congregation. Therein <hi>they draw nigh unto God with their Mouth, and honour him with their Lips,</hi> (as the Lord saith of his people the Jewes, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 13.) <hi>Offering up the Calves of their lips unto him,</hi> (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaks, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 2.) in saying after the Minister, repeating the words of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. But in the mean time their hearts are far removed, and estranged from him,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62640:82"/>
being no wayes affected with what their Tongues utter, and pronounce. And even so is it, in their <hi>private Confessions.</hi> They make them but a <hi>Lip-labour.</hi> It may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king use of some Set-form, composed by themselves, or others, they only repeat the words in a Formal, and Customary way, but without any inward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> affection; their Hearts not being touched with the sense and feeling of what their Tongues utter, and confesse.

               <p>Take but one more, and that briefly.<note place="margin">5. Filial.</note> Being thus <hi>Cordial,</hi> it is also <hi>Filial.</hi> Such is the Confession which he maketh to his <hi>God;</hi> not <hi>servile.</hi> Such is the confession of the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> oft-times, a <hi>servile,</hi> a slavish confession, the fruit not of <hi>love</hi> to God, but of <hi>fear;</hi> and that not of a <hi>Reverential,</hi> but a <hi>Slavish</hi> fear. Such was <hi>Balaams</hi> Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he maketh, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 31, 34. when he saw <hi>the Angel stand before him with a drawn Sword,</hi> then he cryeth out, <hi>I have sinned.</hi> And so it is with some wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ungodly wretches, being in a strait, (as he was), stopped in their course; the Angel of the Lord meeting them; (as he did him) with a drawn Sword, some Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God threatning them, it may be, Death it self staring them in the face, so as
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62640:83"/>
they apprehend themselves ready to drop into Hell; now they will confess, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg their sinnes. But this they do not out of any love to God, or hatred of their sins, but meerly out of a slavish fear: It may be in a <hi>despairing way,</hi> as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> did. Now, in this the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of a true penitent sinner dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers; that, is a <hi>filial acknowledgment:</hi> Such was that of the <hi>Prodigal Son,</hi> who cometh unto his Father, as a Father; making his Confession to him under that Notion, <hi>Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and in thy sight,</hi> Luk. 15. 21. And thus the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sinner comes unto his God, confessing his sinnes unto him, not simply, as to a <hi>Iudge,</hi> from whom he expects nothing but severity of Justice, (as <hi>Achan</hi> did his sinne to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> Josh. 7. 20.) but as unto a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> with some apprehensions of mercy. Thus are the confessions of a truly penitent sinner, ordinarily attended and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with some apprehension of mercy; (I say), either with the present sense of it, as <hi>Pauls confession</hi> here was, to which he subjoynes, <hi>But I obteined mercy.</hi> Or with the <hi>hope</hi> of it: So runs that confession, which <hi>Shecaniah</hi> there maketh, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 2. <hi>We have transgressed, &amp;c. Yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.</hi>
               </p>

and acknowledgment of the truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sinner, be discerned from that which is false and counterfeit. And so you have both these <hi>Questions</hi> resolved. That which now remains of this, is the <hi>Application.</hi> Which I shall direct, (as in the former Branch) onely two wayes, by way of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, Exhortation.</hi>
               </p>

                  </note> such a Confessor, so forward and ready in such a way, to confesse and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his sinnes, both to God and Man; how many then from hence may be convinced, that they are as yet, none of this number; that they are as yet in a state of impenitency; that they are as yet in their sinnes, lying under the guilt and power of them? Diverse sorts there are, who come within the verge and compass of this <hi>Conviction.</hi> Let me take notice of some of them. Which whilest I do, let me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you, all of you, to go along with me, trying and examining your selves, whether you be not of this number.<note place="margin">1. Such as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of sin.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the first place, Some there are, who do not, as yet, <hi>know themselves to be sinners;</hi> they were never convinced of their sinnes, never convinced of the sinfulness of their nature, never convinced of any such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable evils, whether in their hearts or lives, as should need any such serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and acknowledgment. So is it with
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62640:84"/>
some morall <hi>civil Iusticiaries,</hi> whose lives not having been stained, with such open, such foul and scandalous sinnes as they see in others; hereupon they are well opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated of themselves. They are not <hi>as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are,</hi> (as the <hi>Pharisee</hi> said of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 11.) no Swearers, no Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, no Adulterers, &amp;c. so as they scarce see wherein they are sinners, much less great sinners. Very far are they from making any such confession and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of their sinnes, as <hi>Paul</hi> here doth of his. Now, as for such, let them know, that not having as yet been convinced of their sinnes, they must needs be in them, lying under the power, and under the guilt of them. This is the first work that the Spirit of God worketh in the heart of a regenerate person. It is to him, a <hi>Spirit of Conviction; when the comforter is come,</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>he shall reprove</hi> (or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>the world of sin,</hi> Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. 8. This is the work of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and it is the <hi>first</hi> work. Certainly, the Soul which never yet knew what this work meant, must needs be far from any such ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acknowledgment, as here we meet with in the Text. <hi>Paul,</hi> before he came to make this confession, that he was <hi>the chief of sinners,</hi> he had <hi>seen a light from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven shining round about him; and falling, to the earth, he heard a voice saying unto him,</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:62640:85"/>
                  <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi> (as we have the story) <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 3, 4. He had a strong, a clear, and powerful Conviction, discovering to him, and throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing him of, the evil of that course which he then took. And thus must it be with every poor sinner. Before ever he will be brought to an ingenuous confession and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his sinnes, he must see a light from Heaven, discovering them to him; and he must hear a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, convincing him of the sinfulness of them; and he must be struck down to the earth, humbled in the sense of his own Vilenesse, before ever his heart will be brought to such a frame and temper, as here we find in this our Apostle; to be ready thus to confess and acknowledg his sinnes, both to God and Man, upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions. Certainly, they who never yet knew what this Spirit of <hi>Conviction</hi> meant, are as yet, far from being ingenuous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours, and consequently, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude themselves to be in a state of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency.<note place="margin">2. Such as being convin ced, will not be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the second place; Another sort there are who have been convinced of their sins, which yet, they will not be brought to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess</hi> and <hi>acknowledge.</hi> Convinced (I say) they have been, being guilty (it may be) of some foul, open, and scandalous sinnes, whereof they have been convinced, not
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62640:85"/>
onely by the light of the <hi>Word,</hi> but even by the light of <hi>Nature;</hi> which light is sufficient to make a discovery of some, of many sinnes, specially of those against the second Table. This is the <hi>work of the Law, written in the hearts of men,</hi> (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15.) which whilest it directs them to many <hi>Duties,</hi> it cannot but convince them of many <hi>Sinnes. Rectum est index sui &amp; obliqui.</hi> Yet, for all this, they will not be brought to a confession and acknowledgment of what they cannot but be convinced of. No, though charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by the Ministers of God, again and again, yet for all that, they will not be brought to confess their sinnes; no,<note place="margin">Not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</note> not so much as unto God. Is it not the case of some, of many profane wretches? (I wish there may be none of them within the hearing of it, or, if there be, that it may sink into their hearts); They are such as cannot but be convinced of their sinful wayes and courses, being (as the Apostle saith of obstinate Hereticks, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 11.) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>self-condemned; their own consciences bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing them,</hi> (as he speaks of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 2. 15.) their sinnes being of a horrid nature, staring them in the face (as it were); yet for all that, the time is yet to come, that ever they should go into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, there to <hi>spread their sinnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:62640:86"/>
                  <hi>him,</hi> (as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did <hi>Senacheribs</hi> blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Letter, <hi>Isa.</hi> 38.) to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at his footstool, by confessing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging their sinnes. This is a course, a practise, which they are meer strangers to, never yet knew what it meant.</p>
               <p>And not confessing their sinnes unto<note place="margin">Much less to Men.</note> God, they are very farre from acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them unto <hi>Men;</hi> from whom their main care is to <hi>hide</hi> them, (as <hi>Achan</hi> did his <hi>Wedge of Gold,</hi> and <hi>Babylonish Garment,</hi> which he hid in his <hi>Tent, Iosh.</hi> 7. 22). And if they be found out, and charged upon them, What do they then? Why either <hi>deny</hi> them, (as <hi>Gehazi</hi> did his running after <hi>Naman</hi> to receive a reward from him, which his Master <hi>Elisha</hi> had refused; when his master asked him, <hi>Whence comest thou? he said, Thy servant went no whither,</hi> 2 King. 5. 25.) so adding sinne unto sinne. Or else <hi>excuse,</hi> it may be <hi>defend,</hi> what they have done. By no means they will be brought to take the blame and shame of Sinne to themselves. Let such take notice how farre they are from <hi>Pauls</hi> disposition, who upon all occasions shews himself for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ready, to confess and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge against himself his former sinnes; that so, taking shame to himself, he might give Glory to God. Never was he more ready to take unto himself the <hi>praise</hi> of his <hi>good deeds</hi> when he was a <hi>Pharisee,</hi> than now
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62640:86"/>
he is to take both the <hi>blame</hi> and <hi>shame</hi> of his <hi>evil ones,</hi> being a <hi>Christian.</hi> Certainly the Soul that will not be brought to the confessing, and acknowledging of those sinnes whereof it is convinced, must needs<note place="margin">3. Such as confess, but not truly.</note> be in a state of Impenitency, lying under the power, and guilt of sinne.</p>
               <p>A third sort there are, (I shall hasten what I may) who it may be at some times, and upon some occasions, will confess and<note place="margin">False Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tried by a five<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</note> acknowledge their sinnes; but their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements are not <hi>sincere,</hi> but <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical,</hi> and counterfeit. And such they will appear to be, if brought to the <hi>Test,</hi> tryed by the Touchstone of that five-fold <hi>Property</hi> which I have held forth to you.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Either they are not <hi>Voluntary,</hi> and<note place="margin">They are not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted.</note> free, but extorted. They will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess but when they are brought to the <hi>Rack;</hi> never but when they are in some Strait, having some Judgement of God lying upon them, or threatning them. Then, it may be, God and Men shall hear of them, and from them, then they will confess against themselves. Whereas at other times they are wholly silent in this way.</item>
                  <item>2. Or else (in the second place) there is<note place="margin">Not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</note> no <hi>ingenuity</hi> in their Confessions. And thence is it, that, if they be drawn to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, and acknowledge ought against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they deal very partially, hiding their
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62640:87"/>
sinnes what they may, seeking to excuse, colour, extenuate, shift them off to others (as you have heard) not willing to lay them forth open and naked, and so to deal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly either with God or Man. Still they will be keeping back part.</item>
                  <item>3. Or (thirdly) their Confessions are<note place="margin">Only ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</note> onely in the gross, in a <hi>general way,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any distinct reflection upon any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular sins, which draws from them that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement.</item>
                  <item>4. Or (in the fourth place) they are<note place="margin">Verbal, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</note> meerly <hi>verbal,</hi> and <hi>formal,</hi> without any true inward sense and feeling of the sinnes which they confess, and acknowledge.</item>
                  <item>5. Or else (in the last place) what they<note place="margin">In a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing way.</note> do, is altogether in a <hi>despairing way,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either sense, or hope of Mercy.</item>
               </list>
               <p>All these (as I have showen you) they are evidences of a false and counterfeit Acknowledgment. And yet such, and no better, are the Confessions which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part (it is to be feared) do rest contented<note place="margin">4. Such as in stead of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing, make Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their sins, boasting in them.</note> with. Never regarding to get their hearts brought to such a <hi>voluntary, ingenuous, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, cordial,</hi> and <hi>filial</hi> Acknowledgment, as might evidence to themselves, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the truth of their Repentance.</p>
               <p>There is yet a fourth sort, and that is the worst of all, such as will make <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> (or rather <hi>Profession</hi>) of their sinnes, but not as <hi>sinnes;</hi> not confessing them with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

and shame, with indignation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, with a serious purpose and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of forsaking and abandoning of them, (as the true Penitent doth) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther boasting of them, and glorying in them. I wish there were none such to be found among Christians at this day; such as glory in their sinnes; which they shew not, as <hi>Beggars</hi> do their <hi>Soars,</hi> to move pity and compassion in the Beholders, but as <hi>Souldiers</hi> do their <hi>Wounds</hi> and <hi>Skars</hi> which they have received in some honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Service; accounting it their Honour, their Glory, that they have been the <hi>chief of sinners.</hi> Such monsters of Men there have been, and I fear yet are, men so hardned in their sinful wayes and courses; so far given over to that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate minde,</hi> (as the Apostle saith of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 1. 28.) so far <hi>past all sense and feeling,</hi> (as he saith of some, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 19.) as that they are not ashamed to declare their sinnes. <hi>They declare their sinne as Sodom</hi> (as the Prophet saith of the People of the <hi>Iews,</hi> Isa. 3. 9.): Making their boast thereof, as those <hi>Idolaters</hi> did of their <hi>Idols,</hi> Psal. 97. 7. And as <hi>Lamech</hi> did of his Cruelty and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 23, 24. Yea, it may be, boast of that which they never did.

There, those damned Souls, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62640:88"/>
and cry out of their sinnes, and curse the time that ever they committed them. As for boasting of them, glorying in them, they are far from it. Now, as for such, let them know, that this their boasting, their glorying, (shall I speak it in the Apostle's Language to his <hi>Corinthians</hi> in another case, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6.) <gap reason="foreign">

(Hear, and tremble at it, you, who stand in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree guilty in this kind). <hi>They declare their sinne as Sodom, and they hide it not,</hi> (saith the Prophet, speaking of the <hi>Iews</hi> in the Text forecited, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 9. As they shewed it in their <hi>deeds,</hi> so they spared not to publish it with their <hi>tongues,</hi> not in way of <hi>confession,</hi> as <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 32. 5. but in a way of <hi>profession</hi> as <hi>Lamech,</hi> Gen. 4. 23, 24. (as our new Annotator explains it). Thus did they declare their sinnes as <hi>Sodom,</hi> as the men of <hi>Sodom;</hi> who openly professed, what they commonly practised or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But what follows? <hi>Woe unto their souls, for they have rewarded evil to themselves:</hi> By these wicked courses, they draw down the Vengeance of God upon their own heads. Oh, far be this from any one of us! The shameful parts of the body, nature teacheth to hide and cover them. If any shall be so immodest as to discover them to open

view, we should presently conclude him to be either mad or drunk, not himself. What is it then to uncover the nakedness, and filthiness of the Soul? And not onely to uncover it, but to boast of it, to glory in it. As for such, well may we say of them, what the Apostle doth of those voluptuous <hi>belly Gods,</hi> Phil. 3. 19. that <hi>their glory is their shame.</hi> So is it now, and so they shall find it another day, at that great day, when (as he there saith of them) <hi>Destruction shall be their end. Paul,</hi> confessing his sinnes here in the Text, he doth it openly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and Men, but he doth it upon another account, <hi>viz.</hi> That he might take the shame of them to himself.</p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62640:93"/>
to know what sinne is, and what is sinne. Now, this knowledge is not to be attained, but by and from the <hi>Law. By the Law, is the knowledge of sinne,</hi> (saith the Apostle) Rom. 3. 20. <gap reason="foreign">

For, [1st.], it will not discover <hi>all sinnes.</hi> Sinnes against the <hi>Second Table</hi> it may, but not so many of them against the <hi>First Table;</hi> which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the greatest sinnes. <hi>Grosse</hi> sinnes it may, not other. <hi>Actual</hi> sinnes it may, which are the <hi>Branches;</hi> but not <hi>Original</hi> sinne, which is the <hi>Root</hi> of all sinne.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62640:94"/>
is not enough for a Christian to have the light of the Word shining round about him, to have a general knowledge of sinne, but he must be particularly convinced of his own sinnes.

Thus did <hi>Paul,</hi> he brought himself, his heart and life to the <hi>Law,</hi> and by that means, he came not onely to attain the knowledge of sinne in a general way, but to see his own sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the sinfulness of his Nature, and the sinfulness of his Life; as his former sinnes acted before his Conversion, so the <hi>Body of sinne,</hi> which still remained in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and so by that means, brings him to that Confession which there he made, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.</p>

Such a one was this our Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> (as the same Author there taketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, paralleling him with <hi>Peter,</hi> in this confession which here he maketh). Notwithstanding that before his Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was morally blameless in his life and

conversation, and now an eminent Saint; yet he passeth this Censure upon himself, that he was, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>chief of Sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And such Censurers shall we find other of the Saints of God to have been, severe in censuring of themselves. Hence is it, that in their Confessions and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements we shall find them aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their sinnes to the heighth, indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring what they could to express and set forth the Heinousness, the Greatness of them. So we find <hi>David</hi> confessing and acknowledging of that sinne of his, in Numbering of the People, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. His heart smiting him for what he had done, he breaks forth into the Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, confessing that he had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not onely sinned, but greatly sinned. <hi>And David said unto the Lord, I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned greatly in that I have done.</hi> And what was it that he had done? Why, he had caused the People, through his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to be numbered; to have a Muster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role taken of all those that were fit to bear Armes, if occasion should require it. And what, Was this so great a Sinne? In appearance it was not, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more than what, out of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick respect, he might do; and what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before him (in likely-hood) had frequently and usually done. But <hi>David,</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:62640:97"/>
knowing his own heart, and being privy to his own intentions and aimes in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he did; that he had done it, not onely out of a Vain curiosity, when as there was no need that he should do it, but also out of a principle of Pride, and carnal confidence, having therein made flesh his Arm, trusting in the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his People; hereupon he not onely confesseth the sinne, but censureth it as a very great sinne; withall censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himself to have therein done foolishly, very foolishly, as it followeth in the close of that Verse, <hi>I have done very foolishly.</hi> However, in this action, I seemed to my self to have been very prudent and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick; yet now I see that it was no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than extream folly, seeing I swerved out of the way of thy Commandements, through pride, and carnal confidence.</p>
               <p>And not unlike is that other confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his, which he maketh in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Uriah, Psal.</hi> 51. where he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in express tearms acknowledgeth the Fact which he had done, his <hi>going into Bathsheba,</hi> (as he calleth it in the Title of the Psalme) his committing Adultery with her; but he aggravateth it to the full, setting forth the Foulness and Hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of it, which he doth by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of words about it, calling it <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Transgression, Sinne, Evil;</hi> an exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62640:97"/>
of words, serving and tending to the aggravation of his sinne. Withal, he accuseth and condemneth himself before God, for that sinne, clearing, and justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, as touching what he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, in taking away his <hi>Child;</hi> so also, touching what he had threatned by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> that he would do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>viz.</hi> That, <hi>the Sword should never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his house,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 10. And so touching whatsoever else he should please to do unto him, however he should punish him or his, yet, still he acknowledgeth, how he had deserved all, justifying of God. This we shall find in the fourth verse of that Psalm, where confessing how he had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in sinned against God, <hi>Against thee, thee onely have I sinned, and done this evill-in thy sight;</hi> he subjoyneth, <hi>That thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest</hi> Which words are commonly (and I think not amiss) looked upon as a <hi>Reason,</hi> why he thus made this confession to his God, <hi>viz.</hi> That he might give unto him the glory of his Justice, in what ever he had spoken and threatned against him, or in what ever judgments and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he should lay and inflict upon him. Such a <hi>severe Censurer</hi> was <hi>David</hi> of his own sinnes, and of himself for them.</p>
               <p>And the like shall we find in diverse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; As in <hi>Daniel,</hi> who confessing his own,

and the peoples sinnes, <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Then he cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures himself, and them for them, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging what they had justly deserved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, even shame and confusion of face; <hi>O Lord</hi> (saith he), <hi>righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day,</hi> v. 7. which he repeats again in the verse follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with some amplifications. <hi>O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our Kings, to our Princes, and to our Fathers, because we have sinned against thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such a confession of sinne it is that King <hi>Solomon</hi> prescribes unto all penitent sinners, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 47. <hi>If they shall repent, and make supplication unto thee, saying, We have sinned, and done perversly, we have committed wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, &amp;c.</hi> As if he should say, We cannot sufficiently express, how heinous our sins are. And such confession, being truly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, they will be ready to make, We see it in the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> upon his return to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 21. <hi>Father</hi> (saith he), <hi>I have sinned against Heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi> Where see, how he first aggravateth his fault, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62640:98"/>
that in what he had done, he had sinned against <hi>Heaven,</hi> that is, against God, who dwelleth in the Heavens; not onely against his earthly Father, whom he had immediately offended, by his lewd and extravagant courses, but also against his Heavenly Father, whose Laws he had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed. Then he passeth Censure upon himself, adjudging and acknowledging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, worthy to be cast off by his Father, unworthy to be any longer owned by him, as his Son, <hi>I am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi> So far was he from excusing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or from any wayes mincing, or exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating what he had done. What ever others might think of it, who might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to the levitie of his youth, and so make leight of it, he censures it, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for it, as deserving not onely a frown, or a check from his Father, but an utter ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication and abjection. So severe will true Penitents be, in Censuring of their own sinnes, and themselves for them. Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon themselves: as vile unworthy wretches.

The face which a man seeth in the water, or in a glass, it is in all points like unto his own, of the same feiture, colour, complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.

                  </gap>, <hi>There is no difference</hi> (or <hi>distinction), all have sinned, and come short of the Glory of God.</hi> That is, (as some expound it, and as we find these words [<hi>the Glory of God</hi>] used by the same Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7.) having all alike sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> they are alike deprived of the <hi>Image of God,</hi> wherein man was at the first Created, consisting in Holiness and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes; and consequently, all alike infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Original Corruption, which is the <hi>Image of Satan,</hi> all alike disfigured and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.

These he knoweth better than he doth the sinnes of any others. Many sins he must take notice of in others, but of more in himself. <hi>Mine iniquities are more than the hairs of my head,</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) Psal. 40. 12. This a man may say of himself, rather than of another, being (as the Penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is) a diligent and constant observer of himself, observing his daily slips and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, his daily commissions and omissions, which he cannot do in another. In others, he taketh notice onely of their <hi>open</hi> sinnes, in himself, of his <hi>secret</hi> sinnes; which, as they are more in number, so they may be more heinous in nature than the open sinnes of others. And besides, observing his own sinnes, he knoweth the nature and quality of them, better than he can do of the sins of others. In others, he taketh notice of the outward <hi>Acts</hi> of such or such sinnes, seeing them, or hearing of them; but in himself, he taketh notice also of the <hi>circumstances</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying<note place="margin">The pe nitent sinner weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his own <hi>sins.</hi>
                  </note> his own sinnes, which many times exceedingly do aggravate them. So as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he doth but guess at the greatness of other mens sinnes, judging them by the outward
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62640:100"/>
appearance, he Weigheth his own. Even as the Lord is said to weigh the wayes of men, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 7. <hi>Thou most upright doest weigh the path of the just.</hi> Pondering all their goings, (as the <hi>Wiseman</hi> saith of him), <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>The wayes of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings.</hi> Taking exact notice of all their <hi>Actions,</hi> weighing them, as <hi>Hannah</hi> hath it in her Song, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>The Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him Actions are weighed.</hi> And as their <hi>Actions,</hi> so their <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Spirits. The Lord weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Spirits</hi> (saith the <hi>Wiseman</hi>), Prov. 16. 2. repeated, cap. 21. 2. Like as the <hi>Goldsmith</hi> that weigheth his Gold, he taketh exact notice of every grain; so doth God ponder and weigh all the actions, words, and thoughts of Men, as their good works, so their sinnes; taking notice of every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance that may make them either light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or heavier, extenuate or aggravate them. And thus doth the true penitent sinner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to weigh and ponder his own sinnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering not onely the sinnes themselves, but the circumstances wherewith they are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which oft-times are great aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And so by putting these grains into his own ballance, which he cannot do in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers, his own sinnes in his apprehension, come to weigh down the sinnes of others; though haply in themselves not so heavy as others. Thus is he better acquainted with

And hence is it, that he cometh to be so cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious towards himself, judging his own sinnes more, and greater than the sinnes of others; and so himself, a greater sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than others.<note place="margin">

               <p>Besides this, (in the second place) as he seeth and weigheth his own sinnes, so he <hi>feeleth</hi> them; Which he doth not the sinnes of others. The sinnes of others he taketh notice of by the Eye, or Ear; either by hear-say, or at the most being an eye-witness of them, and so knoweth them onely by speculation, but his own sinnes he feeleth them. Feeling the <hi>Body of sinne</hi> stirring in him, even as <hi>Rebecca</hi> selt the two twins stirring and striving in her Womb, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 22. thus doth he feel Corruption striving and struggling with Grace (of which <hi>Paul</hi> complains, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.) Besides, he feeleth his <hi>Actual sinnes,</hi> which, it may be, lye heavy upon his Soul. As <hi>David</hi> saith his sinnes did upon him. <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 12. <hi>Mine iniquities</hi> (saith he) <hi>have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;</hi> which may be understood, not onely of

the Judgements of God, which then lay upon him, whereof his sinnes were the cause, but even of his sinnes themselves, which lay heavy upon his Soul. And so is it in measure with all true Penitent sinners, they are such as either do feel, or have felt the weight and burden of their sinnes, being <hi>weary, and heavy laden</hi> with them, as our Saviour giveth a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, such as labour under the sense of sinne, feeling it lying upon them as an intolerable burden. And this again maketh them think their own sins greatest. So it did <hi>Paul</hi> here (as you have heard). He saw and heard of the sinnes of others, but they did not lie upon him as his own did, and therefore he judgeth himself to be the <hi>chief of sinners.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62640:102"/>
mean time, they are very ready to censure others. As for others, none are more censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of them than they, very quicksighted they are, in prying into their lives, nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts, ready to censure both, and that most severely, nay, rigidly and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably. Ready to pass a sharp censure upon the <hi>moates,</hi> the least infirmities and failings which they spie in others. And not onely censuring the <hi>faults,</hi> (which they do beyond all proportion of merit), but the persons also for the faults sake, condemning them for <hi>Hypocrites.</hi> But, in the mean time, they are gross flatterers of themselves. Not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spying the beams in their own eyes, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking many gross evills in themselves, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding themselves, as if all were well with them, and that there were nothing in them that should deserve a Censure. Such were the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of old, none more ready to censure others than they. So did he the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> in the Gospel, blessing God, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was not such a one as he, and others were. <hi>God I thank thee,</hi> (saith he) <hi>I am not as other men are,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or even as this Publican,</hi> Luk. 18. 11. And thus is it with many, too many, they are very quicksighted towards others. As it is observed of the most raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and mischievous birds, birds of prey, they are usually most quicksighted: So is it with the worst and wickedest of men, none more ready to find fault with others, whilest
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62640:103"/>
they see none in themselves. Now as for such, let them take notice how far they are from the temper and disposition of this our <hi>Apostle</hi> here in the Text. <hi>Paul,</hi> whilest he was <hi>Saul a Pharisee,</hi> no question he thought as well of himself as any other, he was then, highly opinionated of his own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that he was not as others; if a sinner, yet not so great a sinner as others were. But now being brought home to Christ, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his eyes opened, he cometh to see more evil in himself, then in any other; whereupon he passeth this severe censure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself, that he was not onely a sinner, but a great sinner, yea, <hi>the chief of sinners.</hi> Certainly they, who do not see any thing in themselves that deserve a censure, and that a sharp one, they may well conclude, that as yet, they have not had their eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, they have little or no acquaintance with themselves. Did they but throughly know themselves, they would see so much at home, as would make them less censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous abroad. So is it with a truly gracious Soul; a truly penitent sinner, the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is, the more humble, the more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, the less censorious of others, where there may be any hope. The Story tells us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. of those <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> which brought that poor woman taken in the Act of <hi>Adultery</hi> before our Saviour, however, they were all of them guilty of the like, or
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62640:103"/>
of some as great sinnes as she was, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their shrinking and stealing away, after they had heard what our Saviour said to them, <hi>He that is without sinne among you, let him first cast a stone at her,</hi> vers. 7. <hi>Now they which heard it</hi> (saith the Text), <hi>being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by their own Conscience, went out one by one,</hi> vers. 9.) yet how harsh and rigid were they against her, as in accusing, so in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring of her; urging the Law, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that such should be stoned, which they would have speedily executed, without any further hearing. So rigid were they against her. But so was not our <hi>Saviour.</hi> However he himself <hi>knew no sinne,</hi> being free from all sinne, both Original and Actual; <hi>holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, undefiled, separated from sinners,</hi> (as the Apostle saith of him), <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. yet, see how mildely, how gently, how tenderly he was pleased to deal with her, telling her, that seeing there were no witnesses present, to prove what they charged her with, he would not condemn her, onely willing her to <hi>go away and sinne no more,</hi> Vers. 11. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, they who are so harsh, and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, in censuring &amp; condemning of others, either never considered, or else have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, what themselves are, or were. Which if they did but seriously think of, it would teach them that Lesson which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle willeth <hi>Titus</hi> to presse upon his <hi>Creti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and that upon this ground, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 2, 3.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62640:104"/>
                  <hi>Put them in mind</hi> (saith he) <hi>to speak evil of no man,</hi> (that is, not without just cause), <hi>but to be gentle, shewing meekness unto all men; For we our selves were sometimes foolish, disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, deceived, serving diverse lusts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</hi> This would make men more severe in censuring themselves than others.</p>
               <p>A second sort there are, who (it may be)<note place="margin">2. Such as are sparing in their <hi>censuring</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> will be content to pass a censure upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but they are very sparing in it. That they are sinners they will acknowledge, but what? <hi>Great sinners?</hi> not so, much lesse the <hi>chief of sinners.</hi> Here they will plead what they can for themselves, for the extenuating of their sinnes, and excusing of themselves; making use of diverse <hi>Pleas</hi> for that end and<note place="margin">Diverse Pleas made use of by such, for the extenuating of their sinnes.</note> purpose. I shall instance in three or four of the most usual.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though they be sinners, and have their<note place="margin">1. Others greater sinners than they.</note> faults, yet, they are not such as others are. There are others as bad, nay, worse than they. And to make this good, they single out some persons grosly scandalous, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themselves with them, blessing God that they are not so bad as they. Thus did the <hi>Pharisee</hi> even now spoken of, comparing himself with the <hi>Publican,</hi> one of the vilest sort of persons that then were. So were the <hi>Publicans</hi> accounted amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> being servants to the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose yoak the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62640:104"/>
                  <hi>Iews</hi> could not endure, Officers imployed by them, for the gathering in of their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, which they did for the most part with greatest rigour, grating upon the people, by exacting more than their due, and so making what advantage of their places they could. Hence it was that they came to be of so ill repute as they were, to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the worst of men. Thus we find <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners</hi> put together, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 10, 11. And elsewhere <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Harlots, Mat.</hi> 21. 31. intimating them to have been an infamous company. Now, with him doth the <hi>Pharisee</hi> there compare himself, as also with other notorious sinners. Which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he blesseth God that he was not so vile, as he and they. <hi>God I thank thee, I am not as other men are, Extortioners, Unjust, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, or even as this Publican,</hi> Luk. 18. 11. And the like are many, very ready to plead for themselves. Comparing themselves with persons notoriously scandalous, they applaud themselves in this, that they are not so bad as they, none of the <hi>chief of sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2d. A second Plea is, that if they be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,<note place="margin">2. They are but as others.</note> and great sinners, guilty (it may be) of some foul and scandalous sinnes, yet therein they are not alone, they are but as others, they have done no otherwise then some have done before them, and others will do after them. They are flesh and blood as well as others, and therefore, if they have
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62640:105"/>
fallen, they make the less of it, because it is a thing incident to all. And to this purpose, it may be, they will not spare to make use of Scripture, perverting and abusing it to their own destruction; which telleth them, how that <hi>in many things we offend all,</hi> Jam. 3. 2. And how <hi>the just man falleth seven times,</hi> i. e. often, as into sufferings, so into sinnes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 16. So as <hi>there is not a just man that doeth good, and sinneth not,</hi> Eccl. 7. 20. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, taking up the examples and instances of holy men, eminent Saints of God, whose sinnes stand upon Record in Scripture, some of them very foul and horrid, making use of them, if not for the excusing, yet for the extenuating of their own.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third of these Pleas is, Though they<note place="margin">3. They have sinned through infirmity</note> have fallen into such and such sinnes, yet they did it not willingly, out of any love or liking they had to the sinne, but through infirmity, being, it may be, entised and drawn into it by evil company, upon whom they are willing to transferre their sinnes, that they may shift them off from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. So <hi>Adam</hi> did his eating of the <hi>Apple,</hi> which he put upon his <hi>Wife, The Woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the Tree, and I did eat,</hi> Gen. 3. 12. And so did <hi>Saul</hi> his sparing of <hi>Agag,</hi> which he putteth upon the people, (as you have heard) 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 24.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:62640:105"/>4. A fourth and a last Plea, (to name no<note place="margin">4. They could not resist Sarans Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> more) is, They have fallen, and fallen foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but they could not help it, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by Satan, whose temptations were so strong, that they could not resist them, and so they would charge the fault rather upon him, than themselves. So did the <hi>Woman</hi> at the first, <hi>The Serpent beguiled me, and I did eat,</hi> Gen. 3. 13. And the like do these her children, by this means, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at least to extenuate their sinnes, as if they in the acting and committing of them, had been onely <hi>Instruments</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessories.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These, and many the like Pleas and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> sar from making use of any such Pleas.</note> do carnal men oft-times find out, making use of them, if not to defend, yet to extenuate their own sinnes, and so to excuse themselves, if not in whole yet in part; that so they may not seem so vile in their own eyes, as in truth they are. But in so doing, how unlike are they to the Apostle here in the Text? <hi>Paul,</hi> if he would have gone about such a work, the excusing or extenuating of his sinnes, how many Pleas might he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have taken up? He was not the first Persecutor, nor the onely Persecutor, no, nor yet the greatest Persecutor. There were then others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides him, and there had been others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, some of them as violent as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he had been. Besides, what he had
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62640:106"/>
done, he had done it out of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> not knowing what he did, nor Whom it was that he opposed. Nay, what he did, he did it out of Zeal for God. Besides, in what he did against the Church, he was instigated and set on by Satan, who rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed those Persecutions. And as by Satan, who had the chief hand in it, so by others his Instruments, who put him forward up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that work. But see how he layeth all these aside. However, he took notice of some, if not all of them; As of his Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, <hi>I did it Ignorantly:</hi> And of his good Intention, <hi>I verily thought with my self, that I ought to do many things, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Name of Iesus of Nazareth,</hi> Act. 26. 9. Yet, he is far from making any such use of them, but he chargeth his sinnes home upon himself, Censuring them, and himself for them; and that most severely, according as the nature of his sinnes required, acknowledging himself, to be the <hi>chief of sinners.</hi>
               </p>

7. 1. Which, let it be rightly and warily understood. Not but that Christians may censure the sinnes of others. This, <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> persons not onely may do, but ought to do, both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> whom God hath made <hi>Censores morum,</hi> Judges and Censurers of the manners of others; yea, and this may private Christians also in some cases lawfully do. In case the sinne be open and scandalous, they may censure and condemn it for a sinne in whomsoever it is, and that according to the nature of it. But being private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, let them be sparing in censuring of the persons of others, specially in censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them for such weaknesses and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities as they espie in them. Taking heed of being rash, or rigid, and uncharitable in their censures of others, whether of their <hi>Persons</hi> or <hi>Actions.</hi> Here let that of the Apostle take place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>Who art thou that judgest another mans servant?

Which, as it will be more safe, so more useful. Be we strict inquisitors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our own hearts and lives. Bring both to a scrutinie, and to a censure. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62640:107"/>
spare not to excercise our severity.</p>
               <p>Not that I would have Christians to be<note place="margin">Yet, not being rash, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigid in these censures.</note> 
                  <hi>over-harsh against themselves,</hi> so as to pass too rigid censures upon their own persons or actions. It is the <hi>Preacher's</hi> advice, (as you heard before), <hi>Be not wicked over much,</hi> Eccles. 7. 17. i. e. <hi>judicio tuo,</hi> in thine own judgment. An extream, which sometimes good and gracious Souls are subject to. Out of a deep apprehension which they have of their own sinnes, their weaknesses, and their wants, they are ready to passe harsh censures upon themselves, sometimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging themselves to be <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times charging upon themselves, that great and unpardonable sinne, <hi>the sinne against the Holy Ghost;</hi> which notwithstanding they are very farr from, being such as desire nothing more then to hearken to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Dictates thereof. In this, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians must be wary and tender; whilest they are not uncharitable towards others, they must take heed of being so to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. In the mean time, let them not forbeare to judge and censure themselves, to passe censure upon their own sinnes, their inward and secret corruptions, their outward and actual Transgressions, their sinful Commissions and Omissions. And herein let them be impartial, not conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at any thing in themselves, not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their own sinnes through false
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62640:107"/>
glasses, but beholding them as they are, let them passe a righteous judgment upon them, judging and censuring themselves for them, according to their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> demerit. And this let every of us be exhorted to do.</p>
               <p>Motives hereunto take one or two instead of many. 1. This is the next, and onely<note place="margin">

                  </note> way to <hi>prevent Gods Censures. If we would judge our selves, we should not be judged of the Lord</hi> (saith the Apostle to his <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31.

He who thus burdens himself, with charging his sins home upon himself; by so doing, he shall lighten the burden of sinne, that it will not lie so heavy upon his Soul, as otherwise it would. To be thus <hi>Heavy-laden,</hi> is the way to <hi>Rest, Mat.</hi> 11. 28. This is the way, the next way to <hi>obtein Mercy</hi> at the hands of God. It was the way which <hi>Benhadads</hi> servants took to find mercy from the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> to come to him <hi>with Ropes upon their heads,</hi> 1 King. 20. 31. So censuring and condemning themselves aforehand as Capital Offendors, having deserved death. No readier way to find Mercy at the hands of God, than for a man to be thus his own judge, and to be thus severe against himself. <hi>In quan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This is the next way to sue forth a Pardon. So <hi>David</hi> apprehended it, who maketh use of this as an <hi>Argument</hi> to move God to shew mercy to him, in the pardoning of his sinne, his acknowledging that he had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned greatly, and done very foolishly. <hi>Now,</hi>

                  <hi>beseech thee O Lord</hi> (saith he), <hi>take away the Iniquitie of thy servant, for I have done very foolishly,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 10. A strange Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument one would think to make use of, to such a purpose, to induce God to shew mercy to him, by aggravating his sinne in such a manner. Carnal reason would have thought it might have been a more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to have pleaded some excuse, and to have extenuated his sinne what he could. Not so, <hi>David</hi> apprehended this as the right way, and so he sound it; not to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to hide or extenuate, but to lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and to aggravate his sin to the height. In this the case is different betwixt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> Before <hi>men,</hi> offendors are oft-times acquitted by the means of such Pleas, and excuses as they make use of. It is not so with <hi>God.</hi> With him, <hi>he that covereth his sinne</hi> (seeketh to conceal it, or to excuse it), <hi>shall not prosper,</hi> (as the <hi>Wiseman</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us), <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. not prosper in his suit for mercy at the hands of God. Would we obtein mercy from him, do not deal deceitfully with him. But deal we impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially betwixt him and our own Souls, charging our selves home, in giving in our accounts to him. Not taking the like course that that unjust <hi>Steward</hi> in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel put his Masters debtors upon, in giving in their accounts unto him, that for an <hi>hundred,</hi> one shonld set down <hi>fifty,</hi> another
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62640:109"/>
                  <hi>eighty,</hi> (as we have it in the Parable) <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 6, 7. This we find there commended in him as a politick device, tending to his and their advantage; but so will it not be found in those that shall give in the like accounts to their God. Their diminishing will be an augmenting of their Debt. And therefore in this case deal we plainly, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our selves to the utmost. This is the onely way to procure a gracious, and full discharge from God.</p>
               <p>Let these few <hi>Motives</hi> suffice. To which<note place="margin">Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> I might also (as before) sub-join some <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,</hi> shewing you how Christians may attain unto this, to be such <hi>severe censurers</hi> of themselves. In order to which, the first work to be done, is, to <hi>get acquaintance with our selves;</hi> to know our own hearts and lives, to know our sinnes, what they are; how many, how great. To which end a serious, and frequent, examination is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite; taking special notice of our spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial sinnes, as <hi>Paul</hi> here did of his. And, knowing them, to feel them; specially to feel that <hi>Body of sinne</hi> within us, that mass of corruption, which virtually conteins in it the Seeds of all sinnes. By this means we shall come to see that in our selves, which will make us ready to pass such a severe censure upon our selves, as <hi>Paul</hi> here doth, That we are sinners, great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, even <hi>the chief of Sinners.</hi> But I shall

not proceed any further in the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this useful <hi>Observation,</hi> which hath taken me up a great deal more time than I intended to have bestowed upon it, when I first took it up.</p>
               <p>There is yet one thing behind, wherein<note place="margin">These words looked upon in reference to the former.</note> I shall be Brief. I have hitherto looked upon these words of the Apostle, as simply considered in themselves. It yet remains, that I should look upon them in a <hi>relative</hi> way. This I gave a touch upon, and but a touch, in my entering upon them. Let me now do it a little more fully, looking upon them, as relating to what went before, to the words immediately foregoing; <hi>Christ Iesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief:</hi> That is, One, and a chief one, of those sinners whom he came to save. Thus doth he bring home that <hi>general Doctrine,</hi> (as before I shewed you) making it his own by a <hi>particular Application.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<note place="margin">

                  </gap>ine of the Gospel, the Doctrine of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Jesus Christ, to know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that Christ came into the world to save sinners; but thus to bring it home to themselves, making it their own by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Application. This are they to do, (as you have heard before) by all such Truths as they meet withal in the Book of God;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62640:110"/>
                  <hi>Precepts, Prohibitions, Exhortations, Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, Consolations;</hi> that they may be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto them, they are in such a way, to bring them home to themselves. And this they are to do in speciall by this saving <hi>Truth,</hi> upon the right knowledg whereof, depends their everlasting Salvation; <hi>This is life eternal, that they may know thee, the onely true God, and him whom thou hast sent, Iesus Christ,</hi> John 17. 3. That it may be saving to those that hear it, it must be brought home by such a <hi>particular Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Such an Application doth this our Apostle make of it, as here in the Text, so elsewhere; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>The life which I now live in the flesh, I live</hi> (saith he) <hi>by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</hi> Not onely <hi>who gave himself for us,</hi> (as elsewhere he speaketh), <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. <hi>Who was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for our Offences, and rose again for our Iustification;</hi> that is, for us <hi>men</hi> in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, us <hi>believers</hi> in Special, but for <hi>me</hi> in Particular. Thus doth he apply the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Christs death and passion to himself in particular; and the like are all true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sinners to do</p>
               <p>This is <hi>true Faith,</hi> that faith whereby a<note place="margin">

                     </gap>aith,</hi> (saith the Apostle), Rom. 3. 28. And what faith is this? Why, faith in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62640:110"/>
Jesus Christ, <hi>The faith of the Son of God,</hi> (as he calls it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20.) believing in him, on him. Such a faith it is that Christ cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for at the hands of his Disciples, <hi>Ye believe in God, believe also in me,</hi> Joh. 14. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Believe on me.</hi> And such a faith it is that God commandeth at the hands of all. <hi>This is his Commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son Iesus Christ,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 23. which is done by applying his merits to our selves.</p>
               <p>And again, as a Christian is hereby justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,<note place="margin">2. Hereby a Christian liveth upon earth.</note> so it is hereby that he liveth. That he liveth here upon earth. <hi>The just shall live by his faith</hi> (saith <hi>Habukkuk,</hi> cap. 2. vers. 4.) His faith in God's word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. This is the <hi>Anchor</hi> which he rides by in all storms and stresses which here come down upon him, his Faith resting upon the promises of God; specially upon this great promise, the promise of Life and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Christ. So <hi>Paul</hi> lived, as he there telleth us, <hi>The life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</hi> Whilest he lived in this frail mortal body, (for so are we to understand that his <hi>liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the flesh,</hi> not his living after a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and fleshly manner, but his living a natural life here upon earth) this life he now lived, <hi>by the faith of the Son of God,</hi> resting and relying upon him, in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states and conditions, committing himself
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62640:111"/>
unto him, and by his Faith, drawing Ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tue from him, whereby he was inabled to live unto him, to live a <hi>spiritual life</hi> whilest he was yet in the flesh.</p>
               <p>And as a Christian liveth by this faith<note place="margin">3. Hereby he shall live here after.</note> here, so it is by this faith that he shall live <hi>hereafter.</hi> Understand it rightly. Not that he shall so live by it in Heaven, as here he doth upon Earth. No, here we live by <hi>faith,</hi> there by <hi>sight,</hi> (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7.) seeing and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what now by faith we hope for. But this is the onely way and means to bring us unto Eternal life, thus to believe in, and on, Jesus Christ. <hi>God so loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him,</hi> (or <hi>on him,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) <hi>should not perish, but have everlasting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. This is the true and only sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, <hi>Believe on the Lord Iesus, and thou shalt be saved,</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Iai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi>) Act. 16. 31. But I shall not enlarge upon it. Briefly, by way of <hi>Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

Jesus Christ, as that he was the Son of God, made man, and that he came into the world to save sinners, &amp;c.

               <p>Which let not us do, Let not us rest in such a general faith, but as we desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any benefit from Christ, bring we him home by such a particular <hi>Application</hi> of his Merits to our selves.</p>
               <p>Q. But how shall we be able to do this? when as Christ did not intend, that the Merit of his Death should be effectual to all,<note place="margin">
