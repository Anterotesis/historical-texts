            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BUT what relation has this Question to my Charge of <hi>SCHISM</hi> against the <hi>Nonconformists?</hi>

               </note> This is an expression for which he takes all occasions of traducing my Lord of <hi>Ely.</hi> But that Holy and Learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late knew very well the Language of that <hi>Primitive Christianity</hi> which flourished long before the Rise of <hi>Popery,</hi> tho Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> it seems is not acquainted with it. It is the constant Phrase of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Epistles, and of those who were concerned in them.

<pb facs="tcp:40884:8"/>
Ordinaries</hi> who were called <hi>Collegae</hi> in the language of those Ancient <hi>Laws,</hi> as being of a <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> by themselves. This I have lately proved in a <hi>Latin</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course on those Epistles.<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:40884:8"/>
Colleges,</hi> or <hi>Collegiate Churches</hi> make him fancy that, when we speak of an <hi>Episcopal College,</hi> we must mean some such <hi>Bodies</hi> of the Bishops <hi>cohabiting</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ready to assemble as often as there is occasion.

            <p>But sure he could not think that S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>

               </note> or any of his Contemporaries could allude to any of our <hi>Modern Colleges.

mistaking S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> But possibly he did not bethink himself how much S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> was concerned in this matter. Could he therefore unwillingly mistake <hi>Us?</hi> His very Expostulations now mentioned plainly imply, that he knew we could not so much as pretend to any such <hi>Body,</hi> as <hi>now</hi> extant in any part of the World.

speak nothing unagreeable thereunto in dealing with our own <hi>SCHISMATICKS.</hi> But had I owned the <hi>Pope</hi> as a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Unity,</hi> I must have owned what I there proved to be the <hi>Fundamental Principle</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>consulted</hi> as such.

               <pb facs="tcp:40884:12"/>
for there is nothing so <hi>wicked</hi> but he will suppose <hi>Bishops</hi> may be guilty of it, how much soever it be against their <hi>Interest.</hi> And because it is <hi>not lawful</hi> to forbear all <hi>Christian Assemblies</hi> for any Commands of <hi>Bishops</hi> whatsoever; therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it unlawful (if he will conclude any thing pertinent to our purpose) to forbear <hi>Conventicles</hi> for them. Just as if a Child should argue that because it is not obliged to forbear all meat at the <hi>Parents</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or the <hi>Physicians,</hi> therefore it ought to obey neither, if they should, like <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab,</hi> impose any <hi>Abstinence</hi> in <hi>Diet</hi> in particular Circumstances.

                  </gap> by the <hi>defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> number of <hi>Thousands. 2.</hi> That I said he did it <hi>more</hi> than <hi>once. 3.</hi> That I said he did it sometimes where his <hi>Argument</hi> was <hi>grounded</hi> on it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>LET the <hi>Reader</hi> judge between us, <hi>where</hi> the <hi>Mistake</hi> is,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>20.</hi>
               </note> whether on <hi>his</hi> part, or <hi>mine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note> He tells us the number of the <hi>Antiochians</hi> out of S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> that they were <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slates <hi>20000.</hi> He may indeed say that the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb facs="tcp:40884:15"/>
number. But where can he find it so when the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>Myriads</hi> is so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly expressed as it is <hi>here?</hi> Again he makes the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in <hi>Eusebius</hi> equivalent to the <hi>Thousands</hi> in S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly translates it <hi>Thousands.</hi> Why did he not keep to the number of <hi>Myriads</hi> in the <hi>English</hi> rather than alter it into <hi>another number</hi> if his design had been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to express an <hi>indefinite number?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Yet once more, on occasion of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who had said that <hi>many Myriads</hi> did meet in one place to hear, He tells us that <hi>two or three Myriads are more than can well hear any one preach.</hi> Certainly he again meant <hi>Thousands</hi> when he speaks of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>well</hi> and conveniently, for <hi>one My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riad</hi> is much <hi>more</hi> than can hear in any of our modern Auditories. It is no way probable that he could mean <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three Myriads</hi> indefinitely. If he did not, then I have gained my first two Points, both that he mistook <hi>Myriads</hi> for <hi>Thousands,</hi> and that he mistook it so <hi>more</hi> than <hi>once.</hi> Possibly our <hi>English</hi> Translation might have given him the occasion of this Mistake, which renders the word as he does. <hi>Jud. v.14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT was he not, at least mistaken, where his <hi>Argument</hi> was <hi>grounded</hi> on his <hi>Mistake,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. <hi>21.</hi>
               </note> and where his <hi>Interest</hi> required
<pb facs="tcp:40884:16"/>
that he should <hi>not</hi> have been mistaken? This he would fain perswade us: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>truly</hi> will easily be known by the <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of his producing these Passages <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> he is so mistaken. That was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the Passage produced out of S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> by the excellent <hi>Dean,</hi> wherein he says that <hi>thousands</hi> of <hi>Tickets</hi> were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Martyrs</hi> in favor of the <hi>lapsed,</hi> in <hi>each</hi> of which several persons were also included. To <hi>disprove</hi> this, and withal to <hi>prove</hi> what he drives at in that whole Discourse, that their <hi>Cities</hi> generally were answerable to our modern <hi>Parishes,</hi> even the <hi>greatest</hi> of <hi>them</hi> to the <hi>greatest</hi> of our <hi>Parishes;</hi> he undertakes to shew that <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> could not be so <hi>populous</hi> as that account of the <hi>Tickets</hi> would make it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause even <hi>Antioch,</hi> which was one of the <hi>greatest</hi> in the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> had but <hi>twenty Myriads</hi> in it. I do not now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute how <hi>true</hi> his Observation is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>numbers</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the <hi>mind</hi> of S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> tho I think he is mistaken in them. That is a work proper for his Learned <hi>Adversary.</hi> But it is very plain, by the tenor of this Reasoning, that it was highly his <hi>Interest</hi> to <hi>contract</hi> the numbers of the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> because that was his best way to <hi>contract</hi> the number
<pb facs="tcp:40884:16"/>
of the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> and that <hi>20000</hi> was much more for his purpose than <hi>200000,</hi> because the <hi>former number</hi> came nearer to the number of S. <hi>Martin</hi>'s <hi>Parish,</hi> which is the largest Precedent he can find among us. The <hi>later number</hi> is so little for his <hi>Interest,</hi> as that it would most effectually <hi>confute</hi> him. It would be a <hi>third</hi> Instance, besides <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> of a <hi>Diocesan City,</hi> vastly exceeding our most <hi>populous</hi> modern <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes.</hi> Thus manifestly he is out in all his three Particulars, tho he has hitherto been so backward to acknowledge it. And indeed his whole attempt to make the <hi>Roman Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> answerable to our present <hi>Market Towns</hi> is so extremely <hi>incredible</hi> to one so versed in the <hi>Histories</hi> of those <hi>Cities</hi> as this Author is, as that it is very hard, on this account also, to excuse him from another Charge of very great <hi>Servility</hi> to his <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Disingenuity</hi> in owning his <hi>Convictions.</hi>

is (in the Language of the most ancient and accurate Writers against <hi>SCHISM,</hi> especially <hi>Ignatius</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> from whom <hi>later Antiquity</hi> has received the same Terms) expressed as grounded on the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Priest</hi> and the <hi>Altar.</hi> In which way of <hi>Reasoning</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they who partake at the <hi>same Altar,</hi> and of the <hi>same mystical Sacrifices</hi> offered thereon, and receive their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this <hi>Sacrifical Feast</hi> from the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the <hi>same Priest,</hi> whose Office it is to offer those <hi>mystical Sacrifices</hi> on that <hi>same Altar,</hi> that <hi>they,</hi> and <hi>they alone,</hi> are to be judged to belong to the <hi>same Society,</hi> confederated by those <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> And on the contrary, that they who set up <hi>other Altars</hi> in opposition to that <hi>one Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> in order to the confederation of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Societies,</hi> owning no correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the <hi>Original Altar</hi>: and they who set up a <hi>distinct Priesthood</hi> by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, owning no <hi>dependence</hi> on the <hi>Priest</hi> related to that <hi>Altar,</hi> cannot, by virtue of this <hi>Sacrifical Confederation</hi> be judged to belong to the <hi>original Society,</hi> nor can consequently be intitled to the <hi>Privileges</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> from which they are so <hi>divided.</hi> This <hi>One Altar</hi> those <hi>Ancients</hi> understand of the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

Communion,</hi> and the <hi>one Priest</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> who was <hi>possessed</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> when the Separation was first made; And accordingly conclude farther, that whoever keep not to the <hi>original Communion,</hi> and do not own the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of such a <hi>Bishop</hi> and his <hi>Canonical Successors</hi> within his <hi>own Jurisdiction,</hi> are, for these very Reasons, <hi>cut off</hi> from the <hi>Original Churches,</hi> and from all <hi>just</hi> and <hi>legal</hi> Claims to the <hi>spiritual Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>Privileges</hi> of <hi>Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE Things, one would think,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> should be very plain, as to the Case of our present Nonconforming Adversaries. And yet it is strange to see how extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partial men, otherwise well meaning, are, when tempted by the <hi>Interest</hi> of a beloved <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Party.</hi> And I know not whether we have a greater instance of this human Frailty than Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> He it is that will needs perswade us, that this very same Reasoning which was made use of by those Fathers, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all those <hi>Diocesan Societies</hi> and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies SCHISMATICAL,</hi> which are maintained in opposition to the <hi>Diocesan Bishop,</hi> does indeed prove the contrary; That in that very same Case it proves that the <hi>Diocesan</hi> is the only <hi>SCHISMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICK.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40884:43"/>
This had indeed been more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable, if he had taken the Argument fingly, and vindicated it from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfullness of their management of it. Then he might indeed pretend to shew, with some consistency to his own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, that it did prove the <hi>contrary</hi> to that for which the <hi>Ancients</hi> had produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it. But when he is not content with this, but will needs pretend fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as well as his <hi>Reasoning,</hi> is the <hi>Doctrine</hi> also of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>; That <hi>they</hi> as well as <hi>he,</hi> were for defending subdivided <hi>Diocesan Assemblies</hi> against the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their <hi>Diocesan</hi>; That <hi>they</hi> as well as <hi>he,</hi> charged the <hi>Diocesans</hi> (that was <hi>themselves,</hi> in the Cases concerned in their Disputes) with the <hi>SCHISM</hi> of such <hi>Divisions</hi>; That accordingly <hi>they,</hi> as well <hi>he,</hi> should <hi>unchurch</hi> the <hi>Diocesan Ordinaries</hi> for not allowing the Exercise of Discipline by <hi>Felicissimus,</hi> and such like <hi>Presbyters</hi> independently on <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi> within their <hi>Ordinaries Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> for not owning such divided <hi>Factions</hi> and <hi>Assemblies</hi> headed by <hi>single Presbyters</hi> for <hi>proper Churches,</hi> and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to the <hi>Privileges</hi> that were proper to truly <hi>Ecclesiastical Assemblies</hi>; that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40884:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is indeed that their whole Disputes were by <hi>themselves</hi> designed <hi>against themselves,</hi> and in favour of their <hi>Adversaries</hi>: it is very strange how he could be so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of so weak Conjectures as those are which he uses in a Case, of it self, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely <hi>incredible.</hi> But such gross mistakes as these they are usually guilty of, who will venture rather to expound Authors by single <hi>Expressions,</hi> not throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, than inquire into the true <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> of the <hi>Dispute,</hi> and the matter of Fact that occasioned it, and the <hi>Interest</hi> and true <hi>design</hi> of the <hi>Dispute</hi> it self, as fitted to the <hi>Case</hi> for which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.</p>
            <p>A PARADOX so incredible <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> one would expect should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by very full and convincing Evidence. Yet all he has to shew for it, is, that those <hi>Ancients</hi> limit this <hi>Unity</hi> by <hi>one Altar,</hi> that is, as he conceives, by <hi>one</hi> single <hi>Communion-Table</hi>; and by <hi>one Priest,</hi> that is, as he also understands it, by one single <hi>Ordinary Minister.</hi> Whence he concludes, that the notion of a <hi>single</hi> united Church <hi>then</hi> included no more than could ordinarily maintain <hi>Personal Communion</hi> from the <hi>same Table</hi> that could ordinarily assist the Ministry
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40884:44"/>
of one <hi>single Minister,</hi> and ordinarily meet in the <hi>same place,</hi> even in those primitive Times of <hi>Persecution,</hi> when it could not be safe for <hi>many</hi> to meet so. He concludes, that this being so, whosoever were <hi>thus united</hi> in a <hi>single Congregation,</hi> and under the <hi>perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anl</hi> care and inspection of a <hi>single Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> must consequently have been <hi>united</hi> to a <hi>Church,</hi> and could not be judged <hi>SCHISMATICKS</hi> for want of any <hi>other</hi> Terms of <hi>Union.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that the <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Diocesan Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> supposing <hi>many Congregations</hi> thus <hi>united</hi> among <hi>themselves,</hi> cannot accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly involve such <hi>Congregations</hi> in the Crime of <hi>SCHISM,</hi> if they refuse those <hi>further</hi> Terms of <hi>Union,</hi> whilst they yet retain the <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>one Altar</hi> and <hi>one Priest,</hi> which was then thought <hi>Catholick,</hi> and from which alone the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings</hi> now mentioned made it <hi>SCHIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MATICAL</hi> to depart. That this being so, the <hi>Diocesans</hi> themselves, if they <hi>refuse</hi> Communion to <hi>Congregations</hi> so <hi>united,</hi> or, which amounts to the same thing, <hi>impose</hi> their <hi>own</hi> Terms of <hi>Union</hi> on them (which on these suppositions, cannot be <hi>Catholick</hi>) must <hi>themselves</hi> be judged to be the <hi>Violators</hi> of <hi>Catholick
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40884:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Unity,</hi> and <hi>SCHISMATICKS,</hi> not <hi>those Congregations</hi> whom he supposes to do no more than assert their own <hi>just Liberty</hi> against <hi>Usurpation</hi> and <hi>Uncatholick Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi>; That this being the <hi>present Case</hi> of our <hi>Nonconformists</hi>: they are also justifiable, on the <hi>same Principles,</hi> from the <hi>Guilt</hi> of <hi>SCHISM.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT enough has been already said <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> for overthrowing the force of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. I design not to repeat any more of it than what is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for preparing the way to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent undertaking. It is first plain, that this whole Argument can have no other force than what it must derive from the <hi>Authority</hi> of those <hi>ancient Authors</hi> who <hi>first</hi> used it. The very <hi>expressing</hi> of the <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Catholick Unity</hi> by <hi>one Altar,</hi> and <hi>one Priest,</hi> is not taken from the Language of the <hi>New Testament.</hi> Hence it follows further, that this whole Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning depending wholly on the <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of them who first used it, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently hold in any Cases but those for which they <hi>design'd</hi> it, &amp; must undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly be false in all such other Cases for which it was <hi>impossible</hi> that they <hi>could design</hi> it. These things therefore being thus premised, several things have been
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40884:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
already suggested to shew, that in the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>Ancients</hi> no such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences could be <hi>designed,</hi> as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries are in <hi>interest</hi> concerned to draw from this way of Reasoning.

            <p>THUS impossible it was, that those <label type="milestone">

When this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, there will no pretence remain for our Adversaries misunderstanding them.

               <hi>Colleges</hi> of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> Who sees not that by the <hi>one Priest</hi> they could not mean <hi>ordinary Ministers,</hi> but only the <hi>City-Bishop</hi>? Yet these very expressions Mr. <hi>B.</hi> can occasionally quote, without observing how they make against him.

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> FIRST therefore I observe, that this way of <hi>reasoning</hi> for <hi>Unity</hi> from <hi>one Altar,</hi> and <hi>one Priest</hi> was not first taken up in the <hi>later</hi> Ages of the Church, but deduced from the nearest and freshest memory of the <hi>Apostles.

Had it been taken up in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Times, the Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would rather have been from the Terms that were <hi>more familiar</hi> and <hi>usual</hi> in the custom of the <hi>Church</hi> to others that were <hi>less familiar,</hi> as from <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> more easily granted, and better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, by the <hi>vulgar.</hi> They would rather have proved the necessity of <hi>one Priest</hi> from the necessity of <hi>one Bishop,</hi> because this <hi>later</hi> was in the <hi>later usage</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the much more <hi>usual</hi> name by which that <hi>Office</hi> was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40884:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
known. That therefore they take the contrary way of <hi>Reasoning,</hi> it is a plain sign, that when this Argument was first taken up, it was better known what was meant by <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Altar,</hi> than what was meant by <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Table</hi>; and that it was more easily granted, that the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> did oblige to <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> than that the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Communion Table</hi> did so. This way of Reasoning is plainly accommodated to the first <hi>beginnings</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> when the <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be gathered from Concessions <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent</hi> to <hi>Christianity,</hi> than to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by its <hi>own authority.</hi> Which Observation will withal add much to the <hi>Validity</hi> of the <hi>Reasoning,</hi> that it was first taken up before the extraordinary Gifts of <hi>Inspiration</hi> ceased, and in fresh memory of the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first appearing of the Case of <hi>actual SCHISM.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BEFORE the <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>actual SCHISM</hi> it is unreasonable to expect <hi>express Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> of the <hi>sin</hi> of <hi>SCHISM.</hi> And if immediately upon the <hi>first</hi> appearance of the <hi>Case,</hi> they proceeded on <hi>these Principles</hi> in condemning it, and withal
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40884:49"/>
the <hi>Case</hi> appeared before the memory of the <hi>Apostles Doctrine</hi> could have been forgotten; then it will plainly follow that these were the Principles by which those <hi>earliest Ages</hi> were directed, in judging concerning the sense of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi> Either therefore the <hi>Apostles</hi> left no certain <hi>Principles</hi> for preservation of <hi>Unity</hi> in the <hi>Churches</hi> instructed by them, or we must suppose those Principles <hi>forgotten</hi> in so short a distance of time; or we shall have reason to believe that these were the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Reasonings</hi> on which the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves would have proceeded in judging concerning this <hi>Case,</hi> if it had fallen out in their own time, and they had thereupon been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to give their own <hi>judgment</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. This <hi>Consequence</hi> will hold, tho the <hi>Apostles</hi> had delivered nothing concerning it from <hi>express Revelation.</hi> For in such Cases the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> plainly supposed that other means of <hi>human Information</hi> were sufficient, when it did not undertake to secure them from the errors of such <hi>Popular Reasonings,</hi> especially where the Errors would have proved of so dangerous Consequence as they must in such a Case as this concerning the obligation to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40884:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Unity.</hi> But in such a Case wherein the <hi>Apostles</hi> had been left to their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings, we see it is usual for them to reason from <hi>Popular Notions</hi> received among the <hi>Hellenistical Jews.</hi> And therefore all such Reasonings from <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> so <hi>received</hi> in the <hi>Apostles times,</hi> must be granted to have been secure from actual Errors. Whence it will further follow, that the <hi>Reasonings</hi> of the <hi>next Age</hi> from <hi>Notions</hi> popularly <hi>received</hi> in the <hi>first Age,</hi> must have been the <hi>same</hi>; and therefore as <hi>certain,</hi> as if they had been used by the <hi>Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> thus unassisted by <hi>actual Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and indeed as <hi>infallible</hi> as <hi>Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> it self, when this was the only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why <hi>Inspiration</hi> was not given them, because the <hi>Inspirer</hi> thought these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings sufficient without it to secure them from <hi>actual Error,</hi> in such a Case wherein he was so <hi>obliged</hi> to secure them.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY therefore I observe <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> further, That as this <hi>Reasoning</hi> was, as I said, taken from Notions <hi>antecedent</hi> to <hi>Christianity</hi>; so much more probably from <hi>Judaism</hi> than <hi>Heathenism,</hi> tho both of them had <hi>Altars</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> among them. For <hi>Heathenism</hi> was a Religion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40884:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wholly condemned by the <hi>Christians,</hi> and therefore utterly unfit to give any <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>Reasonings</hi> for <hi>positive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions.</hi> But <hi>Judaism</hi> was a way of which the first <hi>Christians</hi> were always very cautious of speaking <hi>dishonorably.</hi> Most of the first <hi>Converts</hi> were <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Nation,</hi> and still retained a great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for the Constitutions of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and therefore with them such <hi>Reasonings</hi> from <hi>Old Testament</hi> Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents must have been very prevalent. Besides the whole History of the <hi>New Testament</hi> Disputes, S. <hi>James</hi>'s Words are very full to this purpose, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.20 not to trouble my self with naming more. Accordingly the first <hi>Converters</hi> utterly disowned any design of <hi>abrogating</hi> the <hi>Law.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself professed he came not to <hi>destroy,</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">S. Mat. 5.17. Luke 16.17·</note> but to fullfil it. And one principal inducement made use to bring them over to the <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> was indeed, that <hi>Moses</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">S. John 5.45.</note> in whom they trusted, had given <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> to our Saviour, that of him all the <hi>Prophets</hi>

            <p>PURSUANT hereunto whatsoever <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> benefit was boasted of by the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Disputation, they shew that the same also belonged to <hi>Christianity</hi> in a sense much more <hi>beneficial,</hi> tho <hi>mystical,</hi> as indeed more proper to a state of <hi>mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Judaism.</hi> Nor do they only <hi>accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date</hi> their own <hi>Constitutions</hi> to the ancient <hi>Predictions</hi> (that was easier, tho there had been no relation between them) but they also <hi>reason</hi> from them as often
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40884:51"/>
as they had any new occasion from the Controversies of that Age. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the Principles they proceeded on, the Reasoning was indeed very <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>prudent.</hi> For this being granted, that the things which befel the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.11.</note> 
               <hi>happened to them as Ensamples,</hi> and <hi>were written for the Admonition</hi> of the Age of the Apostles, <hi>upon whom the Ends of the World</hi> (so much spoken of by the Prophets) <hi>were come</hi>; That whatsoever was written, was written <hi>designedly</hi> for the instruction of those <hi>later Ages</hi>; That it was suitable to the way of <hi>Prophecy</hi> to <hi>foretel</hi> and <hi>command</hi> by way of <hi>mystical Representations</hi>; That all the <hi>external Worship</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> was design'd by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> himself like so many <hi>Prophetick Visions</hi> to <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> and <hi>shadow</hi> the Duties of those in whose times the Prophesies were to be <hi>fulfilled</hi> and <hi>understood</hi>; It was indeed as proper and reasonable for them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their Duties from <hi>mystical Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> of the <hi>Levitical Worship,</hi> as it was constant and customary for <hi>Prophets</hi> to gather their own <hi>Duties</hi> from their own <hi>Visions,</hi> and from <hi>mystical Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> of their own Visions, when to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Visions</hi> themselves the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40884:51"/>
               <hi>Interpretations</hi> were also revealed to them. However as to us, it may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that these <hi>Principles</hi> are plainly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and this way of <hi>Reasoning</hi> plainly allowed and proceeded on in most of the Disputes of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> not only for the <hi>Conviction</hi> of <hi>Adversaries,</hi> but for <hi>Information</hi> of <hi>themselves,</hi> as the Reasonings on which the credit of <hi>Christianity</hi> it self was recommended and received by most of the Converts of those Ages, as those upon which the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves believed it, as those which were suggested to them by that <hi>Inspiration</hi> by which they were guided in their <hi>Preachings,</hi> and therefore must have been <hi>solid,</hi> if any thing was so, I do not say in <hi>Christian,</hi> but in any other sort of <hi>received</hi> Revelations.</p>

that he may not be confounded with too many Disputes at first.

be taken for the Characters of <hi>Christian Unity.</hi> For in this way of reasoning from <hi>Prophetick Resemblances,</hi> tho the Reasoning do not hold, as it does in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Precedents,</hi> that the <hi>Precedents</hi> and the things <hi>represented</hi> by them must be of the same <hi>kind</hi>; Yet 1.

               <hi>here</hi> it is as natural and proper to <hi>reason</hi> from <hi>Symbolical Representations,</hi> as it is to <hi>Reason</hi> from <hi>Literal Expressions</hi> in dealing with <hi>Men.</hi> Especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that, in the Case I am speaking of, these <hi>Symbols</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely fitted to <hi>represent</hi> their <hi>Antitypes</hi> under the <hi>Gospel</hi>; and so fitted as that they, who should live in those <hi>later days,</hi> when those <hi>Prophecies</hi> concerning <hi>mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Judaism</hi> were to be <hi>fulfilled,</hi> might know their own <hi>Duty,</hi> and within what Bounds they were to confine their <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> according to the <hi>ancient Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi> concerning them, that is, how far such <hi>Innovations</hi> were agreeable to the mind of <hi>God</hi> in his ancient <hi>Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> THUS it is plain that they <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood God,</hi> and thus it is most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <label type="milestone">

But in the Particulars for which I am concerned at present there were yet more <hi>particular Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions</hi> that this indeed was God's <hi>Design.</hi> For as it was not to be doubted that God <hi>designed Unity</hi> for the <hi>Mystical,</hi> as well as the <hi>Literal Israel,</hi> so he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have been more <hi>express</hi> in the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40884:59"/>
of his mind, if he had intend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed any <hi>change</hi> in the <hi>Principles</hi> of this <hi>Unity.</hi> But seeing there appears not the least <hi>intimation</hi> of such a design, seeing he was pleased to <hi>continue</hi> a <hi>mystical Priesthood,</hi> and a <hi>mystical Altar</hi> in the <hi>Mystical,</hi> as well as the <hi>Literal, Israel.</hi> Who would not thence conclude that he intended the <hi>mystical Priesthood</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> should still be the Principles of <hi>Unity</hi> to the <hi>mystical Israel,</hi> as the <hi>Literal Priesthood</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> had formerly been to the <hi>Literal</hi>? And seeing the very Terms of <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> were not the proper Language of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> why should they be used at all, but only to signifie that they were equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent under the <hi>New Testament</hi> with those things which had properly born their Names under the <hi>Old,</hi> and were to perform the same Office? Thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that this <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Reasoning</hi> holds particularly in this Case concerning <hi>Unity.</hi> I now proceed in my intended Method.</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY therefore, it is <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> further certain that this whole Topick of Reasoning, as it was used by the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians</hi> was plainly designed to characterize a <hi>visible external Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>

and a <hi>visible external Unity,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stinct from other divided <hi>Societies</hi> or <hi>Assemblies</hi> of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>SCHISMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICKS.</hi> This is plain in the Disputes of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which are plainly designed against such as <hi>baptized</hi> or celebrated their <hi>Agapae,</hi> or <hi>Communion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ep ad <hi>Smyrn.</hi> Sect. 7.</note> without the <hi>Altar</hi> of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> or did any thing relating to their <hi>Ecclesiastical Assemblies</hi> without his <hi>Authority.</hi> And so in all the Disputes of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> whether with <hi>Felicissimus,</hi> or the <hi>Novatians,</hi> these Arguments are used against them who acted <hi>separately</hi> from the <hi>Bishop,</hi> in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> Penitents, or <hi>rejecting</hi> them, as the <hi>Novatians,</hi> which were Acts of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Jurisdiction,</hi> or in setting up <hi>Anti-Bishops</hi> within a <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Canonically <hi>possessed.</hi> And therefore their design against such Adversaries as these were, must have been to shew that the <hi>Bishop's Altar,</hi> in opposition to those <hi>Separate Altars,</hi> was the <hi>one Altar,</hi> and the <hi>Bishop</hi> himself that <hi>One Priest,</hi> which were to be the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Catholick Unity,</hi> in order to the proving all them <hi>divided,</hi> who were not in <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Bishop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND fifthly, this Dispute was not between <hi>Individual Altars</hi> of the <hi>same <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label>

Communion,</hi> but between <hi>different Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> as Notes of <hi>different Communions. Ignatius,</hi> as he blames them who offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated without the <hi>Bishop's consent,</hi> so he expresly grants the Validity of that Eucharist which was administred either <hi>by the Bishop,</hi> or by <hi>him to whom the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop permitted it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ep. ad <hi>Smyrn. ib.</hi>
               </note> In vain therefore does Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> gather from hence, that there was then only one <hi>Communion-Table</hi> in the <hi>Bishop's</hi> House. In vain does Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that the <hi>Multitude</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> consisted in <hi>one Congregation,</hi> which could meet constantly in the <hi>same place.</hi> This was utterly impertinent to the Disputes of those times. They were all of <hi>one Altar,</hi> who were of <hi>one Communion,</hi> from how many <hi>Tables</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they communicated, and they only belonged to a <hi>different Altar,</hi> and <hi>set up Altar against Altar,</hi> who owned a <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Communion.</hi> This was plainly all which they were obliged to mean by the interest of those Disputes.</p>
            <p>AND therefore sixthly, by the <hi>One <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> Priest</hi> those <hi>Ancients</hi> could not mean only <hi>Christ,</hi> nor by the <hi>One Altar,</hi> only an <hi>invisible Communion</hi> with <hi>him.</hi> This would have been as confidently, and as unconfutably, pretended to by their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40884:60"/>
Adversaries, if their own confident Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations must have been allowed to pass for Arguments. When therefore they used these Topicks as <hi>argumentative</hi> to <hi>Adversaries,</hi> their meaning must have been and was that the means of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating with <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>invisible Priest,</hi> was by communicating with him that was <hi>visible,</hi> and the means of partaking of the <hi>invisible Altar,</hi> was also by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of that which was <hi>visible,</hi> and consequently that they who were not in <hi>external Communion</hi> with the <hi>Bishop,</hi> could not partake of the <hi>invisible Bread,</hi> nor the <hi>invisible Priesthood.</hi> So <hi>Ignatius</hi> expresly makes disrespect to the <note n="(a)" place="bottom">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40884:62"/>
does not take away the <hi>Use,</hi> but only the <hi>Obligation</hi> of using several Altars. The <hi>same God</hi> was oftentimes worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>several Nations,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THE other Reason is, because the <hi>Hebrews</hi> themselves were but <hi>one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

of the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and of the <hi>New Moons.</hi> Must we therefore think that they who were at a distance from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> thought themselves unconcerned in those <hi>Sacrifices</hi>?<note place="margin">Num. 28.</note> It is no way proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they did so.

Their <hi>private Devotions</hi> required not the presence of any such person. The <hi>Reading</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> seems not to have been any part of the <hi>Synagogue-Worship,</hi> till after the <hi>Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</hi> If it had, it is hardly imaginable how the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> would have so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried as it did from the time of <hi>Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seh</hi> to <hi>Josiah.</hi> How successful soever <hi>Manasseh</hi> might have been in suppressing it in his own Dominions, yet he could not do it in <hi>Samaria.</hi> The Instances al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready produced, shew that the <hi>Prophets</hi> did ordinarily <hi>sacrifice,</hi> and yet I believe one instance cannot be produced that ever they did so in <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Besides, for the <hi>New Moons,</hi> it was <hi>David</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse

to <hi>Saul</hi> for his absence, that he was invited to a <hi>publick Sacrifice</hi> for his whole <hi>Family</hi> in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> 1 Sam. XX.5, 6, 29. It seems then it was usual for <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> to have their <hi>proper Sacrifices</hi> in their own <hi>Cities,</hi> and that the <hi>New Moons</hi> which were otherwise appointed by <hi>God,</hi> were particularly pitched on for that purpose.

The first <hi>Fact</hi> that was condemned on this account was the <hi>Altar</hi> of the <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benites</hi> and <hi>Gadites</hi> and the half Tribe of <hi>Manasseh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jos. XXII.</note> immediately upon their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission by <hi>Joshua.</hi> This we see was looked on as a Crime of a very high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and as a great affront to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40884:67"/>
Religion, that the other Tribes thought themselves obliged on a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Account, to punish it by a War. And the best means to know what it was that was thus severely blamed in it, will be to see how it was charged, and how it was defended. It was charged with a design of <hi>rebelling</hi> against the <hi>Lord,</hi> Verse 16. It is charged with a <hi>departure from the Lord,</hi> and from the <hi>Fellowship</hi> of their <hi>Brethren.</hi> So the vulgar Latine: <hi>Tantùm ut a Domino, &amp; à nostro consortio, non recedatis aedificato altari praeter altare Domini Dei nostri.</hi> Verse 19. Here it is plainly charged with a <hi>dissolution</hi> of <hi>Unity,</hi> and that both of their <hi>Unity</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> and with his <hi>People.</hi> This therefore was the Crime from which those <hi>other Tribes</hi> were concerned to purge themselves. And how do they do it? They deny that their <hi>Altar</hi> was intended for <hi>Burnt Offering</hi> or <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Verse 26. And how far that <hi>Reason</hi> went for their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and of what <hi>Sacrifices</hi> they prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally designed it, may better be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from their following Words, <hi>Verse</hi> 27, <hi>But it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, to execute the service of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40884:68"/>
Lord before him in our burnt offerings, and in our Sacrifices, and in our Peace-offerings, and that your children should not say to our children in time to come, ye have no part in the Lord,</hi> 28. <hi>Therefore said we, if so be that they should so say to us, or to our generations in time to come, then will we Answer, Behold the fashion of the Altar of the Lord, which our Fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but it is a witness between us and you.</hi> And they conclude in detestation of the Charge: <hi>Verse</hi> 29. <hi>God forbid that we should rebel against the Lord, and turn this day from the Lord, to build an Altar for burnt offering, or for meat offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or for sacrifice, save the Altar of the Lord our God that is before his Tabernacle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEIR <hi>Reasoning</hi> is plainly this. <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> They disown any design of drawing their Posterity from the <hi>Assemblies</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> before the <hi>Ark,</hi> which was then in <hi>Shiloh.</hi> They profess that this was so far from their design as that their meaning was only to assert their <hi>Right</hi> to that <hi>common Altar</hi> of the <hi>Jewish Nation,</hi> that in time to come they might not be <hi>excluded</hi> from their <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> That plainly was the meaning of those words, <hi>ye have no part in they part in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40884:68"/>
Lord,</hi> to deny their <hi>Right</hi> of partaking in their <hi>common Sacrifices.</hi> And of what <hi>Sacrifices</hi> could these be understood but of those which were offered in the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>other Tribes,</hi> from whence it might otherwise have been in their power to exclude them? This they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted by preserving among themselves a <hi>Copy</hi> of the <hi>Altar</hi> which was before the <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> So it appears that the <hi>Altars</hi> of <hi>different Deities</hi> were of <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Shapes,</hi> and that by owning the <hi>shape</hi> of the <hi>Altar</hi> of the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> they signified that <hi>he</hi> was the <hi>God</hi> to whom their Devotions were designed, and with whom they pretended to <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> in their <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> And herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted the difficulty of <hi>doubling</hi> their <hi>Altar</hi> in the <hi>Oracle</hi> given to the <hi>Delians.</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40884:69"/>
taking a <hi>Copy</hi> of the <hi>Altar</hi> at <hi>Damascus,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> XVI.10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That in <hi>Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>Altar</hi> he professed an approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and <hi>Communion</hi> with those <hi>Syrian Idolaters.</hi> This therefore was the way taken by <hi>Onias</hi> in his <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Heliopolis.</hi> That he might avoid the imputation of <hi>SCHISM</hi> he <hi>Copyed</hi> his <hi>Altar</hi> from the <hi>Altar</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as we shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve hereafter. This <hi>Copy</hi> therefore of the <hi>Altar</hi> at <hi>Shiloh</hi> signified their chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging a <hi>Right</hi> in those <hi>Assemblies</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> which were <hi>there</hi> to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nay, to take of all pretence of being hindered by this new <hi>Altar</hi> from the participating in the <hi>Assemblies</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> they profess further that they intended it for no <hi>Sacrifices</hi> at all, not even those that were offered <hi>day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> nor on their <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> or <hi>New Moons.</hi> So far they were from pretending it for those <hi>Anniversary</hi> Ones which required their Attendance at <hi>Shiloh.</hi> In all which Apologies they plainly suppose that <hi>this Use</hi> of their <hi>Altar</hi> that had broken them off from their attendance on the <hi>Altar</hi> and <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> had indeed been the Case that had made them justly obnoxious to the charge, of having an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare praeter Altare,</hi> of having an <hi>Altar
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40884:69"/>
save the Altar of the Lord their God that was before the Tabernacle,</hi> and of <hi>dividing</hi> from <hi>God</hi> and from the <hi>Communion</hi> of their <hi>Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT this was the true state of <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> that Controversie seems also very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the <hi>reason</hi> intimated by the other Tribes whereby they were brought into this suspicion. <hi>Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 19.</note> 
               <hi>if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the Lord, wherein the Lord's Tabernacle dwelleth, and take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session among us: but rebel not,</hi> &amp;c. The reason as it should seem that made the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> suspect that their Brethren intended this <hi>Altar</hi> for the <hi>publick Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> and <hi>Assemblies</hi> on their side <hi>Jordan</hi> was, that they took the land of their own possession to be <hi>unclean,</hi> and that their design in erecting this <hi>new Altar</hi> was to <hi>cleanse</hi> it. In this supposition, they offer them a better expedient as they conceived, that they should rather come over to their own Land, which they call the <hi>Possession</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> as acknowledged <hi>clean</hi> on both sides, than take that undue way of <hi>sanctifying</hi> what they injoyed already on the other side of <hi>Jordan.</hi> But <hi>private Altars</hi> were not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40884:70"/>
thought sufficient to <hi>sanctifie</hi> the <hi>Land.</hi> If so, that same Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> had been holy long before it was conquered by <hi>Joshua</hi>; for <hi>Abraham</hi> and the other Patriarchs had <hi>sacrificed</hi> there whilst it was yet possessed by the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> The Wilderness had also been <hi>holy,</hi> where <hi>Moses sacrificed</hi> after the Victory over <hi>Amalek.</hi> It was therefore a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Altar</hi> alone erected by the present <hi>possessors</hi> of the <hi>Land</hi> that could proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be said to <hi>sanctifie</hi> it, and for such a one they took that of which I am at present discoursing. It was erected by the whole <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Possessors</hi> of those parts before they dispersed themselves, immediately after their return from helping their Brethren in <hi>Canaan</hi>; not by any one <hi>single Tribe,</hi> much less for the Rites of a <hi>single Family.</hi> It was also greater than ordinary. So the Text notes that it was a <hi>great Altar to see to</hi>: Verse 10. From thence they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that it was designed for the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Sacrifices</hi> of their <hi>Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Assemblies,</hi> to excuse them from their Anniversary Attendance. This very Story plainly shews that they were already <hi>disunited</hi> in their secular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If they had also been made thus
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40884:70"/>
independent in <hi>Religion</hi> also, this had indeed so disunited them, as that they would not any longer have looked like <hi>one Nation.</hi>

               <hi>against</hi> the <hi>publick Altar</hi> were those of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> against the <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> These were plainly designed to cut off the ten Tribes of his own Kingdom from their correspondence with <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> The reason inducing him to it was, lest, by their frequent Journies thither on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the three <hi>Anniversaries,</hi> they should contract a dangerous correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and friendship with the Kings of the Lineage of <hi>David,</hi> in whose Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions the <hi>publick Altar</hi> was, and, for a love of their Religion, and to make their Journey more easie, they should be tempted to revolt from him to their former Master. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> XII.27. This appears also from the <hi>reason</hi> pretended by him, why he did so, to the People, <hi>Verse</hi> 28. <hi>It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy Gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the Land of Egypt.</hi> It was plainly to discourage them from going up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> that he made use of this pretence of the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>someness of their <hi>Journeys,</hi> so <hi>far,</hi> and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40884:71"/>
so <hi>frequently.</hi> And accordingly he fits his pretended Expedients. To ease them of the <hi>length</hi> of their Journies, he appoints them <hi>two places</hi> instead of that <hi>one,</hi> and both of them in the opposite Frontiers of his own Kingdom, <hi>Dan</hi> in the <hi>Northern,</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> in the <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Parts, that so none might have occasion to go <hi>out</hi> of his Kingdom, on account of their Worship in their <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary Assemblies,</hi> nor yet be obliged to so long Journies <hi>within</hi> it as formerly. The distance was less to <hi>two</hi> places, I mean to the choice of either of them, than it would have been to any <hi>one,</hi> and yet more convenient in the <hi>Borders</hi> than in any other situation. By that means it came to pass that none of them could come at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but he must pass by one of them at a more convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from his own abode. And for avoiding the same pretended trouble of the <hi>Anniversaries,</hi> he reduces the <hi>three</hi> to only <hi>one,</hi> like unto the Feast that was in <hi>Judah,</hi> which makes me more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to think that it ought not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the <hi>eighth Month,</hi> as our present Copies have it, but of the <hi>seventh,</hi> Verse 32,<note place="margin">

and understood in the Copies of his time. Why should he cut off <hi>two</hi> of their <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversaries,</hi> and yet pitch so punctually on the <hi>third</hi> of them for the time of his own <hi>Assemblies,</hi> if his design had not been, as I said, particularly to cut off their <hi>dependence</hi> on <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in this very particular point of their <hi>Anniversary Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Assemblies</hi>? These were his Innovations concerning the <hi>Altar.</hi> As to the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> he changed that also from the Family of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and the Rules of the <hi>Law,</hi> by that means making them also <hi>independent</hi> on the <hi>High-Priesthood</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>

               <hi>to cry all arm against you: O Children of Israel, fight ye not against the Lord God of your Fathers, for ye shall not prosper.</hi> And in this reasoning he concludes this peculiar presence of <hi>God</hi> which was proper to the <hi>Segullah</hi> from the presence of his <hi>Priests,</hi> and the <hi>Orderlyness</hi> of their <hi>Ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> So he reasons, <hi>Verse</hi> 10. <hi>As for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken him, and the Priests which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster unto the Lord are the Sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business. V.</hi> 11. <hi>And they burn unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for we keep the charge of the Lord our God, but ye have forsaken him.</hi> And this charge against <hi>Jeroboam</hi> of having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken God he manages also on the same Principles, <hi>Verse</hi> 9, <hi>Have ye not cast out the Priests of the Lord, the Sons of Aaron, and the Levites,</hi> &amp;c. So that in this way of Reasoning, keeping <hi>united</hi> with the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> is the same with not having forsaken <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>disuniting</hi> from <hi>them</hi> is the same with having <hi>forsaken him</hi>; and they who keep thus <hi>united</hi> can call the <hi>Lord</hi> their <hi>own God,</hi> but they who had thus <hi>forsaken him</hi> could not <hi>call him</hi>

so. He is only said to be the <hi>God</hi> of their <hi>Fathers.</hi> This touches the very point of the <hi>Segullah,</hi> their being <hi>God's</hi> peculiar <hi>People,</hi> and <hi>God's</hi> being peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly their <hi>God</hi> rather than of any other <hi>People.</hi> If therefore this <hi>Privilege</hi> was forfeited by their discession from <hi>God's Priesthood,</hi> by their being <hi>disuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> from <hi>God</hi> himself in such a sense as this; it plainly follows that this <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> must have been taken for a Bond of their <hi>Union</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> and each other, as they were a <hi>Sacred Society,</hi> and intitled to <hi>Sacred Privileges.</hi>

Notions.</hi> Tho the <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> was destroyed by <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> within about two hundred years after it was first built, and with it, no doubt,<note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">S. Joh.

            <p>ACCORDINGLY our <hi>Saviour</hi> and the <hi>Apostles</hi> had occasion to declare <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> themselves what they thought concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Disputes, and they still declare themselves in favour of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40884:75"/>
Our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself, in his Dispute with the <hi>Woman</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> tells her that <hi>Salvation</hi> was <hi>of the Jews.</hi>
               <note place="margin">S Joh. IV.22.</note> The <hi>Salvation</hi> there spoken of was in all likelyhood that which was expected from the <hi>Messias,</hi> who was to be a <hi>Prince</hi>

               <hi>Emanuel, God with us,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was to <hi>save his People from their Sins.</hi> When therefore he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priates this <hi>Salvation</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> his meaning was most probably this, that whereas the <hi>Samaritans</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> did pretend to the <hi>privilege</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>God's</hi> only <hi>People,</hi> God himself would declare it against them. The <hi>Messias</hi> who was promised to the <hi>true Israel</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> should not come of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> but of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who should also alone be partakers of that <hi>Salvation</hi> of which he was to be Author as <hi>Messias</hi> to a <hi>particular People.</hi> That the <hi>Messias,</hi> who was to be of the Stock of God's <hi>Israel,</hi> was to be a <hi>Jew</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, plainly confuted the <hi>Samaritan</hi> pretence of <hi>themselves</hi> being alone the <hi>true Israel,</hi> exclusively to the <hi>Jews.</hi> That the benefit of his <hi>Salvation,</hi> which was at first <hi>appropriated</hi> to the <hi>Israelites</hi> till they were <hi>cast off</hi> from being the

               <hi>Segullah</hi> by <hi>God</hi> himself, should be also <hi>proper</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> understood in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinction to the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> plainly implies that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> were to be excluded out of the number of his <hi>People</hi> which were to be saved by the <hi>Messias.</hi> What is this but plainly to deny any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest they could challenge in any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Segullah,</hi> of being either the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> exclusively to others, or being any <hi>part</hi> of his <hi>People,</hi> whilst they continued in their own Faction?</p>

of the ingratitude of those who did not return, that a person who was not of the <hi>People</hi> of the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> and who could not call that <hi>God his</hi> in so peculiar a regard as <hi>they</hi> could, should notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing be more <hi>thankful</hi> for a benefit received from <hi>him</hi> than they who were already of his <hi>People.</hi> So in his Parable of him who fell among Thieves, the <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Levite</hi> pass him by,<note place="margin">S.

               <hi>Symbol</hi> of God's <hi>Presence,</hi> and the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving</hi> of it did therefore plainly signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a <hi>removal</hi> of that <hi>special Presence</hi> which he had been pleased to shew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; and the <hi>distance</hi> to which it was removed, as it signified the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of God's <hi>displeasure</hi> against them, so it signified withal the <hi>distance</hi> God intended hence forward to keep at from them, as far as it is <hi>possible</hi> for <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>distant,</hi> that is, in regard of that <hi>special presence</hi> of <hi>care</hi> and <hi>particular concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which he had for them whilst he owned them as <hi>his People.</hi> So <hi>Moses</hi> understood it, and prays accordingly, <hi>Verse</hi> 15, 16. <hi>If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. For wherein shall it be known here, that I and thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have found grace in thy sight? Is it not in that thou goest with us? So shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.</hi> Plainly therefore his sending the <hi>Angel</hi> with them implyed the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of his <hi>own presence</hi> from them. The <hi>presence</hi> so withdrawn was <hi>that</hi> whereby they were known to have <hi>found grace in his sight,</hi> that is, whereby they were known to be his peculiar <hi>Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>; and that whereby the <hi>People</hi> of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40884:104"/>
               <hi>Israel</hi> were <hi>separated</hi> from all the <hi>People that</hi> were <hi>upon the face of the earth.</hi> That is, wherein they were <hi>preferred</hi> before all other <hi>Nations.</hi> What is this but the very notion of their being the <hi>Segullah</hi>? That therefore must have consisted in this <hi>peculiar Presidency</hi> of <hi>God</hi> over them.</p>
            <p>THE same appears from the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Persia</hi> mentioned in <hi>Dan.</hi> X.13. who <label type="milestone">

that <hi>peculiar Providence</hi> which results from his <hi>particular care</hi> of them, and own no <hi>Nation</hi> interested therein but <hi>themselves.</hi> I might shew that the first <hi>Christians</hi> understood it so from the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> both from their Expositions of the forementioned passage in <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi> and from the account they give generally from the Book of <hi>Enoch,</hi>

that Persons conversing do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to be <hi>rightly understood</hi> by <hi>those</hi> with whom they deal; so the same <hi>justice,</hi> in order to the same <hi>designs,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that what significations of their mind shall be made use of, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the same way as it is known that the Persons dealt with <hi>will,</hi> and will have <hi>reason to</hi> understand them. These common Rules of <hi>Equity</hi> in <hi>deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> are used and appealed to for a justification of his own dealing by <hi>God</hi> himself. It remains therefore that I shew that this was the <hi>design</hi> of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> among the <hi>Heathens,</hi> to <hi>appropriate</hi> a <hi>Nation</hi> to the <hi>Care</hi> of a <hi>particular Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> so that they who were admitted to such <hi>Sacrifices</hi> might challenge an <hi>interest</hi> in the <hi>Daemons</hi> Care, and they who had no <hi>Right</hi> to be admitted to the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> should be also supposed to have no <hi>Right</hi> to that <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> of the <hi>Daemon,</hi> and they who were <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded</hi> from the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> should also be judged <hi>excluded</hi> from that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</hi>

of <hi>one Altar</hi> when yet the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> on which they feasted, could not all of them be <hi>offered</hi> at <hi>one Altar.</hi> This is expresly taken notice of to have been the case of <hi>Solomon</hi> in the Dedication of his temple: <hi>The same day did the King hallow the middle of the Court that was before the house of the Lord:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings. VIII.64.</note> 
               <hi>for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the Peace offerings: because the brazen Altar that was before the Lord, was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the Peace offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> The number then offered of Twenty two thousand Oxen and one hundred and twenty thousand Sheep was indeed no greater than what might often be expected at the <hi>Anniversaries</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V.63.</note> and the Provision there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not extraordinary, but such as it was intended should be constantly made use of on such occasions as often as they returned. So that consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made a <hi>Perpetual Right</hi> that <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> might for ever be burnt in <hi>that place,</hi> whenever they should again prove so numerous as that the <hi>Altar</hi> could not <hi>receive</hi> them. Yet did he not think fit to erect any more <hi>Altars</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:40884:130"/>
but that <hi>brazen one.</hi> Why not but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he found it not agreeable to the <hi>customes</hi> and <hi>significations</hi> of those times to receive their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> on such solemn occasions <hi>from</hi> any more than <hi>one Altar,</hi> tho they were more than could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>by one Altar</hi>? And I believe there cannot be given an Example where-ever <hi>one Temple</hi> had more than <hi>one Altar</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the <hi>same Deity,</hi> how <hi>numerous</hi> soever the <hi>Sacrificers</hi> or <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were that might, on such <hi>publick Occasions,</hi> be <hi>expected</hi> to partake of it. Which also makes it very probable that their <hi>partaking</hi> at <hi>one Altar</hi> was indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed as an <hi>Emblem,</hi> and an <hi>Obligation</hi> of them all to <hi>Unity.</hi> And this might possibly be the reason why, when it was lawful to worship the <hi>same Deity</hi> in <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant places,</hi> they notwithstanding <hi>copyed</hi> out the <hi>principal Altar.</hi> Perhaps it was <hi>mystically</hi> to signifie that it was still the <hi>same Altar</hi> that they still <hi>intended</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of, that when the <hi>distance</hi> of the <hi>place</hi> hindered their real participation with it, they yet <hi>intended</hi> to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with it <hi>in effigie,</hi> that is, as <hi>really</hi> as it was <hi>possible</hi> for them to communicate with it at a <hi>distance.</hi> For as the <hi>external Participation</hi> at a <hi>visible Altar</hi> was not
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40884:131"/>
taken, in this <hi>Mystical</hi> way of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for a <hi>multiplying</hi> an <hi>Altar distinct</hi> from the distinct <hi>Archetypal Altar</hi> by which their <hi>invisible Communion</hi> was to be maintained with their <hi>Deity,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a means of partaking of the <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Altar</hi> from whence the <hi>visible Altar</hi> was supposed to be <hi>Copyed</hi>; so neither, for the same reason, could a <hi>distant Communion</hi> with an <hi>Altar copyed</hi> from that which was <hi>Archetypal</hi> of all <hi>visible</hi> ones, be taken for a <hi>distinct Communion</hi> with a <hi>distinct Altar,</hi> but rather as a means of communicating with that <hi>original visible Altar</hi> from which that is also supposed to have been <hi>Copyed.</hi>

            <p>AND perhaps the <hi>reason</hi> of this <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> might have been that very ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom mentioned before (as these <hi>Sacred Rites</hi> are the clearest Footsteps of <hi>ancient Customs</hi>) of entertainments, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of great Quality treated their Guests, tho sitting at other Tables with <hi>Portions</hi> sent to them from their <hi>own.</hi> So it is plain in the case of <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that they were not at the same Table with <hi>Joseph.</hi> It is expresly said, that his Servants did <hi>set on Bread for him by himself,</hi> and for his Brethren <hi>by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> and for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> which did
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40884:131"/>
eat with him by themselves: <hi>Genesis</hi> XLIII.32. Yet the <hi>Messes</hi> that were sent them, were sent them by his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Order, and from his <hi>own Table.</hi> For it should seem that it was not the custom at first to set down any thing but <hi>Bread</hi> on the <hi>other Tables</hi> of the <hi>Guests,</hi> and that the <hi>meat</hi> was left to the disposal of him who treated them, according to the respect he was pleased to shew them. Accordingly these <hi>Panegyres</hi> of the <hi>Gods</hi> were publick Entertainments of their Worshipers, and the <hi>Altars</hi> were answerable to the <hi>Tables</hi> whereon the Gods themselves were served in their <hi>own Persons.</hi> And as it was a piece of <hi>state,</hi> that how <hi>many</hi> Tables soever any great person had for his <hi>Guests,</hi> yet he never had any more than <hi>one</hi> for <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> so it was consequently proper that the <hi>Worshipers</hi> should all be treated with <hi>Portions</hi> from the <hi>same Altar.</hi> Besides, it seems to be the <hi>praegustation</hi> (if I may so call it) of the <hi>Gods,</hi> by which indeed the meat was thought to be <hi>consecrated,</hi> so that till the <hi>Gods</hi> had their <hi>Portions</hi> first, it was not fit to be feasted on by the <hi>rest</hi> as a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> This was therefore the sin of <hi>Ely</hi>'s Sons, that they would have their Portions <hi>before</hi> the <hi>fat was
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40884:132"/>
burnt</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> II.15, 16. And perhaps this civility of <hi>Praegustation,</hi> and the <hi>honor</hi> done them by receiving what <hi>himself</hi> had first <hi>tasted,</hi> and immediately from his <hi>own hand,</hi> might have been the reason why, in those secular Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the <hi>Guests</hi> were to receive their meat from their <hi>Patron's Table.</hi> But considering the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> as the <hi>Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and that between the <hi>Gods</hi> themselves and their <hi>Worshipers</hi>; so it was proper that both <hi>Parties</hi> that <hi>covenanted</hi> should <hi>partake</hi> in the <hi>same Entertainment.</hi> Otherwise their <hi>Feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> together could not have been a <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol</hi> of their <hi>Unity.</hi> But where multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were offered (as there were always great <hi>multitudes</hi> offered on the occasions I am speaking of) there was no possibility that <hi>all</hi> should partake of <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same Sacrifice.</hi> But it was <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi> as <hi>one</hi> when <hi>all</hi> of them came from the <hi>same Table,</hi> and for that <hi>reason,</hi> and that <hi>alone,</hi> all were judged to <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> with their <hi>God</hi> when they <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated</hi> from the <hi>same Altar</hi> with <hi>him.</hi>

Tho matters of <hi>Council</hi> have indeed been administred in many places by <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyarchical</hi> Governments, yet generally, even there where they were so, matters of <hi>Action</hi> have been thought best manageable by <hi>single Presidents.</hi> But however they were managed in <hi>secular</hi> Causes, yet the reason has been always thought so peculiar in <hi>Sacred</hi> Ones, as that I believe there can hardly be given an instance where the administration of these publick <hi>Panegyres</hi> was not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a <hi>single Priest,</hi> who presided over the rest.

As for the Representation of <hi>Mercury</hi> it is well known that one of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of that <hi>God</hi> was to conduct the <hi>Souls</hi> to <hi>Hades,</hi> and that his <hi>Caduceus</hi> had a particular influence over the <hi>Spirits</hi> of that place, and his <hi>Petasus</hi> or <hi>Orcus</hi> peculiarly fitted his employment in those <hi>invisible Regions,</hi> and that he had an acknowledged Power of <hi>bettering</hi> the <hi>passage</hi> of the <hi>Souls</hi> committed to his Charge. So was also the unclean Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of <hi>Banbo</hi> an Emblem of the <hi>Genesis.</hi> So that by the whole contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of these Representations the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign seems to be the <hi>signifying,</hi> and

it was that this <hi>Unity</hi> was derived according to the <hi>Hellenistical Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis.</hi> And the Apostle who seems frequently to allude to it,<note place="margin">Eph.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40884:156"/>
among the Philosophical <hi>Heathens,</hi> but the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves, especially the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenists,</hi> and alluded to in all the remaining Disputes in the like case in the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I now proceed further to shew the like <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Solidity</hi> of the same Argument as applyed to the Case of <hi>Christian SCHISMATICKS</hi> under the <hi>New Testament.</hi> And some things have already been taken notice of that will considerably prepare the way. It has already been observed that <hi>Christianity</hi> is nothing but a <hi>Mystical Judaism,</hi> and that this <hi>Assertion</hi> that it was so is the main thing endeavoured to be proved in the <hi>Discourses,</hi> and the <hi>Supposition</hi> that it was so is the main Foundation supposed in the <hi>Reasonings</hi> of the New Testament.

So far were they <hi>then</hi> from decrying this as a <hi>Legal</hi> Way of <hi>Reasoning,</hi> as our Brethren do <hi>now.</hi> It has likewise been
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40884:157"/>
observed that this agreeableness between <hi>Judaism</hi> and <hi>Christianity,</hi> or between the <hi>Literal</hi> and <hi>Mystical Judaism,</hi> held also in these very Particulars, that both of them were supposed to have a <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> and an <hi>Altar,</hi> I mean <hi>visible,</hi> as well as <hi>invisible</hi>; and that these <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> were to perform the same <hi>Offices</hi> with <hi>Christians,</hi> as they had done among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly that Reasonings were also al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed from the <hi>Priesthood</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to the <hi>Mystical Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> which were still kept up among the <hi>Christians,</hi> so that the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> in Reasoning thus did no more than what they could justifie by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Precedents</hi> in the <hi>New Testament.</hi> This Reasoning will especially hold, where the <hi>Design</hi> aimed at is <hi>common</hi> to <hi>Judaism</hi> with <hi>Christianity,</hi> that there the <hi>Means</hi> of prosecuting that <hi>same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> should be also <hi>proportionably</hi> the <hi>same.</hi> And therefore seeing that the <hi>Church</hi> is still a <hi>Society,</hi> and that a <hi>visible</hi> one under a <hi>visible Government</hi> proper to it self, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were; and seeing that <hi>external Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> are not by any one pretended to be <hi>antiquated</hi> parts of <hi>Judaism,</hi> but are <hi>still</hi> as seasonable,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40884:157"/>
and as necessary for the subsistence of such <hi>Societies</hi> as they were <hi>then</hi>; and that this way of keeping to the <hi>external Communion</hi> of the <hi>visible Priesthood</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> of our <hi>Christian Churches</hi> are as conducive to the maintenance of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity now</hi> as they were then: It plainly follows, that they ought <hi>actually</hi> to <hi>contribute</hi> to the same <hi>Design</hi> as they did <hi>then,</hi> That our <hi>Mystical Priesthood</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> ought as firmly to be adhered to in order to the preserving our interest in the <hi>Segullah now</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> thought themselves obliged to adhere to theirs, for claiming the like <hi>Privileges</hi> of the <hi>Segullah then.</hi>

            <p>BESIDES these things, it appears likewise how many of the <hi>Principles</hi>

him, so that <hi>none</hi> but <hi>Christians now</hi> can pretend to it, not even the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but upon a condition, common to <hi>them</hi> with any <hi>other Nations,</hi> that of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Christians.</hi> Their way of <hi>appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating</hi> this <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Patronage</hi> to <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> was by their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and their <hi>Altar.</hi> All the whole <hi>Nation</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> had a <hi>Right</hi> to partake of those <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and by consequence to that Patronage; and none of any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whilst they kept their National Distinctions, had any <hi>Right</hi> to partake with them at their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> tho they otherwise pretended to worship the same <hi>Supreme Being,</hi> and in the same <hi>way</hi> as they did. This was the Case of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> Ezr. IV.2. who yet were told that they had nothing to do with them, <hi>Verse</hi> 3. In excluding them from their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> they must needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their Title to the <hi>Mystical Invisible Sacrifices,</hi> and to that special <hi>Patronage</hi> of the <hi>Supreme Being,</hi> they denyed them any portion in the <hi>Holy One.</hi> And <hi>we</hi> also have an <hi>Altar,</hi> of which the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves,<note place="margin">Heb. XIII.10.</note> as well as the <hi>Heathens,</hi> have no <hi>Right</hi> to partake, but on the condition of <hi>Proselytism,</hi> who therefore, by the same Reasoning, can have no
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40884:158"/>
               <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>Invisible Sacrifices,</hi> and our <hi>God.</hi> Their <hi>High Priest</hi> also was a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of <hi>Unity</hi> as he presided over their solemn <hi>Panegyres,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> then celebrated on that occasion, not as a <hi>Head</hi> of their <hi>Proseuchae</hi> or <hi>Synagogues,</hi> or of those <hi>Assemblies</hi> wherein they met for the celebration of their <hi>ordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> And, by the same Reasoning, our <hi>Bishops</hi> ought to be <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Unity,</hi> not as <hi>presiding</hi> over <hi>Parishes</hi> and such subdivisions appointed for <hi>Ordinary As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,</hi> but as presiding in those <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi> which were common to <hi>whole Churches</hi> of one denomination, that is, as I have elsewhere shewn, of such as were <hi>Diocesans.</hi>

related peculiarly to the <hi>Mystical Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Sacrifice</hi> of the <gap reason="foreign">

his Dominion was peculiarly in the <hi>World</hi> of <hi>Spirits,</hi> and his Designs were principally for rescuing captivated <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> from the Dominion of their <hi>Bodies,</hi> and the Confinement of the <hi>lower World,</hi> which were also the principal designs of the <hi>Mysteries.</hi> And therefore here the Reasoning from the <hi>Jewish Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Priesthood</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> will peculiarly hold, if we consider them as <hi>Mysteries,</hi> ours being indeed no other than <hi>Mystical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.

in the same <hi>See,</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he mentions only <hi>some</hi> of them with whom he had conversed, tho he was sixty five years old at the writing of the <hi>Epistle.</hi> The <hi>Succession</hi> of those <hi>seven Bishops</hi> before him in the <hi>same See</hi> might very probably come <hi>near</hi> the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> And considering that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists on <hi>their Testimony</hi> as an Argument for proving an <hi>Apostolical Tradition,</hi> it must needs have been that the <hi>first</hi> of them lived in fresh memory of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> This way of Reasoning alone is agreeable to the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> of that <hi>Age</hi> in proving the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their <hi>contemporary Hereticks.</hi> They prove them indeed by the <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Tradition.</hi> But then they insist on no Testimony of any <hi>Church</hi> as competent for this purpose, but of those alone which had at first <hi>received</hi> their <hi>Traditions</hi> immediately from the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> themselves in <hi>person,</hi> and insist on no <hi>Succession</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> as competent for <hi>deducing</hi> such a <hi>Testimony</hi> to their <hi>own Times,</hi> but only such <hi>Successions</hi> whereof the <hi>first</hi> were <hi>contemporary</hi> with the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, that <hi>such Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> might <hi>receive</hi> their <hi>Traditions</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

to the agreement of both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in that Dispute, that the publick <hi>solemn Worship</hi> under the <hi>personal</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the <hi>High Priest</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> thought to Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> thought to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>; the very Foundation of that Dispute should be quite taken away, that <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>High Priesthood</hi> should be no more <hi>confined,</hi> neither to Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> nor yet to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Plainly he must still be supposed to mean the <hi>thing</hi> he discourses of, in the <hi>meaning</hi> of the <hi>Parties</hi> concerned in that Dispute, allowing only the liberty of <hi>Mysticizing</hi> it so far as the <hi>Gospel</hi> it self required that it should be <hi>mystically</hi> understood. The Question therefore, between the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> being concerning the <hi>Confinement</hi> of the <hi>High Priesthood,</hi> our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Answer must be understood to <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of that which should be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>High Priesthood</hi> under the <hi>Gospel.</hi> This must be the meaning of the Reason drawn from the <hi>Spiritual Nature</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>spiritual way</hi> of <hi>worshiping</hi> him. Not as our <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> are apt to understand it, that there should be no <hi>need</hi> of <hi>Priests</hi> nor <hi>Sacrifices</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:40884:164"/>
(that were to <hi>overthrow</hi> his <hi>own</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions under the <hi>Gospel</hi> it self else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) but supposing the <hi>continuance</hi> of the <hi>High Priesthood</hi> and such <hi>mystical Sacrifices</hi> as the <hi>Gospel</hi> allows of, to let them know however, that they should henceforth be so <hi>spiritual,</hi> as that all who did communicate in the <hi>same spirit,</hi> how distant soever their <hi>Residences</hi> were, might notwithstanding communicate in <hi>them,</hi> which they could not do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And still it is to be understood, not of <hi>single Congregations,</hi> but of the <hi>Congregations,</hi> at least, of <hi>whole Cities</hi> (for those <hi>publick Sacrifices,</hi> wherein the <hi>High Priests</hi> were concerned, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver designed for <hi>less</hi> than the <hi>whole Cities,</hi> how <hi>great</hi> and <hi>populous</hi> soever, where they were performed) that every <hi>City</hi> should have the same <hi>Privilege</hi> as <hi>Sichem</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to have <hi>Mystical Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>High Priests</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> with whom they might communicate without such tedious Journies as they of the <hi>Dispersion</hi> were fain to make at the return of their solemn <hi>Anniversaries</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And tho then the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> were guilty of <hi>SCHISM</hi> for erecting a new <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> and <hi>High Priest</hi> in a <hi>distinct City,</hi> and at a

               <hi>distance</hi> from <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; yet hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the like Charge should not hold. <hi>Distant Cities</hi> might have their particular <hi>High Priests</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> without any such <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>Unity</hi> and Peace between them. All this while this Dispute was between <hi>Cities,</hi> not <hi>single Congregations.</hi> And the liberty of having particular <hi>High Priests</hi> must therefore be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood at least of <hi>whole Cities,</hi> in which nothing bore such a natural resemblance to the <hi>Jewish High Priest</hi> as their <hi>Bishops.</hi>

undoubtedly be more favorable and willing to receive Conviction by what their Brethren had to say for the <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance</hi> of the <hi>Mystical High Priesthood</hi> as well as their <hi>Mystical Sacrifices.</hi> For this must have extremely conduced to the <hi>comforting</hi> them for the <hi>Ruine</hi> of their <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Priesthood,</hi> when they might yet enjoy their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Priesthood</hi> (which had been the greatest <hi>endearment</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to them) every where else more <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> than they did at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Nay, so far would it be from being <hi>scandalous</hi> now, that more than formerly, must, on these very accounts, be <hi>favorably</hi> affected to <hi>Christianity.</hi> And upon this account it was <hi>seasonable</hi> to advance the <hi>prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> when he was to <hi>succeed</hi> in the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>High Priesthood</hi> by the true Principles of <hi>Christianity,</hi> as we have all the reason we can desire from the footsteps of those times, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it was indeed, about this time, considerably advanced.</p>

according to the Canon of <hi>Neocae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarea,</hi> a number small enough for this attendance on the <hi>Bishop</hi> alone, but very much too small and disproportionable for the Service of the <hi>Presbytery</hi>; that, accordingly in <hi>Rome</hi> they vyed with the <hi>Presbyters</hi> themselves, which they could have had no pretence for if their Office had obliged them ordinarly to any Service to the <hi>Presbyters.</hi> But in the ancient <hi>Offices</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Eucharistical,</hi> the <hi>Deacons</hi> bore a considerable part, which were therefore not fitted for the use of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> alone, which makes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that it was intended that <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> should use the Office of <hi>Consecration</hi> when they were not with the <hi>Bishops.</hi> And herein also they answered the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> in the Old Law, who had their <hi>Offices</hi> in the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the Temple so that they could not be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.

            <p>THIS therefore being granted, it <label type="milestone">

very same Philosophy which made the others <hi>obnoxious</hi> to such influences.

Ep. 67. ad Theoph. <hi>For the Mysteries of the Christians are not so understood, as if the Deity were under any necessity of following the Materials or Words made use of in the Mystical Rites on account of any natural attractive Power in them, which may indeed be the Case of the Mundane Spirit; but so as that God is present at them from an inclination free from passion, and proper, and becoming a Deity.</hi> This <hi>Synesius</hi> had from the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> especially the <hi>Chaldee</hi> ones collected first in <hi>Verse</hi> by <hi>Julian</hi> sirnamed <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Original</hi> of the name of <hi>Eucharist</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> to this very <hi>Sacrament,</hi> that they intended thereby to signifie that this was, among them, to perform the Office of a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi> The very name was thus commonly applyed to the <hi>Bread</hi> it self in the time of S. <hi>Justin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</hi> So he tells us expresly: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> and <hi>Blessing</hi> that was used over it in the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Consecration.</hi> This giving of <hi>Thanks</hi> was no more than what was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally used by the <hi>Christians</hi> of those times in their common Meals, which yet were never therefore called <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists.</hi> Nor is it to be thought strange that the word thus used in the <hi>Abstract</hi> should be thus applyed. The ordinary form used concerning the other sort of Sacrifices which were expiatory is to call them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so used concerning them. So the <hi>Priests</hi> are said to eat the <hi>Sins of the People</hi>: Hos. IV.8. because they did indeed eat
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:40884:194"/>
their shares of those <hi>Sacrifices</hi> which were <hi>offered</hi> for the <hi>Sins</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi> This expression exactly answers our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Case.</p>
            <p>THUS far the Christians might <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> have been led into this substitution of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> as the proper <hi>Evangelical Sacrifice,</hi> even from the popular received Notions of the <hi>Hellenists</hi> concerning <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</hi> But yet, in this Reasoning from the Old Testament <hi>Prefigurations</hi> even of <hi>Evangelical Sacrifices,</hi> they might yet justifie a further <hi>Change</hi> from the common usages as designed by God himself in that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed should last for <hi>ever.</hi> Thus having shewn that <hi>Christ's Priesthood</hi> was not after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but a new <hi>Order,</hi> that of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> to which <hi>perpetuity</hi> was expresly appropriated by the <hi>Psalmist</hi>; the same Reasoning would then hold for an alteration in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which is used expresly by the Apostle himself to prove an alteration of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> If there be any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, it would rather be here that the Reasoning proceeds more strongly in the former Case. For the Notion of <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is more intrinsecally involved in the very Notion of a <hi>Priest,</hi> who has
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:40884:195"/>
no other Relation to a <hi>Covenant</hi> than that of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> nor mediates any otherwise than as the <hi>Covenant</hi> it self was entred into by such <hi>Sacrifices</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was <hi>his Office</hi> to preside. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his concernment in <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental to his concernment in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> so also the <hi>change</hi> of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> must necessarily suppose a <hi>change</hi> in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> as antecedent to it. And this would bring the Reasoning yet more close to the <hi>Materials</hi> of our <hi>Christian Sacrifice</hi> as consisting of the very Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> For if our Saviour's <hi>Priesthood</hi> was to be of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> then his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> must also be of the same kind as those of <hi>Melchizedec.</hi> And if we may again reason concerning the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedec</hi> from what is <hi>mentioned</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it in the <hi>Story,</hi> as the Apostle concludes his being <hi>without Father</hi> or <hi>Mother,</hi> or <hi>Genealogy,</hi> or <hi>beginning of Days,</hi> or <hi>end of Life:</hi> because the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>Genesis</hi> mentions neither his <hi>Father,</hi> nor <hi>Mother,</hi> nor <hi>Genealogy,</hi> &amp;c. Then for the same reason we may conclude that he had no other <hi>Sacrifice</hi> but that of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> because no other is mentioned in that place. Which <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:40884:195"/>
will the rather hold because of the <hi>Connexion</hi> of that Action with the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Priesthood.</hi> So it is in the Text, <hi>Melchizedec king of Salem brought forth bread and wine:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. XIV.18.</note> 
               <hi>and he was the priest of the most high God.</hi> The <hi>Vulgar</hi> reads it, <hi>Erat enim,</hi> with a Causal Particle. And unless some such thing be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, it will not be easie to give any tolerable account of the pertinency and <hi>connexion</hi> of the former part of the Verse with the later. For what <hi>relation</hi> could his bringing forth <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> have with his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> if not as the proper <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which concerned him as a <hi>Priest</hi>? Why should this <hi>Mystical Priesthood</hi> be mentioned as a <hi>Precedent</hi> of a <hi>future Priesthood</hi> (as it was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be by those who used this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning) unless it were also known what <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was to be proper to him, seeing that, in the same Reasoning, it was also granted that every <hi>Priest</hi> ought to have something to <hi>offer</hi>? And what was so proper for <hi>Melchizedec</hi> as a <hi>Priest</hi> as to meet <hi>Abraham</hi> with congratulatory <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Sacrifices</hi> for his <hi>Victory,</hi> and to entertain him and his Army with a <hi>Feast</hi> upon those <hi>Sacrifices</hi>? And why should <hi>Abraham</hi> return his thanks in a

way becoming him as a <hi>Priest</hi> by giving him the <hi>Tithes</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of his <hi>Spoils,</hi> the usual way of expressing their thankfulness to their <hi>Gods</hi> for <hi>Victories,</hi> according to the customs of those times, and which the Apostle understands to have concerned him as a <hi>Priest,</hi> when he thence concludes the <hi>preference</hi> of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of <hi>Melchizedec</hi> to that of <hi>Levi</hi> who <hi>payed</hi> Tithes to <hi>him</hi> in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>; unless himself had been first treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him as a <hi>Priest</hi> in that entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him? Whatever may be thought of the <hi>Reasoning</hi> it self as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting from <hi>Inspiration</hi>; yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considering the <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of that <hi>Age,</hi> there can be little reason to doubt but that this would have been the <hi>actual Reasoning</hi> of persons so <hi>circumstantiated,</hi> and so <hi>perswaded.</hi> And then considering them as persons for whom <hi>Providence</hi> was so peculiarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned as not to leave them to their own Reasonings in matters of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but only in such cases where their <hi>Reasonings,</hi> how <hi>fallible</hi> soever in themselves, were yet <hi>secure</hi> from <hi>actual error</hi>; it plainly follows that if they were <hi>left</hi> to them here, they must here also be <hi>secure</hi> from <hi>actual error.</hi> But
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40884:196"/>
then especially this Argument will hold when the whole Reasoning is grounded on such <hi>Principles,</hi> as are otherwise al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and supposed by such persons, whom all grant to have been assisted, in those very Discourses wherein they are supposed, by a <hi>Supernatural</hi> and <hi>Divine Inspiration.</hi>

            <p>IT hence appears how naturally this <label type="milestone">

               <hi>Reasoning,</hi> so agreeable to the <hi>Principles</hi> then granted by the <hi>Christians,</hi> does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on this Supposition, that the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi> was their <hi>Mystical Sacrifice.</hi> I might now proceed to shew that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Reasoning,</hi> but the <hi>Conclusion</hi> it self, was also owned by them, that they did own the <hi>continuance</hi> of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the times of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that they took the <hi>Eucharist</hi> for the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> proper to those <hi>times,</hi> if this had not been a <hi>common place</hi> usually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated between <hi>Us</hi> and the <hi>Romanists,</hi> where our <hi>Writers</hi> and our <hi>Church</hi> too, do usually grant as much as I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for, that it is indeed an <hi>Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Sacrifice,</hi> and that this is the true sense of those passages of Antiquity which are produced for this purpose.

               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:40884:197"/>
of <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifices,</hi> which is that which is denyed by our Writers. I am unwilling to inlarge on things already commonly observed, especially when what I am concerned for is already granted me on all hands, as it is here. I only observe now that this particular Reasoning is the Reasoning of S. <hi>Cyprian: Item in Sacerdote Melchizedec Sacrificii Dominici Sacramentum praefiguratum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus, secundùm quod Scriptura Divina testatur &amp; dicit; &amp; Melchizedec Rex Salem protulit panem &amp; vinum.

LXIII. <hi>Pannel.</hi> I mention this the more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:40884:197"/>
because S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Author in the whole Argument from <hi>One Priesthood</hi> and <hi>One Altar,</hi> that the Reader may see how accurately, what is said concerning it, is agreeable to his mind. Now these things being put together, That this whole <hi>Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> both <hi>Premises</hi> and <hi>Conclusion</hi> too, were owned by them, and that they were withal taken up from such <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> as could not fail them, it plainly follows that the whole <hi>Reasoning</hi> was <hi>solid</hi> as urged against the <hi>Ancient SCHISMATICKS,</hi> at least as to this Particular, That the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is a <hi>Mystical Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT that I may as little urge them with <hi>Authorities</hi> as is possible, who, I <label type="milestone">

that which was there <hi>spiritually</hi> offered to the <hi>Father.</hi> This <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed acknowledged alone for the <hi>true Sacrifice</hi> as the <hi>Platonists</hi> used the term of <hi>Truth</hi> only concerning the <hi>Archety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals,</hi> and the <hi>external Sacrifices</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were no further thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the name of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> than as they <hi>represented</hi> and <hi>transacted</hi> and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed</hi> the <hi>Benefits</hi> of that <hi>invisible Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> Which being supposed, it will plainly follow that, if the <hi>Christian Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi> do perform the same Office of <hi>representing,</hi> and <hi>transacting,</hi> and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying</hi> that <hi>invisible Sacrifice,</hi> this will have as just a claim to the name of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> as those <hi>visible</hi> Slaughters of <hi>Beasts</hi> had. Now to bring this home to the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> what is there that could be doubted of by any who lived in those times? that can be doubted of even by our Brethren themselves? Is it that <hi>Christ</hi> is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> who was supposed by the <hi>High Priest</hi> who offered the <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Sacrifice</hi>? Is it that his <hi>invisible Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> is most efficaciously <hi>represented</hi> and <hi>applyed</hi> by his <hi>external Oblation</hi> of himself upon the <hi>Cross,</hi> so that even those <hi>External Legal Sacrifices</hi> could no otherwise <hi>represent</hi> and <hi>apply</hi> the <hi>Virtue</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:40884:198"/>
of this <hi>invisible Sacrifice</hi> than as they pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily <hi>represented</hi> this bloody <hi>Evangelical Sacrifice</hi> on the <hi>Cross,</hi> and therefore hence derived immediately their very Title to the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Sacrifices?</hi> Is it that this Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Sacrament</hi> was <hi>designed</hi> purposely for this end, to <hi>represent</hi> that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our Blessed Lord upon the <hi>Cross,</hi> and more <hi>immediately</hi> so <hi>designed</hi> than those <hi>Legal Sacrifices</hi> themselves? I suppose our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries themselves will not doubt but that the <hi>Eucharist</hi> was <hi>designed,</hi> at least, to <hi>represent</hi> this <hi>Prototypical Sacrifice</hi> upon the <hi>Cross.</hi> But can they indeed think that <hi>Representation</hi> was all, and that <hi>Application</hi> was not <hi>designed</hi> also? Was there no <hi>Application</hi> in those <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> under the <hi>Law</hi>? Wherein then consisted the material <hi>Benefit</hi> of those <hi>Representations</hi>?

Or are the <hi>Evangelical Representations</hi> less <hi>efficacious</hi> than the <hi>Legal?</hi> What <hi>some</hi> of our dividing Adversaries may deny I know not; But I cannot foresee any thing in this Reasoning that would be doubtful either by the <hi>Reasonings</hi> of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> or the <hi>Sentiments</hi> of the most <hi>Ancient</hi> Times of <hi>Christianity.</hi>

               <hi>Incorporeal Sacrifice</hi> had to <hi>Corporeal</hi> ones in <hi>general,</hi> and therefore on the same account deserved the name of the <hi>true Sacrifice</hi> among <hi>Corporeal</hi> ones, as the <hi>Incorporeal</hi> did <hi>simply.</hi>

agreeable to the <hi>reason</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi> and was so also to the <hi>sentiments</hi> of those <hi>Ancients</hi> who used this way of <hi>Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> They therefore ascribed the <hi>Truth</hi> to these <hi>Archetypal Beings,</hi> because they thought them <hi>really</hi> to perform the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> signified by the <hi>name.</hi> Nay more, they did not think the <hi>sensible Beings</hi> to have any <hi>real</hi> influence in performing it, but that whatever <hi>efficacy</hi> they had was to be wholly ascribed to the <hi>Relation</hi> they had to these <hi>Originals.</hi> In which way of <hi>Reasoning</hi> the greatest Mysteries must be most effectual, and by how much the more Mystical any thing is, that is, by how much nearer any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches the first Archetypal Beings of all, by so much the more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious it must be proportionably.

That had been to have reflected on the <hi>Divine Institutions,</hi> even for the <hi>Seasons</hi> for which they were appointed.

is, to receive that Power <hi>immediately</hi> from <hi>themselves</hi> which, on this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, they could not have received from those <hi>Legal Representations</hi> any otherwise than as <hi>influenced</hi> by <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW this he proves from this <label type="milestone">

<q>Both that the <hi>Legal Institutions</hi> did not perform what they were designed for by any <hi>Native</hi> Virtue of their <hi>own,</hi> and that

adds that, for the honor of him who had required this at their hands, they ought to pay their duty without dissimulation. If they should do otherwise, he shews who would resent and punish it; <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Ignatius</hi> cannot seem so strange, these things being considered,

as they did to <hi>Blondell</hi> who had consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none of them.

compare them with the <hi>first invisible Archetypes</hi> of <hi>Unity</hi> (as that is indeed his great design in those Epistles in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the <hi>SCHISMS</hi> then ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing) then it was very proper for him to take notice only of the <hi>two Orders</hi> which were then immediately concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Office of Ministration, and then to compare them with <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> as this? Nor can it be thought strange that there should be <hi>several</hi> gradual intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual <hi>Archetypes</hi> as there were among
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:40884:215"/>
those which were <hi>sensible.</hi> But when his design is to compare the <hi>Ecclesiastical Judicatory</hi> to the <hi>first</hi> which was <hi>sensible, Deacons</hi> were not as yet instituted; and therefore the only comparison remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was between <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the <hi>Bishops</hi> with their <hi>Presbyteries.</hi> And then who sees not how aptly the <hi>Bishops</hi> will answer <hi>Christ</hi> himself, as <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding</hi> over their own <hi>Presbyteries</hi> the same way as <hi>Christ</hi> did over his <hi>Apostles</hi>? In each of these comparisons one <hi>Order</hi> is omitted, the <hi>Deacons</hi> in the later, and the <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the former. Why the <hi>Deacons</hi> are omitted, the Reason is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy given. Why the <hi>Presbyters</hi> are, the reason may be that they are sometimes reckoned as <hi>one Order</hi> with the <hi>Bishop,</hi> by those who never thought of any <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> therein, that is, by such who do as expresly reckon <hi>three Orders</hi> upon other occasions. Thus many of the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, as their Testimonies are produced by <hi>Blondell</hi> himself. And thus <hi>Philo</hi> before them sometimes reckons the <hi>High Priest</hi> in the <hi>same Order</hi> with the <hi>common Priests,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid. Disser. <hi>Cypr.</hi> ad <hi>Ep. Cypr.</hi> XXXIII.</note> sometimes he makes him a <hi>distinct Order</hi> by himself. So that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the <hi>Bishops</hi> being of the <hi>same Order</hi> with <hi>Presbyters,</hi> he might
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:40884:215"/>
however have as great a <hi>pre-eminence</hi> above them on account of his <hi>place</hi> as the <hi>High Priest</hi> had above the <hi>Ordinary Priests,</hi> which is as much as they <hi>do</hi> or <hi>need</hi> desire. However in the <hi>same Order</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> only as a <hi>Head</hi> is concerned as a <hi>Representative</hi> of the <hi>Mystical Unity</hi> which is the main thing designed in these <hi>Comparisons.</hi> Which is a <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> not agreeing to the <hi>common Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER because, on other <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> occasions, they reckoned them as <hi>distinct Orders,</hi> therefore there are not wanting such <hi>Mystical Representations</hi> of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Hierarchy</hi> as make it exactly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> even in this paricular also. Thus S. <hi>John</hi> in the Sixth Chapter of his <hi>Revelations</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents him who sate upon the Throne, the very expression used concerning the <hi>Bishops,</hi> even in those <hi>Primitive</hi> Times.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, so here are represented twenty four <hi>Elders sitting</hi> likewise on <hi>Thrones</hi> about the the <hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> That they were designed for <hi>Priests</hi> appears from
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:40884:216"/>
the circumstances of their <hi>Representation.</hi> They are cloathed in <hi>White Raiment,</hi> answering the <hi>Linnen Ephod</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> Verse 4. They have also <hi>Vials</hi> full of <hi>Odors,</hi> which are interpreted to be the <hi>Prayers of the Saints,</hi> and <hi>Harps</hi> to sing the <hi>Hymns</hi> which were usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally joyned with the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> Chap. V.8. What is this else but exactly the <hi>Office</hi> of ordinary <hi>Priests</hi> in those <hi>Times?</hi> That therefore they had also <hi>Crowns,</hi> Chap. IV.4. &amp;c. is only to intimate their being a <hi>Royal Priesthood,</hi> which was one of the <hi>Glories</hi> pretended to by the <hi>Literal Israel,</hi> and therefore, by the <hi>Reasoning</hi> then used, more justly claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by that which was <hi>mystically</hi> so. And it is thus expounded by those <hi>Elders</hi> themselves, <hi>Chap.</hi> V.10. that the <hi>Lamb</hi> had made them <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> to their <hi>God.</hi> That the number is exactly twenty four, was, in all probability de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from some <hi>Jewish Precedent.</hi> If we might trust the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> this was the number of the <hi>Elders</hi> in ordinary <hi>Cities,</hi> answerably whereunto the <hi>Great Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> consisting of <hi>three</hi> such as those had seventy two. And then this would very aptly fit the <hi>Christian Presbyteries</hi> which were ordinarily mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:40884:216"/>
by them according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Cities.</hi> But because <hi>Josephus,</hi> who knew better than any of these <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,</hi> owns but seven, and because those <hi>City Presbyters</hi> seem to have been rather for the <hi>Civil</hi> Government than the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical</hi> of those <hi>Cities</hi>; therefore as it will be more agreeable to the <hi>Interest</hi> of our <hi>Cause,</hi> so I believe it will be also to that of <hi>Truth,</hi> to derive it rather from an <hi>Ecclesiastical Council</hi> of the <hi>High Priest.</hi> And this might very probably be twenty four, exactly one out of each of the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> into which the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Jewish Priesthood</hi> was divided. As for the <hi>Rabbins</hi> they are all too late to give us any certain Information of matters of <hi>Fact</hi> in that <hi>Age,</hi> and I cannot foresee any better Testimonies of <hi>that Age</hi> why <hi>this</hi> might not have been the precise number. Nor will it the less fit our <hi>Hypothesis</hi> concerning the <hi>Christian Presbyteries,</hi> if it be remembred, what I have proved, that <hi>Christian Episcopacy</hi> is only a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the <hi>Jewish High Priesthood.</hi> Whence it will also follow that the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Presbyteries</hi> ought to be understood as answerable to that <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> which immediately related to the <hi>High Priest</hi> himself. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives

the number of twenty four, to be the number of the <hi>Apostles</hi> doubled, to shew the interest that the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>

               <hi>contemporary SCHISMATICKS,</hi> what can our Adversaries pretend why it should not be as good and solid <hi>still</hi>?

These things, alas! to say no more, are too ticklish for them to venture their immortal <hi>Souls</hi> on, and I doubt not but the more considerable among them will not so much as <hi>pretend</hi> them.

Is it that tho the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>SCHISM</hi> be <hi>eternally</hi> and <hi>equally</hi> criminal, yet it may change in its <hi>imputation,</hi> that the matter of <hi>Fact</hi> may be chargeable with <hi>SCHISM</hi> in <hi>one Age,</hi> as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> were guilty of <hi>SCHISM</hi> for separating from the <hi>Jewish High Priest,</hi> which yet the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> were not, tho they were likewise chargeable with the same <hi>Separation?</hi> But does it follow that because such Changes were allowable from the <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Institutions</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> therefore the like Change is also now allowable under
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:40884:226"/>
the <hi>Gospel?</hi> And have I not proved that the <hi>ancient Christians</hi> used this same <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,</hi> and used it <hi>solidly,</hi> even under the <hi>Gospel</hi>! That the <hi>Law</hi> had any <hi>Temporary Constitutions</hi> they concluded from the <hi>Praedictions</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> it <hi>self</hi> which <hi>foretold</hi> a <hi>Change</hi> in the <hi>later times.</hi> But can they pretend the like <hi>Change</hi> under the <hi>Gospel</hi>? Does the <hi>Gospel</hi> foretel any further <hi>later Days</hi> wherein its <hi>own Constitutions</hi> shall be antiquated also? Nay, do not the same persons stile the <hi>Gospel</hi> the <hi>Everlasting Gospel,</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Temporariness</hi> of many of those <hi>Legal Constitutions?</hi> Why so, if <hi>its</hi> Constitutions were also <hi>Temporary</hi>?</p>
            <p>BUT tho I should not take this <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>

And is not such a <hi>Constitution</hi> as naturally conducive <hi>still</hi> to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of an external Unity, as it was <hi>then,</hi> and will it not be so for <hi>ever</hi>? Will not all their little <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> Objections proceed as effectually against the <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> for <hi>Unity</hi> of such a <hi>Provision</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> as they do <hi>now</hi> against the same in <hi>ours</hi>? Can they in earnest think that the same <hi>Principles</hi> they insist on for justifying their present contempt of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Government</hi> and their present <hi>Separation,</hi> would not have <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> themselves to <hi>separate,</hi> if they had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in those <hi>times,</hi> or would not have <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused</hi> and <hi>justified</hi> those who <hi>did</hi> then <hi>separate?</hi> I speak not of the particular <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> which are <hi>change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> with the <hi>change of Circumstances,</hi> but of the <hi>Obligation</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> it self, and the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> which, of their <hi>own nature,</hi> are <hi>coeternal</hi> with
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:40884:229"/>
the <hi>Societies</hi> to which they belong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively. And it is too great an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of their consciousness of <hi>Guilt</hi> in this particular, that they are so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to undertake the <hi>Patronage</hi> of those <hi>Ancient SCHISMATICKS.</hi> Their late <hi>Church Historian</hi> is very kind to the <hi>Memory</hi> of the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatists.</hi> Why so, but that he seems sensible that his <hi>own Principles</hi> would have made <hi>him</hi> do as <hi>they</hi> did, if <hi>he</hi> had lived in those <hi>Circumstances</hi>? On the contrary, there is nothing in those <hi>Reasonings</hi> which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged persons to <hi>Submission</hi> to <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in those <hi>ancient times,</hi> which will not do so <hi>still,</hi> and for <hi>ever</hi>; and we have no reason to believe but that they, who, upon those <hi>Reasons</hi> thought themselves <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>Submission</hi> to their <hi>Ecclesiastical Governors,</hi> under pain of <hi>SCHISM, then,</hi> would, for the <hi>same Reasons,</hi> have thought themselves <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> to it <hi>now,</hi> under the same pain of <hi>SCHISM,</hi> if they had refused it.</p>
            <p>AS therefore an <hi>external Government</hi>

once <hi>erected,</hi> and fitting it to the end of maintaining a <hi>Mystical Unity.</hi> The <hi>Means</hi> we have seen then designed was the <hi>confining</hi> the <hi>Benefits</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> to the <hi>Solemnities</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and transacting the <hi>Solemnities</hi> by <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>confining</hi> the Power of <hi>Sacrificing</hi> to a certain <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Persons</hi>; so that none could <hi>partake</hi> of those <hi>Sacrifices</hi> but from <hi>them,</hi> and obliging every <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual</hi> to the <hi>Publick Panegyres,</hi> that none might think himself secure without a <hi>participation</hi> in those <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending those <hi>Panegyres</hi> to whole Cities, and confining the <hi>management</hi> of those <hi>Panegyres</hi> to a <hi>single Person.</hi> Now what is there in all this that our Brethren can think <hi>temporary</hi>

as the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> did prove that their <hi>Eucharist</hi> was a <hi>nearer</hi> draught of that same <hi>Sacrifice</hi> on the <hi>Cross</hi> than the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>Mosaick Law</hi>?

               <hi>Mystical</hi> Way of understanding things, so conveniently of any thing as of <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Bishop.</hi> I have shewn how, in the <hi>Mysteries,</hi> the <hi>Hierophanta</hi> was to <hi>personate</hi> the <hi>God</hi> who was concerned in those <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and that it was, on account of this <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonation,</hi> that he who <hi>communicated</hi> with the <hi>Hierophanta,</hi> was accounted to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> with the <hi>Deity</hi> represented by him.

Christ</hi> is a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Unity</hi> to <hi>Mankind,</hi> because he is the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Man,</hi> and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:40884:234"/>
               <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Unity</hi> even to <hi>Christ</hi> himself because he is the <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> And because none that has Interest in the <hi>visible Government</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> can <hi>represent God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> in this particular regard of <hi>Headship</hi> but the <hi>Bishop,</hi> therefore none but <hi>he</hi> can <hi>represent</hi> them as <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Unity.</hi> And therefore in this <hi>Mystical</hi> Way of <hi>Reasoning</hi> from <hi>Representations</hi> to <hi>Things,</hi> none but the <hi>Bishop</hi> can <hi>unite</hi> us to the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi> Whence it will further follow that whoever are <hi>disunited</hi> from the <hi>Visible Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> and particularly from that <hi>Visible Communion</hi> of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> must consequently be <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united</hi> from the whole <hi>visible Catholick Church</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> and not only so, but from the <hi>Invisible Communion</hi> of the Holy <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and which is yet more from <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>God</hi> himself, and all the <hi>Benefits</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to all these <hi>Unities,</hi> whether <hi>Visible</hi> or <hi>Invisible,</hi> which cannot in reason be thought <hi>communicable</hi> to him who is <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united</hi> from the <hi>Original</hi> from whence they flow.</p>

               <hi>formerly?</hi> This would indeed weaken the <hi>Obligation</hi> on <hi>God's</hi> part.
