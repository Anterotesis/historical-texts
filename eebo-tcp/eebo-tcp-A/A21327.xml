         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe lyttell boke whyche I sent to you at the begynnynge of lent last passed, a smal requitall of your gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll benefites, I haue caused nowe to be printed: as well for a testimonie of the herty loue, whiche I doo beare toward you, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge printed it maie the lengar endure with you and others, as also that my priuate gyft maie be beneficiall to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, whiche without disdaine or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy will oftentymes reade it. I knowe well, some men will thinke, and saie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so perchaunce, that I spende my witte vainely. for it is the office of priestes for to preache, and that it dothe not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to a knyght, muche lesse to a she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe, to write, specially of suche holy
<pb facs="tcp:5763:3"/>
mattiers. Also that in writyng to you, whiche are continually occupied about the kynges maiesties busynesse, I lose all my labour: considering that beside the tymes of meale and of slepe (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che also be littell and scarse, as I well haue perceyued) there remaineth with you none oportunitie to reade any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of englyshe or latin. Truely I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that priestes ought to preache, and that it is their propre office. And yet no christen man is excluded to gyue good counsaile in that whiche pertayneth to the lawes and commandementes of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty god. And he that can do it, and will not (though he be no priest) I dout not but he shall make a straite reknyng for hydynge his talent. A knyght hath receiued that honour not onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende with the swerde Christis faithe and his propre countrey, agaynst them, whiche impugneth the one or inuadeth the other: but also, and that most chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the meane of his dignitie (if that be imploied where it shuld be, and este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as it ought to be) he shuld more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually with his learnyng and witte assayle vice and errour, moste pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ennemies to christen men, hauinge
<pb facs="tcp:5763:3"/>
thervnto for his sworde and speare his tunge and his penne. And where for the more reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce due to the order of priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode, it is most congruent and sittyng, that preaching in commune assembles, be reserued onely to that ministracion, yet where a knyght or other man, not being of a lite estimacion, hath lernyng ioyned with moderate discrecion, yf he being zelouse of vertue, and meued on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by charitie, wolde fayne haue other men to remembre their state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and according to their dueties, to loue god, and to feare his terrible sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, what lawe or raison should lette hym, with an humble spirite and vncor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rupted intent, to set furth in writing or print, that whiche shalbe commodious to many men? And if he be a knight, or in other authoritie (for the rarenesse of learnynge founden in suche men) the warke shal be muche the better imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and of the moo men desyred. Also for asmuche as I am a sheriffe, I think my selfe the more bounden to bee thus occupied. For sens it pertaineth to myn office, and also the lawes of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme doo compell me to punishe trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressours: Howe muche more is it my
<pb facs="tcp:5763:4"/>
duetie, to doo the best that I can, by all studye and meanes to withdrawe men from transgressing the lawes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of god, whiche beinge diligently and truely obserued, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of transgressyng of temporall lawes should be clerely excluded? Moreouer as often as I doo consyder the temporall punyshementes, and doo abhorre the sharpenesse of theim, I do reuolue in my mynde, what horrible peynes are prepared for theim, whome the sonne of god shall condemne at his generall iugement, to the whiche, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall tormentes being compared, doo seme but a shadow: here begynne I to feare, not for my selfe onely, but alsoo for other, which either in transgressing goddis lawes, or neglectynge our due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do prouoke his wrath daily by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plesyng hym. Wherfore aswel for myn owne erudicion, as for the remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of other men, I haue gathered togither out of holy scripture this litle treatise: whiche often tymes radde and kept in remembraunce, shall be a preseruatiue against death euerlasting. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching your oportunitie in the receiuyng it, althoughe your ministraciou be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<pb facs="tcp:5763:4"/>
yet remembre the wordes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che our sauiour Christ spake vnto Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tha. What I meane therby, by redyng and digestyng that place, whiche is in the tenthe chapitre of Luke, ye shal ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily perceiue, without an expositour. At the least waie either by day or by night Martha shall finde oportunitie to sitte downe by her sister, if not, she shall find but litle thanke for all her good house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyfery. If Martha ministrynge vnto Christ temporally, had no more thanke for hir labor, what thanke shal we loke fore, whiche alwaie bee occupied about thynges that be worldly? thereby see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng onely our temporall commoditie. But yet in our dayly exercise we maie oftentymes ioyne the two systers togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well by secrete thankes gyuen to god for his sundry benefittes, as by frequent meditacion of our laste daie. Whervnto we shall fynde occasion, as often as we do here the bell ryng at the death or terrement of any man, or here reported of pestilence or warre, thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng theim than to be the trumpettes of death, whiche do call vs to reknyng. And as touchynge the readyng of this litle woorke, if ye do rede it in the masse
<pb facs="tcp:5763:5"/>
while, for lacke of tyme more conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, I dare vndertake, god will bee therwith nothyng offended: but ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therwith stered the more deuoutly to serue hym, he shall receyue it of you as a good praier, sens that meditacion and praier be but one thing in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And yet meditacion is the more constant. For in praier the mynde is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes wandring, and thinketh least on that, whiche by the tunge is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. In this wise dooinge, ye shall not lacke oportunitie to reade ouer this boke, whiche shall not seme longe vnto suche as I thinke that ye be, that is to saie, in whome witte ouerfloweth not grace, but gyueth place to her. Finally by readyng therof I trust vnto god we bothe shall receyue eche comforte of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well in this present worlde, as in the worlde to come: whiche is the perfection of amitie, whiche many mo men haue writen of, than haue truely vsed as they should doo. Thus I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte you to god, whom I moste herti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly praie, to keepe you alwaie in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour long to continue.</p>

            <p>THe hygh God commandeth, the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell calleth, the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet from heauen most terribly soundeth: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise ye that be dead, and come to the iugement: Whither I dooe eate or drynke (saieth saynt Hierom) or what so euer els that I doo, alwaye this voyce ryngeth in myne eares:<note place="margin">

               </note> Aryse ye that be dead, and come to the iudgement. As often as the daie of iugement cometh to my minde, my hert and all my whole body trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth and quaketh. This is spoken by the blessed man Hierom, who not only in his childhode and youthe spente his tyme vertuously, but also beinge come to the state of a man, excluded him self from all worldly busynesse, and lyuing to the age of .lxxxx. yeres, was euer con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinually occupied in spirituall exercise. Conferre his lyfe with our lyues, and lette vs beholde, yf we ought any lesse to remembre this sounde of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pette: Aryse ye that be dead, and come to the iudgement. O good lorde, howe should men here that be dead, and lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng lyfe? howe can a man ryse on his
<pb facs="tcp:5763:6"/>
feete, and if he can not goo? howe maie he than come to the iudgement? yes well enough, if thou consyderest what thynge that deathe is. Truely death is none other thing, than the priuacion of corporall sensis, with the departyng of the soule from the body. For whan we here not, neither see, neither smell, nor taste, nor yet feele, than truely we bee in dyeuge, or elles dead in deede. Christe calleth oftentimes to vs: Kepe (saieth he) the commaundementes:<note place="margin">

Leat vs nowe consydre, if we dooe heare hym: or yf we would seme to here hym. The man that is deafe will make a countenance as he dyd heare: also he that is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blynde will seme to see perfitely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thei would not haue their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment knowen. And therfore both the one and the other maie soone be decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Somme there be, that will saie, that thei see a thyng, whan thei looke not vppon it: And that thei heare one man speake, whan thei talke to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We in dede doo delite in thynges

that be carnall and worldly. And yet whan men speake of thynges which be spirituall and heauenly, we with our mouthes doo commende it, fynally in our hertes we do nothyng regarde it. We leat Christ speake what he listeth, but yet we ceasse not to talke with his ennemies, the diuell, the fleshe, and the worlde. Call ye that heryng? no true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

No man is so madde, that he woulde haue the thyng that he hateth. All this is the worlde. for of the worlde it cometh, and to the world shall it be lefte. And therefore the loue that we beare toward it, we do wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully take frome God, whoo oonely shuld haue it. Wherby we haue lost the more parte of our hearynge.

theim: to affirme that to bee in theim, that neuer approched theim: to speake fayre vnto theim, and thynke shrewdly of theim: to vse that thynge that they seeme to delyte in. And not that waye onely, but also how to fynde oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to gyue pleasures for the optayning thy purpose.

               <p>This persuasion of the worlde is won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derfull vehement. wherfore fewe men, and that with muche difficultie, maie well escape it. For it is a vile courage, that is not attached with Auarice. A gentyll herte for the more parte couey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth honoure, whiche is supposed to be

in authoritee: but in deede it maie be in nothynge, but in vertue onely. For honoure is nothynge but honestee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it hath ben vsurped for the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macion, that is in authoritee. And so is it take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Aristotle, to be the rewarde of Uertue.
