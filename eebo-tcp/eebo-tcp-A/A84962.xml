            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full and True Account of a moſt <hi>Barbarous Murther and Robbery</hi>
            </head>
            <argument>
               <p>Committed on the Body of Mrs. <hi>Johannah Williams,</hi> By one <hi>William de Fray,</hi> a French-man, at a Gravel-Pit near <hi>Barnet,</hi> in <hi>Hartfordſhire.</hi> Likewiſe of his being apprehended and taken, and committed to <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>-Goal. He Robbed her of a Gold-Watch, together with Three Guinneas, and one Five Shilling piece in Money, firſt having cut her Throat from Ear to Ear, then ſcarrified her Face, by reaſon ſhe ſhould not be known. And of his making his Eſcape towards <hi>Dunſtable.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>FOR as God hath ſaid, the Murther ſhall not go unpuniſhed, but that he ſhall be brought forth either in this World, or that which is to come;</hi> ſo it pleaſed God to order it, that a Gentleman was walking forth with his Blood-Hounds, that ſented the Carkaſs of this poor Murthered Gentlewoman, whereupon they went forthwith to it, the Gentleman following them, heard them Howl and run too and fro about the Pit, inſomuch that he looked down, thereupon he eſpied a dead Body, which behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſtood a ſmall time aſtoniſhed, but pheſently coming to himſelf, he run forthwith and made a Hue and Cry, withal ſatisfying the People in the Town of <hi>Barnet,</hi> that there was a great Murther Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Gravel-Pits aforeſaid, and he believed it was but juſt done, the People hearing him tell this moſt ſad and deplorable Story, run ſome one way and ſome another, and ſome to the Pit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon viewing the Corps, and Cloths of the deceaſed Murthered Gentlewoman, found her to be one of the Neighbouring Gentry, who was as I am inform'd was Walking a little diſtance from her Houſe, ſomewhat Early in the Morning, for a little of the freſh Air, and being pritty well Attired its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Villian had ſome miſtruſt of her having Money, and thereupon fell upon with his Blood-thurſty Hands, not being ſatisfied till he had Committed this moſt Vile and Deteſtable Tragedy.</p>
            <p>And although many Tragical Actions of this nature, have been often Committed of late, by ſeveral Barbarous and Bloody minded Villians, yet this does appear to be as Black as any, we have yet heard off, for could any one think, that a Fellow could have the Impudence to be ſo Notorious Wicked, as to offer any Violence ſo near the Houſe as that was, nay, not only ſo but at broad Day light, when all People were Walking on the Road, one would have thought the late Murther of the Worthy <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Bowles</hi>'s Lady were enough for an Example of all Perſons whatſoever, and to molifie the Sturdieſt and Strongeſt Heart in the World.</p>
            <p>Now the Hue and Cry being out run, this Barbarous and Bloody minded Villain, it forthwith ſtruck ſuch a Terrour to his Spirits, as God had ordered it, that he had not the Power to go any further, but forthwith went into an Inn at <hi>Dunſtable,</hi> where he ſat down and call'd for a Mugg of Beer, and ſome Bread and Cheeſe, which was preſently brought him, the Tapſter looking earneſtly upon him, ſee him look ſomewhat dejected, and withal a few drops of Blood upon his Ruffels, thereupon he went to his Maſter and told him there was a Hue and Cry paſt the Road about the Murther of one Mrs. <hi>Joannah Williams,</hi> who was found dead this Morning in a Gravel-Pit near <hi>Barnet,</hi> and he believed if this Fellow were fully Examin'd, they would find it to be him thereupon his Maſter order'd a Conſtable forthwith to be call'd; in the mean time the Maſter of the Inn approached the Company of this moſt Barbarian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Villian, ſaying, <hi>Sir your Servant</hi> and the like, and by way of diſcourſe asked him from whence he came, in a very reſpectful manner, in ſo much he could not have the leaſt cauſe of ſuſpicion, and ſo he told him from London, likewiſe he asked him whether he was going, he ſaid to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> in order to take Shipping for <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſo the <hi>French</hi>-man asked him if he ſhould reach to <hi>Stonyſtratford,</hi> and how many Miles it was to it, the Maſter of the Inn told him no, it would be to far, and he had better ſtay all Night.</p>
            <p>But in the midſt of their Diſcourſe, in come the Conſtable, who made no more to do, but examined him, at which the poor Monſieur who was ſo bloodily bent, was mightily aſtoniſhed; but the Conſtable forthwith had him before a Juſtice, who examined him from whence he came? and whither he was going? Likewiſe, how he came by that Blood on his Ruffels? But he could not give any good account of himſelf, therefore the Juſtice ordered a <hi>Mitimus</hi> to be made, and committed him to <hi>Hertford</hi>-Goal; and in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, confeſſed the Buſineſs to the Conſtable, who hath got a more particular Account, which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear againſt him at his Tryal; It is too long and tedious to repeat the particulars, therefore ſhall omit, by reaſon the Tryal will make it more plain to thoſe, who are deſirous to hear it.</p>
            <p>Nothwithſtanding the many repeated Examples that have been of late, it will no ways be a warning to leave off their vile and hideous Practices, and they not having the Fear of God before their Eyes, and giving their Minds full and wholly over to Covetouſneſs, and it works ſo much in the Minds of thoſe who are ſo hardened in Sin, that they value not the Laws of God and Man, but are grown ſo lazy, that they care not what wickedneſs they commit, to accompliſh the Deſires of their wicked Appetites, which this bloody-minded Villain, as I think to a very high degree ſhown in this moſt Bloody Tragedy.</p>
            <p>But here this Barbarous Villain, after his Commitment was made, he was forthwith delivered into the Cuſtody of the Goaler, to whom he declared, he was brought up a Gentleman, but the Loſſes his Friends had ſuſtained in <hi>France,</hi> by being forced to leave their Native Soil, to fly to Charitable <hi>England</hi> for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, having loſt all their Subſtance, he had nothing to ſubſiſt withal, and being in no manner of buſineſs, could not tell how to live. Therefore he being weak, not daring to truſt God's Providence.</p>
