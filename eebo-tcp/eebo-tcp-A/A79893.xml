            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CERTAIN QUERIES Concerning the PROPRIETY and RIGHT OF The Miniſtry of <hi>England</hi> TO TITHES.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether the Miniſtry of <hi>England</hi> hath not as good a Propriety in Tithes, as Noblemen, Gentlemen and Free-holders have in their Lands? The Reaſons of this Query are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>Ethelwolph</hi> ſonne of King <hi>Egbert</hi> (who had brought the <hi>Saxon Heptarchy</hi> into a <hi>Monarchy)</hi> had all <note place="margin">See S. <hi>Hen. Spelmans</hi> Councils. <hi>anno</hi> 855.</note> the Lands in <hi>England</hi> for his Demeſne, as is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in his <hi>Commentaries upon Littletons Tenures,</hi> and conferred the Tithes of all the Kingdom upon the Church, by his Royal Charter dated <hi>Anno</hi> 855. in theſe words, <hi>King</hi> Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolph <hi>by the conſent of his Prelates and Princes which ruled in</hi> England <hi>under him in their ſeveral Provinces, did enrich the Church of</hi> England <hi>with the Tithes of all his Lands and Goods by his Charter Royal,</hi> &amp;c. Adding in the end, <hi>That who ſo ſhould encreaſe the gift, God would pleaſe to proſper, and increaſe his dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if any ſhould preſume to diminiſh the ſame, that he ſhould be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it at Gods judgement ſeat,</hi> &amp;c. And this he did not only as Lord <hi>Paramount,</hi> but as <hi>Proprietary</hi> of the whole Land, the Lords and great men at that time having no property or eſtates of permanency, but as accountants to the King, whoſe the whole Land was, and yet they alſo gave their free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, which the King required, that thereby they might be barred from plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Tenant-right; as alſo to oblige them to ſtand in maintenance of Tithes againſt all pretenders.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the people can have no Right or Propriety in them; for they never bought or paid for them: Neither could they come by Inheritance; For that which was not their fore-fathers could not deſcend to them: Neither came they to them by Donation, which they can never ſhew.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether it be agreeable to Piety, Prudence, Juſtice and Equity to alienate Tithes from the Miniſtry, which have been ſo freely given by our own Chriſtian Kings out of zeal to advance Gods glory, confirmed by many Acts of Parliament, oft times renued, and reiterated, as by <hi>Magna Charta</hi> thirty times confirmed, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118467:3"/>
many other Statutes ſince, yea by the Text, and Body of the Common Law, which affirms Tithes to be due <hi>Iure Divine,</hi> as Sr <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> teſtifies in the <hi>ſecond part of his Reports.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether the inconveniences and evils can poſſibly be foreſeen, which will enſue upon the alteration of ſuch Fundamental Laws of this Nation, as have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in force through all changes for above a thouſand years together?</p>
            <p>Tithes have been given to the Church for maintenance of Gods word and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrs, with a curſe to all ſuch as ſhould alienate them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether it is agreeable to Piety and Prudence, to pull them from God, to rend them from his Church, to violate the Dedication of our Fathers, the Oaths of our Anceſtors, the Decrees of ſo many Parliaments, and to expoſe our ſelves to thoſe horrible curſes which the body of the Nation hath obliged it ſelf to, in caſe they conſented to the alienation of the ſame? as <hi>Nehem.</hi> 10. 32, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether it be not more then probable that the Miniſtry hath had a propriety in the Tithes in all Chriſtian Churches, ever ſince Chriſtians had a propriety in <note place="margin">Orig <hi>Hom.</hi> 11. <hi>in Num.</hi> Cypr. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 66.</note> their eſtates; ſince <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who lived not much above two hundred years after Chriſt, tell us, That the community amongſt Chriſtians was not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceaſed in their time, and yet where it was, the Tithes were paid?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whether it be not Sacriledge to alienate Tithes from the Church, having been dedicated and conſecrated unto God, either by the voluntary conſent of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or by Donation of Princes? Seeing what is voluntarily conſecrated by man, is confirmed by God, and may not be alienated, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Law is the ſame under the Goſpel, as appears in the example of <hi>Ananias,</hi> Acts 5. 3. whom <hi>Peter</hi> arraigns and God condemns, for this very Sacriledge: <hi>Why haſt thou</hi> (ſaid <hi>Peter) kept back part of the price of the Land? Whilſt it remained</hi> (viz. <hi>unſold) was it not thine own? and after it was ſold, was it not in thine own power?</hi> viz. to have conſecrated or not conſecrated it, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>And Ananias hearing theſe words, ſell down and gave up the ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Whether it is not againſt the light of Nature, and cuſtome of all Nations, to diſanull the <hi>Will</hi> of the dead? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Brethren, I ſpeak after the manner of men, though it be but a mans Covenant</hi> (or Teſtament) <hi>yet if it be confirmed (viz.</hi> by the death of the Teſtator) <hi>no man diſanulleth it, i. e.</hi> no man ought to diſanull it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Tithes having been given by Teſtament, confirmed by the death of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Is it not againſt the light of Nature, and cuſtom of all Nations to alienate them, Heb. 9. 16, 17. <hi>For a Teſtament is of force after men are dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Many Impropriations having been reſtored to the Church by godly Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen, and others having been bought in and ſetled in the moſt legal way that could be deviſed upon the Miniſtry; Is it not againſt all Juſtice and Equity to take them from the Church again? And will it not diſcourage all men for the future from works of Piety and Charity when they ſee them thus perverted?</p>
            <p n="9">9. Whether it be not more then probable that there was a poſitive Precept gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by God to the Fathers for the giving to him the tenth part of their ſubſtance, as he had formerly required the ſeventh part of their time? And whether do not the examples of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> ſo readily giving their tenth, evince this? Or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a Precept, Had it not been will-worſhip in them? And do not ſuch poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precepts (if unrepealed) binde all to the end of the world? as we ſee in the caſe of the Sabbath.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Whether Tithes, as an honouring of God be not enjoyned in the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment? As they tend to preſerve the publike worſhip of God, in the ſecond
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118467:3"/>
and fourth Commandment? And as maintenance to the perſors of Miniſters, in the fifth Commandment? being part of the honour due to ſpirituall Parents.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Whether Tithes can be called <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> which were paid ſo long before <hi>Antichriſt</hi> time? And when <hi>Antichriſt</hi> [the Popes of <hi>Rome]</hi> were the firſt that durſt take upon them to alienate them from the Church, by granting Exemptions, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thereby robbing the Church and Pariſh Miniſters to gratifie the <note place="margin">This alſo is juſtified by <hi>

14. Whether to ſpeak of a ſufficient maintenance without Tithes, be not a meer fancy, that never was, nor (as I believe) ever will be brought into action? And whether it would not trouble the wiſeſt men that are, to name a ſtipend that would be ſufficient at all times, as Tithes are; which proceeding from the wiſdome of God, cannot be matched, much leſſe bettered by mans wiſdome?</p>
            <p n="15">15. Whether be not Tithes the fitteſt maintenance for the Miniſtry, ſeeing hereby they partake with the people in times of plenty, which will more inlarge their hearts in thankfulneſſe; and ſuffer with them in times of ſcarcity, which will more affect them with ſenſe of Gods judgements? for that when natural affections concur with ſpiritual, they are more active and vigorous.</p>

               <head>Certain Queries concerning bringing Tithes into a Common Treaſury, and reducing Miniſters to ſtipends.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IF Tithes ſhould be brought into a commoon Treaſury, and Miniſters paid out thence, whether would our Country-men, that ſay Tithes are ſuch an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable burden, be any whit eaſed? Yea would they not be more burdened by how much their Tithing would be looked more narrowly into?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Would not the trouble of Miniſters be far greater, being enforced to ſend or go from Market to Market for every buſhel of Corn or Mault, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he ſpends in his houſe?</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a dearth come, would it not tend to the ruine of many Miniſters families, who will be forced to ſpend more in a quarter then they receive for their half years allowance?</p>
               <p n="4">4. If things ſhould riſe in the price the next hundred of years as they have done the laſt, how ſhall Miniſters be then able to live upon theſe ſtipends?</p>
               <p n="5">5. How many Officers muſt there be imployed in every County to bring the Tithes into a common Treaſury, all which, either in whole or in part, muſt be maintained out of them? And how will this curtail the Miniſters ſhare?</p>
               <p n="6">6. What attendance muſt Miniſters give quarterly, or each half year, upon the Truſtees or Treaſurers in every County, till they have liſt or leiſure to pay them? What trouble, journeys and expences will this put them to? How will they be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to bribe, and pay for expedition, or to be fobbed off with baſe and clipt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? or to be forced to take wares for their money, if the Treaſurers be Tradeſmen; as many have been ſerved of late in the caſe of Augmentations?</p>

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118467:4"/>
7. Will not Miniſters hereby be caſt upon tentations, to ſpeak onely pleaſing things (like Trencher-Chaplains) leſt their ſtipends ſhould be taken from them?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Can it be expected that Miniſters can or will be ſo liberall to the poor, and given to hoſpitality when they buy all with the penny, as when they have it in Tithes?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Will not ſuch as bear the bag, and upon whom the Miniſters muſt depend for their ſubſiſtance, Lord it over them with pride and contempt enough? as bad, or worſe then the Biſhops and their Chancellors did?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Though ſuch as are of the beſt repute in each County ſhould be choſen out to be the Treaſurers, yet do we not ſee by daily experience, how men are miſtaken in judging of the honeſty of others? And how many men fall from their former principles of honeſty? and that if neither of theſe ſhould be ſo, yet how apt ſtanding waters are to putrifie?</p>
               <p n="11">11. If contentious ſuits have been betwixt Miniſters and People about Tithes, hath it not for the moſt part ariſen from the peoples covet<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="12">12. Were not Patrons at the firſt made choice of to defend the Miniſters right againſt the fraud and injuſtice of the people? And may not the wiſdome of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament finde out the ſame, or ſome ſuch like courſe, whereby the Miniſter ſhall neither be ingaged in contentions with his people, nor troubled with avocations from his ſtudy thereby?</p>
               <p n="13">13. May there not ariſe as many or more quarrels in caſe Tithes be brought into a common Treaſury, whileſt ſome pretend conſcience, and ſo will pay none at all; others think themſelves over rated; others think that the Tradeſman, who gets more by his Shop then they do by the Plough, ſhould bear an equal ſhare in this common burden? And who then ſhall take courſe to enforce ſuch to pay? If the Treaſurers in the Country, ſurely they will prove but cold Solicitors in anothers cauſe. But ſuppoſe they do ſtir, they muſt ſpend out of the common ſtock; and ſuch ſuits being like to be many, eſpecially in ſuch times as theſe, how will the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſtipends be curtailed thereby? Beſides, may it not be ſuppoſed, that they which ſpend of other mens purſes, are like to cut large thongs out of others hides?</p>
               <p n="14">14. If the Countryman ſhall pay a rate in money for his Tithes, will it not come far more hardly from him? even like drops of bloud, money being uſually very ſhort with them. And will he not think it far eaſier to part with a cock of Hay, or a ſheaf of Corn, or ſuch a ſmall thing, then to part with ſo much money as his whole Tithes may come to, once or oftner in the year? And how little will he think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf eaſed hereby?</p>
               <p n="15">15. If Tithes be brought into a common Treaſury, when a Living is worth two, three, or perhaps four hundred pounds by the year, a great part of it will be diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of to other places, and will it not certainly be a great grief to the people, that their Tithes ſhall go to they know not whom? certainly to ſuch as neither feed their ſouls with the bread of life, nor their bodies with the ſtaff of bread? And will not their poor want that relief, and themſelves that entertainment which they uſed to have at their Miniſters houſe, to the aggravation of their diſcontent?</p>

               <p n="1">1. VVHether have we not cauſe to ſuſpect, that thoſe perſons which petition againſt Tithes and an impoſed Maintenance, are acted by Jeſuites, who cunningly creep in amongſt them, ſeeking hereby to overthrow the Engliſh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, which hath ſo ſtrongly oppoſed them, both by word of mouth and writings? And the rather, becauſe of that Scottiſh Jeſuite, who lately turned Anabaptiſt, and <note place="margin">I have good information that there are lately come over 100.

And the removing of our Teachers into corners, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether have vve not cauſe to believe that the far greateſt part of the Gentry, Yeomandry and commons of the Land, that have Tithes to pay, are deſirous to have them continued to the Miniſtry: ſeeing ſo many thouſands of them out of a few Counties petitioned the late Parliament for the ſame: And no doubt but many thouſands more out of every County would do the like, if they had the leaſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement thereunto.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether if Tithes were wholly taken away, would the generality of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be at all eaſed, ſeeing both Purchaſers and Tenants muſt pay ſo much the more for their Land?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whether can we imagine that the Parliament, that hath ſo lately declared to the world, <hi>That they will be exceeding tender of every ones Liberty and Property,</hi> will now ſo ſoon after take away the Propriety of all the Miniſtry of <hi>England</hi> at one blow, to the ruine of ſo many thouſand Families for the preſent; to the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Parents from bringing up their Children to the Work of the Miniſtry for time to come, and ſo to the indangering of the removall of the Goſpel from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whether would not theſe Petitioners (if Tithes were removed) cry out and complain as much of the tyrannicall oppreſſion and burden of Rents, as the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> did, and ſo never be quiet till they have levelled all things?</p>
