            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>MUSICK in ancient Times was held in as great Estimation, Reverence and Honour, by the most Noble and Virtuous Persons, as any of the Liberal Sciences whatsoever, for the manifold Uses thereof, conducing to the Life of Man: Philosophers accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it an Invention of the Gods, bestowing it on Men, to make them better conditioned than bare Nature afforded; and concludes a special necessity thereof in the Education of Children, partly from its natural delight, and partly from the efficacy it hath in moving the Affections to Virtue; commending chiefly these three Arts in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if in the whole I gain your ingenious Acceptance, it will further encourage me to do you more Service in this Nature.</p>

                  <p>MVSICK is an Art unsearchable, Divine and Excellent, by which a true Concordance of Sounds or Harmony is produced, that rejoyceth and cheereth the Hearts of Men, and hath in all Ages and in all Countries been highly reverenced and esteemed; by the <hi>Jews</hi> for Religion and Divine Worship in the Service of God, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by Scripture; By the <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> to induce Virtue and Gravity, and to incite to Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>These Six Notes were thus used for many years past in that order, <hi>ascending</hi> and <hi>descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>; but in these latter times, Four are only in use, the which are <hi>Sol, La, Mi, Fa</hi>; so that <hi>Ut</hi> and <hi>Re</hi> are now changed into <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>La,</hi> four being found sufficient for expressing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97795:9"/>
the several sounds, and less burthensome for the memory of Practitioners.</p>
                     <p>Besides the Names of these <hi>Notes,</hi> there is used in our <hi>Scale of Musick,</hi> called the <hi>Gam-ut,</hi> seven Letters of the <hi>Alphabet,</hi> which are set in the first Column, at the beginning of each Rule and Space, as <hi>G. A. B. C. D. E. F.</hi> And of these there are Three Septenaries ascending one above the other, <hi>G</hi> being put first, which is according to the third Letter in the <hi>Greek</hi> Alphabet, called <hi>Gamma,</hi> and is made thus <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, (the first derivation thereof being from the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi>) as you may see in the <hi>Scale</hi> at the end of this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>These seven Letters of the Alphabet are called seven <hi>Cliff's,</hi> or more properly <hi>Cleaves,</hi> the other Names and Syllables adjoyned to them are the <hi>Notes</hi>; and by these three Septe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries are distinguish'd three several <hi>Parts</hi> of Musick, into which the Scale is divided; first, the <hi>Bass,</hi> which is the lowest part; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the <hi>Mean,</hi> or middle part; and thirdly, the <hi>Treble,</hi> or highest part; so that according to these <hi>three Septenaries, Gam-ut</hi> is the lowest Note, and <hi>E la</hi> the highest. And this the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual <hi>Gamuts</hi> in Mr. <hi>Morley</hi> and others, did not exceed; but it is well known that there is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Notes</hi> in use, both above and below, which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97795:9"/>
exceed that compass, and that both in <hi>Vocal</hi> and <hi>Instrumental</hi> Musick, which ought not to be omitted; for the Compass of Musick is not to be confin'd: And though there be but three Septenaries of Notes in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Gam-ut,</hi> which amount to the Compass of One and Twenty Notes or Sounds; yet in the <hi>Treble,</hi> or highest part, as occasion requires, you may <hi>Ascend</hi> more Notes, for it is the same over again, only eight Notes higher: Or in your <hi>Bass,</hi> or low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part you may <hi>Descend</hi> the like Notes low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than <hi>Gam-ut,</hi> as the Compass of the <hi>Voyce</hi> or <hi>Instrument</hi> is able to extend, the which will be the same, and only <hi>Eights</hi> to those above. And these Notes of Addition are usually thus distinguished:</p>
                     <p>Those above <hi>E la</hi> are called Notes in <hi>Alt,</hi> as <hi>F fa ut,</hi> and <hi>G sol re ut, &amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Alt.</hi> And those below <hi>Gam-ut</hi> are called <hi>double Notes,</hi> as <hi>Double F fa ut, Double E la mi, &amp;c.</hi> as being <hi>Eights</hi> or <hi>Diapasons</hi> to those above <hi>Gam-ut.</hi> I have therefore in the Table of the <hi>Gam-ut</hi> in this Book, expressed them with double Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their right places.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Gam-ut</hi> is drawn upon fourteen <hi>Rules</hi> and their <hi>Spaces,</hi> and doth comprehend all Notes or Sounds usual in <hi>Musick;</hi> either <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:97795:10"/>
or <hi>Instrumental,</hi> yet when any of the parts which it is divided into, <hi>viz. Treble, Mean,</hi> or <hi>Tenor</hi> and <hi>Bass,</hi> shall come to be prick'd out by it self in <hi>Songs</hi> or <hi>Lessons,</hi> either for <hi>Voyce</hi> or <hi>Instrument, five lines</hi> is only usual for one of those Parts, as being sufficient to contain the compass of <hi>Notes</hi> thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing: And if there be any <hi>Notes</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend higher or lower, it is usual to add a <hi>line</hi> in that place with a Pen.</p>
                     <p>But all <hi>Lessons</hi> for the <hi>Organ, Virginals,</hi> or <hi>Harp,</hi> two staves of <hi>six lines</hi> together are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, one for the left hand or <hi>lower Keys,</hi> the other for the right hand or <hi>upper Keys.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore he that means to understand what he <hi>Sings</hi> or <hi>Plays,</hi> must study to be perfect in the knowledge of the <hi>Scale</hi> or <hi>Gam-ut,</hi> and to have it perfect in his memory without book, both forward and backward, and to distinguish the <hi>Cliffs</hi> and <hi>Notes</hi> as they be in <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Space;</hi> for knowing the <hi>Notes</hi> Places, their Names are easily known.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>In these Three observe this for a General Rule, that what <hi>Name</hi> the <hi>Note</hi> hath, the same <hi>Name</hi> properly hath his <hi>Eighth</hi> above or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, be it either in <hi>Treble, Mean, Tenor,</hi> or <hi>Bass.</hi>

                     <p>The fourth <hi>Cliff</hi> is the <hi>B Cliff,</hi> which is proper to all parts, as being of two natures or properties, that is to say, <hi>Flat</hi> or <hi>Sharp,</hi> and doth only serve for that purpose for the <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> and <hi>sharping</hi> of Notes, and therefore it is called <hi>B fa, B mi</hi>; the <hi>B fa</hi> signifies <hi>flat,</hi> the <hi>B mi sharp:</hi> The <hi>B fa,</hi> or <hi>B flat,</hi> is known on <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Space</hi> by this mark [<gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But these two Rules you are to observe of them both: First the <hi>B fa,</hi> or <hi>B flat,</hi> doth alter both the name and property of the <hi>Notes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which it is placed, and is called <hi>Fa,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it half a <hi>tone</hi> or <hi>sound</hi> lower than it was before.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the <hi>B mi,</hi> or <hi>B sharp,</hi> alters the property of the <hi>Notes</hi> before which it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but not the Name; for it is usually pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced either before <hi>Fa</hi> or <hi>Sol,</hi> and they retain their Names still, but their Sound is raised half a <hi>tone</hi> or <hi>sound</hi> higher.</p>
                     <p>Note, That these two <hi>B Cliffs</hi> are placed

not only at the beginning of the Lines with the other <hi>Cliff,</hi> but is usually put to several Notes in the middle of any <hi>Song</hi> or <hi>Lesson</hi> for the <hi>Flatting</hi> and <hi>Sharping</hi> of Notes, as the Harmony of the Musick requires.</p>

                     <p>HAving observed the foregoing Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of proving your <hi>Notes,</hi> to know their Places, you may easily know their Names also, if you will follow this Rule: First, observe that <hi>Mi</hi> is the principal or master Note, which leads you to know all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for having found out that, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers follow upon course; and this <hi>Mi</hi> hath its being in four several places, but it is but in one of them at a time; its proper place is in <hi>B mi,</hi> but if a <hi>B fa,</hi> which is a <hi>B flat</hi> (as is mentioned in <hi>chap.</hi> 2.) be put in that place, then it is removed into <hi>E la mi,</hi> which is its second place; but if a <hi>B flat</hi> be placed there also, then it is in its third place, which is <hi>Alamire</hi>; if a <hi>B flat</hi> come there also, then it is removed into its fourth place, which is <hi>D la sol re</hi>; so that in which of these it is, the next Notes above it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending are <hi>Fa sol la, Fa sol la,</hi> twice, and then you meet with your <hi>Mi</hi> again, for it is found but once in Eight Notes: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>near,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97795:14"/>
the Notes next below it descending are <hi>L sol fa, La sol fa,</hi> and then you have your <hi>Mi</hi> again: For your better understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of which, I have here inserted the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned old Metre, whose Rules are plain, true, and easie.</p>

                     <p>These Rules and Examples being seriously perused by the Learner, will infallibly direct him in the right naming of his Notes, which is a very great help to the Singer; for there is nothing makes him sooner mistake his tune in Singing, than the misnaming of his Notes: Therefore for the better understanding the Rule of naming your Notes, by finding your <hi>Mi</hi> in its several places, cast your eye on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Example, for the like naming your Notes in any Cliff whatsoever, be it <hi>Bass, Trebl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The which several Parts are demonstrated by those little Arches, or Columns, on the right side of the following Example.</p>

And because I will omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may be useful to Practitioners, I have set down a third Example of the naming of the Notes in all Parts and Cliffs, as the Flats are assigned to all Cliffs.</p>

                     <p>THus having briefly given you plain and familiar Rules for the understanding the nature and use of the <hi>Gam ut,</hi> it will be necessary, before I set down your first plain <hi>Songs,</hi> to insert a word or two concerning the <hi>Tuning of the Voyce,</hi> in regard none can attain the right guiding or ordering their <hi>Voyce</hi> in the <hi>rising</hi> and <hi>falling</hi> of several <hi>Sounds</hi> which are in <hi>Musick</hi> (at first) without the help of another <hi>Voyce</hi> or stringed <hi>Instrument.</hi> They are both of them extraordinary helps, but some <hi>Voyces</hi> are best guided by the <hi>sound</hi> of an <hi>Instrument,</hi> and better, if the Learner have skill thereon to express the several sounds, so that his <hi>Voyce</hi> may go along with the <hi>Instrument,</hi> in the <hi>ascending</hi> and <hi>descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> of the several <hi>Notes</hi> or <hi>Sounds.</hi> And (if not) if an <hi>Instrument</hi> be sounded by another who is an <hi>Artist,</hi> so the Learner hath a good <hi>Ear</hi> to guide his <hi>Voyce</hi> in <hi>unity</hi> to the <hi>sound</hi> of the <hi>Instrument,</hi> it will with a little pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, by sometimes singing with, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without) guide his <hi>Voyce</hi> into a perfect <hi>Harmony,</hi> to sing any plain <hi>Song</hi> with exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97795:18"/>
I mean by <hi>Tuning his Notes</hi> perfectly, <hi>Ascending</hi> and <hi>Descending,</hi> and also in the <hi>rising</hi> or <hi>falling</hi> of a <hi>Third,</hi> a <hi>Fourth,</hi> or <hi>Fifth,</hi> and <hi>Sixth, &amp;c.</hi> as in the following <hi>Plain Songs</hi> are set down. At the first guiding the <hi>Voyce</hi> therein, it will much help if you observe this Rule; for a <hi>Third ascending,</hi> which is from <hi>Sol</hi> to <hi>Mi,</hi> at your first <hi>Tuning</hi> sound by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees all three Notes, as <hi>Sol La Mi,</hi> then at second <hi>Tuning</hi> leave out <hi>La,</hi> the middle Note, and so you will Tune from <hi>Sol</hi> to <hi>Mi,</hi> which is a <hi>Third.</hi> This Rule serves for the rising of <hi>Fourths</hi> or <hi>Fifths, &amp;c.</hi> as your third <hi>Plain Song</hi> in the next page directs.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Observe that in the Tuning of your <hi>Voyce</hi> you strive to have it cleer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the expressing of your <hi>Voyce,</hi> or Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Notes,</hi> let the <hi>Sound</hi> come clear from your <hi>throat,</hi> and not through your <hi>teeth,</hi> by sucking in your breath, for that is a great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to the clear utterance of the <hi>Voyce.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, observe that in Tuning your first <hi>Note</hi> of your <hi>plain Song,</hi> you equal it so to the pitch of your <hi>Voyce,</hi> that when you come to your highest <hi>Note,</hi> you may reach it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Squeaking, and your lowest <hi>Note</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grumbling.</p>

                     <p>OBserve that the two <hi>B Cliffs</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned are used in Song for the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and sharping Notes. The property of the <hi>B flat</hi> is to change <hi>Mi</hi> into <hi>Fa,</hi> making that Note to which it is joyn'd a <hi>Semitone</hi> or half a Note lower; and the <hi>B sharp</hi> raiseth the Note before which it is set a <hi>Semitone</hi> or half a <hi>sound</hi> higher, but alters not its Name; so that from <hi>Mi</hi> to <hi>Fa,</hi> and likewise from <hi>La</hi> to <hi>Fa,</hi> is but a <hi>Semitone</hi> or a half Note, between any two other Notes it is a perfect <hi>Tone,</hi> or <hi>sound,</hi> as from <hi>Fa</hi> to <hi>Sol,</hi> from <hi>Sol</hi> to <hi>La,</hi> from <hi>La</hi> to <hi>Mi,</hi> are whole <hi>Tones,</hi> which is a perfect <hi>Sound.</hi> And this may be easily distinguished, if you try it on the Frets of a <hi>Viol</hi> or <hi>Lute,</hi> you shall perceive plainly that there goes two <hi>Frets</hi> to the stopping of a whole <hi>Note,</hi> and but one <hi>Fret</hi> to a half <hi>Note;</hi> so that it is observed that <hi>Mi</hi> and <hi>Fa</hi> do only serve for the <hi>flatting</hi> or <hi>sharping</hi> all <hi>Notes</hi> in the <hi>Scale,</hi> and they being rightly understood, the other <hi>Notes</hi> are easily applyed to them; for if <hi>G sol re ut</hi> have a sharp set before it, it's the same in sound with <hi>A la mi re</hi> flat; and <hi>B fa B mi</hi> flat, is the

                     <p>MEasure in this Science is a Quantity of the length and shortness of Time, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Natural Sounds pronounced by the Voyce, or Artificial, upon Instruments; which Measure, is by a certain motion of the hand or foot expressed in variety of Notes. These Notes in Musick have two Names, one for Tune, the other for Time or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Notes to certain Sounds. The Names of Notes in Tuning I have set down in the former Chapter, being Four, <hi>Sol, La, Mi, Fa.</hi> Those in the Proportion of Time are Eight, as a <hi>Large, Long, Breve, Semibreve, Minim, Crotchet, Quaver,</hi> and <hi>Semiquaver,</hi> expressed at the beginning of this Chapter: The four first are Notes of Augmentation or Increase, the four last of Diminution or Decrease. The <hi>Large</hi> is the first of Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97795:20"/>
being longest in sound; and the <hi>Semibreve</hi> the last of Augmentation, being shortest in sound: In Time, it is called the <hi>Master-Note,</hi> being of one certain Measure by it self. All the other Notes, both of Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and Diminution, are measured by or proportioned to its value: The <hi>Large</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains eight <hi>Semibreves,</hi> the <hi>Long</hi> four, and the <hi>Breve</hi> two. The Notes of Diminution, <hi>viz. Minim, Crotchet, Quaver,</hi> and <hi>Semiquaver,</hi> are reckoned to, as the others were measured by the <hi>Semibreve;</hi> and, according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary proportion of Time, two <hi>Minims</hi> are accounted to the <hi>Semibreve,</hi> two <hi>Crotchets</hi> to the <hi>Minim,</hi> two <hi>Quavers</hi> to the <hi>Crotchet,</hi> and two <hi>Semiquavers</hi> to the <hi>Quaver.</hi>

                     <p>OBserve that to the Measure of the <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breve</hi> all Notes are proportioned, and its Measure is expressed (by a Natural Sound of the Voyce, or Artificial on an Instrument) to the moving of the hand or foot <hi>up</hi> and <hi>down</hi> when its measure is whole; in Notes of Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, the Sound is continued to more than one <hi>Semibreve</hi>; but in Notes of Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Sound is variously broken into <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims, Crotchets,</hi> and <hi>Quavers,</hi> or the like: So that in keeping time your hand goes down at one half, which is a <hi>Minim,</hi> and up at the next. For the more ease at first, if you have two <hi>Minims,</hi> or four <hi>Crotchets,</hi> as in the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple following, in one Bar, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a <hi>Semibreve</hi>; you may, in <hi>Minims,</hi> pronounce <hi>one, two,</hi> your hand being down at your first sounding <hi>one,</hi> lift it up leisurely, and when it is up a small distance pronounce <hi>two,</hi> and then laying your hand down again begin the third <hi>Minim,</hi> lifting it up at the fourth, and down at the fifth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Also when you have four <hi>Crotchets,</hi> pronounce <hi>one, two,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97795:23"/>
three, four,</hi> that is, the hand is down at <hi>one</hi> and up at <hi>three,</hi> and down when you begin the next Bar of four <hi>Crotchets,</hi> as in this Example. This Rule observe, according to the <hi>Measure</hi> of those <hi>Notes</hi> your <hi>Semibreve</hi> is divided into, be it either <hi>Triple, Duple</hi> or <hi>Common Time.</hi>

                     <head>A Brief Discourse of the <hi>Italian</hi> manner of Singing; wherein is set down, the Vse of those Graces in Singing, as the <hi>Trill</hi> and <hi>Gruppo,</hi> used in <hi>Italy,</hi> and now in <hi>England</hi>: Written some years since by an <hi>English</hi> Gentleman, who had lived long in <hi>Italy,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned, Taught the same here.</head>

                        <head>The Proem to the said Discourse is to this effect.</head>
                        <p>HItherto I have not put forth to the view of the World, those Fruits of my Musick Studies employed about that Noble manner of Singing, which I learnt of my Master the famous <hi>Scipione del Palla</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi>; nor my Compositions of <hi>Ayres,</hi> Composed by me, which I saw frequently practised by the most famous Singers in <hi>Italy,</hi> both Men and Women: But seeing many of them go about maimed and spoil'd, and that those long winding Points were ill performed, I therefore devis'd to avoid that old manner of running Division, which has been hitherto
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97795:27"/>
used, being indeed more proper for Wind and Stringed Instruments than for the Voice. And seeing that there is made now a days an indifferent and confused use of those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Graces and Ornaments to the good manner of Singing, which we call <hi>Trills, Grupps, Exclamations</hi> of <hi>Increasing</hi> and <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> of the Voice, of which I do intend in this my Discourse to leave some foot-prints, that others may attain to this excellent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Singing: To which manner I have framed my last <hi>Ayres</hi> for one Voice to the <hi>Theorbo,</hi> not following that old way of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> whose Musick not suffering the Words to be understood by the Hearers, for the multitude of Divisions made upon short and long Syllables, though by the Vulgar such Singers are cryed up for famous. But I have endeavoured in those my late Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, to bring in a kind of Musick, by which men might as it were Talk in Harmony, using in that kind of Singing a certain noble neglect of the Song (as I have often heard at <hi>Florence</hi> by the Actors in their Singing <hi>Opera's</hi>) in which I endeavoured the Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Conceit of the Words, seeking out the Cords more or less passionate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaning of them, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97795:27"/>
in them so much as I could the <hi>Art of Descant,</hi> and paused or stayed the Consonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Cords upon long Syllables, avoiding the short, and observing the same Rule in making the passages of Division by some few <hi>Quavers</hi> to Notes and to Cadences, not exceeding the value of a quarter or half a <hi>Semibreve</hi> at most. But, as I said before, those long windings and turnings of the Voice are ill used, for I have observed that Divisions have been invented, not because they are necessary unto a good fashion of Singing, but rather for a certain tickling of the Ears of those who do not well understand what it is to sing Passionately; for if they did undoubtedly Divisions would have been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd, there being nothing more contrary to Passion than they are; yet in some kind of Musick less Passionate or Affectuous, and upon long Syllables, not short, and in final Cadences, some short Points of Division may be used, but not at all adventures, but upon the practice of the Descant; but to think of them first in those things that a man will sing by himself, and to fashion out the manner of them, and not to promise a mans self that his Descant will bear it; for to the good manner of Composing and Singing in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97795:28"/>
this way, the understanding of the conceit and the humour of the words, as well in passionate Cords as passionate Expressions in Singing, doth more avail than Descant; I having made use of it only to accord two Parts together, and to avoid certain notable Errours, and bind certain Discords for the accompanying of the Passion, more than to use the Art: And certain it is, that an <hi>Ayre</hi> composed in this manner upon the conceit of the words, by one that hath a good fashion of Singing, will work a better effect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, more than another made with all the Art of Descant, where the Humour or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the words is not minded.</p>
                        <p>The original of which defect (if I deceive not my self) is hence occasioned, because the Musician doth not well possess and make himself Master of that which he is to Sing. For if he did so, undoubtedly he would not run into such Errours, as most easily he falleth into, who hath framed to himself a manner of Singing; for Example, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Passionate, with a general Rule that in Encreasing and Abating the Voice, and in Exclamations, is the foundation of Passion, doth always use them in every sort of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, not discerning whether the words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97795:28"/>
it: Whereas those that well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the conceit and the meaning of the Words, know our defects, and can distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish where the Passion is more or less requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Which sort of people we should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to please with all diligence, and more to esteem their praise, than the applause of the ignorant Vulgar.</p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Art</hi> admitteth no Mediocrity, and how much the more curiosities are in it, by reason of the excellence thereof, with so much the more labour and love ought we, the Professors thereof, to find them out: Which love hath moved me (considering that from Writings we receive the light of all <hi>Science,</hi> and of all <hi>Art</hi>) to leave behind me this little light in the ensuing Notes and Discourses; it being my intention to show so much as appertaineth to him who maketh profession of Singing alone, upon the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>Theorbo,</hi> or other Stringed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, so that he be already entred into the <hi>Theorie</hi> of <hi>Musick,</hi> and Play sufficiently. Not that this cannot also be attain'd by long Practise, as it is seen that many, both Men and Women, have done, and yet this they attain is but unto a certain degree: But because the Theorie of these Writings c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nduceth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97795:29"/>
unto the attaining of that degree; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the profession of a <hi>Singer</hi> (in regard of the excellence thereof) not only parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things are of use, but they all together do better it; therefore to proceed in order, thus I will say:</p>
                        <p>That the chiefest foundations, and most important Grounds of this Art are, the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of the <hi>Voice</hi> in all the <hi>Notes</hi>; not only that it be neither too high nor too low, but that there be a good manner of <hi>Tuning</hi> it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Which <hi>Tuning</hi> being used for the most part in two fashions, we will consider both of the one and the other; and by the following Notes will shew that which to me seemeth more proper to other effects.</p>
                        <p>There are some therefore that in the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of the first <hi>Note,</hi> Tune it a <hi>Third</hi> under: Others Tune the said first Note in its proper Tune, always increasing it in Lowdness, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that this is a good way of putting forth the <hi>Voice</hi> gracefully.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the first: Since it is not a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule, because it agrees not in many Cords, although in such places as it may be used, it is now become so ordinary, that instead of being a Grace (because some stay too long in the third Note under, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97795:29"/>
it should be but lightly touched) it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tedious to the Ear; and that for Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in particular it ought seldom to be used: but instead of it, as being more strange, I would chuse the second for the Increasing of the Voice.</p>
                        <p>Now, because I have not contained my self within ordinary terms, and such as others have used, yea rather have continually sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched after novelty, so much as was possible for me, so that the Novelty may fitly serve to the better obtaining of the <hi>Musicians</hi> end, that is to delight and move the affections of the mind, I have found it to be a more affectuous way to Tune the <hi>Voice</hi> by a contrary effect to the other, that is, to Tune the first Note in its proper Tune, diminishing it; because Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is the principal means to move the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and Exclamation properly is no other thing, but the slacking of the Voice to re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it somewhat more. Whereas Increasing of the Voice in the <hi>Treble</hi> Part, especially in feigned Voices, doth oftentimes become harsh, and unsufferable to the Hearing, as upon divers occasions I have heard. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly therefore, as an affection more proper to move, it will work a better effect to Tune the Voice diminishing it, rather than
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97795:30"/>
Increasing of it: Because in the first of these ways now mentioned, when a man Increases the Voice, to make an Exclamation, it is needful that in slacking of it, he Increase it the more. And therefore I have said that it showeth harsh and rough. But in the Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of the Voice it will work a quite contrary effect, because when the Voice is slacked, then to give it a little spirit, will always make it more passionate. Besides that also, using sometimes one, sometimes another, variety may be used, which is very necessary in this <hi>Art,</hi> so that it be directed to the said end.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Of Tuning therefore with more or less Grace, and how it may be done in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said manner, tryal may be made in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-written Notes with the words under them, <hi>Cor mio, deh non languire.</hi> For in the first <hi>Minim</hi> with the <hi>Prick,</hi> you may Tune <hi>Cor mio,</hi> diminishing it by little and little, and in the falling of the <hi>Crotchet</hi> increase the Voice with a little more spirit, and it will become an <hi>Exclamation</hi> passionate enough, though in a Note that falls but one degree: But much more spriteful will it appear in the word <hi>deh,</hi> by holding of a Note that falls not by one degree: As likewise it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come most sweet by the taking of the <hi>greater Sixth</hi> that falls by a leap. Which thing I have observed, not only to show to others
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97795:31"/>
what a thing <hi>Exclamation</hi> is, and from whence it grows; but also that there may be two kinds of it, one more passionate than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as well by the manner in which they are described, or tuned in the one way or the other; as also by imitation of the word, when it shall have a signification sutable to the conceit. Besides that, <hi>Exclamations</hi> may be used in all Passionate Musicks, by one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule in all <hi>Minims</hi> and <hi>Crotchets</hi> with a <hi>Prick</hi> falling; and they shall be far more Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate by the following Note, which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, than they can be in <hi>Semibreves;</hi> in which it will be fitter for increasing and diminishing the Voice, without using the <hi>Exclamations.</hi> Yet by consequence under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that in <hi>Airy</hi> Musicks, or <hi>Corants</hi> to dance, instead of these Passions, there is to be used onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> a lively cheerful kind of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is carried and ruled by the <hi>Air</hi> it self. In the which, though sometimes there may be place for some <hi>Exclamation,</hi> that live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of Singing is in that place to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not any Passion to be used which sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth of <hi>Linguishment.</hi> Whereupon we see how necessary a certain judgment is for a Musician, which sometimes useth to prevail above Art. As also we may perceive by the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97795:31"/>
foregoing Notes, how much greater Grace the four first <hi>Quavers</hi> have upon the second syllable of the word <hi>Languire</hi> (being so stayed by the second <hi>Quaver</hi> with a <hi>Prick</hi>) than the four last equal <hi>Quavers,</hi> so printed for Example. But because there are many things which are used in a good fashion of Singing, which because there is found in them a greater Grace, being described in some one manner, make a contrary effect one to the other; whereupon we use to say of a man that he sings with much Grace, or little Grace: These things will occasion me at this time first to demonstrate in what fashion I have described the <hi>Trill</hi> and the <hi>Grup</hi>; and the manner used by me to teach them to those who have been interessed in my house; and further, all other the more necessary effects: So that I leave not unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed any curiosity which I have observed.</p>

                        <p>And because in the two last lines of the foregoing Ayre, <hi>Deh doue son fuggiti,</hi> there are contained the best passions that can be used in this noble manner of Singing, I have therefore thought good to set them down,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97795:34"/>
both to show where it is fit to encrease and abate the voice, to make <hi>Exclamations, Trills,</hi> and <hi>Grups</hi>; and in a word, all the Treasures of this Art; and that they may serve for Example, whereby men may take notice in the Musick of the places, where they are most necessary, according to the passions of the words. Although I call that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner of Singing, which is used with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tying a mans self to the ordinary measure of time, making many times the value of the Notes less by half, and sometimes more, according to the conceit of the words; whence proceeds that excellent kind of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a graceful neglect, whereof I have spoken before.</p>
                        <p>[<hi>Our Author being short in setting forth this chief or most usual Grace in Singing, called the</hi> Trill, <hi>which, as he saith very right, is by a beating in the Throat on the Vowel</hi> (a'h) <hi>some observe that it is rather the shaking of the Uvula or Pallate on the Throat, in one sound, upon a Note. For the attaining of this, the most surest and ready way is by imitation of those who are perfect in the same; yet I have heard of some that have attained it by this manner, in sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a plain Song, of</hi> 6 <hi>Notes up and</hi> 6 <hi>down, they have in the midst of every Note beat or shaked
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97795:34"/>
with their finger upon their Throat, which by often practice came to do the same Notes exactly without. It was my chance lately to be in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with three Gentlemen at a Musical Practice, which sung their Parts very well, and used this Grace</hi> (<hi>called the</hi> Trill) <hi>very exactly: I desired to know their Tutor, they told me I was their Tutor, for they never had any other but this my</hi> Introduction: <hi>That (I answered) could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them but in the Theory, they must needs have a better help in the Practick, especially in attaining to sing the</hi> Trill <hi>so well. One of them made this Reply, (which made me smile) I used, said he, at my first learning the</hi> Trill, <hi>to imitate that breaking of a Sound in the Throat, which Men use when they Leuer their Hawks, as</hi> he-he-he-he-he; <hi>which he used slow at first, and by often practice on several Notes, higher and lower in sound, he became perfect therein. The</hi> Trill, <hi>or</hi> Shake <hi>of the Voice, being the most usual Grace, is made in</hi> Closes, Cadences, <hi>and other places, where by a long Note an</hi> Exclamation <hi>or</hi> Passion <hi>is expressed, there the</hi> Trill <hi>is made in the latter part of any such Note; but most usually upon binding Notes in</hi> Cadences <hi>and</hi> Closes, <hi>and on that Note that precedes the closing Note. Those who once attain to the perfect use of the</hi> Trill, <hi>other Graces will become easie.</hi>]</p>

                           <pb n="54" facs="tcp:97795:35"/>Since there are so many effects to be used for the excellency of this Art, there is required (for the performing of them) neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily a good voice, as also a good wind to give liberty, and serve upon all occasions where is most need. It shall therefore be a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advertisement, that the Professor of this Art, being to sing to a <hi>Theorbo</hi> or other stringed instrument, and not being compelled to fit himself to others, that he so pitch his Tune, as to sing in his full and natural Voice, avoiding feigned Tunes of Notes. In which, to feign them, or at the least to inforce Notes, if his Wind serve him well, so as he do not discover them much; (because for the most part they offend the Ear;) yet a man must have a command of Breath to give the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Spirit to the Increasing and Diminishing of the Voice, to Exclamations and other Passions by us related; and therefore let him take heed, that spending much Breath upon such Notes, it do not afterward fail him in such places as it is most needful: For from a feigned Voice can come no noble manner of singing; which only proceeds from a natural Voice, serving aptly for all the Notes which a man can manage accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his ability employing his wind in such
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97795:35"/>
a fashion as he command all the best passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Graces used in this most worthy manner of Singing. The love whereof, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of all Musick, being kindled in me by a natural inclination, and by the study of so many years, shall excuse me, if I have suffered my self to be carried further than perhaps was fit for him, who no less esteems and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to learn from others, than to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to others what himself hath learned; and to be further transported in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, than can stand with that respect I bear to all the Professors of this Art. Which Art being excellent and naturally delightful, doth then become admirable, and entirely wins the love of others, when such as possess it, both by teaching and delighting others, do often exercise it, and make it appear to be a pattern and true resemblance of those ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceasing celestial Harmonies, whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed so many good effects and benefits upon earth, raising and exciting the minds of the Hearers, to the contemplation of those infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite delights which Heaven affordeth.</p>

                           <hi>This Author having set most of his Examples and Graces to the</hi> Italian <hi>words, it cannot be denyed but the</hi> Italian <hi>Language is more smooth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97795:36"/>
and better vowelled than the</hi> English, <hi>by which it has the advantage in</hi> Musick, <hi>yet of late our Language is much refined, and so is our Musick, to a more smooth and delightfal way and manner of singing after this new method; especially by the excellent Compositions of Mr.</hi> Henry Lawes, <hi>and other excellent Masters in this Art, and was by them Taught for above this forty years past, and is daily used and taught by several eminent Professors at this day. Therefore such as desire to be taught to sing after this way, need not seek after</hi> Italian <hi>or</hi> French <hi>Masters, for our own Nation was never better furnished with able and skilful Artists in Musick than it is at this time, though few of them have the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they deserve, nor must Musick expect it as yet, when all other Arts and Sciences are at so low an Ebb: But I do hope, as Almighty God has most miraculously restored His Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in Peace, whose Virtues and Piety declare Him a Lover and Encourager of Arts, and of Musick especially; so I hope the Clergy, Nobility, and Gentry of this Kingdom, will follow His Gracious and Royal Example.</hi>

                     <p>OF these Moods, though of little use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, there is scarce any Author that has wrote of Musick but do give some account of them; among the <hi>Latin, Alste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, Cassiodorus,</hi> and others; in <hi>English,</hi> Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> and Mr. <hi>Morley</hi>; therefore not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be singular, I shall give you this short Narrative.</p>
                     <p>These five <hi>Moods</hi> have no relation to those <hi>Moods</hi> mentioned in the former part of this Book; those have reference to <hi>Notes</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> these only concern <hi>Tune.</hi> That which the <hi>Grecians</hi> called <hi>Mode</hi> or <hi>Mood,</hi> the <hi>Latins</hi> termed <hi>Tone</hi> or <hi>Tune:</hi> The design of either, was to shew in what Key the Song was set, and how each Musical Key had relation one to another. These five appertained to the <hi>Grecians</hi> only, and had their several appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97795:37"/>
from the Countries in which they were invented and practised. The <hi>Latins</hi> reduced theirs to Eight <hi>Tones</hi> or <hi>Tunes,</hi> and were by the Churchmen termed Plain-songs. These exceeded not the compass of six Notes, and was to direct how to begin and end in the proper <hi>Keys</hi>; which eight <hi>Tones</hi> or <hi>Tunes</hi> are printed in the <hi>Tenor</hi> Part of Mr. <hi>Morley</hi>'s <hi>Introduction, pag.</hi> 147. The <hi>Grecian Moods</hi> had these various effects.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The <hi>Dorick Mood</hi> consisted of <hi>sober slow Tun'd Notes</hi> (Counterpoint) where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Parts goes Note for Note toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be they of two, three, or four Parts, as is set forth in my late Book of Musick of four Parts to the Psalms and Hymns used in our Churches, Printed in <hi>Folio,</hi> 1671. This <hi>Mood</hi> had its name from <hi>Doria,</hi> a civil part of <hi>Greece</hi> near <hi>Athens</hi>; and being solemn, moveth to Sobriety and Godliness.</item>
                        <item>2. The <hi>Lydian Mood</hi> was used to grave solemn Musick, the Descant or Composition being of slow time, fitted to Sacred Hymns and Anthems, or Spiritual Songs, in Prose, sometimes in Verses alone, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ometimes in a full <hi>Chorus</hi> of four or five Parts; which moveth a kind of Heavenly Harmony, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the mind is lifted up from the regard of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97795:37"/>
earthly things to those celestial Joys above. This <hi>Mood</hi> had its derivation from the famous River in <hi>Lidia</hi> called <hi>Pactolus,</hi> and the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding retrograde <hi>Meander,</hi> representing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the admirable variety of Sound in Musick, passing by the famous Cities, <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and <hi>Sardis</hi> once the Royal Seat of rich King <hi>Croesus.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. The <hi>AEolick Mood,</hi> was that which was of a more Airy and soft pleasing sound, as your <hi>Madrigals</hi> or <hi>Fa la's</hi> of five and six Parts, which were Composed for Viols and Voices by many of our excellent <hi>English</hi> Authors, as Mr. <hi>Morley, Wilks, Wilbey, Ward,</hi> and others: Which Musick by its variety and delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, allayeth the Passions, and charmeth the Affections into a sweet and pleasing temper; such as was that enchanting Musick of the Harp, provided for King <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. <hi>That</hi> Saul <hi>was refreshed, and the evil Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him.</hi> This <hi>Mood</hi> had its deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>AEolia</hi> (a Kingdom of <hi>AEolus</hi>) whence he is feigned to send his rushing Winds, which do resemble this <hi>Mood,</hi> that is so commixt with fancy and airy reports, one part after other.</item>
                        <item>4. The <hi>Phrygian Mood</hi> was a more warlike and couragious kind of Musick, expressing the Musick of Trumpets and other Instruments
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97795:38"/>
of old, exciting to Arms and Activity, as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and the like. This <hi>Mood</hi> had its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation from <hi>Phrygia</hi> (a Region bordering upon <hi>Lydia</hi> and <hi>Caria</hi>) in which is that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Town <hi>Cios,</hi> and the most high Hill <hi>Idae,</hi> famous for the <hi>Trojan</hi> War. Many Historians have written of its rare Effects in warlike Preparations: <hi>Suidas (in litera T)</hi> writes of <hi>Timotheus,</hi> a skilful Musician, that when <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great was much dejected in his mind, and loth to take up Arms, he with his <hi>Phrygian</hi> Flute expressed such excellent sounds and varieties of Musick, that the Kings passions were immediately stirred to War, and ran presently and took up Arms. But the Story of <hi>Ericus</hi> the Musician passes all; who had given forth, that by his Musick he could drive men into what Affections he listed; and being required by <hi>Bonus</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to put his Skill in practice, he with his Harp, or <hi>Polycord Lyra,</hi> expressed such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual melody and harmony, in the variety of changes in several <hi>Keyes,</hi> and in such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Fug's</hi> and spritely <hi>Ayres,</hi> that his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors began first to be moved with some strange passions, but ending his excellent Voluntary with some choice Fancy upon this <hi>Phrygian Mood,</hi> the Kings passions were
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97795:38"/>
altered, and excited to that height, that he fell upon his most trusty friends which were near him, and flew some of them with his fist for lack of another weapon; which the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician perceiving, ended with the sober and solemn <hi>Dorick,</hi> which brought the King to himself, who much lamented what he had done. This is recorded at large by <hi>Crantzius, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Daniae cap.</hi> 3. and by <hi>Saxo Grammaticus, lib.</hi> 12. <hi>Hist. Daniae,</hi> and others.</item>
                        <item>5. The <hi>Ionick Mood</hi> was for more light and effeminate Musick, as pleasant <hi>amorous Songs, Corants, Sarabands,</hi> and <hi>Iigs,</hi> used for honest mirth and delight at Feasts and other merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This <hi>Mood</hi> had its derivation from the <hi>Ionians</hi> of <hi>Ionia,</hi> which lies between <hi>AEo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> and <hi>Caria,</hi> a situation full of all pleasure, whose plenty and idleness turned their honest mirth into lasciviousness. By this <hi>Mood</hi> was the <hi>Pythagorean Huntsup,</hi> or Morning Musick, which wakened and roused their dull Spirits to study and action. The abuse of this <hi>Mood</hi> is soon reformed by the sober <hi>Dorick;</hi> for what this excites above moderation, the other draws into a true <hi>Decorum.</hi>

                     <p>THe Tunes of <hi>Psalms</hi> are of general use, all who are true Lovers of Divine <hi>Musick</hi> will have them in estimation, they may be called Holy <hi>David</hi>'s Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, they are easie and delightful: Those who are principally concerned, are <hi>Parish-Clerks,</hi> as being the Leaders of those Tunes in their Congregations, for whose use and benefit, I have set down these following Directions.</p>
                     <p>First, observe how many Notes Compass the Tune is; secondly, the place of the first Note; and lastly, how many Notes above and below that, so that you may begin the first Note in such a Key, as the rest may be sung in the compass of your own and the peoples Voices, without <hi>squeaking</hi> above, or <hi>grumbling</hi> below. For the better understanding of which, these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Instructions are necessary, which serve also for all other Tunes that are not here; but when you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in these, I refer you to my large Book lately published in Folio, Entituled, <hi>Psalms and Hymns in Solemn Musick of Four Parts</hi>; in which is 47 several Tunes, with the <hi>Bass</hi> under each <hi>Common-Tune,</hi> as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to sing to the <hi>Organ, Theorbo,</hi> or <hi>Bass-Viol</hi>; also variety of excellent Translations of <hi>Psalms</hi> and <hi>Hymns,</hi> never before published.</p>

Treble-Viol, Tenor-Viol,</hi> and <hi>Bass-Viol.</hi> The <hi>Treble-Viol</hi> plays the highest Part, and its Lessons are prick'd by the <hi>G sol re vt</hi> Cliff <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When you begin to Tune, raise your <hi>Treble</hi> or smallest string as high as conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently it will bear without breaking; then stop only your second or <hi>small Mean</hi> in <hi>F,</hi> and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97795:55"/>
tune it till it agree in sound with your <hi>Treble</hi> open; that done, stop your <hi>Third</hi> in <hi>F,</hi> and make it agree with your <hi>Second</hi> open; then stop your <hi>Fourth</hi> in <hi>F,</hi> and make it agree with your <hi>Third</hi> open; then stop your <hi>Fifth</hi> in <hi>F,</hi> and make it agree with your <hi>Fourth</hi> open; and lastly, stop your <hi>Sixth</hi> in <hi>F,</hi> and make it agree to your <hi>Fifth</hi> open.

                     <head>Some General Rules for the Viol.</head>
                     <p>THere are three sorts of <hi>Bass-Viols,</hi> as there are three manners of ways in playing.</p>
                     <p>First, a <hi>Bass-Viol</hi> for <hi>Consort</hi> must be one of the largest size, and the Strings propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a <hi>Bass-Viol</hi> for <hi>Divisions</hi> must be of a less size, and the Strings according.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, a <hi>Bass-Viol</hi> to play <hi>Lyra-way,</hi> that is by <hi>Tableture,</hi> must be somewhat less than the two former, and strung proportionably.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the choice of your <hi>Viol Bow,</hi> let it be proportioned to the <hi>Viol</hi> you use, and let the Hair be laid stiff, and the Bow not too heavy, nor too long.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In holding your <hi>Viol</hi> observe this Rule: Place it gently between your Knees, resting the lower end thereof upon the Calves of your Legs, and let your Feet rest flat on the Ground, your Toes turned a little outward, and let the top of your <hi>Viol</hi> lean towards your left shoulder.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In the holding of your Bow, observe this Rule: Hold the Bow betwixt the ends of your Thumb and your Forefinger, an Inch below the Nut, the Thumb and first Finger resting on the Wood, the ends of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97795:59"/>
your second and third Fingers staid upon the Hair, by which you may poise and keep up your Bow. Your Bow being thus fix'd, you must draw it over one string, and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in a right angle, about two or three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches above the Bridge, making each several string yield a clear sound.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In the posture of your left hand observe this Rule, place your Thumb on the back of the Neck, and opposite to your Forefinger, so that when your Fingers are to rest on the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Stops or Frets, your hand may have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to move up and down, as occasion shall require; and in the stopping observe, that when you set any finger down, let it not be just upon the Fret, but close to it, bearing it hard down with the end of your finger, and let it rest there, playing the following Notes with your other fingers, until occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the moving it; and be sure not to lift your fingers too high, but keep them in an even distance to the Frets, that so they may pass more readily from Fret to Fret.</p>
                     <p>Also in the Rule of true Fingering, where you skip a Fret, there leave a finger; and when you have any Notes which are high Notes, that reach lower than the Frets, there the highest Note is always stopt either with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97795:59"/>
the third or fourth finger; if with the third, then the first and second fingers are ready to stop the two next Notes either ascending or descending from it: But if the highest Note be stopt with the fourth finger, then the Note under it is stopt either with the third or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond finger, according as it is either Flat or Sharp; if Sharp, the third; if Flat, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. But whether the highest Note be stopt with the third or fourth finger, the third be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it must be stopt with the first finger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> which is ever as a guide to the two Notes above it. Lastly, when two Notes which follow one another are stopt with the same finger removed, it is to prepare the other fingers to the aforementioned posture, or to remove them to some other place. This or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Fingering directs the whole Finger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board (in stopping three Notes which follow upon any one string) with this proviso, where stops are wide, the fourth or little finger is of more use, than lower down, where the stops fall more close.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In the moving your Bow observe this Rule, when you see an even number of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> or <hi>Semiquavers,</hi> as 2, 4, 6, or 8, tyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, you must begin with your Bow for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, though the Bow be drawn forward the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97795:60"/>
Note before; but if the number be odd, as 3, 5, or 7, (which is by reason of a Prick Note or an odd <hi>Quaver</hi> Rest) then the first Note must be plaid with the <hi>bow</hi> drawn backward.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, in the practice of any Lesson, play it slow at first, and by often practice it will bring your hand to a more swift motion.</p>
                     <p>And now, your <hi>Viol</hi> Being Tuned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the foregoing Directions, I have here following set down a few Lessons for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with, and over the Notes I have set fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, to direct with what fingers to stop them; 1, 2, 3, 4, is set for first, second, third, and fourth fingers; those which have no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures over them, are the string open.</p>
                     <p>For the usual <hi>Graces,</hi> the <hi>Shake</hi> is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal; of which there are two, the <hi>close shake</hi> and the <hi>open shake;</hi> the <hi>close shake</hi> is when you stop with your first Finger on the first Fret, and <hi>shake</hi> with your second Finger as close to it as you can; the <hi>open shake</hi> is when you stop with your first Finger on the first Fret, and <hi>shake</hi> with your third Finger on the third Fret; this observe in all stops whatsoever. For other <hi>Graces,</hi> as <hi>Double Relishes, Back-falls, &amp;c.</hi> I refer you to the Table of the several <hi>Graces</hi> in my Directions for the <hi>Treble-Violin,</hi> which are proper also to the <hi>Bass-Viol.</hi>

                     <head>A BRIEF INTRODUCTION To the Playing on the TREBLE-VIOLIN.</head>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>THE <hi>Treble-Violin</hi> is a cheerful and spritely Instrument, and much pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised of late, some by <hi>Book,</hi> and some <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>; which of these two is the best way,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97795:63"/>
may easily be resolved: First, to learn to play by <hi>rote</hi> or <hi>ear</hi> without <hi>Book,</hi> is the way never to play more than what he can gain by hearing another play, which may soon be forgot; but on the contrary, he which learns and practises by Book, according to the Grounds of <hi>Musick,</hi> fails not, after he comes to be perfect in those Rules, which guide him to play more than ever he was taught or heard, and also to play his part in <hi>Consort</hi>; which the other will never be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, unless he have this <hi>sure guide.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Violin</hi> is usually <hi>strung</hi> with <hi>four strings,</hi> and tuned by <hi>fifths;</hi> for the more plain and easie understanding thereof, and the stopping all <hi>Notes</hi> in their right <hi>places</hi> and <hi>tune,</hi> it will be necessary that on the <hi>neck</hi> or <hi>finger-board</hi> of your <hi>Violin,</hi> there be placed six <hi>frets,</hi> as is on a <hi>Viol:</hi> This, though it be not usual, yet it is the best and easiest way for a Beginner who has a bad Ear, for by it he has a certain rule to direct and guide him to stop all his <hi>Notes</hi> in exact <hi>tune,</hi> which those that do learn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, seldom have at first so good an Ear to stop all <hi>Notes</hi> in perfect <hi>tune.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore for the better understanding thereof, in this following Example is assigned to those six <hi>frets</hi> on the <hi>finger-board,</hi> six Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97795:63"/>
of the Alphabet in their order; the first <hi>Fret</hi> is <hi>B,</hi> the second <hi>C,</hi> the third <hi>D,</hi> fourth <hi>E,</hi> fifth <hi>F,</hi> and sixth <hi>G; A</hi> is not assigned to any of the <hi>Frets,</hi> but is the String open.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>In this Example you have the names of the 4 <hi>strings,</hi> and the letters assigned to each <hi>fret.</hi>

                     <head>Some General Rules for the TREBLE VIOLIN.</head>
                     <p>FIrst, The <hi>Violin</hi> is usually plaid above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, the Neck thereof being held by the left hand; the lower part thereof is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted on the left breast, a little below the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: The <hi>Bow</hi> is held in the right hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ends of the Thumb and the three first Fingers, the Thumb being staid upon the Hair at the Nut, and the three Fingers resting upon the Wood: Your <hi>Bow</hi> being thus fixed, you are first to draw an even stroke over each string severally, making each string yield a clear and distinct sound.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for the posture of your left hand, place your Thumb on the back of the Neck, opposite to your Forefinger, so will your Fingers have the more liberty to move up and down in the several Stops.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, for your true fingering, observe these directions, which will appear more easie to your understanding, if in your first pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice you have your <hi>Violin fretted,</hi> as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, that where you skip a <hi>fret</hi> or <hi>stop,</hi> there to leave a finger, for every <hi>stop</hi> is but half a Tone or Note, for from <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                        </gap> to <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                        </gap> is but half a Note, but from <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                        </gap> to <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                        </gap> is a whole Note, therefore the leaving of a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97795:65"/>
is necessary to be in readiness when half Notes happen, which is by <hi>flats</hi> and <hi>sharps.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next, when you have any high Notes, which reach lower than your usual Frets or Stops, there you are to shift your fingers; if there be but two Notes, then the first is stopt with the third finger; but if there be three Notes that ascend, then the first is stopt with the second finger, and the rest by the next fingers.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, in the moving your Bow up and down observe this Rule, when you see an even number of <hi>Quavers</hi> and <hi>Semiquavers,</hi> as 2, 4, 6 or 8 tyed together, your Bow must move up or forwards, though it was up at the Note immediately before, but if you have an odd number, as 3, 5 or 7 (which happens very often, by reason of a prickt Note or an odd <hi>Quaver Rest</hi>) there your Bow must draw back at the first Note.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, in your practice of any Lesson, play it slow at first, and by often practice you will bring your hand to a more swift motion.</p>
                     <p>As for the several <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Flourishes</hi> that are used, as <hi>Shakes, Backfalls,</hi> and <hi>double Relishes,</hi> this following Table will be some help to your practice; for there is first the Note plain, and after the <hi>Grace</hi> expressed by Notes at length.</p>

                  <opener>Ingenious Practitioner,</opener>
                  <p>HAving thus (after the plainest method I could) set down several Rules and Directions for thy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice on the <hi>Treble Violin,</hi> by way of Fretting; which way I have known used by some of the most eminent Teachers on this Instrument, as the most facile and easie to initiate their Scholars: And also by the way of Pricking down Lessons in Letters; yet do I not approve of this way of Playing by Letters, save only as a Guide to young Practitioners, to bring them the more readily to know all the Stops and Places of the Notes, both Flat and Sharp, as is set down in the Table pag. <hi>96, 97.</hi> And having by this practice come to the perfect knowledge thereof, to lay the use of Letters aside, and keep to their practice by Notes only. And therefore in the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the Skill of this Musick, I have added some few Lessons both ways, that after thou canst play them by Letters, thou maist play the same again by Notes: Those who desire to be furnished with more Lessons, I refer to a Book lately published, Entituled, <hi>Apollo's Banquet,</hi> containing above two hundred new Tunes for the <hi>Treble Violin,</hi> with the most usual French Dances added to them.</p>
                  <p>By the practice of these Rules, and a little help of a Master, I doubt not but thou mayst in a short time become a good Proficient on this Instrument; which is the hearty desire of thy Well-wisher,</p>

                  <p>THere are Nine Concords of Musick, as followeth:</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Unison, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Tenth, Twelfth, Thirteenth,</hi> and <hi>Fifteenth;</hi> whereof five are called <hi>perfect,</hi> and four <hi>imperfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The five perfect, are <hi>Unison, Fifth, Eighth, Twelfth,</hi> and <hi>Fifteenth:</hi> Of these, you may not take two of one sort together, neither rising or falling, as two <hi>Fifths,</hi> or two <hi>Eighths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the other four, called imperfect, you may take two or three together of one sort, rising or falling, which are a <hi>Third, Sixth, Tenth,</hi> and <hi>Thirteenth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Nine Concords are comprehended in four, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Unison, Eighth, Fifteenth,</hi> are accounted as one, for every <hi>Eighth</hi> is the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Third, Tenth,</hi> likewise.</p>

                  <p>So that in effect there are but four Concords.</p>
                  <p>The Discords are, a <hi>Second, Fourth,</hi> and <hi>Seventh,</hi> with their <hi>Eighths;</hi> which being sometime mixt with Concords, make the best Musick, being orderly taken.</p>

                     <p>THe Parts of <hi>Musick</hi> are in all but four, howsoever some skilful Musicians have Composed Songs of twenty, thirty, and forty parts; for be the parts never so many, they are but one of these four in nature. The names of those four parts are these: The <hi>Bass,</hi> which is the lowest part and foundation of the whole Song; the <hi>Tenor,</hi> placed next above the <hi>Bass</hi>; next above the <hi>Tenor,</hi> the <hi>Mean</hi> or <hi>Counter-Tenor;</hi> and in the highest
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97795:71"/>
place, the <hi>Treble.</hi> These four Parts by the Learned are said to resemble the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the <hi>Bass</hi> expresseth the true nature of the Earth, who being the gravest and lowest of all the Elements, is as a foundation to the rest; the <hi>Tenor</hi> is likened to the Water, the <hi>Mean</hi> to the Air, and the <hi>Treble</hi> to the Fire: Moreover, by how much the Water is more light than the Earth, by so much the Air is lighter than the Water, and Fire than Air. They have also in their native property every one place above the other; the lighter upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, the weightiest in the bottom. Having now demonstrated that there are in all but four Parts, and that the <hi>Bass</hi> is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the other three, I assume that the true sight and judgment of the upper three must proceed from the lowest, which is the <hi>Bass</hi>; and also I conclude, that every part in nature doth affect his proper and natural place, as the Elements do.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that the ancient Musicians, who intended their Musick only for the Church, took their sight from the <hi>Tenor,</hi> which was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther done out of necessity, than any respect to the true nature of Musick; for it was usual with them to have a <hi>Tenor</hi> as a Theam, to which they were compelled to adapt their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97795:71"/>
other Parts: But I will plainly convince by demonstration, that contrary to some opinions the <hi>Bass</hi> contains in it both the Ayr and true judgment of the Key, expressing how any man at first sight may view in it all the other Parts in their original essence.</p>
                     <p>In respect of the variety in Musick which is attained to by farther proceeding in the Art, as when Notes are shifted out of their native places, the <hi>Bass</hi> above the <hi>Tenor,</hi> or the <hi>Tenor</hi> above the <hi>Mean,</hi> and the <hi>Mean</hi> above the <hi>Treble</hi>; this kind of <hi>Counterpoint,</hi> which I promise, may appear simple and only fit for young Beginners, (as indeed chiefly it is) yet the right speculation may give much satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, even to the most skilful, laying open unto them, how manifest and certain are the first grounds of <hi>Counterpoint.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, it is in this case requisite that a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal <hi>Bass,</hi> or at least part thereof be framed, the Notes rising and falling according to the nature of that Part, not so much by degrees, as by leaps of a third, fourth, or fifth, or eighth, a sixth being seldom, a seventh never used, and neither of both without the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of a skilful Composer. Next, we must consider whether the <hi>Bass</hi> doth rise or fall, for in that consists the mystery: That rising
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97795:72"/>
or that falling doth never exceed a fourth, <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                           <hi>If the Bass do rise more than a fourth, it must be called falling: and likewise, if it fall any distance more than a fourth, that falling must be called rising.</hi>
                        </note> for a fourth above, is the same that a fifth is underneath, and a fourth underneath is as a fifth above; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if a <hi>Bass</hi> should rise thus: 1 2 3 <gap reason="music">
                           <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first rising is said to be by degrees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no Note between the two Notes; the second rising is by leaps, for <hi>G</hi> skips over <hi>A</hi> to <hi>B,</hi> and so leaps into a third; the third Example also leaps two Notes into a fourth. Now for this fourth, if the <hi>Bass</hi> had descended from <hi>G</hi> above to <hi>C</hi> underneath, that descending fifth in sight and use had been all one with the fourth, as here you may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, for they both begin and end in the same Keys, thus: G C <gap reason="music">

                     <p>This Rule likewise holds, if the Notes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend a second, <note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                           <hi>If your Bass should fall a seventh, it is but the same as if it did rise a second; or a sixth falling, is but the same of a third rising: and so on the contrary, if the Bass do rise a seventh or sixth, it is the same as though it did fall a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But that I may (as near as I can) leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing untouch'd concerning this kind of <hi>Counterpoint,</hi> let us now consider how two Thirds being taken together between the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97795:81"/>
                        <hi>Treble</hi> and the <hi>Bass,</hi> may stand with our Rule. For sixths are not in this case to be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, being distances so large that they can produce no formality: Besides, the sixth is of it self very imperfect, being compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of a third, which is an imperfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; and of a fourth, which is a Discord: and this the cause is, that the sixths produce so many fourths in the Inner Parts. As for the third, it being the least distance of any Concord, is therefore easily to be reduced into good order. For if the <hi>Bass</hi> and <hi>Treble</hi> do rise together in thirds, then the first Note of the <hi>Treble</hi> is regular with the other Part, but the second of it is irregular; for by rule instead of the rising third, it should fall into the eight. In like sort, if the <hi>Bass</hi> and <hi>Treble</hi> do fall two thirds, the first Note of the <hi>Treble</hi> is irregular, and is to be brought into rule by being put into the eighth, but the second Note is of it self regular. Yet whether those thirds be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into eights or no, you shall by suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition thereof find out the other parts, which never vary from the rule but in the sharp <hi>Bass.</hi> But let me explain my self by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>

                     <p>Lastly, in favour of young beginners let me also add this, that the <hi>Bass</hi> intends a close as often as it riseth a fifth, third, or second, and then immediately either falls a fifth, or riseth a fourth.

                     <head>PART II. Of Tones of Musick.</head>
                     <p>OF all things that belong to the making up of a Musician, the most necessary and useful one for him is the true knowledge of the Key or Mood, or Tone, for all signifie the same thing, with the Closes belonging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, for there is no Tune that can have any grace or sweetness unless it be bounden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a proper Key, without running into strange Keys, which have no affinity with the Ayr of the Song. I have therefore thought good in an easie and brief discourse to endeavour to express that which many in large and obscure <hi>Volumes</hi> have made fearful to the <hi>idle Reader.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first thing herein to be considered is the eighth, which is equally divided into a fourth, and a fifth, as thus:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97795:84"/>
                        <hi>The</hi>8 <gap reason="music">

                        <hi>The</hi> 4. <hi>The</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>Here you see the fourth in the upper place, and the fifth in the lower place, which is called <hi>Modus Authentus:</hi> But contrary thus: <hi>The</hi> 8 <gap reason="music">
                           <desc>〈♫〉</desc>

                        <hi>The</hi> 5. <hi>The</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>This is called <hi>Modus Plagalii,</hi> but howsoever the fourth in the eighth is placed, we must have our eye on the fifth, for that only discovers the Key, and all the Closes pertaining pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly thereunto: This fifth is also divided into two thirds, sometimes the lesser third hath the upper place, and the greater third supports it below, sometimes the greater third is higher, and the lesser third rests in the lowest place: as for Example:
<gap reason="music">
                           <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>The lesser</hi> 3. <hi>The greater</hi> 3. <gap reason="music">

                        <hi>The greater</hi> 3. <hi>The lesser</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>The lowest Note of this fifth bears the name of the Key, as if the eighth be from <hi>G</hi> to <hi>G,</hi> the fifth from <hi>G</hi> beneath to <hi>D</hi> above, <hi>G</hi> being the lowest Note of the fifth, shews that <hi>G</hi> is the Key; and if one should demand in what Key your Song is set, you must answer in <hi>Gam-vt,</hi> or <hi>G sol re vt,</hi> that is, in <hi>G.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:97795:84"/>If the compass of your Song should fall out thus:
<gap reason="music">

                        </gap>
                     </p>
                     <p>Respect not the fourth below, but look to your fift above, and the lowest Note of that fift assume for you Key, which is <hi>C,</hi> then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that fift into its two 3<hi rend="sup">ds</hi>, and so you shall find out all the closes that belong to that Key.</p>
                     <p>The main and fundamental close is in the Key it self, the second is in the upper Note of this fift, the third is in the upper Note of the lowest third, if it be the lesser third; as for example, if the Key be in <hi>G,</hi> with <hi>B flat,</hi> you may close in these three places.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The first close is that which maintains the Ayr of the Key, and may be used often, the second is next to be preferr'd, and third last.</p>
                     <p>But if the Key should be in <hi>G</hi> with <hi>B sharp,</hi> then the last close being to be made in the greater or sharp third, is unproper, and therefore for variety sometime the next Key above is joyned with it, which is <hi>A,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the fourth Key, which is <hi>C.</hi> But these
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97795:85"/>
changes of Keys, must be done with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet I have aptly closed in the upper Note of the lowest third of the Key, the Key being in <hi>F,</hi> and the upper Note of the third standing in <hi>A,</hi> as you may perceive in this Ayr.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But the last and final Close is in the Key it self, which is <hi>F,</hi> as it must ever be, whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97795:85"/>
your Key shall stand, either in <hi>G,</hi> or <hi>C,</hi> or <hi>F,</hi> or elsewhere, the same rule of the fifth is perpetual, being divided into thirds, which can be but two ways, that is, either when the upper third is less by half a Note than the lower, or when the lower third contains the half Note, which is <hi>Mi fa,</hi> or <hi>La Fa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the lower third contains the half Note, it hath it either above, as <hi>La Mi Fa; La Mi</hi> being the whole Note, and <hi>Mi Fa</hi> but half so much, that is the half Note; or else when the half Note is underneath, <hi>Mi Fa Sol; Mi Fa</hi> is the half Note, and <hi>Fa Sol</hi> is the whole Note; but whether the half Note be uppermost or lowermost, if the lowest third of the fifth be the lesser third, that Key yields familiarly three closes; example of the half Note, standing in the upper place was shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, now I will set down the other.</p>

                     <p>But for the other Keys that divide the fifth, so that it hath the less third above, and the greater underneath, they can challenge
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97795:86"/>
but two proper closes, one in the lowest Note of the fift, which is the fundamental Key, and the other in the uppermost Note of the same, wherein also you may close at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. True it is, that the Key next above hath a great affinity with the right Key, and may therefore, as I said before, be used, as also the fourth Key above the final Key.</p>

                     <p>THe consecution of perfect Cords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves is easie, for who knows not that two eighths or two fifths are not to be taken rising or falling together, but a fifth may either way pass into an eight, or an eight into a fift, yet most conveniently when the one of them moves by degrees, and the other by leaps, for when both skip together the passage is less pleasant: the ways by degrees are these.</p>

                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:97795:87"/>The fourth way is only excepted against, where the fift rising into the eight, and in few parts it cannot well be admitted, but in Songs of many Voices it is oftentimes necessary.</p>
                     <p>The passage also of perfect Concords into imperfect, either rising or falling, by degrees or leaps, is easie, and so a Unison may pass in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a lesser third, or a greater third; also into the lesser sixt, but seldom into the greater sixt. A fift passeth into the greater sixt, and into the lesser sixt; as also into the greater or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser third; and so you must judge of their eights, for <hi>de octavis idem est judiciem</hi>; and therefore when you read an Unison, or a fift, or a third, or a sixt, know that by the simple Concords the Compounds are also meant.</p>
