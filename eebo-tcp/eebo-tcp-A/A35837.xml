            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>PRetious to the Lord is the death of his Faithful Saints and Servants, who in their Life time have given up to do his will; and their faithfulness worthy to be commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to Posterity, with those Antients and worthies of old, who by their faithfulness ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a good Report: And since it hath pleased God in this our Age to cause his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-day to appear, and the Son of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to arise, to expel the darkness of a long night of Apostacy, and the Clouds of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that have been over many, and to raise up many living and faithful Witnesses thereof; some of which have faithfully finished their
<pb facs="tcp:58114:3"/>
Testimony, and fulfilled their Course with Joy, and laid down their Heads in Peace with God, and entered into that Eternal Rest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared thorow Christ Jesus, for the faithful; among whom this our dear deceased Brother was one whom God raised up early in the morning of his Glorious day, and made an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Instrument in his Hand for the publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his mighty Day of Power, preaching Repentance, in order to the Remission of Sin, and bearing a faithful and universal Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the free Grace of God to mankind; and the Lord was with him, and prospered him in his manifold Sufferings, Travels, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Exercises in the Gospel of Christ, and word of the Ministry, as may be seen in this small Collection of his several Books, Testimonies and Epistles, herein contained; and many were made sensible of the benefit of his Labours, Counsels, Admonitions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, to the good and welfare of their Immortal Souls, for the Lord our God (in whose Dread and Zeal he Laboured) did indue him with Faith and Courage, and great bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for his Name and Truth; and he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht
<pb facs="tcp:58114:3"/>
the same in great plainness, and in the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity thereof. To the tender hearted he was exceeding tender, but to the Stubborn &amp; Lofty he was sharp and plain, admonishing them, and declaring the righteous Judgment of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that state <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> work to cause Division and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and to sow Dissention among Brethren, he would plainly Testifie against them, and reject them, and in the Dread of the Lords Power Thunder out Gods Judgment against their Deceit &amp; Wickedness, as he did upon such occasion in his last visit to London, a few days before his departure out of the Body, which he then told some of us was neer at hand.</p>
            <p>He was a Man religiously concerned for the Honour of God, and had a great care upon his Spirit, that those that had believed, and made profession of the Truth, might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer it in a holy and blamless Conversation, which he would often say could never be done
<pb facs="tcp:58114:4"/>
by the largeness of Knowledg, nor strength of Comprehension, but by a real dying to their Wills and Affections, by the vertue of the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cross; he was also sincerely devoted to maintain Love and Unity among the People of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was fervent and fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And although the Envy of Wicked and Unreasonable Men was very great, and fierce against him, especially in those early days of his Travel and Labours; for the sake whereof he was often Beaten, Stoned and Imprisoned; he neither feared their Malice, Threats nor Blows, but boldly went forth publishing the Truth, Testiifyng to that of God in all Consciences; and the Hand of divine Providence did often deliver him in
<pb facs="tcp:58114:4"/>
a wonderful manner out of the hands of the wicked, for his Names sake.</p>
            <p>And finally, having faithfully served out his Generation, and finished his Sufferings, Testimony and Course with Joy, he hath now obtained the Crown Immortal, and is gone into the everlasting Rest, from all his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and his Works follow him, with the blessed Reward in the Kingdom of Glory and Peace, that never shall have End.</p>

            <p>WHen I came out of <hi>Darby Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,</hi> in the year 1651. I passing through several Counties, Visiting Friends, I came into <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> to a place called <hi>Balby,</hi> where <hi>Thomas Kilham, Iohn Kilham, Richard Farnsworth,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Aldam</hi> came to me, and were Convinced of God's Truth; so then I passed towards <hi>Sinderhill-Green,</hi> where some were Convinced; and so I passed to one <hi>Lievtenant Ropers</hi> House, where <hi>Iames Nailer</hi> came to see me, where he was Convinced after I had some Discourse with him; and then <hi>Thomas Goodyear</hi> came to me, and after I had declared the Truth to him, he was Convinced, and received the Truth; and I had Meetings at <hi>Lievtenant Ropers,</hi> whither several People came, who after they had heard the Truth declared,
<pb facs="tcp:58114:6"/>
received it; and at one evening Meeting there, <hi>William Dewsbery</hi> and his Wife came, and heard me declare the Truth, and after the Meeting, it being a Moon-shine Night, I walked out into the Field, and <hi>William Dews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery</hi> and his Wife came to me, from the Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, into the Field, and confessed to the Truth, and received it, and after some time he did testifie to it; and in 1653. he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the North, into <hi>Westmerland, Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and declared the Truth both in Steeple-Houses and Meetings; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went great Sufferings, Beating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the rest of Friends for the Truth and then after was Imprisoned at <hi>York,</hi> and also at <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton</hi> in 1654. And when I was brought up a Prisoner to <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> I got leave of him that brought me up, to see him in that Prison; and after that he Travelled up and down a great Part of the Nation, declaring the Truth, and went under great Sufferings with the rest of Friends, who went in great hazard of their Lives, declaring the Truth of Christ. And in his latter Days he was long Imprisoned in <hi>Warwick,</hi> but after he was set at
<pb facs="tcp:58114:6"/>
Liberty, he came to Visit Friends at <hi>London,</hi> where he bore a faithful Testimony for Love and Unity, and against the Spirit of Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and after went back, and finished his Course, and laid down his Head at <hi>Warwick</hi> in Peace with the Lord, in 1688.</p>

               <p>It is the Liberty of the Law of this Nation, that any which is brought Prisoner before those that sits to judge their Cause, may speak for themselves, the truth to witness against the false information given in against them; and that Liberty I take, to manifest the ground and cause of my going into the Steeple-house at <hi>Wellingborrow.</hi> As I was going in the Street, <hi>Thomas Andrews</hi> (called Minister of that Town) called to me with these words, <hi>Give over deceiving the People, lest the Plagues of God fall on thee</hi>

               <p>If there be any such Law, read it to us, and if there be such a Law in thy Conscience, thou knowst it is contrary to the Scriptures, for the Apostles and Ministers of Christ went to and fro in the Countrey, Preaching the Word of eternal Life, and there were added to the Church daily such as should be saved, and the number of the Saints and Brethren were daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, and the Law that is in force in this Nation, doth allow all that professeth Faith in Jesus Christ, to have free Liberty to walk in the Faith, which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture.</p>

            <p>Yet <hi>Marmaduke Storr</hi> said to the people, take notice all people, how we are deprived of the priviledge and liberty that the Law of this Nation allows, in that we may not be heard speak, and have a legal Trial, which is granted to Felons and Murtherers.</p>
            <p>Then they were with-drawn, and he who is called <hi>William Deusbury,</hi> turned to the Court, and spoke as followeth to the Judge: <hi>With what measure thou meetest to us, it will be measured to thee again; and the Lord God of Heaven and Earth will judge between thee and us, and will give unto thee, and every one of you, according to the works you have done, and in that day you shall know whai is now declared is the Truth; the Lord hath spoken it, in whom we trust, and he will us deliver.</hi>

            <p>THE Book thou hath Printed, is seen with the Light that returned an Answer to thy first <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>; and for the Truths sake, and it to clear, from the Lies, Slanders, and Aspersions cast upon it, in the Light here is writ, to witness against the falshood and untruth, which thou hast charged us withal, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers thy <hi>Queries,</hi> which to that of God in all Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, who it minds, will give them to discern, that what thou hast charged against the People, who in scorn are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> is false, and on thee is return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Lines following make manifest, wherein is writ what thou hast charged them withal, and to clear the Truth, an Answer thereunto is returned.</p>
            <p>In thy Preface as thou calls it, which thou presents to the Reader, thou hast not much of it exprest, before thou begins falsly to accuse us, charging us with draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People aside, and intangling them with dark Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical snares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thou sayst, the Answers thou received to thy ten <hi>Queries,</hi> were so obscure, deceitful, and confused, that it constrained thee to Reply. To which thou sayst, an Answer thou hast received, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hath now undertaken to give the sence of what thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands, of what is writ to thee, and hath given it forth publickly to the World, that we have accused thee of slanders, in things that are too gross in plainness of speech to publish to the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Dark diabolical snares we deny, the Word of the Lord God we witness, which was in the beginning,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58114:67"/>
which Word is Life, and the Life is the Light of Men, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.1.4. Which word we Preach to turn the minds of People from darkness to light; from the power of Satan to the living God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. in the light of his living Word, which discovers the thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. to wait in his Light, on him for power, to lead out of all the ways of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, into union with the Father of Life, in Christ the Light, who in him walk, there is no occasion of stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.10. but who deny to be guided by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is none of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. but in darkness walk and stumble at noon-day; and it is truth we declare, as it is Recorded in the Scripture of Truth, he that can receive it let him; and for thy charging the Answer to be obscure, deceitful, and confused, seeing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in thee hath published that they are deceitful, and could not publish them to make manifest what the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is, and some of them which thou hast published, thou hast both added and diminished; for the Truths sake, the Queries with their Answers is published, that the Answer may witness for it self, against the fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood thou hast charged on it; he that hath an Eye to see, let him see.</p>
            <p>And for thy giving thy sence of what thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands of our writing, and saith we accuse thee of slandering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Thy sence thou gives of our words with thy dark understanding, we deny, and slandering we deny, it is thy own practice, proved to thy Face, by thy own words, as followeth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In thy second false Accusation thou saist, that we judge our Novices, and all others besides our selves uncapable to receive some of our Principles, as yet,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58114:68"/>
and therefore we study to darken the sence, by subtil glozing, equivocating expressions, and shuffles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Thy false Accusation we deny, we do not judge Novices besides our selves uncapable to receive our Principles; we know Christ the true Light hath enlighted every one that comes into the World, and the Gospel we Preach, is to turn the minds of People from Darkness to Light, and who it minds, it will give them an understanding, the principle of pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to know, Christ the Light in whom we stand clear of thy Slanders; in this Light we plainly speak, as moved of him, and do not study to darken the sence of our words, as thou dost falsly accuse us, the Lord is Judge between thee and us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Accusation charging us with damnable Heresies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And further thou saist, what thou hast charged us withal, is upon such rational grounds, that thou art sure we are convinced, in the seceret of our Hearts and Consciences, that thou Lies not: In the presence of God I charge thee to be a Liar, in the Slanders and Lies before written, what followeth will make thee more manifest; thou saist, we frequently judge Men by the Light which gave forth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even while we are opposing the authority of Scriptures, as they are the only Rule of knowing God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Thy charge is false, in saying we oppose the authority of Scriptures, which Christ the Light, who gave forth the Scripture, who spake as one having au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and not as the Scribes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.29. and the Scripture is a true Testimony of him, who is the Way to the Father, <hi>none knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son reveals him,</hi> Mat. 11.27. So thou in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58114:68"/>
the Light art seen to be guilty of what thou chargest us withal, in denying Christ the Light within, to be the Authority of Scriptures, and the perfect Rule of Faith and Obedience; therefore let Flesh be silent, and the lying Mouth be stopped, for Christ we own, which was before the Scriptures, and is the authority of them, for when he spoke them forth, he spoke as one having authority, and according as Christ speaketh of the Scriptures, we them own in their place, a true Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39.40. <hi>who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and no Man cometh to the Father, but by him,</hi> John 14.6.</p>
            <p>So none oomes to the knowledge of the Father by reading the Scriptures, though they think to find Life there, they shall not, if they come not to Christ, of whom they testifie, and in whom the Life is, who saith, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think to have eternal Life,</hi> and they are they which testifie of me; and he reproves all who will not come to him, that they may have life. So what thou chargest us withal, thou art the Man that denies the authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and found guilty of slandering the Children of Light, as what is written makes manifest, and what as followeth will make thee more manifest, to all that have Eyes to see the many Falshoods and Lies thou hast begun the Book withal, in that thou calls the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Reader; so out of thy own Mouth thou art Condemned.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth Accusation, thou saist, we are so drunk with Delusion and Impudency, that we will rather charge the Scripture with deceit, then question our own deceitful Hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> In the presence of God we witness against
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58114:69"/>
thee, we own the Scripture to be the Scripture of Truth, and do not charge the Scripture with deceit, but with the Light of Christ that gave forth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and discovereth the deceit of the Heart, with which Light we judge the deceit of the Heart, and witness against thee in the Light, which makes known to us the Scripture in the Truth, as it is in Jesus Christ the Light, God is our witness.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth false Accusation, thou saist, we write and speak the Language of Scripture, as if we were for it, and is not, which is rank Hypocrisie, and done of purpose to deceive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> We in the Light speak as moved of the Lord, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. whose Language is according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and doing any thing in Hypocrisie we deny, or to deceive any, the Lord is our witness, who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the lying spirit, and stop thy lying Mouth.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The sixth false Accusation, thou saist we boast, that we are as perfect as Christ that dyed at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Thy charge is false, boasting we deny, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perfection that is of self; our Righteousness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ, is as a filthy Ragg, and a menstruous Cloth; Christ our Righteousness, who is the true Light, <hi>That lighteth every one that comes into the World, Iohn</hi> 1.9. we witness him the same Christ, as was in that Body that suffered at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; and every one of the Children of Light in the measure of growth in him, the same mind is in them, that was in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5. who is the brightness of the Fathers glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The seventh false Accusation, thou saist we say, that he that trusts in Christ that dyed at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for Salvation, shall be deceived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:58114:69"/>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This Charge is false as the other, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God we witness against thee, no other Christ we bear Testimony of, to be the Salvation of lost Man and Woman, but that Christ according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Testimony, who was born of the Virgin, and made a good Confession before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and suffered at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and rose again the third day, and ascended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, and sitteth at the right Hand of God; and this Christ we witness the true Light, <hi>Who lighteth every one that comes into the World,</hi> and saith, <hi>I stand at the Door and knock, who opens, I will come into him, and Sup with him, and he with me,</hi> Rev. 3.20. and we wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness him faithful; <hi>And as many as receives him, to them he gives power to become the Sons of God</hi>; and this is the condemnation of all, because they believe not in him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The eight false Accusation, thou saist we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Christs Institutions and holy Ordinances, with the odium of Mens Traditions, outward Observations, inconsistant with Gods Kingdom, and compares them to <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi>'s great Idol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Thy Charge is false, Christs Institutions, and holy Ordinances, we own in the Dispensation of time they were to be continued, and what is now in this Dispensation of time, known in the administration of his Spirit we own; but who upholds any Idolatry in observing any thing by Tradition, and not guided by the Spirit of Christ, and so walk contrary to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Law of God in the Conscience; and though their words be never so glorious in outward appearance, in crying the Ordinances of Christ, while they deny to be guided by Christ, they are no Ordinances of Christ, but an Image, set up in the proud exalted nature, which
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58114:70"/>
               <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> set up his Image in, which with the Power of God shall be thrown down, and thou with the rest of the Idol Worshippers shall be broken to pieces, and Lies shall not save thee; for the Lord will exalt his Name, and his Children that observe his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances shall raign in his spiritual Power, that preserves them, therein to observe the movings of his Spirit, which doth lead to worship the Father in Spirit and Truth, according to Scripture Testimony, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.23, 24.</p>
            <p>And when thou <hi>Iohn Timson</hi> hast presented thy false Accusations and Lies to the Reader, in the Preface of thy Book, that they might receive the Falshoods, and Lies that are written therein, and these Lies and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which are here laid before thee, and witnessed against, in the answer thereto returned will sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove to thy face, and be manifest to that of God in every ones Conscience, that thou hast spoken unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly with thy Lips, when thou saist thou Lies not, and all these Lies found in thy Mouth; given forth publickely for all to read; and thou declares to the Reader, that the Lord knows, what diligence and tenderness of Bowels, thou hast had to prepare it for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Reply.</hi> Blush, for shame, O vain Man, to appeal to the Lords knowledge of thy diligence and tenderness of Bowels, to prepare so many Lies and Falshoods for People to read, thou shalt certainly know that the Lord takes notice of thee, and he will lay thee open, and make thee manifest, and Lies shall not cover thee, nor be thy refuge, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.17. when our God will clear his Truth, and thy Tongue, and all others, that rise up against him, shall fall in Judgement, the day shall declare it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:58114:70"/>Further, thou goes on, saying, as for those persons that have answered me, who have charged me with bringing sorth many Lies and Slanders, and have made a noise thereof, as if I was some carnal lying wretch, that matters not what I write.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> To that of God in every ones Conscience I appeal, that Lies proceed from a carnal wretched Heart, and the Lord is making thee manifest, who would make Lies thy refuge; which with the Light thou art seen, and thy Lies turned upon thee, that in the Light thou mayst be read what thou art; and in the Light our Books are known, and no such thing is in our Books as thou falsly charges us with, and would make People believe is written therein, in giving the sence of our words in thy dark mind; and for the Simples sake, an answer is returned, to clear the Truth of God, in what he hath given out by his Spirit, both in word and writing, and whether thou wilt receive it, yea, or nay, thou shalt know, and all others, that Christ is the Authority of the Scripture, and when he spoke them forth, he spake as one having Authority, and not as a Scribe; and who in his Light walk, cannot be perswaded to turn from him, by any Lies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches thou canst cast upon them, who saist we are wholly turned from the Truth, which against thee witness it is not so, let God be Judge and in his day make manifest what we are, in whose Will we rest, as moved of him to witness against the Falshoods, thou hast further charged upon us in what followeth.</p>
            <p>Thou hast not done justly nor honestly in that thou hast not Printed the Questions, as given forth by thee, and Answers as returned by us, and in an answer to what is of thee required, to prove the Charge thou

chargest us withal, in thy Reply to the Answer to the first Question, and the false Accusations, Lies and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders is not proved in all thou hast writ.</p>

            <p>TO all Rulers, Teachers and People, in the Nation of <hi>England</hi>; and to all the Inhabitants in these Northren Countries, in which the mighty Jehovah Lord God omnipotent over all, hath determined to raise up his righteous Seed, to the exaltation of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his great Name, to the fulfilling of the Scriptures of Truth, as is Recorded in <hi>Ieremiah</hi> the 23. <hi>Chap.</hi> and 7. and 8. verses, It shall no more be said, the Lord liveth that brought us out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but shall be said, the Lord liveth that hath raised his Seed, and brought it forth of the North Countrey, and out of all the Nations where it is scattered; and this I have to declare to you all, in the Authority of the Word of his Holiness; The Lord will manifest according to the determination and purpose of his mind, unto a poor people that fear before him, and seek the Lord with strong cries and tears day and night, that if it be the Pleasure of the Lord, all the Inhabitants in

            <p>Oh what shall I say concerning the People of the Land of my Nativity; Oh my Bowels, my Bowels are moved within me for her Inhabitants, from the highest to the lowest, with all in these Northen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and in the tender compassion I cannot be silent, but in the force of the Spirit of the Lord exhort all, who yet witness not redemption from their vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations;

turn, turn, why will ye die, for the Lord God will not be mocked, he is of purer Eyes then to behold Iniquity; Oh reject not his Counsel, neither kick at the reproofs of the Lord, for the day of his Patience will not extend for ever, neither will his Spirit always strive with man, for he is jealous of his Glory. Oh turn, turn, all People, and diligently hearken to the Counsel of God, the Light of his own Spirit, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves you secretly in your Hearts and Consciences, and look up to the Lord with the eye of your minds, in true watchfulness and dependency upon the Lord, that he may save you from your iniquities, that you may find peace with God, whatever befal you in these days of great calamity, which is upon the Face of the Earth: Oh People if you reject God's Counsel and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den your necks against the reproofs of the Spirit of the Lord. Oh what shall I say unto you, seeing there is no minding the Fear of the Lord, but every one doth what seemeth good in your own Eyes: Oh the pity that's to you from one that cannot help you, but in the sence of your misery, that rejects Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, saith in my secret mournings for you; Oh that my Eyes were as a Fountain of Tears, that I might water thy Altar, Oh Lord, day and night, that if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thou mightst be prevailed withal, and change thy purpose concerning this stiff-necked and hard-hearted People, that reject thy Counsel in the Land of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: But notwithstanding all this simpathizing Bowels, as one who hath received favour at thy Hands, Oh Lord, I leave all with thee, spare thy People, Oh Lord, and inable them to go thorough the trial of the day, and sweeten their passage, and the Cup they are to drink,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:58114:170"/>
who fear before thee, and tremble at the Word of thy Holiness, even so be it with them, oh Lord.</p>
            <p>Once more I cannot but exhort all People, look about you, yea from the highest to the lowest, and who hath not desperately sold themselves to do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, take a view of the Lords dealings with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Land, how he hath shaked the rods of his many Judgments over the Nation, which did smite upon many, and they were mown down as grass, which caused many that feared the Lord to wrestle with him with strong crys day and night, that he would stay the hand of the destroying Angel, and the Lord heard his poor People, and stayed his Hand in a great measure, waiting to see if the People of the Land would mend their ways, and the Rulers therein would give over persecuting, imprisoning, spoiling and banishing his poor People, who fear before him, and serves him in uprightness of their Hearts day and night, and dare not disobey him in what he makes known unto them, though they hazard their Liberty and all enjoyments, yea life it self, so tender are they over the Glory of the Lord, who hath given them victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over sin, and all selfishness, through the Blood of the Lamb, and the word of their Testimony, no more to love their lives to death, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But Oh, you Rulers, though God hath stayed his Hand in a great measure, that the sound of mortality is not so loud in the Ears as hath been, yet how do you answer the end of the Lord, seeing that few Prisons in the Nation but the Lords People are in them, because of the exercise of their pure Consciences towards the Lord, and other cruel proceedings in rending Husband from Wife, and Wife from Husband, and Parents
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:58114:171"/>
from Children, and Children from Parents, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely banishing them out of their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: for these things, and other wicked proceedings, the Hand of the Lord is stretched out still, and the pale Horse is on his way, passing to and fro in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he that rideth thereon is Death, smiting and cuting down with the Sword of Plague and Pestilence; and if so be you proceed as you have done, in executing these cruel Laws against the innocent, then will the commission of the Rider of the pale Horse be enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what flesh can stand before the pale Horse, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rider thereon is <hi>Death,</hi> as is recorded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.8.</p>
            <p>Oh my Bowels is moved within me for the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that will come upon the Nation, if you Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers continue your Persecution, for the day of the Lord hastens, that they that do wickedly shall be as stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the Maker thereof shall be as a Spark, and he will blow up the flame in the fierceness of his wrath; and who can stand in this terrible dreadful day, wherein Christ shall be revealed in flames, rendering Vengeance on all them that know him not, and obey not the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the Lord Jesus Christ, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Further, this I exhort, all mind what you say and do, who hath hardened their Hearts in a boasting Spirit, and said, we see no difference, but these Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we cast in Prison God cuts off in a common Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity as well as others; the sence of their sufferings causeth many a Cry and Tear to be poured forth before the Lord, and the mighty God answered and said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Soul, I have beholden the cruelty of Men, how they have stowed my People up in Prisons, and in the Ship, where the infection was, and them that hath
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:58114:171"/>
been taken away, their Blood shall be required at their Hands who cast them into Prison, and as to all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral that fell in the common Calamity that feared my Name, it was to stain the pride of the glory of all Flesh, as well amongst my People, as others, that my People might wait in my Light to stand in a true preparation for the day of their dissolution; therefore I take away my People in my everlasting loving kindness from the evil to come, but the wicked I cut off in my Fury, and they shall reap the fruit of their own doings, and this is the substance of what the Lord hath said in taking away his People in this common Calamity; therefore let the stout-hearted bend, and no more boast themselves in loftiness of their minds, to see the righteous taken away, for if the judgment begin at the House of God, and the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the wicked and ungodly and Sinners appear; for yet a little while, and the Lord will plead the cause of his People, with terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vengeance he will manifest himself, and the Rod of the wicked shall nor always lye upon the backs of the righteous, but their long continued Afflictions will be accomplished in time; therefore you meek, gentle, and peaceable quiet People, who abhor every appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil, abide in the Word of Patience, and pray for them that Persecute you, that if it be the Will of God we may prevail with the Lord, that their Eyes may be opened, and their Hearts softned, that they may break off from their evil doings, and so escape the terrible vengeance, as is before written, wherein the Lord will break the Battle out of the Earth, and establish purity and peace amongst a people called by his Name; that as they have sowen in Sorrow and long-suffering, they shall reap with Joy, in this great and terrible day of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:58114:172"/>
the coming of our Lord, which is nigh to be revealed, wherein he will say to the wicked that hath imprisoned, and afflicted his People, Go ye cursed into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels; and to his righteous Blessed suffering Seed, he will say, Come you Blessed of my Father, enter into the Kingdom prepared for you before the Foundation of the Earth was laid; so shall every one reap the fruit of their doings, whether it be good or evil; according to their deeds, so shall be their reward from the Lord, who is over all Blessed for ever.</p>
            <p>Oh, <hi>London, London,</hi> yea I say once more you Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>London,</hi> whose lives was given you for a prey, and you stand as Monuments of Gods Mercy to this day, while many of your dear Relations, Neighbours, and Acquaintance were cut down, with him that rid upon the pale Horse; Oh, that you would lay it to Heart, who are yet living before the Lord, and all turn to the Counsel of the Lord, the Light and Manifestation of his Spirit in your own Consciences, to guide you in all fear, and dread of the Eternal God, to wait upon him to feel the opperation of his holy Spirit, to guide you in all your words, and works, that so you may be a good savour unto the Lord in your faithful Obedience to the measure of his Spirit, that so he may take delight in you, and take away the reproach that hath been cast upon you, the Inhabitants of the City of <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But if you People, in the City of <hi>London,</hi> do not prize the Mercies of the Lord, but slight all his kindnesses, and harden your Hearts and not regard the reproofs of his Spirit, but delight your Hearts in pride, pleasures, pomp, riches, and glory, in this present World, and with so doing provoke the Eyes of the Glory of the Great

            <p>CAlled in the Light of the Lord Jesus to stand li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Witnesses for him upon the Earth amongst the Children of Men: Oh! the Bowels of the Love of the Lord that is in my Heart to you, that when I was nigh unto death, to the sight of all that saw me (as to the outward Man) and scarce able to speak, I was constrained to give forth the substance of what is now sent amongst you, for a perfect discovery of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, seeing that many are called, and few chosen; and many convinced that are not converted; therefore are these lines written, that you may truly know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you be born again, and redeemed from the Earth yea or nay. And in order thereunto, let every Man and Woman search their Hearts with the Light of the Lord, and it will truly manifest whether you be born again, and so feed upon the Tree of Life; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise you rest in outward formal conformity to the Tturh, and the heart in the Earth, and that Spirit will turn against Truth, and hath done: And some others
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58114:174"/>
are drawn to delight their Hearts in the Gifts,<note place="margin">1668</note> Parts, and knowledge which the Lord hath given them, more then in the Lord, the Fountain from whence they come; and so abuse the gift, and feeds upon the fruit of the Tree of Knowledg, which puffeth up, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Man wise in his own eyes, and say in his Heart, I am wise, and rich, sees, and wants nothing; when they are Blind, miserable, naked, and wants all things; and whatever any profess, as to the Service of God, that is in this condition, they have an end to themselves in what they do, which grieveth the Spirit of the Lord, when Men and Women in a discoursitive Spirit takes upon them to declare the Truth, when the Lord nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther calls them, nor speaketh by them; so are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren born of the Royal Seed burthened, (for such have turned against the Truth, and the Children born of it) whom the Lord hath and will ease in the day determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when all mouthes shall be closed in silence, but who are opened by him; and not any Voice be heard, but his own Spirit speaking in and thorow his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, born of him, who alone seeks his Glory, and not any thing for themselves which must be denied. Therefore seeing the Enemies wiles are great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; let all dread the Lord, and who have been led astray, wait in the heart-searching Light, to see the Mystery of Iniquity where it led them forth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Light to judge down proud exalted self, which hath turned against the Truth, and bring into true Poverty, and abhoring of self, to wait at the Throne of Grace, for the Lord to raise you up in the Resurrection which raised up Jesus from the dead; and in this Life contentious Self is buried in death, and the true unity is known, where the Lord alone is exalted

            </p>
            <p>And all dear Friends and Brethren that love the Light, and rejoyce in the Judgments of the Lord, to have subtil Self buried in the true Death, that what gifts of the Spirit soever the Lord gives unto you, and the Enemy tempt you never so strongly to puff you up in a self-priding spirit, in what you have received of the Lord; yet his fear is so minded by you, which keeps you in a true sence of your nothingness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and emptiness in your selves, which causes you to wait in true self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WHom the Lord hath in this his Glorious Day visited, and in his Light plucked as Brands out of the Fire, to wait upon him, that his Great Work of Regeneration may be perfected in all of you, to your Eternal Comfort, and the Glory of the Name of our God forever, &amp;c. And my dear Friends, seeing many are Called, and few Chosen; many Convinced, that are not Converted; and many come forth with us, and go forth from us, that are not of us, as by sad Experience hath been witnessed, &amp;c. and from the deep Sense of this working of the Enemy, I am constrained to send this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle</hi> amongst you, knowing the Kingdom of God is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto Ten Virgins, Five Wise and Five Foolish, who had all Lamps, and slumbred in the Secure Mind, until they were awakened to enter in with their Lord, then were the Foolish Virgins made manifest, that though they had Lamps like the other, yet wanting the Oyl, they neither did or could enter, &amp;c. Oh! dear and tender Friends, let all Dread the Lord, who make mention of his Name in the Light of Christ; for this Parable is to you, unto whom the Lord hath sent to preach to you and in you the Word of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>And this is upon my Spirit, in the Word of the Lord to you all convinced of the precious Truth of our
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:58114:180"/>
God, turly to examine and search your Hearts with the Light of Christ Jesus, that you may have a certain Knowledge, how it is with you, and how you escaped the subtil Wiles of the Enemy, which have hindred so many from the Possession of the Life of Truth; and that you may truly discern, how the Enemy draws into the Foolish Conceitedness, in the Out-side and Formal Profession of the Truth feeding upon the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Part, and so stoppeth the Hunger that should reach the Life; and then in an Exaltedness saith, <hi>I See, Know, am Clothed, and want Nothing</hi>; when they are Blind, Naked, Miserable and want all things, and this is the State of all the Foolish Virgins, who dwell in the Outward Court, and place all their Confidence in the Form, and Outside, and Profession of Truth, and so has lost the Sense of that Heavenly Hunger, which must possess the Life hid with God, or else it must mourn out its days in Sorrow. Therefore all dear Friends, watch diligently to the Heart-searching Light, that this Mystery of Iniquity you may all discern, that so the Enemy may not prevail against you, to turn you aside, either to the Right Hand or to the Left, that whatever the Lord has convinced you of to be Evil, you may wait upon him for Strength, to preserve you out of it, that so you may Answer God's Witness in the Regulation of your Conversation in the Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of your Hearts, so you may stand clear before the Lord, that you are willing to do and suffer whatever the Lord should call you to; and when you have done all this, then be you watchful to the Heart-searching Light, that the Enemy doth not draw your Minds to place your Confidence in the Work of Righteousness you have done, as the <hi>Ground of your Hope and Calling

So tender Friends, that truly seek God's Glory, and so love his Light that you are willing to give up Life and all to do his Will; and when the Enemy would draw you to rest in what you have done and so take the Jewels of God and play the Harlot, and deck Your Selves; you Drea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

our Fellowship with the Father in the Son, and one with another in him: and all dear Brethren and Sisters, in this Word of Faith keep your Meetings, both vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly and faithfully, that so none of you be found for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking the assembling of your selves, as the manner of some is, who are out of the Word of Faith; but as the Lord hath counted you worthy to be his Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-place on Earth, and his Tabernacle amongst the Children of Men; Prize every Oportunity the Lord affordeth you to meet together in his Powerful Holy Name, with the Loins of your Minds girt up with the Word of Faith in you, which will empty you of Self, and cloth you with the Garment of deep Humility, and fill you with the Riches of his Everlasting Love and Endless Mercies, for God dwelleth with the Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the Proud he beholds afar off: So, without Faith in the Name of Christ, and a Humble Spirit, the In-dwelling Presence of the King of Eternal Glory you cannot enjoy: Therefore I charge you in the Name of the Lord, Hearken not to any Suggestions within you, nor Counsels without you, that would draw you to sleight or forsake meeting together in the Name of the Lord Jesus; but let every particular Member know your Service in the Body, that by your Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness others be encouraged to meet with you, to wait in the Light, to feel the Living Refreshings of the Lord; and when you are refreshed with the Income of God's sweet Presence, be watchful, that not any utter words rashly before the Lord, to spend your Talent in a forward Spirit, to satisfie the Lust, that would appear further then the Lord would have them, as some have done which has brought them under a great Vail of Darkness, and have

Therefore, dear Friends, wait in the Light, that the Word of the Lord may dwell plentifully in you, as it is written, so are we Witnesses; <hi>If any have my Word, let him speak my Word faithfully; is not my Word like a Fire and a Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that breaks the Rocks in pieces,</hi> which sealeth up the Testimony God calleth unto in the Heart of his Disciples: Therefore all be very circumspect in this weighty Matter, that whatever you feel of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshings of God in you, that you do not let any thing come forth, either in Words or Sounds, or any Noises, but what is brought forth in the Authority of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Powerful Word; then will the Blessing of the Lord attend what is brought forth, be it much or little, either in Words or Hymns, or Joyful Sounds, do not quench it, but answer the Lord in the Authority of the Word of Eternal Life; and the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Lord, who are thus exercised, will not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den any, but it will be a Stream of Refreshing in the Hearts of all the Righteous; thus will every Vessel be preserved in the Life of Truth, and not go but as the Presence of the Lord goes before them: Therefore let all dread and fear the Mighty God, who have received any Gift, to see that the True Birth possess the Gift,

               </gap>s were published in Print, which would appear to the Reader of a tendancy as to the breach of Unity; (which
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:58114:195"/>
would cause the Enemies of God to Rejoyce; it did so wound my Spirit, that for many Week, they that saw me did not expect that I would continue long in the Body: But God in his Mercy restored Strength in his Appointed time.</p>
            <p>And when I did hear that some in the <hi>West,</hi> did intend to Publish in Print against some Friends: I bore my Testimony against such proceedings, and told one that did favour what was intended, that I would have my Hand cut off, before I would exercise it in such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings: And desired him, to speak to <hi>W.

            <p>So to Clear my Conscience of all False Reports cast upon me, as that I have Encouraged what is brought forth as before written; and to satisfie all Friends in God, I have Laboured according to the Ability God hath given me, to prevent the publishing all things of that Nature, as afore-said; and have Endeavoured with all concerned, that I could meet with: to have a care of watching for Evil, lest they provoke one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wrath, and so quench the love: But rather look at the good one in another, and in the Love of God Minister, to preserve them forth of any weakness they

did see lay near to attend them; that so the pure Holy Spirit of Life and Love, that first gathered us into it self, to be a People in God, and in his blessed Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to raign over what was, and is contrary to his blessed Nature, may again restore, (where it is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) in the Universality of its blessed Power, to make up the Breaches, and to restore the Desolate ones, in causing every one that Professeth the Blessed Truth of God, to love their Neighbour as themselves; and so to do unto all, as they would have others to do unto them; that so all concerned in the Exercise, in the Measure of the Grace of God in Christ, (that seeks the peace of his People) may stand as Saviours upon mount <hi>Sion,</hi> to the Honour of the Name of the Lord our God, and the Eternal comfort of all that love not their Lives unto Death, to serve the Lord, and his dear and chosen People, in the Meek Patient and Peaceable Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>In which the Lord keep you all with my Soul; that in his pure and Peaceable Dominion we all Reign, and throw down our Crowns before his Throne, and all unanimously Sing, all Glory, Honour, Praises, Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and Dominion be given to him, who is found worthy to sit upon his Throne in all our Consciences, Christ Jesus the true Light, and hope of our Glory, even so be it with all that Professeth his Blessed Truth, Saith my Soul in the Name of the Lord.</p>

            <p>But of late I have heard that thou my antient Friend <hi>Edward Nightingal,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Cox,</hi> with some other in that City, doth meet in a Separating spirit from the rest of Friends in that City, which casts a Stumbling-block in the way of many: And instead of gathering Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to receive the Truth, you scatter and drive them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and giveth great advantage to them that watch for evil, and is of a bad savour, and a Wounding of the Spirits of them that truly fear the Lord: I can truly say that your meeting in that Separating spirit, which is such an evil savour in the Nation, hath been and is more Affliction to me, then all Persecutions and Imprisonments I have endured unto this day: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I intreat and beseech thee, my Antient Friend <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Nightingal,</hi> with all that meet in the Separation from the rest of Friends in the City, to turn your minds to the Light of Christ in you, that will let you see you have not done well, and with it judge that which hath led you to Separate from meeting with Friends; and return to meet with Friends in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the sweet Concord, Love and Unity, in the Life of the Blessed Truth, as in the days of old and Years past, of which I am a witness with the rest of faithful Friends, that in all our Meetings, whether in the Prison, or in the City, we never wanted the sweet appearance of Christ our Life in us, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, according to his Promise, and our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort then, and so is it now, with all that meet in his Name, and Unity with his People, as we did in those days, which was many Years before the Enemy could
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:58114:198"/>
get any enterance to make a breach, amongst them that make Profession of Gods blessed Truth, and to draw some into a self Separation, as he hath done you, and too many elsewhere: For I do assure you it is the work of the Enemy of your Souls; for you should not have Separated, but have kept your places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Friends; and not have taken offence because Friends see there might be some service for Truth, in meeting twice on the First Day; it is very like in that City, some that had a Love to Truth, might get an opportunity to come to one of the Meetings: It is very much to me, how you let the Enemy get over you, as to cause you to Separate from Friends; which if you had kept your places, in meeting with Friends, you in time might have seen a Service in meeting twice a day as well as they: For you may be sure that Separation neither restores any to love the Truth, neither gathers any to God, but rather scattereth and driveth away some that was gathered in Love to Truth, by the painful and faithful Labourers that was truly sent of the Lord, as is before written. Therefore in the earnings of tender Bowels of the Love of God to you, I once more beseech you, that you in Humiliation wait in the Light of Christ, he will let you see how the Enemy led you from the Light out of your places, when you Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Meeting with Friends; and in yeilding obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Light, it will bring you into your places again, to meet with Friends to your Comfort, and the Honour of the Name of the Lord, according to the Counsel of the Lord in my Heart, here sent unto you.</p>
            <p>But if you reject the Council of the Lord, which in
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:58114:199"/>
his Love I am moved to send these Lines unto you; then shall I Lament your Conditions, because of the evil consequence your Separation will produce to your sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and wounding many God would not have Wounded; for which you must give an account: And before you lay down your Heads in peace, you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me, who hath not hide from you the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of the Lord.</p>

            <p>And my dear Friends, I desire all to be watchful, that not any come short of what is required of them, both Rulers of Families, and Parents of Children; while you have a day to be with them, call your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies together to wait upon the Lord, in the fear of his Name; certainly the Lord will answer the end of your endeavours in causing the savoury Life to stream through you, to season your Servants and Children, that the Church of God may be in every pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

by all Superfluity, that your good Examples may raise up the witness of God in your Children; and for want of this care in some Parents, and being too indulgent, and full of lenity to their Children they grow Rude, Stubborn, Self-willed and Disobedient to their Parents, while they are under their tuishion, to the wounding of the Hearts of their Parents, who neglected their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to the Government of their Children in their tender Years: Therefore I desire and beseech you, in this weighty concern, that you slight not the opper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity God gives you, to be in all things a good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all that live with you, both Children and Servants, that by your godly Conversation, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Exhortations you raise up the Witness for God in your Children and Servants, and in exercising the Power God hath given to you, to cross and keep down the evil Nature, while they live with you: And when your Children grow up, take them to Meetings, and keep your Eyes over them, that they behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves soberly according to your Exhortations; then encourage them in wel-doing, so will the Lord bless your sweet and heavenly Behaviour in your Families, that Servants will bless God that ever it was their lots to come into your Families, in that their Spirits were sweetly seasoned with the Truth, by your heavenly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and Care over them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and your Children will magnifie the Name of the Lord for your blessed Care and heavenly Instructions, and godly Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours every way for their good in this World, and their eternal happiness in the World to come, which will Crown the hoary Heads of their Parents with Joy, to see their blessed care and endeavours sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Children, and to see their Off-spring to be

            <p>And if any of these Children of these heavenly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Parents, when they are from under their tuishion, for want of watchfulness, grow into carelesness, and turn their backs of the blessed Truth of God, and trample all the care and good counsel of their Parents under their Feet, to satisfie their own Wills in the Pride and Vanity of this evil World, to the wounding of the Hearts of their careful and loving Parents, they will be clear of their Blood, when they shall reap the fruit of their doings except they Repent.</p>
            <p>And all you young and tender People, with others that come among Friends, through the education of your careful Parents, Masters or Mistrisses you have been under, I have a concern upon my Spirit to write to you, that you do not rest in an outward profession of the Truth, by what you have received by Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but all watch to the heart searching Light of Christ in you, which will let you see you must be Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and Born again, and so be made real and faithful Friends, by the Heavenly inspiration of the powerful

Spirit of God in you, which if you be careful upon your watch, you will see Judgment upon all in you that is not obedient to the Light of Christ, in whose Light you will see more Light, that will let you see your great necessity of the enjoyment of the Life which is hid with Christ in God, which will cause you to pray without ceasing, that the Lord would enable you to loath and abhor the Pride, Pomp and Pleasure of this evil World, and to give you assurance of Gods Love to your Souls; and until you enjoy it in all places of your retirement, you will pour forth your Supplications with Tears to the Lord, as the blessed and heavenly Travellers and Companions did and doth, who could not find the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in outward observations, tho none more faithful in observing what is made known to them to be the Will of God; but the Kingdom of God not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in outward observations, you in the Light press forward, according to your Spiritual Hunger and Thirst, in true poverty of Spirit, weeping and seeking the Lord your God, asking the way to <hi>Sion,</hi> with your Faces thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward, that you may enjoy his Salvation for Walls and Bulwarks.</p>
