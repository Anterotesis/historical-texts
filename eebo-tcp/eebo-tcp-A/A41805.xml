            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN APPEAL TO ALL <hi>True Engliſh-men, (If there be any ſuch left,</hi>) Or, A CRY for BREAD.</head>
            <p>THE Philoſopher having invited ſome <hi>curious Wits,</hi> and perhaps no <hi>dull Palats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to an Entertainment; when the Table was ſpread, and plentifully furniſhed with variety of excellent Diſhes, and the Gueſs ſet; inſtead of falling on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and eating (as was expected) they all ſat gazing on one another, no Man offering to touch any thing: At which, the Maſter of the Feaſt amazed, looks about to ſee if he could diſcover what ſhould be the Reaſon that his Gueſts did not mind their Meat, and inſtantly he perceived that there was <hi>no Bread on the Board.</hi> A greater Error than perhaps ſome may think it; for the moſt <hi>delicious Viands</hi> without <hi>Bread</hi> are not <hi>ſavory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or at leaſt will not be long ſo. Let other <hi>Dainties</hi> be what they will, <hi>Bread</hi> is the <hi>ſtanding Diſh:</hi> With thoſe we may pleaſe our <hi>Palats,</hi> but without that we cannot <hi>Live.</hi> So that the Proverb hath only done it Juſtice, in telling us, <hi>That Bread is the Staff of Life:</hi> And that Country is moſt highly eſteemed which can beſt ſecure its Inhabitants from the want of it.</p>
            <p>Now our own <hi>Dear Country</hi> of <hi>England</hi> has been thought to yield to none for <hi>Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in <hi>Corn,</hi> and conſequently for <hi>fulneſs</hi> of <hi>Bread.</hi> Of old it, and <hi>Sicily,</hi> were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Roman Granaries;</hi> though now it is quite another thing, and every way for the better: For conſidering how much the Art and Induſtry of the Husband-man at this time o'th' day excels thoſe of former times, and how much the Ground is cleared from <hi>Roughs, Woods, Foreſts, Fens,</hi> and ſuch kind of unprofitable or uſeleſs Places, as anciently eat up a great part of the Iſland, it may now be modeſtly judged to be capable of producing Four times the Quantity of Grain which it did in <hi>Roman</hi> Times; though then it was thought that it might vye with any other Place in the World. And I have heard ſome Men, who neither wanted Parts nor Experience, ſtrenuouſly argue, and with ſeeming ſound Reaſon conclude, That ſince the Improvement in the Northern and Weſtern Parts, it is impoſſible that there ſhould ever be any thing like a Famine in <hi>England,</hi> ſuppoſing Corn were not half a Crop, which rarely happens.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:109914:2"/>Theſe Things being ſo plain, we might perhaps think our ſelves the happieſt People under the Sun, if we could fill our Bellies with Reaſons; but I never knew an hungry Stomach ſurfeit with Arguments: A piece of <hi>Bread and Cheeſe</hi> is more worth to ſuch a one than all the <hi>fine Talk</hi> in the World; and in ſpite of all that has or can be ſaid, we find even in this <hi>fruitful Country</hi> ſuch a <hi>Famine of Bread</hi> coming upon us, as is likely to <hi>pinch</hi> the <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>ſtarve</hi> the <hi>Poor.</hi> And what ſhall we do in this Caſe? Shall we believe thoſe who tell us, that we cannot want in ſuch a Country as this? I fear our <hi>gnawing Stomachs</hi> will not ſuffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> our <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings</hi> to be <hi>gull'd</hi> in a Matter of this Nature. What then? Shall we lie down, and dye? Shall we, like a Parcel of Sots and Fools, tamely ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Malady, and pine away the miſerable Remainder of our Days without further Care? Or ſhall we try, if there be any Remedy? Certainly thoſe Men have loſt both their Wits and Senſes too, who would not uſe their utmoſt Endeavors to prevent ſuch a general Miſchief as this. Now if we will ſeriouſly, and to any purpoſe, ſeek after a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, we muſt firſt make Enquiry after the true Cauſe of our want; for if we can take away that, our old Plenty will return.</p>
            <p>Well Country-men! ſhall we ſend <hi>Hui and Cry</hi> after the Cauſe of this Miſchief and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery? Any Man will ſay there is little need of that: For if it were poſſible to find out ſo meer a <hi>Cockney</hi> as never ſaw a <hi>Field of Corn</hi> in his Life; yet if you ſhould ask him what might be the Reaſon of <hi>want of Bread,</hi> he would preſently tell you <hi>want of Corn;</hi> and would ſay, That he were a moſt impudent Fellow who ſhould affirm, that there could be any <hi>want of Bread</hi> in a Country, which at the ſame time afforded <hi>plenty of Corn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And yet ſuch a Paradox as this I muſt maintain, if I will ſpeak truth; and ſhew you the true Reaſon of your preſent want of Bread, which is daily like to be greater. Indeed if the <hi>Earth</hi> had play'd the <hi>Step-mother,</hi> and proved unkind to us, it would then have concerned us to have ſent abroad, and furniſhed our ſelves from other Countries which have to ſpa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, as hath been the Practice and Prudence of ſome of our Neighbors, eſpecially <hi>France</hi> of late, whoſe Policy it were better to <hi>imitate</hi> than <hi>ſtarve.</hi> But that is not the Caſe; if we might enjoy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>our own,</hi> we need trouble <hi>no Body elſe.</hi> For I dare boldly affirm, That for Twenty Years laſt paſt, there hath ſcarce been a better general Crop of Bread-Corn, than was this Year, and the laſt. As for the laſt Year, what I ſay will be eaſily granted; yea, I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe, that it produced enough to furniſh us for that Year, and this too, if an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Uſe had been made of it. As for this Year, I find many poſſeſſed with another Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which I cannot but admire; for I have had Occaſion to view the Corn in ſeveral Counties: And in ſpite of any <hi>Dutch-man</hi> alive, will pretend to ſome Underſtanding of it; and I every where found <hi>Bread-Corn</hi> a <hi>good Crap;</hi> nay, Wheat to the Eye ſeemed to out-do that of the laſt Year. And though I do not think it to be really altogether ſo good, yet is it a Crop not to be complained of, and under which we need know no want. And though a Thouſand <hi>New-faſhion'd, Sham, Dutch Tranſubſtantiation Arguments</hi> were brought againſt this, yet they ſhall never perſwade me out of my <hi>Senſes.</hi> I will therefore lay this down for a certain Concluſion; <hi>That the Reaſon of our Scarcity is not from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of the Earth, or for Want of a Crop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will ſay then, what is the Reaſon? If you pleaſe, <hi>Country-men,</hi> we will firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine thoſe Reaſons that paſs for current, and then ſee if we can find out the true one. Some think, that it may contribute ſomething to our Scarcity, That in many Places they are not able to <hi>manage</hi> their <hi>Harveſt,</hi> and <hi>want Hands</hi> to get in their <hi>Corn.</hi> This, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, is a very deplorable Thing; and, if true, makes the Matter much worſe. For if we already want Hands to <hi>get our</hi> Corn, by reaſon that thoſe who uſed to aſſiſt in that Matter are gone for Soldiers, or knockt o'th' Head; in a while it will be in danger to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109914:2"/>
come to this paſs, That we ſhall want Hands to <hi>till and ſow the Ground,</hi> and ſo we ſhall have <hi>no Corn at all.</hi> But however, this cannot be the Reaſon of our preſent Scarcity: For want of Hands may be a Reaſon for a more tedious Harveſt, or may let Corn receive ſome Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; but this, if by chance it make it ſomething worſe, yet it makes it nothing leſs: It may abate of the Pleaſantneſs, but brings no want to our Door. And the very ſame thing may be ſaid as to unſeaſonable Weather in many Places; and therefore I ſhall give that Objection no further anſwer.</p>
            <p>But to be ſhort, The great Cry, and generally received Opinion is, That there hath been ſuch a <hi>general Blaſt,</hi> as hath <hi>deſtroyed or ſpoiled the Corn;</hi> That it is full of <hi>Choler, or black Ears;</hi> and that other Ears are <hi>light,</hi> yea often <hi>quite Empty.</hi> And thus we are ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to make that the <hi>Hand of God,</hi> which is the <hi>Fruits of our own Folly.</hi> It were juſt with him to deal thus with ſo wicked a Nation; but he hath not done ſo you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it were the height of Ingratitude to charge him as <hi>plaguing</hi> us with <hi>Famine,</hi> when he <hi>bleſſeth</hi> us with <hi>Plenty.</hi> I do not ſay, there is no Blaſt; ſome little Foundation there hath been for this Complaint, which hath been ſtrangely ſpread and improv'd by thoſe who are the real Cauſe of our Evils; and then being entertain'd by ſilly frightful People, who if they hear of a Blaſt, verily believe all the Corn to be ſpoiled, it got greater Credit. And no doubt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it hath been encouraged by the Farmer, with a Deſign to advance his Market. But this I ſay, and I make no doubt plainly to prove it, That the <hi>Blaſt</hi> is not the Cauſe of the <hi>preſent Scarcity,</hi> and <hi>Dearneſs</hi> of <hi>Corn.</hi> To this end, I ſhall conſider the utmoſt that in all likelihood it can affect us. I grant, that the Blaſt hath been very buſy, eſpecially in ſome Places, as near the Sea-Coaſt, and in thoſe Countries, which rarely change their Seed, where there is always ſome Blaſt, more or leſs: Yea, conſidering the backwardneſs of the Year, I am apt to think there may be a great deal of <hi>ſmall Grain,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>chalky Land,</hi> where the Clevel is always leſs than in <hi>Clay, mixt,</hi> or <hi>chiſelly</hi> Earth. Yea further, ſuppoſe that the Corn were no where altogether ſo <hi>bold</hi> as it was the laſt Year; yet, for all this, we might have had <hi>Corn enough, and good, cheap.</hi> For though the <hi>Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Kent</hi> (whoſe Country is very ſubject to <hi>Blaſt,</hi> for which particular Reaſons might be given) make great Complaint; and their Out-cry, by reaſon of their Neighborhood, doth much affect the <hi>Citizens,</hi> yet in many Places the Blaſt is very inconſiderable. And I have ſeen, this very Year, many and large Fields of Corn free from black Ears, though not from ſome light Ears; and I never knew any crop of Corn altogether free. This ought alſo to be obſerved, That Wheat was thicker on the Ground this Year than the laſt; (which all allow to be a great Crop) and if <hi>more Straws,</hi> conſequently there muſt be <hi>more Ears</hi> of Corn: So that if we ſhould ſuppoſe the Blaſt to have deſtroyed every <hi>Third</hi> Ear of Corn (which I believe it hath not done the <hi>Tenth</hi>) there would have been a <hi>ſufficient Crop</hi> to have ſupplied the Lan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, without making Corn dear. And then if we reckon upon the old Stock which remained, or ought to have remained, from the laſt Years Plenty, we might as reaſonably have expected to have ſeen Wheat ſold now at 3 <hi>s.</hi> or 3 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> a Buſhel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or (as ſome call it) a Strike, as in former Years.</p>
            <p>By this time I expect ſome ſhould grow Teſty, and ſay, If this be not the Reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what is? For nothing can be more plain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>an that <hi>Corn is Dear,</hi> and continues <hi>Riſing,</hi> to the endangering of many Thouſands of Poor, periſhing for want. Now I could give as plain a Reaſon for it, if an <hi>honeſt Engliſh-man</hi> might ſpeak with ſafety; for we are now under <hi>Dutch Comptrollers,</hi> and as nothing muſt be done, ſo nothing muſt be ſaid, that may be offenſive to the <hi>Hogen Mogens:</hi> However I will out with it; and if my <hi>Country-men</hi> will not <hi>See,</hi> they may be <hi>Blind,</hi> til they are <hi>Starved:</hi> For I can do no more for them, than to tell them the plain Truth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:109914:3"/>
that makes this Scarcity, and will make it greater. Thoſe dear Friends of ours, for whom we have ſpent our <hi>Bloud,</hi> and our <hi>Eſtates,</hi> (I am unwilling to ſay <hi>damn'd our Souls</hi> too) that we might <hi>raiſe</hi> and <hi>keep</hi> them at this <hi>Height,</hi> now carry away our Corn at that rate, That if <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s <hi>Granaries</hi> were among us, they would make a <hi>Dearth,</hi> if they are ſuffered to go on. <hi>Ten, Twenty, or Thirty Ships</hi> going out together from one Port of ours, laden with Corn, are not worth our taking Notice of; but as they have drove this Trade very briskly of late, and continue ſo to do, ſo it is not one Port alone which they Ply: But that if poſſible you may be ſenſible, that theſe <hi>Horſe-leeches</hi> would ſuck you very <hi>laſt drop of Bloud;</hi> I will lay a kind of Scheme before you, together with the Arts by which our Corn is drawn from us.</p>
            <p>Our Northern Seas, from whence we only croſs to <hi>Holland,</hi> and they to us, are now the ſafeſt of all others, by reaſon that no Enemy can come thither. but either about <hi>Scotland,</hi> or by the <hi>Downs;</hi> and ſo will be in continual Danger of falling into the Mouths of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Dutch Men</hi> of <hi>War;</hi> which makes the <hi>Privateers</hi> and <hi>Pirates</hi> have little Kindneſs for that <hi>Road:</hi> So that our <hi>Corn-carriers</hi> have a ſafe and quick Paſſage to and from all our Ports on that Coaſt, even from the <hi>South-foreland</hi> to <hi>Tinmouth-haven,</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if there be any thing to be had for them. And this Range takes in upon our Sea-Coaſt theſe Counties, <hi>Kent, Eſſex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Lincoln, York</hi> and <hi>Durham:</hi> And in in theſe Counties theſe Ports, <hi>Dover, Sandwich, Margate, Colcheſter, Harwich, Yarmouth, Boſton, Hull, Newcaſtle,</hi> and above a Hundred other Places; where they may either put in; or with their Boats fetch off Corn to their Ships: And to all theſe Ports they have already well plyed, and tolerably well drained them. But leſt you ſhould imagine that this only affects theſe maritine Counties, I will demonſtrate to you how, by this means, they draw the Corn from all Parts, even out of the very Heart of the Country. For where there are <hi>navigable Rivers</hi> Corn will moſt certainly <hi>run</hi> after the <hi>Price,</hi> and <hi>travel</hi> to <hi>Sea;</hi> if more be bid for it there, than on Land. And the Farmer (let who will ſtarve) by Hook or by Crook, by Night or by Day, will convey it away, if the Market pleaſe him: And ſo our Corn ſhall go as far as the River reaches, or they will carry it to it. For Inſtance; Suppoſe the Corn Veſſels come into <hi>Boſton-deep,</hi> with a Deſign to take in Lading at <hi>Boſton,</hi> or <hi>Lynn,</hi> and other Places thereabout, here fall into the Sea (amongſt others) Three Rivers navigable a very conſiderable way up into the Country: The <hi>Welland,</hi> navigable up as far as <hi>Stamford,</hi> a Town bordering upon Three Counties, <hi>Lincoln, Northampton,</hi> and <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> 2.

Next. if you pleaſe, we will convey our <hi>Corn Veſſels</hi> to <hi>Hull,</hi> where they have been ſo often already, that by this time hey may know the way themſelves: This ſtands upon the <hi>Humber,</hi> which is a confluence of Rivers, into which (not to name any other) runs the <hi>Trent;</hi> which paſſing through part of <hi>Yorkshire</hi> continues his current through <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> and by <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> travelling through ſome of our beſt Corn Countries into the very heart of the Kingdom, and is navigable within Six Miles of <hi>Darby.</hi> But not to trouble you with many others, I think the <hi>Thames</hi> ought not to be forgotten; which one way brings up the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whatever the crying Sins or villanous Contrivances of Men may effect, doubtleſs the Creator, who is a God of Goodneſs. never originally deſigned one Nation to undo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

            <p>I have thus, in ſhort, laid before you the <hi>plain</hi> Reaſon; and true Cauſe of this <hi>growing Scarcity;</hi> the Remedy is not my Province, nor in my Power, though I could wiſh it were, for my Countries ſake: But to quicken you to ſeek for a Remedy in time, before it be too late; as I have ſhewed you the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> ſo I will briefly touch upon what in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood may be the <hi>Effects</hi> and Tendencies of this deſtructive (and yet connived at) Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Firſt, Our <hi>Country</hi> will be filled with the <hi>lamentable doleful Crys</hi> of <hi>famiſhing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</hi> Thoſe, whoſe <hi>Modeſty</hi> will not ſuffer them to <hi>beg,</hi> nor their <hi>Conſciences</hi> to <hi>ſteal,</hi> muſt the ſooneſt <hi>languiſh</hi> into their <hi>Graves;</hi> and ſo the beſt muſt periſh firſt. Others, who will not endure to want, if it can be any ways ſupplied, will fall to <hi>pilfering</hi> and <hi>ſtealing;</hi> and ſo will be driven to this ſad Choice, either to be <hi>hanged</hi> or <hi>ſtarved:</hi> And this very Thing will fill the <hi>Country</hi> with <hi>Violence,</hi> and Peoples Hearts with <hi>Horror</hi> and <hi>Fear;</hi> when a Man cannot go to Bed, but with an Apprehenſion that his Houſe or Barns will be broke open before Morning and perhaps their Throats cut in their Beds to Boot. Others, endeavouring to prolong a weariſome Life, will fall to <hi>Begging:</hi> And thoſe who are once habituated to that Trade ſcarce ever leave it; ſo that if they chance to ſurvive the Famine, they will ſtock our Country with an idle unprofitable ſort of Cattle, good for nothing, but conſume the Fruits of the Earth: And when Things are brought to this paſs, the Richeſt will be but in an ill Condition. But in the next Place, pardon me if I do believe that one Deſign of theſe <hi>Dutch Practices</hi> is, That they may <hi>ſport themſelves with our Miſeries:</hi> For thoſe, who have obſerved their <hi>Ingratitude and inſolent Humour,</hi> and have read or heard of their <hi>unparallel'd Barbarities and Cruelties</hi> all over the World, muſt acknowledge them to be a People who are not pleaſed with any thing ſo much, as the Miſeries of others; and then moſt of all, when it is by their own Procurement. They are Proud of, and Glory in ſuch Practices. Another Deſign of theirs, I think to be, to ſerve their <hi>Turns</hi> of our <hi>Men,</hi> and to <hi>thin our Country,</hi> in hopes in time to be <hi>abſolute Maſters</hi> of it: For when Men want both <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> to <hi>buy</hi> it, and have little hopes of Relief by <hi>begging,</hi> and are unwilling to be hang'd for <hi>ſtealing,</hi> they will be very free to become <hi>Soldiers;</hi> eſpecially if it be but for this Privilege, That if you will not give the Soldier Bread, he takes it: This ſerves the Turn for a while; but then on a ſudden they are commanded into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where they are put upon all <hi>deſperate At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,</hi> till their <hi>few Brains</hi> are knockt out, and there's an end of them; it is but ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hither for more <hi>Recruits,</hi> till the <hi>Kingdom</hi> is ſo <hi>diſpeopled,</hi> that they may quietly enter upon, and <hi>take poſſeſſion</hi> of it, without any <hi>Diſturbance.</hi> But not to trouble you any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I cannot but think their main Deſign to be, to ſee what they can bring us to; and whether we be already <hi>fitted,</hi> or <hi>can be fitted,</hi> to make <hi>Dutch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
