            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Authors Defence.</head>
            <p>'TIs as I Remember, the Learned <hi>Scribonius,</hi> who Reports, that One of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, devoutly making his Prayers on the behalf of a Person molested by <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> received from those <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> an horrible Blow over the Face: And I may my self Expect not few or small <hi>Buffetings</hi> from <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> for the Endeavours wherewith I am now going to Encounter them. I am far from Insensible, That at this Extraordinary Time of the <hi>Devils Coming down in Great Wrath upon us,</hi> there are too many Tongues and Hearts thereby <hi>Set on Fire of Hell;</hi> that the various Opinions about the <hi>Witchcrafts</hi> which of Later Time have Troubled us, are maintained by some with so much Clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Fury, as if they could never be sufficiently Stated, unless written in the Liquor wherewith <hi>Witches</hi> use to write their Covenants; and that he who becomes an Author at such a Time, had need be, <hi>Fenced with Iron, and the Stuff of a Spear.</hi> The unaccountable Frowardness, Asperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Untreatableness, and Inconsistency of many persons, every Day gives a Visible Exposition of that passage, <hi>An Evil Spirit from the Lord came upon</hi> Saul; and Illustration of that Story, <hi>There met him two Possessed with Devils, exceeding Fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.</hi> To send
<pb facs="tcp:43586:3"/>
abroad a Book, among such Readers, were a very unadvised Thing if a man had not such <hi>Reasons</hi> to give as I can bring, for such an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. Briefly, I hope it cannot be said, <hi>They are all so:</hi> No, I hope the <hi>Body</hi> of this People, are yet in such a Temper, as to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Applying their Thoughts, to make a <hi>Right Use,</hi> of the Stupendous and prodigious Things that are happening among us: and because I was concern'd, when I saw that no Abler Hand Emitted any <hi>Essayes</hi> to Engage the Minds of this People in such Holy, Pious, Fruitful Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as God would have to be made of His Amazing Dispensations now upon us, THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE it is that One of the Least among the Children of <hi>New-England,</hi> has here done, what is done. None, but, <hi>The Father who sees in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi> knows the Heart-breaking Exercises, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I have Composed what is now going to be Exposed; Lest I should in any <hi>One Thing,</hi> miss of Doing my Designed Service for His Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for His People; But <hi>I</hi> am now some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what comfortably Assured of <hi>His</hi> favourable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance; and, <hi>I will not Fear; what can, a Satan do unto me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having <hi>Performed,</hi> Something of what God <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi> in labouring to suit His <hi>Words</hi> unto His <hi>Works,</hi> at this Day among us, and therewithal hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Theme</hi> that has been sometimes counted not unworthy the Pen, even of a <hi>King,</hi> it will easily be perceived, that some subordinate <hi>Ends</hi> have been considered in these Endeavours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43586:3"/>
I have indeed set my self to Countermine the whole PLOT of the Devil, against <hi>New-England,</hi> in every Branch of it, as far as one of my <hi>Darkness,</hi> can comprehend such a <hi>Work of Darkness.</hi> I may add, that I have herein also aimed at the Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Satisfaction of Good men in another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, a Thousand Leagues off, where I have, it may be <hi>More,</hi> or however, more <hi>Considerable,</hi> Friends, than in <hi>My Own;</hi> And I do what I can to have that Countrey, now, as well as alwayes, in the best Terms with, <hi>My Own.</hi> But while I am doing these things, I have been driven a little to do something likewise for <hi>My self;</hi> I mean, by taking off the false Reports and hard Censures about my Opinion in these matters, the <hi>Parters Portion,</hi> which my <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of Peace,</hi> has procured me among the <hi>Keen.</hi> My hitherto <hi>Unvaried Thoughts</hi> are here Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, I believe, they will be owned by <hi>most,</hi> of the Ministers of God in these Colonies: nor can amends be well made me, for the wrong done me, by other sorts of <hi>Representations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, For the <hi>Dogmatical</hi> part of my Discourse, I want no Defence; for the <hi>Historical</hi> part of it, I have a very Great One. The Lievtenant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>New-England,</hi> having perused it, has done me the Honour of giving me a <hi>Shield,</hi> under the Umbrage whereof I now dare to walk Abroad.</p>

               <hi>Baxter</hi> graced the Second Edition of that Book, with a kind Preface, wherein he sees cause to say, <hi>If any are Scandalized, that</hi> New-England, <hi>a place of as serious Piety, as any I can hear of, under Heaven, should be Troubled so much with Witches, I think, tis no Wonder: Where will the Devil show most Malice, but where he is Hated, and Hateth most;</hi> And I hope, the Country will still deserve and answer, the Charity so Expressed by that Reverend man of God! Whosoever travels over this Wilderness, will see it richly bespangled with Evangelical <hi>Churches,</hi> whose Pastors are Holy, Able, &amp; Painful <hi>Overseers</hi> of their Flocks, Lively Preachers, and Vertuous Livers; and such as in their Several Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly <hi>Associations,</hi> have had their Meetings whereat Ecclesiastical matters of common Concernment are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered: <hi>Churches,</hi> whose Communicants have been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously Examined about their Experiences of <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as well as about their Knowledge, and Beleef and Blameless Conversation, before their Admission to the Sacred Communion; although others of less but Hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Attainments in Christianity are not ordinarily deny'd Baptism for themselves and theirs; <hi>Churches,</hi> which are Shy of using any thing in the Worship of God, for which they cannot see a Warrant of God; but with whom yet the Names of <hi>Congregational, Presbyterian, Episcopalian,</hi> or, <hi>Antipaedobaptist,</hi> are swallowed up in that of, <hi>Christian;</hi> Persons of all those Perswasions being actually taken into our Fellowship, when <hi>Visible Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> has Recommended them: <hi>Churches,</hi> which usually do within themselves manage their own Discipline, under the Conduct of their Elders; but yet call in the help of <hi>Synods</hi> upon Emergencies, or Aggrievances <hi>Churches,</hi> Lastly, wherein Multitudes are growing Ripe for Heaven every Day; and as fast as these are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:43586:6"/>
off, others are daily Rising up. And by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and power of the <hi>Divine Institutions</hi> thus mentain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Country, we are still so Happy, that, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, there is no Land in the Universe more free from the Debauching, and the Debasing Vices of Ungodliness. The Body of the People are hitherto so disposed, that <hi>Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, Whoring, Drunkenness,</hi> and the like, do not make a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> but a <hi>Monster,</hi> or a <hi>Goblin,</hi> in the Vulgar Estimation. All this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, we must humbly Confess to our <hi>God,</hi> that we are miserably Degenerated from the <hi>First Love,</hi> of our Predecessors; however we <hi>boast our selves a litile,</hi> when <hi>Men</hi> would go to trample upon us, and we venture to say, <hi>Whereinsoever any is bold (we speak foolishly) we are bold also.</hi> The first Planters of these Colonies were a <hi>Chosen Generation</hi> of men, who were first so <hi>Pure,</hi> as to disrelish many things which they thought wanted <hi>Reformation</hi> else where; and yet withal so <hi>Peaceable,</hi> that they Embraced a Voluntary Exile in a Squalid, horrid, <hi>American</hi> Desart, rather than to Live in Contentions with their Brethren. Those Good men imagined that they should Leave their Posterity, in a place, where they should never see the Inroads of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanity,</hi> or <hi>Superstition;</hi> and a famous Person returning hence could in a Sermon before the Parliament, profess, <hi>I have now been seven years in a Country, where I never saw one man drunk, or heard one Oath sworn, or beheld one Beggar in the Streets, all the while.</hi> Such great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as <hi>Budaeus,</hi> and others, who mistook Sir. <hi>Thomas Mores</hi> UTOPIA, for a Country really Existent, and stirr'd up some Divines Charitably to undertake a Voyage thither, might now have certainly found a Truth in their Mistake; <hi>New-England</hi> was a true <hi>Uto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia.</hi> But alas, the Children, and Servants of those Old
<pb facs="tcp:43586:6"/>
Planters, must needs afford many, <hi>Degenerate Plants,</hi> and there is now Risen up a Number of people, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Inclined than our <hi>Ioshua's</hi> and the <hi>Elders that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived them.</hi> Those two things, our Holy <hi>Progenitors,</hi> and our Happy <hi>Advantages,</hi> make <hi>Omissions</hi> of Duty, and such <hi>Spiritual Disorders</hi> as the whole World abroad is overwhelmed with, to be as Provoking in <hi>us,</hi> as the most flagitious wickednesses <hi>Committed</hi> in other places; and the Ministers of God are accordingly severe in their Testimonies. But in Short, Those Interests of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which were the Errand of our Fathers into these Ends of the Earth, have been too much Neglected and Postponed, and the Attainments of an hand-some <hi>Education,</hi> have been too much undervalued, by <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,</hi> that have not fallen into Exorbitancies of Wickedness; and <hi>some,</hi> especially of our Young ones, when they have got abroad from under the <hi>Restraints</hi> here laid upon them, have become extravagantly and abom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Hence tis, that the Happiness of <hi>New-England,</hi> has been, <hi>but for a Time,</hi> as it was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, and not for a <hi>Long Time,</hi> as ha's been desir'd for us. A Variety of Calamity ha's long follow'd this Plantation; and we have all the Reason imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ascribe it unto the Rebuke of Heaven upon us for our manifold <hi>Apostasies;</hi> we make no Right use of our Disasters, if we do not, <hi>Remember whence we are fallen, and Repent, and Do the first works.</hi> But yet our Afflictions may come under a further Consideration with us: there is a further cause of our Afflictions, whose <hi>Due</hi> must be <hi>Given</hi> him.</p>

               <hi>S</hi> II. The <hi>New-Englanders,</hi> are a People of God settled in those, which were once the <hi>Devils</hi> Territories; and it may easily be supposed that the <hi>Devil</hi> was Exceedingly
<pb facs="tcp:43586:7"/>
disturbed, when he perceived such a people here accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing the Promise of old made unto our Blessed Jesus, <hi>That He should have the Utmost parts of she Earth for His Possession.</hi> There was not a greater Uproar among the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> when the Gospel was first brought among them, then there was among, <hi>The Powers of the Air</hi> (after whom those <hi>Ephesians</hi> walked) when first the <hi>Silver Trumpets</hi> of the Gospel here made the <hi>Ioyful Sound.</hi> The Devil thus Irritated, immediately try'd all sorts of Methods to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn this poor Plantation: and so much of the Church, as was <hi>Fled into this Wilderness,</hi> immediately found, <hi>The Serpent cast out of his Mouth, a Flood for the carrying of it away.</hi> I believe, that never were more <hi>Satanical Devices</hi> used for the Unsetling of any People under the Sun, than what have been Employ'd for the Extirpation of the <hi>Vine</hi> which God has here <hi>Planted, Casting out the Heathen, and Preparing a Room before it, and causing it to take deep Root, and fill the Land; so that it sent its Boughs unto the</hi> Attlantic <hi>Sea</hi> Eastward, <hi>and its Branches unto the</hi> Connecticut <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> Westward, <hi>and the Hills were covered with the Shadow thereof.</hi> But, All those Attempts of Hell, have hitherto been Abortive, many an <hi>Ebenezer</hi> has been Erected unto the Praise of God, by His Poor People here; and, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained Help from God, we continue to this Day.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Devil is now making one Attempt more upon us; an Attempt more Difficult, more Surprizing, more snarl'd with unintelligible Circumstances than any that we have hitherto Encountred; an Attempt, so <hi>Critical,</hi> that if we get well through, we shall soon Enjoy <hi>Halcyon</hi> Days with all the <hi>Vultures</hi> of Hell, <hi>Trodden under our Feet.</hi> He has wanted his <hi>Inearnate Legions,</hi> to Persecute us, as the People of God, have in the other Hemisphere been Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted: he has therefore drawn forth his more <hi>Spiritual</hi> ones to make an Attacque upon us. We have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised,
<pb facs="tcp:43586:7"/>
by some Credible Christians yet alive, that a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, accused of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> as well as <hi>Murder,</hi> and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in this place more than Forty Years ago, did then give Notice, of, <hi>An Horrible PLOT against the Country, by WITCHCRAFT, and a Foundation of WITCHRAFT then Laid, which if it were not seasonably Discovered, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably Blow up, and pull down all the Churches in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> And we have now with Horror seen the <hi>Discovery</hi> of such a <hi>Witchcraft!</hi> An Army of <hi>Devils</hi> is horribly broke in, upon the place which is the <hi>Center</hi> and after a sort, the <hi>First-born</hi> of our English Settlements: and the Houses of the Good People there, are fill'd with the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Shrieks of their Children and Servants, Tormented by Invisible Hands, with Tortures altogether preternatural. After the Mischiefs there Endeavoured, and since in part Conquered, the terrible Plague, of, <hi>Evil Angels,</hi> hath made its progress into some other places, where other persons have been in like manner Diabolically handled. These our poor Afflicted Neighbours, quickly after they become <hi>Infected</hi> and <hi>Infested</hi> with these <hi>Daemons,</hi> arrive to a Capacity of Discerning those which they conceive the <hi>Shapes</hi> of their Troublers; and notwithstanding the Great and Just Suspicion, that the <hi>Daemons</hi> might Impose the <hi>Shapes</hi> of Innocent Persons in their <hi>Spectral Exhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> upon the Sufferers, (which may perhaps prove no small part of the <hi>Witch-Plot</hi> in the issue) yet many of the persons thus Represented, being Examined, several of them have been Convicted of a very Damnable <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft:</hi> yea, more than. One <hi>Twenty</hi> have <hi>Confessed,</hi> that they have Signed unto a <hi>Book,</hi> which the Devil show'd them, and Engaged in his Hellish Design of <hi>Bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Ruining</hi> our Land. <hi>We</hi> know not, at least <hi>I</hi> know not, how far the <hi>Delusions</hi> of Satan may be Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven into some Circumstances of the <hi>Confessions;</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:43586:8"/>
one would think, all the Rules of Understanding Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affayrs are at an end, if after so many most Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Harmonious <hi>Confessions,</hi> made by Intelligent persons of all Ages, in sundry Towns, at several Times, we must not Believe the <hi>main strokes</hi> wherein those <hi>Confessuns</hi> all agree: especially when we have a thousand preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Things every day before our eyes, wherein the <hi>Confessors</hi> do acknowledge their Concernment, and give Demonstration of their being so Concerned. If the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils now can strike the minds of men, with any <hi>Poisons</hi> of so fine a Composition and Operation, that scores of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent People shall Unite, in <hi>Confessions</hi> of a Crime, which we see actually committed, it is a thing prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, beyond the Wonders of the former Ages, and it threatens no less than a sort of a Dissolution upon the World. Now, by these <hi>Confessions</hi> 'tis Agreed, <hi>That</hi> the Devil has made a dreadful Knot of <hi>Witches</hi> in the Country, and by the help of <hi>Witches</hi> has dreadfully En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased that Knot: <hi>That</hi> these <hi>Witches</hi> have driven a Trade of Commissioning their <hi>Confederate Spirits,</hi> to do all sorts of Mischiefs to the Neighbours, whereupon there have Ensued such Mischievous consequences upon the Bodies, and Estates of the Neighbourhood, as could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be accounted for: yea, <hi>That</hi> at prodigious <hi>Witch-Meetings,</hi> the Wretches have proceeded so far, as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert and Consult the Methods of Rooting out the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion from this Country, and setting up instead of it, perhaps a more gross <hi>Diabolism,</hi> than ever the World saw before. And yet it will be a thing little short of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,</hi> if in so <hi>spread</hi> a Business, as this, the Devil should not get in some of his Juggles, to confound the Discovery of all the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> 3. Doubtless, the Thoughts of many will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb facs="tcp:43586:8"/>
a Great Scandal against <hi>New-England,</hi> from the Number of Persons that have been Accused, or Suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> in this Country: But it were easy to offer many things, that may Answer and Abate the Scandal. If the Holy God should any where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Devils to hook two or three wicked <hi>Scholars,</hi> into <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> and then by their Assistance to Range with their <hi>Poisonous Insinuations,</hi> among Ignorant, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, Discontented People, till they have cunningly decoy'd them into some sudden <hi>Act,</hi> whereby the Toyls of Hell shall be perhaps inextricably cast over them: what Country in the World, would not afford <hi>Witches,</hi> numerous to a Prodigy? Accordingly, The Kingdoms of <hi>Sweeden, Denmark, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But besides all this, give me Leave to add; it is to be hoped, That among the persons represented by the <hi>Spectres</hi> which now afflict our Neighbours, there will be found <hi>some</hi> that never explicitly contracted with any of the <hi>Evil Angels.</hi> The Witches have not only intimated, but some of them acknowledged, That they have plotted the Representations of <hi>Innocent Persons,</hi> to cover and shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themselyes in their Witchcrafts; now, altho' our good God has hitherto generally preserved us, from the Abuse therein Design'd by the Devils for us, yet who of us can Exactly State, <hi>How far our God may for our Chastisement permit the Devil to preceed in such an Abuse?</hi> It was the Result of a Discourse, lately held at a Meeting of some very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ious, and Learned, Ministers among us, <hi>That the Devils may sometimes have a permission to Represent an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Person, as Tormenting such as are under Diabolical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestations: But that such Things are Rare and Extraordinary, especially, when such Matters come before Civil Iudicature.</hi> The Opinion Expressed with so much Caution and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, seems to be the prevailing Sense of many others; who are men Eminently Cautious and Judicious; and have both <hi>Argument</hi> and <hi>History</hi> to Countenance them in it. It is <hi>Rare and Extraordinary,</hi> for an Honest <hi>Naboth</hi> to have his Life it self Sworn away, by two <hi>Children of Belial,</hi> and yet no Infringement hereby made on the Rectoral Righteousness of our Eternal Soveraign, whose <hi>Iudgments are a Great Deep,</hi> and who <hi>gives none Account of His matters.</hi> Thus, although, the Appearance of Innocent Persons, in <hi>Spectral Exhibitions</hi> afflicting the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, be a thing <hi>Rare and Extraordinary;</hi> yet who can be sure, that the great <hi>Belial</hi> of Hell must needs be

The <hi>Witchcraft</hi> is a Business, that will not be <hi>Sham'd,</hi> without plunging us into <hi>sore plagues and of Long Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> But then, we are to <hi>Unite</hi> in such <hi>Methods,</hi> for this Deliverance, as may be unquestionably <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>fe;</hi> Lest, <hi>The Latter End be worse then the Beginning.</hi> And here, what I shall say? I will venture to say, thus much; That we are <hi>Safe,</hi> when we make just as much <hi>Use</hi> of all Advice from the Invisible World, as God sends it for. It is a <hi>Safe</hi> Principle, That when God Almighty permits any Spirits from the Unseen Regions, to visit us with Surprising In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, there is then something to be <hi>Enquired</hi> after; we are then to <hi>Enquire</hi> of one another, <hi>What Cause there is for such Things?</hi> The peculiar Government of God, over the Unbodied Intelligences, is a sufficient Foundation for this Principle. When there has been a <hi>Murder</hi> Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, an Apparition of the slain Party Accusing of any man, altho' such Apparitions have oftener spoke <hi>True</hi> than <hi>False,</hi> is not enough to Convict the man, as Guilty of that <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> but yet it is a sufficient Occasion for Magistrates to make a particular <hi>Enquiry,</hi> whether such a man have affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any ground for such an Accusation. Even so, a <hi>Spect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> exactly Resembling such or such a person, when the Neighbourhood are Tormented by such <hi>Spectres,</hi> may reasonably make Magistrates Inquisitive, whether the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so Represented have done or said any thing that may Argue their Confederacy with Evil Spirits; altho' it may be defective enough in point of <hi>Conviction;</hi> especially at a Time, when 'tis possible, some Over-powerful Conjurer may have got the skill of thus Exhibiting the <hi>Shapes</hi> of all sorts of persons, on purpose to stop the prosecution of the Wretch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:43586:10"/>
Reports there may come against any man, from the <hi>World of Spirits,</hi> He will not by His Providence at the same time have brought into our Hands, these more <hi>Evident</hi> &amp; <hi>Sensible</hi> Things, whereupon, a man is to be esteemed a Criminal. But I will venture to say this further; That it will be <hi>Safe,</hi> to account the <hi>Names</hi> as well as the <hi>Lives</hi> of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, too considerable Things to be brought under a <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Process,</hi> until it be found by <hi>Humane Observations,</hi> that the peace of Mankind, is thereby disturbed. We are <hi>Humane Creatures;</hi> and we are <hi>Safe</hi> while we say, they must be <hi>Humane Witnesses,</hi> who also have in the particular Act of Seeing, or Hearing, which enables them to be <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> had no more than <hi>Humane Assistences,</hi> that are to Turn the Scale, when <hi>Laws</hi> are to be Executed. And, upon this Head, I will further add; A Wise and a Just Magistrate, may so far give way to a common Stream of Dissatisfaction, as to forbear Acting up to the Heighth of his own perswasion, about, what may be judg'd <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victive,</hi> of a Crime, whose Nature shall be so abstruse and obscure, as to raise much Disputation.

I leave that unto those Excellent and Judicious Persons, with whom I am not worthy to be Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred: all that I shall do, shall be to lay before my Readers, a brief <hi>Synopsis</hi> of what has been Written on that Subject, by a <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> of as Eminent Persons, as have ever handled it. I will begin with,</p>
            <div type="abstract">
               <pb facs="tcp:43586:10"/>
               <head>An Abstract of Mr. <hi>Perkin</hi>'s way for the Discovery of Witches.</head>
               <p>I. <hi>There are</hi> Presumptions, <hi>which do at least Probably and Conjecturally note one to be a</hi> Witch. <hi>These, give Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Examine, yet they are no Sufficient Causes of Conviction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. <hi>If any man or woman, be notoriously defamed for a Witch; this yeelds a strong Suspition. Yet the Iudge ought Carefully to Look, that the Report be made by men of Honesty and Credit.</hi> III. <hi>If a Fellow Witch, or Magician, give Testimony of any Person to be a Witch; this indeed is not sufficient for Condemnation; but it is a fit Presumption, to cause a strait Examination.</hi> IV. <hi>If after Cursing there follow Death, or at least, some mischief: for Witches are wont to practise their mischievous Facts, by Cursing and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: This also is a sufficient matter of Examination, tho' not of Conviction.</hi> V. <hi>If after Enmity, Quarrelling, or Thrèatening, a present mischief do's follow; that also is a great Presumption.</hi> VI. <hi>If the Party suspected be the Son or Daughter, the man-servant or maid-servant, the Familiar Friend; near Neighbour, or old Companion, of a known and Convicted Witch: This may be likewise a presumption: for Witchcraft is an Art, that may be Learn'd, and Convey'd from man to man.</hi> VII. <hi>Some add this for a Presumption; If the party Suspected be found to have the Devils mark; for it is Commonly thought, when the Devil makes his Covenant with them, he alwayes Leaves his mark behind them, whereby he knows them for his own:—a mark, whereof no Evident Reason, in Nature can be given.</hi> VIII. <hi>Lastly, If the party Examined be Unconstant, or Contrary to himself, in his Deliberate Answers, it argueth a Guilty Conscience, which stops the Freedom of Utteranee. And yet, there are causes of Astonishment, which may befal the Good, as well as the Bad,</hi> IX. <hi>But then there is a</hi> Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>discovering the</hi> Witch; <hi>which must proceed from just and sufficient proofs, and not from bare Presumptions.</hi> X <hi>Scratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:43586:11"/>
of the Suspected Party, and Recovery thereupon; with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other such weak proofs; as also, the Fleeting of the Suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Party, thrown upon the Water; These proofs are so far from being sufficient, that some of them, are after a sort, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of Witcheraft.</hi> XI. <hi>The Testimony of some Wizzard, tho' offering to show the Witches face in a Glass; This I grant, may be a good presumption, to cause a strait Examination; but a sufficient proof of Conviction, it cannot be. If the Devil tell the Grand-Iury, that the Person in Question, is a Witch, and offers withal, to confirm the same by Oath, should the Inquest Receive his Oath or Accusation to Condemn the man? Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly No. And yet, that is as much as the Testimony of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wizzard, who only by the Devils Help, Reveals the Witch,</hi> XII. <hi>If a man being dangerously Sick, and like to Dy, upon Suspicion, will take it on his Death, that such an one hath Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched him, it is an Allegation of the same Nature, which may move the Iudge to Examine the Party,; but it is of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>o onement for Conviction.</hi> XIII. <hi>Among the sufficient means of Conviction, the first is, the Free and Voluntary Confession of the Crime, made by the Party Suspected, and Accused, after Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. I say not, that a bare Confession is sufficient, but a Confession after due Examination, taken upon pregnant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions. What needs now more Witness, or further Enquiry?</hi> XIV. <hi>There is a second sufficient Conviction, by the Testimony of Two Witnesses, of Good and Honest Report avouching before the Magistrate upon their own Knowledge, these two Things: either that the Party Accused, hath made a League with the Devil, or hath done some known practices of Witchcraft. And,</hi> all Arguments that do Necessarily prove either of these, <hi>being brought by two sufficient Witnesses, are of Force, fully to Convince the Party Suspected.</hi> XV. <hi>If it can be proved that the Party Suspected, hath called upon the Devil, or desired his Help; this is a pregnant proof of a League formerly made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</hi> XVI. <hi>If it can be proved, that the Party hath Entertained a Familiar Spirit, and had Conference with
<pb facs="tcp:43586:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, in the Likeness of some visible Creatures: here is Evidence of Witchcraft.</hi> XVII. <hi>If the Witnesses affirm upon Outh, that the Suspected person, hath done any Action, or work, which necessarily infers a Covenant made: as that he hath used En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments; Divined of things before they come to pass, and that peremptorily; Raised Tempests; caused the Form of a Dead Man to appear; it proveth sufficiently that he or she is a Witch.</hi> This is the Substance of Mr. <hi>Perkins.</hi> Take, Next, The Summ of Mr <hi>Gaules</hi> Judgment, about the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of <hi>Witches.</hi> 
                  <q>I Some <hi>Tokens</hi> for the Trial of <hi>Witches,</hi> are altogether <hi>Unwarrantable.</hi> Such are the old Paganish Sign, The Witches <hi>Long Eyes;</hi> The Tradition, of the Witches not weeping; The casting of the Witch into the Water, with Thumbs, and Toes, ty'd across. And many more such Marks, which if they are to know a witch by, certainly 'tis no other witch, but the User of them. II. There are some <hi>Tokens</hi> for the Trial of <hi>Witches,</hi> more <hi>probable:</hi> and yet not so certain us to afford Conviction. Such are, strong and long Suspicion: Suspected Ancest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors: some Appearance of Fact: The Corpse bleeding upon the Witches Touch: The <hi>Testimony of the Party Bewitched:</hi> The Supposed, Witches unusual <hi>Bodily Marks;</hi> The Witches usual Cursing and Banning: The Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es lewd and naughty kind of Life. III. Some Signs there are of a <hi>Witch,</hi> more certain and infallible. As, <hi>Firstly,</hi> Declining of Judicature, or Fultring, Faulty, Unconstant, and Contrary Answers, upon Judicial and Deliberate Examination. <hi>Secondly,</hi> when upon due Enquiry, into a persons Faith and Manners, there are found <hi>all</hi> or <hi>most</hi> of the causes, which produce <hi>Witchcraft;</hi> namely, <hi>God</hi> Forsaking, <hi>Satun</hi> invading, particular <hi>Sins</hi> disposing, and Lastly a <hi>Compact</hi> compleating all. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Witches free Confession, together with Full Evidence of the Fact. <hi>Confession</hi> without <hi>First,</hi> may be a meer Delusion; and
<pb facs="tcp:43586:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Fact</hi> without <hi>Confession</hi> may be a meer Accident. <hi>4thly,</hi> The Semblable Gestures &amp; Actions of suspected Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, with the comparable Expressions of Affections, which in all Witches have been observ'd and found very much alike. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Testimony of the <hi>Party Bewitched,</hi> whether Pining or Dying, together with the joint Oaths of sufficient persons, that have seen certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious <hi>Pranks</hi> or <hi>Feats,</hi> wrought by the Party Accused. IV. Among the most unhappy Circumstances, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict a Witch. One is, A Maligning and Oppugning, the Word, Work, and worship of God: and by any Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Sign seeking to seduce any from it. See Deut. 13. 1, 2. Math. 24. 24. Act. 13: 8, 10. 2 Tim. 3 8. Do but mark well the places; &amp; for this very Property (of thus Opposing and perverting) they are all there concluded arrant and absolute Witches. <hi>V.</hi> It is not requisite, that so <hi>palpable Evidence</hi> of <hi>Conviction,</hi> should here come in, as in other more sensible matters. Tis enough, if there be but so much <hi>Circumstantial</hi> proof or Evidence; as the <hi>Substance,</hi> matter, and Nature of such an Abstruse Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Iniquity will well admit.</q> 
                  <hi>[I suppose he means, that whereas in other Crimes, we Look for more Direct Proofs, in this there is a greater use of Consequential ones]</hi> 
                  <q>But I could heartily wish that the Juries were Empannelled of the most Eminent Physicians, Lawyers, and Divines, that a Country could afford. In the mean time, tis not to be called a <hi>Toleration,</hi> if Witches escape, where <hi>Conviction</hi> is wanting. To this purpose our <hi>Gaule.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I will Transcribe a Little from one Author more. Tis the Judicious <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Batcombe;</hi> who in his <hi>Guide to Grand-Iury men,</hi> after he ha's mentioned several Things that are shrow'd <hi>Presumptions</hi> of a <hi>Witch,</hi> proceeds to such Things as are the <hi>Convictions</hi> of such an one. And he says, <q>
                     <hi>A Witch, in League with the Devil, is Convicted by
<pb facs="tcp:43586:12"/>
these Evidences; I.</hi> By a Witches <hi>Mark;</hi> which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Baser sort of Witches; and this, by the Devils ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sucking or Touching of them. <hi>Tertullian</hi> says, <hi>It is the Devils custome to mark his.</hi> And note, That this mark is <hi>Insensible,</hi> and being prick'd, it will not Bleed. Sometimes, its like a <hi>Teate;</hi> sometimes but a <hi>Blewish Spot:</hi> sometimes a <hi>Red</hi> one; and sometimes the <hi>Flesh Sunk:</hi> but the Witches do sometimes cover them. <hi>II.</hi> By the Witches <hi>Words.</hi> As when they have been heard calling on, speaking to, or Talking of, their <hi>Familiars;</hi> or, when they have been heard <hi>Telling</hi> of <hi>Hurt</hi> they have done to man or beast: Or when they have been heard <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of such Hurt; Or if they have been heard Relating their <hi>Transportations. III.</hi> By the Witches <hi>Deeds.</hi> As when they have been <hi>seen</hi> with their Spirits, or seen secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Feeding any of their <hi>Imps.</hi> Or, when there can be found their Pictures, Poppets, and other Hellish Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. <hi>IV.</hi> By the Witches <hi>Extasies:</hi> With the Delight whereof, Witches are so taken, that they will hardly conceal the same: Or, however at some time or other, they may be found in them. <hi>V.</hi> By one or more <hi>Fellow-Witches,</hi> Confessing their own Witchcraft, &amp; bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Witness against others; if they can make good the Truth of their Witness, and give sufficient proof of it. As, that they have seen them with their Spirits; or, that they have Received Spirits from them; or, that they can tell, when they used Witchery-Tricks to Do Harm; or, that they told them what Harm they had done; or that they can show the mark upon them; or, that they have been together in their Meetings; and such like. <hi>VI.</hi> By some <hi>Witness of God</hi> Himself, happening upon the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Curses of Witches upon themselves, Praving of God to show some Token, if they be Guilty. <hi>VII.</hi> By the Witches own <hi>Confession,</hi> of Giving their Souls to the Devil. It is no Rare thing, for Witches to Confess.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:43586:13"/>
They are Considerable Things, which I have thus Recited; and yet it must be with <hi>Open Eyes,</hi> kept upon <hi>Open Rules,</hi> that we are to follow these things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S.</hi> 8. But <hi>Iuries</hi> are not the only Instruments to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in such a Work; all <hi>Christians</hi> are to be concerned with daily and servent <hi>Prayers,</hi> for the assisting of it. In the Days of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> the Devils were found unable to stand before, that <hi>Prayer,</hi> however then used perhaps with too much of Ceremony, <hi>Let God Arise, Let his Enemies be Scattered, Let them also that Hate Him, flee before Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O that instead of letting our Hearts <hi>Rise</hi> against one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, our Prayers might <hi>Rise</hi> unto an high pitch of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, for such a <hi>Rising</hi> of the Lord! Especially, Let them that are <hi>Suffering</hi> by <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> be sure to <hi>stay</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>Beseech the Lord thrice,</hi> even as much as ever they can, before they complain of any Neighbour for afflicting them. Let them also that are <hi>Accused</hi> of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to <hi>Fast</hi> and <hi>Pray,</hi> and so shake off the <hi>Daemons</hi> that would like <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And Now, <hi>O Thou Hope of,</hi> New-England, <hi>and the Saviour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the Time of Trouble; Do thou look mercifully down upon us, &amp; Rescue us, out of the Trouble which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

always <hi>Yoked</hi> up, from this Piece of Mischief? The best man that ever lived has been called a <hi>Witch:</hi> and why may not this too usual and unhappy Symptom of, A <hi>Witch,</hi> even a Spectral Representation, befall a person that shall be none of the worst? Is it not possible? the <hi>Laplanders</hi> will tell us 'tis possible: for Persons to be unwittingly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with officious <hi>Daemons,</hi> bequeathed unto them, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon them, by Relations that have been <hi>Witches.

Besides what may happen for a while, to try the <hi>Patience</hi> of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. May not some that have been ready upon feeble grounds uncharitably to Censure and Reproach other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, be punished for it by <hi>Spectres</hi> for a while exposing them to Censure and Reproach? And furthermore, I pray, that it may be considered, Whether a World of Magical Tricks often used in the World, may not insensibly oblige <hi>Devils</hi> to wait upon the Superstitious Users of them. A Witty Writer against <hi>Sadducism,</hi> has this Observation, That persons, who never made any Express Contract with <hi>Apostate Spirits,</hi> yet may Act strange Things by <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolick Aids,</hi> which they procure by the use of those wicked <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Arts,</hi> that the Devil first Imparted unto his Confederates. And he adds, <hi>We know not, but the Laws of the Dark Kingdom, may Enjoyn a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Attendence upon all those that practise their My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, whether they know them to be theirs or no.</hi> Some of them that have been Cry'd out upon, as <hi>Employing
<pb facs="tcp:43586:14"/>
Evil Spirits</hi> to Hurt our Land, have been known to be most bloody <hi>Fortune-Tellers;</hi> and some of them have Confessed, That when they told <hi>Fortunes,</hi> they would pretend the Rules of <hi>Chiromancy</hi> and the like Ignorant Sciences, but indeed, they had no Rule (they said) but this, <hi>The Things were then Darted into their Minds. Darted!</hi> Ye Wretches; By whom, I pray. Surely, by none but the <hi>Devils;</hi> who, tho' perhaps they did not exactly <hi>Foreknow</hi> all the thus Predicted Contingencies; yet having once <hi>Foretold</hi> them, they stood bound in Honour now, to use their Interest, which alas, in <hi>This World,</hi> is very great, for the Accomplishment of their own Predictions. There are others, that have used most wicked <hi>Sorceries</hi> to gratify their unlawful Curiosities, or to prevent Inconveniencies in Man and Beast; <hi>Sorceries;</hi> which I will not <hi>Name,</hi> lest I should by Naming, <hi>Teach</hi> them. Now, some <hi>Devil</hi> is overmore Invited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Service of the Person that shall practise these <hi>Witchcrafts;</hi> and if they have gone on Impenitently in these Communions with any <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps become at last a <hi>Familiar</hi> to them, and so assume their <hi>Livery,</hi> that they cannot shake him off in any way, but that One, which <hi>I</hi> would most heartily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe unto them, Namely, That of a deep and long <hi>Repentance.</hi> Should these <hi>Impieties,</hi> have been committed in such a place as <hi>New-England,</hi> for my part I should not wonder, if when <hi>Devils</hi> are Exposing the <hi>Gres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>er</hi> ones with the rest, for their perpetual Humiliation. In the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue therefore, may it not be found, that <hi>New-England</hi> is not so Stock'd with <hi>Rattle Snakes,</hi> as was imagined?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S</hi> 4. But <hi>I</hi> do not believe, that the progress of <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft</hi> among us, is all the Plot, which the Devil is mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the <hi>Witchcraft</hi> now upon us. It is judg'd, That
<pb facs="tcp:43586:14"/>
the Devil Rais'd the Storm, whereof we read in the Eighth Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> on purpose to oversett the little. Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, wherein the Disciples of Our Lord, were Embarqued with Him. And it may be fear'd, that in the <hi>Horrible Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,</hi> which is now upon ourselves, the design of the Devil is to sink that Happy settlement of Government, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Almighty, God, has graciously enclined their Majesties to favour us. We are blessed with a GOVERNOUR, than whom no man can be more willing to serve their Majesties or this their Province: He is continually venturing his <hi>All</hi> to do it: and were not the Interests of His Prince, dearer to him, than his own, he could not but soon be weary of the <hi>Helm,</hi> whereat he sits. We are under the Influence of a LIEVTENANT GOVERNOUR, who not only by being admirably accomplished both with Natural and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Endowments, is fitted for the Service of Their. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties, but also with an unspotted Fidelity, applys himself to that Service. Our COUNCELLOURS, are some of our most Eminent persons, and as Loyal Subjects to the Crown, as hearty lovers of their Countrey. Our Constitution also is attended with singular Priviledges; All which Things are by the Devil exceedingly <hi>Envy'd</hi> unto us. And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will doubtless take this occasion, for the Raising of such complaints and clamours, as may be of pernicious conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, unto some part of our present Settlement, if he can so far <hi>Impose.</hi> But that which most of all Threatens us, in our present Circumstances, is the <hi>Misunderstanding,</hi> and so the <hi>Animosity,</hi> whereinto the <hi>Witchcraft</hi> now Raging, has Enchanted us. The Embroiling, first, of our <hi>Spirits,</hi> and then of our <hi>Affayrs,</hi> is evidently, as considerable a Branch of the Hellish Intreague, which now vexes us, as any one Thing whatever. The Devil has made us like a <hi>Troubled Sea;</hi> and the <hi>More</hi> and <hi>Mud,</hi> begins now also to heave up apace. Even, Good and Wise Men,
<pb facs="tcp:43586:15"/>
suffer themselves to fall into their <hi>Paroxysms;</hi> and the Shake which the Devil is now giving us, fetches up the <hi>Dirt</hi> which before lay still, at the Bottom of our sinful Hearts. If we allow the <hi>Mad Dogs</hi> of Hell to poison us by Biting us, we shall imagine that we see nothing but <hi>such Things</hi> about us, and like <hi>such Things</hi> fly upon all that we see. Were it not for what is IN US, for my part, I should not fear a Thousand <hi>Legions</hi> of Devils; 'tis by our <hi>Quarrels</hi> that we spoil our <hi>Prayers;</hi> and if our Humble, Zealous, and United, <hi>Prayers,</hi> are once <hi>Hindred,</hi> alas, the <hi>Philistines</hi> of Hell have cut our Locks for us; they will then blind us, mock us, ruine us. In Truth, I cannot altogether blame it, If people are a little Transported, when they conceive all the Secular Interests of Themselves and their Families, at the Stake; and yet, at the sight of these Heart-Burnings, I cannot forbear the Exclamation of the Sweet-spirited <hi>Austin,</hi> in his Pacificatory Epistle, to <hi>Ierom</hi> on his Contest with <hi>Ruffin, O miserd et miser and a Conditio!</hi> O Condition, truly <hi>miserable!</hi> But what shall be done to cure these Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? It is wonderfully necessary, that some <hi>Healing At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,</hi> be made at this time; and <hi>I</hi> must needs confess, if I may speak so much, like a <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> I am so desirous of a share in them, that if, <hi>Being thrown Over-board,</hi> were needful to allay the <hi>Storm,</hi> I should think, <hi>Dying,</hi> a Trifle to be undergone, for so great a Blessedness.</p>

                  <hi>S</hi> 5. I would most importunately in the first place, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat every man to maintain an Holy Jealousy over his own Soul, at this Time, and think, <hi>May not the Devil make me, tho' ignorantly, &amp; unwillingly, to be an Instrument of doing something that he would have to be done?</hi> For my part I freely own my Suspicion, Lest something of <hi>Enchantment,</hi> have reach'd more Persons and Spirits among us, then we are well aware of. But then, let us more generally Agree to maintain a kind Opinion, one of another. That <hi>Charity</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:43586:15"/>
without which, even our <hi>Giving our Bodies to be Burned,</hi> would <hi>Profit Nothing,</hi> uses to proceed by this Rule, <hi>It is kind, it is not easily provoked, it is thinks no Evil, it believes all things, hopes all things.</hi> But if we disregard this Rule, of <hi>Charity,</hi> we shall indeed give our <hi>Body Politic to be Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> I have heard it affirmed, That in the Late Great Flood upon <hi>Convecticut,</hi> those Creatures which could not but have Quarrelled at another Time, yet now being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven together, very Agreeably stood by one another. I am sure we shall be worse than <hi>Bruitish,</hi> if we fly upon one another, at a Time when the <hi>Floods of Belial make us afraid.</hi> On the one <hi>Side,</hi> [alas, my Pen, must thou write the word, <hi>Side,</hi> in the Business?] there are very worthy men, who having been call'd by God, when and where this <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> first Appeared upon the Stage, to Encounter it, are earnestly desirous to have it Sifted unto the Bottom of it. And, I pray, which of us all, that should live under the continual Impressions, of the Tortures, Outcries, and Havocks, which Devils confessedly Commissioned by <hi>Witches,</hi> make among their distressed Neighbours, would not have a <hi>Biass</hi> that way, beyond other men? Persons this way disposed, have been men eminent for <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> and men acted by a noble principle of Conscience: Had not <hi>Conscience</hi> of Duty to God, prevailed above other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations with them, they would not for all they are worth in the world, have meddled in this <hi>Thorny Business,</hi> Have there been any <hi>Disputed</hi> Methods used, in Discovering the <hi>Works of Darkness?</hi> It may be none, but what have had <hi>great Precedents</hi> in other parts of the world: which may, tho' not altogether <hi>Iustify,</hi> yet much <hi>Alleviate</hi> a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in us, if there should happen to be found any such mistake, in so <hi>Dark</hi> a matter. They have done, what they have done, with multiply'd <hi>Addresses</hi> to God, for his gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,

and have not been Insensible how much they have exposed themselves in what they have done. Yea, they would gladly contrive, and receive, an expedient, how the Shedding of Blood, might be spared, by the Recovery of <hi>Witches,</hi> not gone beyond the reach of Pardon And after all, They invite all Good men, in Terms to this purpose, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amazed, at the Number, and Quality of those Accused, of Late, we do not know, but Satan, by his Wiles, may have Enwrapped some Innocent persons, and therefore should Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly and Humbly desire, the most Critical Enquiry upon the place, to find out the Fallacy; that there may be none of the Servants of the Lord, with the Worshippers of</hi> Baal. <hi>I</hi> may also add, That whereas, if once a <hi>Witch</hi> do inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously confess among us, no more <hi>Spectres</hi> do in their Shapes after this, Trouble the Vicinage; if any Guilty Creatures will accordingly to so good purpose Confess their Crime to any Minister of God, and get out of the Snare of the Devil, as no Minister will discover such a <hi>Conscientious Confession,</hi> so I believe none in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, will press him to Discover it; but Rejoyce in, <hi>A Soul sav'd from Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> On the other <hi>Side</hi> [if I must again use the word, <hi>Side,</hi> which yet I hope, to Live, to blot out] there are very worthy men, who are not a Little Dissatisfy'd at the Proceedings in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of this <hi>Witchcraft.</hi> And why?

They would have all Due steps taken for the Extinction of <hi>Witches;</hi> but they would fain have them to be <hi>Sure</hi> ones: nor is it from any thing, but the Real and Hearty <hi>Goodness</hi> of such men, that they are Loth to surmise <hi>Ill</hi> of other men, till there be the fullest Evidence, for the surmises. As for the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Iudges,</hi> that have been hitherto in the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, they are <hi>Above</hi> my Consideration: wherefore, I will only say thus much of them, That such of them as I have the Honour of a Personal Acquaintance with, are <hi>Men of an Excellent Spirit;</hi> and as at first they went about the work for which they were Commission'd,

In fine, Have there been Faults on any <hi>Side</hi> fallen into? Surely, They have at worst been but the Faults of a <hi>well-meaning Ignorance.</hi> On every <hi>Side</hi> then, Why should not we Endeavour with Amicable Correspondencies, to help one another out of the <hi>Snares,</hi> wherein the Devil would Involve us? To <hi>Wrangle the Devil,</hi> out of the Country, will be truly a New Experiment! Alas, we are not Aware of the <hi>Devil,</hi> if we do not think, that he aims at Enflaming us one against another; &amp; shall we suffer our selves to be <hi>Devil-Ridden?</hi> or, by any <hi>Unadviseableness,</hi> contribute unto the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening of our Breaches? To say no more, There is a Published and a Credible Relation, which affirms, That very lately, in a part of <hi>England,</hi> where some of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood were Quarrelling, a RAVEN, from the Top of a Tree very Articulately and Unaccountably cry'd out, <hi>Read the Third to the Colossians, and the Fifteenth!</hi> Were I my self to chuse what sort of <hi>Bird</hi> I would be transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into, I would say, <hi>O that I had wings like a Dove!</hi> Nevertheless, I will for once do the Office, which as it seems, Heaven sent that <hi>Raven</hi> upon; even to beg, <hi>That the Peace of God may Rule in our Hearts.</hi>

            <p>THE Text is like the Cloudy and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery Pillar, vouchsafed unto <hi>Israel,</hi> in the Wilderness of old; there is a very <hi>dark side</hi> of it, in the Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that, <hi>The Devil is come down having great Wrath;</hi> but it has also a <hi>bright side,</hi> when it assures us, that, <hi>He has but a short tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>We have in our Hands a Letter from our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended Lord in Heaven, to Advise us of his being still alive, and of his Purpose e're long, to give us a Visit, wherein we shall see our Living <hi>Redeemer, stand at the latter day upon the Earth.</hi> 'Tis the last Advice that we have had from Heaven, for now sixteen Hundred years; and the scope of it, is, to represent how the Lord Jesus Christ, having begun to set up his Kingdom in the World, by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel, he would from time to time ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly break to pieces all Powers that should make Head against it, until; <hi>The Kingdomes of this World are become the Kingdomes of our Lord, and of his

Christ, and he shall Reign for ever and ever.</hi> 'Tis a Commentary on what had been written by <hi>Daniel,</hi> about, <hi>The Fourth Monarchy;</hi> with some Touches upon, <hi>The Fifth;</hi> wherein, <hi>The greatness of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom under the whole Heaven, shall be given to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Saints of the most High:</hi> And altho' it have, as 'tis expressed by one of the Ancients, <hi>Tot Sacramenta, quot verba,</hi> a Mystery in every Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet it is not altogether to be neglected with such a Despair, as that, <hi>I cannot Read, for the Book is Sealed:</hi> it is a REVELATION, and a singular, and notable <hi>Blessing</hi> is pronounc'd upon them that humbly study it.</p>
            <p>The Divine Oracles, have with a most admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Artifice and Carefulness, drawn, as the very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Beverley,</hi> has laboriously Evinced, an exact LINE OF TIME, from the First Sabbath at the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World, unto the great Sabbatism at the <hi>Restitution</hi> of all Things. In that famous <hi>Line of Time,</hi> from the Decree for the Restoring of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> after the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, there seem to remain a matter of <hi>Two Thousand and Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years,</hi> unto that <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> whereto the Church is to be advanced, when the Mystical <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> shall be <hi>fallen.</hi> At the Resurrection of our Lord, there were seventeen or eighteen Hundred of those Years, yet upon the Line, to Run unto, <hi>The Rest which Remains for the People of God;</hi> and this Remnant in the <hi>Line of Time,</hi> is here in our <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> variously Embossed, Adorned, and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized with such Distinguished Events, if we

mind them, will help us escape that Censure, <hi>Can ye not Discern the Signs of the Times?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi> for the View of these Things, had laid before him, as I conceive, a <hi>Book,</hi> with leaves, or folds; which <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lumn</hi> was written both on the <hi>Backside,</hi> &amp; on the <hi>Inside,</hi> &amp; Roll'd up in a Cylindria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Form, under seven <hi>Labels,</hi> fastned with so many <hi>Seals.</hi> The First <hi>Seal</hi> being opened, and the First <hi>Label</hi> removed, under the first <hi>Label</hi> the Apostle saw what he saw, of a first <hi>Rider</hi> Pourtray'd, and so on, till the last <hi>Seal</hi> was broken up; each of the Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being enlarged with Agreeable <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> to Illustrate it. The Book being now Unrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, there were <hi>Trumpets,</hi> with wonderful Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants, Exhibited successively on the Expanding <hi>Backside</hi> of it. Whereupon the Book was <hi>Eaten,</hi> as it were to be Hidden, from Interpretations; till afterwards, in the <hi>Inside</hi> of it, the Kingdom of Antichrist came to be Exposed. Thus, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God on the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> first unto the Downfal of <hi>Paganism,</hi> and then, unto the Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal of <hi>Popery,</hi> which is but Revived <hi>Paganism,</hi> are in these Displayes with Lively Colours and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures made sensible unto us.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, in the Twelfth Chapter of this Book, we have an August Preface, to the Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Horrid <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which our Lord Christ refused, but Antichrist accepted, from the Devils Hands; a Kingdom, which for <hi>Twelve Hundred and Sixty</hi> Years together, was to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual oppression upon the People of God, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43586:19"/>
opposition unto his Interests; until the Arrival of that Illustrious Day, wherein, <hi>The Kingdom shall be the Lords, and he shall be Governour among the Nations.</hi> The Chapter is (as an Excellent Person calls it) an <hi>Extravasated Account,</hi> of the Circumstances, which befel the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> during the first Four of Five Hundred Years of Christianity: it shows us the Face of the Church, first in <hi>Rome</hi> Heathenish, and then in <hi>Rome</hi> Converted, before the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> was yet come to <hi>Mans Estate.</hi> Our Text contains the Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations made upon the most Glorious Revolution that ever yet happened upon the Roman Empire; namely, <hi>That</hi> wherein the Travailing Church brought forth a Christian Emperour. This was a most Eminent <hi>Victory</hi> over the Devil, and <hi>Resemblance</hi> of the State, wherein the World, ere long shall see, <hi>The Kingdom of our God, and the Power of His Christ.</hi> It is here noted.</p>
            <p>First, As a matter of <hi>Triumph.</hi> 'Tis said, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, ye Heavens, and ye that dwell in them.</hi> The Saints in both Worlds, took the Comfort of this Revolution; the Devout Ones that had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived the late Persecutions, were filled with Transporting Joyes, when they saw the <hi>Christian</hi> become the <hi>Imperial</hi> Religion, and when they saw Good Men come to give Law unto the rest of Mankind; the Deceas'd Ones also, whose Blood had been Sacrificed in the Ten Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, doubtless made the Light Regions to ring with <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> unto God, when there were brought
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43586:20"/>
unto them, the Tidings of the Advances now gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, for which they had suffered <hi>Martyrdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As a matter of <hi>Horror.</hi> 'Tis said, <hi>Wo to the Inhabiters of the Earth and of the Sea.</hi> The <hi>Earth</hi> still means the <hi>False Church,</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi> means the <hi>Wide World,</hi> in Prophetical Phrasaeology. There was yet left a vast party of men that were Enemies to the Christian Religion, in the power of it; a vast party left for the Devil to work upon: unto these is, a <hi>Wo</hi> denounced; and why so? 'tis added, <hi>For the Devil is come down unto you, having great Wrath, because he knows, that he has but a short time.</hi> These were it seems to have some desperate and peculiar Attempts of the Devil, made upon them. In the mean time, we may Entertain this for our</p>
            <q>
               <p>DOCTRINE.</p>
               <p>Great WO proceeds from the Great <hi>WRATH,</hi> with which the <hi>DEVIL,</hi> towards the End of his <hi>TIME,</hi> will make a <hi>DESCENT</hi> upon a miserable World.</p>
            </q>
            <p>I have now Published a most awful and solemn Warning for our selves at this day; which has four <hi>Propositions,</hi> comprehended in it.</p>

                  </gap>e, does abundantly prove the Existence of such a Devil.</p>
               <p>About this <hi>Devil,</hi> there are many Things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we may reasonably and profitably be Inqusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; such things, I mean, as are in our Bibles Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd unto us; according to which if we do not speak, on so <hi>Dark</hi> a Subject, but according to our own uncertain, and perhaps humoursome Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, <hi>There is no Light in us.</hi> I will carry you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43586:21"/>
with me, but unto one Paragraph of the Bible, to be informed of three Things, relating to the <hi>Devil;</hi> 'tis the Story of the <hi>Gadaren Energumen,</hi> in the fifth Chapter of <hi>Mark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, then; 'Tis to be granted; The <hi>Devils</hi> are so many, that some <hi>Thousands,</hi> can sometimes at once apply themselves to vex <hi>one</hi> Child of Man. It is said, in Marc. 5. 15. <hi>He that was Possessed with the Devil, had the Legion.</hi> Dreadful to be spoken! A <hi>Legion</hi> consisted of Twelve Thousand Five Hundred people: and we see that in one man or two, so many <hi>Devils</hi> can be spared for a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison. As the Prophet cry'd out, <hi>Multitudes, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, in the Valley of Decision!</hi> So I say, <hi>There are multi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>udes, multitudes, in the valley of Destruction, where the Devils are!</hi> When we speak of, <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> 'tis, <hi>A Name of Multitude;</hi> it means not <hi>One</hi> Individual Devil, so Potent and Scient, as perhaps a <hi>Man chee</hi> would imagine; but it means a <hi>Kind,</hi> which a <hi>Multitude</hi> belongs unto. Alas, The <hi>Devils,</hi> they swarm about us, like the <hi>Frogs of Egypt,</hi> in the most Retired of our Chambers Are we at our <hi>Boards?</hi> There will be Devils to Tempt us unto Sensuality: Are we in our <hi>Beds?</hi> There will be Devils to Tempt us unto Carnality; Are we in our <hi>Shops?</hi> There will be Devils to Tempt us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Dishonesty. Yea, Tho' we get into the Church of God, there will be Devils to Haunt us in the very <hi>Temple</hi> it self, and there Tempt us to manifold Misbehaviours. I am verily perswaded, That there are very few Humane Affayrs, whereinto
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43586:21"/>
some Devils are not Insinuated; There is not so much as a <hi>Iourney</hi> intended, but <hi>Satan</hi> will have an Hand in <hi>Hindering</hi> or <hi>Furthering</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, 'Tis to be supposed, That there is a sort of Arbitrary, even Military <hi>Government,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Devils.</hi> This is intimated, when in <hi>Mar. 5. 9. The Unclean Spirit said, My Name is Legion:</hi> they are under such a Discipline as <hi>Legions</hi> use to be. Hence we read about, <hi>The Prince of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Air:</hi> Our <hi>Air</hi> has a <hi>Power!</hi> or an Army, of Devils in the <hi>High Plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> of it; and these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils have a <hi>Prince</hi> over them, who is, <hi>King over the Children of Pride.</hi> 'Tis probable, That the Devil, who was the Ring-leader of that mutinous and rebellious Crew, which first shook off the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, is now the General of those Hellish Armies; Our Lord, that Conquer'd him, has told us the Name of him; 'tis <hi>Belzebub;</hi> 'tis he that is, <hi>the Devil,</hi> and the rest are, <hi>his Angels,</hi> or his Souldiers. Think on, vast Regiments, of cruel, and bloody French <hi>Dragoons,</hi> with an <hi>Intendant</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, over-running a pillaged Neighbourhood, and you will think a little, what the Constitution among the <hi>Devils</hi> is.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Tis to be supposed, That some <hi>Divels</hi> are more peculiarly <hi>Commission'd,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd,</hi> for some Countreys, while others are for others. This is intimated, when in <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 10. The Devils <hi>besought</hi> Our Lord, <hi>Much, that he would not send them away out of the Countrey.</hi> Why was that? But in all probability, Because <hi>These Divels</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:43586:22"/>
were more Able, to, <hi>Do the Works of the Divel,</hi> in such a Countrey, than in another. It is not likely that every Divel do's know every <hi>Language;</hi> or that every Divel can do every <hi>Mischief.</hi> Tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that the <hi>Experience,</hi> or, if I may call it so, the <hi>Education,</hi> of all Divels, is not alike, and that there may be some Difference in their <hi>Abilities.</hi> If one might make an Inference from what the Divels <hi>Do,</hi> to what they <hi>are,</hi> One cannot forbear Dreaming, that there are <hi>Degrees</hi> of Divels.

               <p>There is a Divellish <hi>Wrath</hi> against <hi>Mankind,</hi> with which the <hi>Divel</hi> is, for <hi>Gods Sake</hi> Inspired. The

The very Devotions of those forlorn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, to whom the Divel is a Leader, are most bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Penances:</hi> and what <hi>VVoes</hi> indeed must we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from such a Divel of a <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Furthermore, the Servile, Abject, Needy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances wherein the Devil keeps the Slaves, that are under his more sensible Vassallage, do suggest unto us, How <hi>woful</hi> the Devil would render all of our Lives. We that live in a Province, which affords unto us, all that may be Necessary or Comfortable for us, found the Province fill'd with vast Herds of Salvages, that never saw so much as a <hi>Knife,</hi> or a <hi>Nail,</hi> or a <hi>Board,</hi> or a Grain of <hi>Salt,</hi> in all their dayes. No better would the Devil have the World provided for! Nor should we, or any else, have one convenient Thing about us; but be as Indigent as usually our most Ragged <hi>VVitches</hi> are; if the Devils Malice were not over-ruled by a Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate God, <hi>Who Preserves Man and Beast.</hi> Hence tis, That the Devil, even like a <hi>Dragon,</hi> keeping a Guard upon such <hi>Fruits</hi> as would Refresh a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing World, has hindred Mankind for many Ages, from hitting upon those useful <hi>Inventions,</hi> which yet were so <hi>Obvious</hi> and <hi>Facil,</hi> that it is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bodies wonder, they were no sooner hit upon. The Bemisted World, must jog on for Thousands of Years, without the knowledge of the <hi>Loadstone,</hi> till a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> stumbled upon it, about Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43586:25"/>
years ago. Nor must the world be blest with such a matchless Engine of Learning and Vertue, as that of, <hi>Printing,</hi> till about the middle of the Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Century. Nor could one Old Man all over the Face of the whole Earth, have the benefit of such a <hi>Little,</hi> tho' most <hi>Needful,</hi> Thing, as a pair of Spectacles, till a Dutch-Man, a little while ago ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated us.</p>
               <p>Indeed, as the Divel do's begrutch us all manner of <hi>Good,</hi> so he do's Annoy us with all manner of <hi>VVo,</hi> as often as he finds himself capable of doing it. But shall vve mention some of the special <hi>woes</hi> with which the Divel do's usually infest the World! Breefly then; <hi>Plagues</hi> are some of those <hi>woes,</hi> with which the Divel troubles us. It is said of the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> in 1. Cor. 10. 10 <hi>They were destroyed of the destroyer.</hi> That is, they had the <hi>Plague</hi> among them. 'Tis the <hi>Destroyer,</hi> or the Divel, that scatters <hi>Plagues</hi> about the World: Pestilential and Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Diseases, 'tis the Divel, who do's oftentimes Invade us with them. 'Tis no uneasy thing, for the Divel, to impregnate the Air about us, with such Malignant <hi>Salts,</hi> as meeting with the <hi>Salt</hi> of our <hi>Microcosin,</hi> shall immediately cast us into that Fermentation and Putrefaction, which will utterly dissolve all the Vital Tyes within us; Ev'n as an <hi>Aqua-Fortis,</hi> made with a conjunction of <hi>Nitre</hi> and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> Corrodes what it Siezes upon. And when the Divel has raised those <hi>Arsenical Fumes,</hi> which become <hi>Venemous Quivers</hi> full of <hi>Terrible Arrows,</hi> how easily can he shoot the delete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43586:26"/>
those Juices or Bowels of Mens Bodies, which will, soon Enflame them with a MortalFire! Hence come such <hi>Plagues,</hi> as that <hi>Beesome of Destruction</hi> which within our memory swept away such a Throng of people from One English City in one Visitation: and hence those Infectious Feavers, which are but so many <hi>Disguised Plagues</hi> among us, Causing Epidemical Desolations. Again, <hi>Wars</hi> are also some of those <hi>VVoes,</hi> with which the Divel causes our Trouble. It is said in Rev. 12. 17. <hi>The Dragon was wroth, and went to make war:</hi> And there is in Truth, scarce any <hi>VVar,</hi> but what is of the <hi>Dragons</hi> kindling. The Divel is that <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>lcan,</hi> out of whose Forge come the instruments of our <hi>VVars,</hi> and it is he that finds us Employments for those Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We read concerning <hi>Daemoniacks,</hi> or people in whom the Devil was, that they would cut and wound themselves; and so, when the Devil is in Men, he puts 'em upon dealing in that barbarous fashion with one another. <hi>VVars</hi> do often furnish him with some Thousands of Souls in one Morning from one Acre of Ground; and for the sake of such <hi>Thyestaean</hi> Banquets, he will push us upon as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>VVars</hi> as he can.</p>
               <p>Once more, why may not <hi>Storms</hi> be rekoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those <hi>VVoes,</hi> with which the Devil do's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb us? It is not improbable, that <hi>Natural Storms</hi> on the World, are often of the Devils raising. We are told in Job. 1. 11. 12, 19. that the Devil made a <hi>Storm,</hi> which Hurricano'd the House of <hi>Iob,</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Heads of them that were feasting in it.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43586:26"/>
                  <hi>Paracelsus</hi> could have informed the Devil, if he had not been informed, as be sure he was before, That if much <hi>Aluminious</hi> matter, with <hi>Salt-Peter</hi> not throughly prepared, be mixed, they will send up a cloud of Smoke, which will come down in Rain. But undoubtedly the Devil understands as well the way to make a <hi>Tempest,</hi> as to turn the <hi>VVinds</hi> at the Solicitation of a <hi>Laplander;</hi> Whence perhaps it is, that Thunders are observed oftner to break upon <hi>Churches,</hi> than upon any other <hi>Buildings;</hi> and besides many a <hi>Man,</hi> yea many a <hi>Ship,</hi> yea many a <hi>Town</hi> has miscarried, when the Devil ha's been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from above to make an <hi>Horrible tempest.</hi> However that the Divel has raised many Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical <hi>Storms</hi> upon the Church, is a thing, than which there is nothing more notorious.

               <p>But in reality, <hi>Spiritual Woes,</hi> are the <hi>Principal Woes,</hi> among all those that the Devil would have us undone withal. <hi>Sins</hi> are the worst of <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I will go forth, and be a Lying Spirit in the Mouth of all the Prophets?</hi> Even so the Devil becomes an <hi>Unclean</hi> Spirit, a <hi>Drinking</hi> Spirit, a <hi>Swearing</hi> Spirit, a <hi>Worldly</hi> Spirit, a <hi>Passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> Spirit, a <hi>Revengful</hi> Spirit, and the like, in the Hearts of those that are already too much of such a Spirit; and thus, they become Improv'd in Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness. Yea, the Devil will put <hi>Good Men</hi> upon doing <hi>Ill.</hi> Thus we read, in 1 <hi>Chron. 21. 1. Satan provoked David to Number Israel.</hi> And so, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil <hi>provokes</hi> men that are Eminent in Holiness, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such Things as may become eminently pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; he <hi>provokes</hi> them especially unto <hi>Pride,</hi> and unto many unsuitable Emulations.

upon them for their <hi>Sins.</hi> 'Tis thus, when an Offended God, puts the <hi>Souls</hi> of men over into the Hands of that Officer, <hi>Who has the Power of Death, that is, the Devil.</hi> It is the woful misery of Unbelievers, in 2 Cor. 4. 4. <hi>The God of this World has blinded their minds.</hi> And thus it may be said of those Woful Wretches, whom the <hi>Devil</hi> is a God unto, <hi>The Devil so Muffles them, that they cannot see the things of their Peace.</hi> And, <hi>The Devil so Hardens them, that nothing will awaken their cares about their Souls:</hi> How come so many to be <hi>Seared</hi> in their Sins?

               <p>We are in the first place, to Apprehend, That there is a <hi>Time</hi> fixed and stated by God, for the Devil to enjoy a Dominion over our <hi>sinful</hi> and therefore <hi>woful</hi> World. The <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>vil</hi> once Exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in Mat. 8. 29. <hi>Iesus, thou Son of God, art thou come hither to Torment us before our Time?</hi> It is plain, That until the <hi>Second</hi> Coming of our Lord, the <hi>Devil</hi> must have a <hi>Time</hi> of plaguing the World, which he was afraid, would have Expired at His <hi>First.</hi> The Devil is, <hi>By the wrath of God, the Prince of this World;</hi> and the <hi>Time</hi> of his Reign, is to continue until the <hi>Time,</hi> when our Lord Himself, shall, <hi>Take to Himself, his great Power and Reign.</hi> Then 'tis that the Devil shall hear the Son of God, swearing with loud Thunders against him, <hi>Thy Time shall now be no more!</hi> Then shall the Devil with his Angels, receive their Doom, which will be, <hi>Depart into the Everlasting Fire prepared for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are also to Apprehend, that in the <hi>mean time,</hi> the Divel can give a shrowd guess, when he drawes near to the <hi>End of his Time.</hi> When he saw Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity enthron'd among the <hi>Romans,</hi> it is here said, in our <hi>Rev, 12 12, He knows he hath but a short time.</hi> And how does he <hi>know</hi> it? Why, <hi>Reason</hi> will make the Divel to <hi>know</hi> that God won't suffer him to have, <hi>the Everlasting Dominion;</hi> &amp; that when God has once begun to rescue the world out of his hands
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43586:28"/>
Hee'l go through with it, until <hi>The Captives of the mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the Terrible shall be delivered.</hi> But the Divel will have <hi>Scripture</hi> also, to make him <hi>Know</hi> that when his Antichristian <hi>Vicar</hi> the <hi>seven headed Beast</hi> on the <hi>seven-hilled</hi> City, shall have spent his determined years, <hi>he</hi> with his <hi>Vicar</hi> must unavoidably go down into the <hi>Bottomless Pitt..</hi> It is not Improbable, that the Divel often hears the <hi>Scripture</hi> expounded in our congregations; yea that we never Assemble without a <hi>Satan</hi> among us. As there are some Divines, who do with more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty conjecture, from a <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ace</hi> in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> That the Angels do some times come into our Churches, to gain some Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from our Ministry. But be sure our <hi>Demonstra ble Interpretations,</hi> may give Repeated Notices to the-Divel, <hi>That his time is almost out:</hi> and what the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er says unto the <hi>Young Man, Know thou, that God will bring thee into Iudgment!</hi> THAT may our Sermons tell unto that <hi>Old Wretch, Know thou, that the time of thy Iudgment is at hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we must now, likewise, Apprehend, that in <hi>such a time,</hi> the <hi>Woes</hi> of the world, will be heightened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what they were at <hi>any Time</hi> yet from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world. Hence ti's, that the Apostle has forewarned us, in 2. <hi>Tim. 3. 1. this know, that in the last days, perillous times shall come.</hi> Truly, when the Divel <hi>knows,</hi> that he is got into his <hi>Last days,</hi> he will make <hi>Perillous Times</hi> for us; the times will grow more full of <hi>Divels,</hi> and therefore more full of <hi>Perils,</hi> than everthey were before. Of this if we
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43586:29"/>
would <hi>Know,</hi> what cause is to be assigned; It is not only, because the Divel growes more <hi>Able</hi> and more <hi>Eager</hi> to Vex the world; but also, and cheefly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the world is more <hi>worthy</hi> to be Vexed by the Divel, than ever heretofore. The <hi>Sins</hi> of men in this Generation, will be more <hi>mighty Sins,</hi> than those of the Former Ages; men will be more Accurate &amp; Exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, &amp; Refined in the Arts of <hi>Sinning,</hi> than they use to be. And besides, their own sins, the sins of all the Former Ages will also lie upon the sinners of this generation. Do we ask why the <hi>mischievous powers of darkness</hi> are to prevail more in our days, than they did in those that are past &amp; gone! Tis because that men by sinning over again the sins of the Former days, have a <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with all those unfruitful works of darkness.</hi> As 'twas said in <hi>Math. 23. 36. All these things shall come upon this generation;</hi> so, the men of the <hi>Last generation,</hi> will find themselves involved in the guilt of all that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Of Sinners tis said, <hi>They Heap up Wrath;</hi> and the sinners of the <hi>Last generations</hi> do not only add unto the <hi>Heap</hi> of sin that has been pileing up, ever since the Fall of man, but they Interest themselves in every sin of that enormous Heap. There has been a <hi>Cry</hi> of sin in all Former Ages going up to God, <hi>That the Divel may come down!</hi> and the sinners of the <hi>Last generations,</hi> do sharpen and louden that <hi>cry,</hi> till the thing do come to pass, as Destructively as Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remediably. From whence it follows, that the Thrice Holy God, with His Holy Angels, will now after a sort more <hi>Abandon</hi> the World, than in the former Ages. The Roaring Impieties of the <hi>Old World,</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:43586:29"/>
at last gave Mankind such a Dista<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>t in the Heart of the Just God; that he came to say, <hi>It Repents me, that I have made such a Creature!</hi> And however, it may be but a witty Fancy, in a Late Learned Writer, that the <hi>Earth</hi> before the Flood was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the <hi>Sun,</hi> than it is at this Day; and that Gods Hurling down the <hi>Earth</hi> to a further Distance from the <hi>Sun,</hi> were the cause of that Flood; yet we may fitly enough say, that men perished by a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> from the God of Heaven. Thus, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanc'd Impieties of this <hi>our World,</hi> will Exasperate the Displeasure of God, at such a rate, as that he will more <hi>Cost us off,</hi> than heretofore; until at last, He do with a more than ordinary Indignation say, <hi>Go Devils; do you take them, and make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all former measures miserable!</hi>

               <p>If Lastly, We are inquisitive after Instances of those Aggravated <hi>Woes,</hi> with which the Devil will towards the <hi>End</hi> of his <hi>Time</hi> assault us; Let it be Remembred, That all the Extremities which were foretold by the <hi>Trumpets</hi> and the <hi>Vials</hi> in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptic Schemes of these things, to come upon the world, were the <hi>woes</hi> to come from the <hi>wrath</hi> of the Divel, upon the <hi>shortning</hi> of his <hi>Time,</hi> The horren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous desolations that have come upon mankind, by the Irruptions of the old <hi>Barbarians</hi> upon the Roman World, and then of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and since, of the <hi>Turks,</hi> were such <hi>woes,</hi> as men had never seen before. The Infandous <hi>Blindness</hi> and <hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>eness</hi> which then came upon mankind, and the Monstrous <hi>

                  </hi> which thereupon carried the Roman world by the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43586:30"/>
Millions together unto the shambles, were also such <hi>woes</hi> as had never yet had a Parallel. And yet these were some of the things here intended, when it was said, <hi>wo! For the Divel is come down in Great wrath, having but a short Time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But besides all these things, and besides the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of <hi>Plagues</hi> &amp; <hi>Wars,</hi> and <hi>Storms,</hi> and <hi>Internal Maladies</hi> now in our days, there are especially two most extraordinary <hi>Woes,</hi> one would fear, will in these days become very ordinary. One <hi>Woe</hi> that may be look'd for is, A frequent Repetition of <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> and this perhaps by the energy of the Divel in the <hi>Earth.</hi> The Divel will be clap't up, as a Prisoner in or near the Bowels of the earth, when once that <hi>Conflagration</hi> shall be dispatch'd, which will make, <hi>The New Earth wherein shall dwell Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;</hi> and that <hi>Conflagration</hi> will doubtless be much promoted, by the Subterraneous <hi>Fires,</hi> which are a cause of the <hi>Earthquakes</hi> in our Dayes. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, we read, <hi>Great Earthquakes in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> enumerated among the Tokens of the <hi>Time</hi> approaching, when the Devil shall have no longer <hi>Time.</hi> I suspect, That we shall now be visited with more Usual, and yet more Fatal <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> than were our Ancestors; inasmuch as the <hi>Fires</hi> that are shortly to, <hi>Burn unto the Lowest Hell, and set on Fire the Foundations of the Mountains,</hi> will now get more Head than they use to do; and it is not impossible, that the Devil, who is e're long to be punished in those <hi>Fires,</hi> may aforehand augment his Desert of it, by having an hand in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43586:30"/>
using some of those <hi>Fires,</hi> for our Detriment. Learned Men have made no scruple to charge the Devil with it; <hi>Deo permittente, Terraemotus causat.</hi> The Devil surely, was a party in the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> whereby the Vengeance of God, in one black Night sunk Twelve considerable Cities of <hi>Asia,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> But there will be more such <hi>Catastrophe</hi>'s in our Dayes! <hi>Italy</hi> has lately been <hi>Shaking,</hi> till its <hi>Earthquakes</hi> have brought Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines at once upon more than thirty Towns; but it will within a little while, <hi>shake</hi> again, and <hi>shake</hi> till the Fire of God have made an Entire <hi>Etna</hi> of it. And behold, This very Morning, when I was intending to utter among you such Things as these, we are cast into an <hi>Heartquake</hi> by Tidings of an <hi>Earthquake</hi> that has lately happened at <hi>Iamaica:</hi> an horrible <hi>Earthquake,</hi> whereby the <hi>Tyrus</hi> of the English <hi>America,</hi> was at once pull'd into the Jawes of the Gaping and Groaning Earth, and many Hundreds of the Inhabitants buried alive. The Lord sanctifie so dismal a Dispensation of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, unto all the <hi>American</hi> Plantations! But be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, my Neighbours, the <hi>Earthquakes</hi> are not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet! We have not yet seen <hi>the Last.</hi> And then, Another <hi>Wo</hi> that may be Look'd for is, The Devils being now let Loose in <hi>preternatural Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> more than formerly; &amp; perhaps in <hi>Possessions</hi> &amp; <hi>Obsessions</hi> that shall be very marvellous. You are not Ignorant, That just before our Lords <hi>First Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> there were most observable Outrages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Devil upon the Children of Men:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43586:31"/>
And I am suspicious, That there will again be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual Range of the Devil among us, a little before the <hi>Second Coming</hi> of our Lord, which will be, to give the last stroke in, <hi>Destroying the Works of the Devil.</hi> The <hi>Evening Wolves</hi> will be much abroad, when we are near the <hi>Evening</hi> of the World. The Devil is going to be Dislodged of the <hi>Air,</hi> where his present Quarters are; God will with flashes of hot <hi>Lightning</hi> upon him, cause him to <hi>fall as Lightning</hi> from this Ancient Habitations: And the <hi>Raised Saints</hi> will there have a <hi>New Heaven,</hi> which, <hi>We expect according to the Promise of God.</hi> Now, a little before this thing, you'l be like to see the Devil, more <hi>sensibly</hi> and <hi>visibly</hi> Busy upon <hi>Earth</hi> perhaps, than ever he was before: You shall oftner hear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Apparitions</hi> of the Devil, and about poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple strangely Bewitched, <hi>Possessed</hi> and <hi>Obsessed,</hi> by Infernal Fiends. When our Lord is going to set up His Kingdom, in the most <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>visible</hi> manner that ever was, and in a manner answering the <hi>Transfiguration</hi> in the Mount, it is a thousand to one, but the Devil will in sundry parts of the World, assay the like for Himself, with a most A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Imitation: and Men, at least in <hi>some</hi> Corners of the World, and perhaps in <hi>such</hi> as God may have some special Designs upon, will to their Cost, be more Familiarized with the <hi>World of Spirits</hi> than they had been formerly.</p>
               <p>So that, in fine, if just before the <hi>End</hi> when the <hi>Times of the Iews</hi> were to be finished, a man then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

O my God, Take me not away in the midst of my Dayes!</hi> Yet when we bear in mind, <hi>That the Devils Wrath is now most Great,</hi> it would make one willing to be, <hi>Out of the Way.</hi> Inasmuch as now is the Time for the doing of those things in the prospect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Balaam</hi> long ago cry'd out, <hi>Who shall live when such Things are done!</hi> We should not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately loth to <hi>Dy</hi> at such a Time.

                  <hi>Protestants,</hi> and <hi>Puritans,</hi> came to Erect Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Churches, in a corner of the World, where he had Reign'd without any Controll for many Ages; and it is a vexing <hi>Eye-sore,</hi> to the Devil, that our Lord Christ should be known, and own'd, and preached in this <hi>Howling Wilderness.</hi> Wherefore he has left no <hi>Stone Unturned,</hi> that so he might undermine his Plantation, and force us out of our Country.</p>
               <p>First, The Indian <hi>Powawes,</hi> used all their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries to molest the First Planters here; but God said unto them, <hi>Touch them not!</hi> Then, <hi>Seducing Spirits,</hi> came to <hi>Root</hi> in this Vineyard, but God so Rated them off, that they have not prevail'd much further than the Edges of our Land. After this, we have had a continual <hi>Blast</hi> upon some of our principal Grain, Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diminishing a vast part of our <hi>Ordinary Food.</hi> Herewithal, Wasting <hi>Sicknesses,</hi> especially Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Mortal Agues, have Shot the Arrows of Death in at our Windows. Next, We have had many Adversaries of our own Language, who have been perpetually assaying to deprive us of those <hi>English Liberties,</hi> in the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof these Territories have been Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled. As if this had not been enough; The <hi>Tawnies</hi> among whom we came, have Watered our Soyl, with the Blood, of many Hundreds of our Inhabitants. Desolating <hi>Fires</hi> also have many times laid the chief Treasure of the whole Province in Ashes. As for <hi>Losses</hi> by Sea, <hi>they</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:43586:38"/>
have been multiply'd upon us: and particularly in the present <hi>French War,</hi> the whole English Nation have observed, That no part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has proportionably had so many Vessels ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as our poor <hi>New-England.</hi> Besides all which, now at last the Devils are (if I may so speak) <hi>in Person</hi> come down upon us, with such a <hi>Wrath,</hi> as is justly <hi>much,</hi> and will quickly be <hi>more,</hi> the Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the World. Alas, I may Sigh over <hi>this</hi> Wilderness, as <hi>Moses</hi> did over <hi>his,</hi> in Psal. 90. 7, 9. <hi>We are consumed by thine Anger, and by thy Wrath we are Troubled: All our Dayes are passed away in thy Wrath.</hi> And I may add this unto it, <hi>The Wrath of the Devil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>But what will become of this poor <hi>New-England</hi> after all? Shall we Sink, Expire, Perish, before the <hi>Short Time</hi> of the Devil shall be finished? I must confess, That when I consider the lamentable <hi>Unfruitfulness</hi> of men, among us, under as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and perspicuous Dispensations of the Gospel, as are in the World; and when I consider the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining State of the <hi>Power of Godliness</hi> in our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, with the most horrible Indisposition that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ever was, to Recover out of this Declension; I cannot but <hi>Fear</hi> lest it comes to this, and lest an <hi>Asiatic</hi> Removal of Candlesticks come upon us. But upon some other Accounts, I would fain <hi>Hope</hi> otherwise; and I will give <hi>you</hi> therefore the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to Try what Inferences may be drawn from these probable Prognostications.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:43586:39"/>
I say, First, That surely, <hi>America's</hi> Fate, must at the long run, include <hi>New-Englands</hi> in it. What was the Design of our God, in bringing over so many <hi>Europaeans</hi> hither of later years? Of what Use or State will <hi>America</hi> be, when the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> shall come? If it must all be the Devils pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, while the <hi>Saved Nations</hi> of the other Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere, shall be, <hi>Walking in the Light of the New Ierusalem,</hi> Our <hi>New-England</hi> has then, 'tis likely, done all that it was Erected for. But if God have a Purpose to make here a Seat for any of, <hi>Those Glorious. Things, which are spoken of Thee, O thou City of God;</hi> then even Thou, O <hi>New-England,</hi> art within a very little while of Better Dayes than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet have Dawn'd upon thee.</p>
               <p>I say, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That tho' there be very <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> Symptoms on <hi>America,</hi> yet there are some <hi>Hopeful</hi> ones. I confess, when one thinks upon the crying Barbarities with which the most of those <hi>Europaeans</hi> that have Peopled this New world, became the Masters of it; it looks but <hi>Ominously.</hi> VVhen one also thinks, How much the way of Living in many parts of <hi>America,</hi> is utterly Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the very Essentials of <hi>Christianity;</hi> yea, how much Injury and Violence is therein done to <hi>Humanity</hi> it self; it is enough to Damp the Hopes of the most Sanguine Complexion. And the <hi>Frown</hi> of Heaven which has hitherto been upon Attempts of better Gospellizing the Plantations, considered, will but increase the <hi>Damp.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, on the other side, what shall be said of all the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43586:39"/>
                  <hi>Promises,</hi> That our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ shall have the uttermost parts of the Earth for his Possession?</hi> and of all the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> That <hi>All the ends of the Earth shall Remember and Turn unto the Lord?</hi> Or does it look <hi>Agreeably,</hi> That such a Rich Quarter of the VVorld, equal in some Regards to all the Rest, should never be out of the <hi>Devils</hi> Hands, from the first Inhabitation unto the Last Dissolution of it? No sure; why may not the <hi>last</hi> be the <hi>first?</hi> and the <hi>Sun of Righteousness</hi> come to shine <hi>Brightest,</hi> in Climates which it Rose <hi>Latest</hi> upon!</p>
               <p>I say, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>as</hi> it fares with <hi>Old England,</hi> so it will be most likely to fare with <hi>New-England.</hi> For which cause, by the way, there may be more of the Divine Favour in the present Circumstances of our Dependence on <hi>England,</hi> than we are well aware of. This is very sure, if matters <hi>Go Ill</hi> with our <hi>Mother,</hi> her poor American <hi>Daughter</hi> here, must feel it; nor could our former Happy Settlement have hindred our Sympathy in that Unhappiness. But if matters <hi>Go Well</hi> in the Three Kingdoms; as long as God shall Bless the English Nation, with Rulers that shall Encourage <hi>Piety, Honesty, Industry;</hi> in their Subjects, and that shall cast a Benign Aspect upon the Interests of our Glorious Gospel, <hi>Abroad</hi> as well as <hi>at Home;</hi> so long, <hi>New-England</hi> will at least keep its Head above Water: and so much the more, for our Comfortable Settlement in such a Form as we are now cast into. Unless, there should be any Singular, Destroying, <hi>Topical Plagues,</hi> whereby an offended God should at last make us
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43586:40"/>
                  <hi>Rise;</hi> But, <hi>Alas, O Lord, what other Hive hast Thou Provided for us!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the <hi>Elder England</hi> will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; speedily be Visited with the <hi>Ancient Loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of God. When one sees, how strangely the Curse of our <hi>Ioshua,</hi> ha's fallen upon the Persons &amp; Houses of them, that have attempted the Rebuilding of the <hi>Old</hi> Romish <hi>Iericho,</hi> which has there been so far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished, they cannot but say, That the <hi>Reformation</hi> there, shall not only be maintained, but also pursued, proceeded, perfected; and that God will shortly there have a <hi>New Ierusalem.</hi> Or, Let a Man in his Thoughts run over; but the Series of amazing Providences towards the English Nation for the last <hi>Thirty Years:</hi> Let him Reflect, How many <hi>Plots</hi> for the Ruine of the Nation, have been strangely discovered? yea, How very unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, those very <hi>Persons,</hi> yea; I may also say, and those very <hi>Methods</hi> which were intended for the Tools of that Ruine, have become the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Occasions of Deliverances? A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but say upon these Reflections, as the Wife of <hi>Manoah</hi> once prudently expressed her self, <hi>If the Lord were pleased to have Destroyed us, He would not have show'd us, all these things.</hi> Indeed, It is not unlikely, that the Enemies of the English Nation, may yet provoke such a <hi>Shake</hi> unto it, as may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps exceed any that has hitherto been undergone: the Lord prevent the Machinations of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries! But, that <hi>Shake</hi> will usher in the most <hi>Glorious Times,</hi> that over arose upon the English <hi>Horizon:</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:43586:40"/>
As for the <hi>French</hi> Cloud which hangs over <hi>England,</hi> tho' it be like to Rain Showers of <hi>Blood</hi> upon a Nation, where the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Blessed Jesus, has been too much treated, as an <hi>Unholy Thing;</hi> yet I believe, God will shortly scatter it: and my Belief is grounded upon a Bottom, that will bear it. If that overgrown <hi>French Leviathan,</hi> should accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish any thing like a Conquest of <hi>England,</hi> what could there be to hinder him from the Universal Empire of the <hi>West?</hi> But the <hi>Visions</hi> of the Western World, in the <hi>Views</hi> both of <hi>Daniel</hi> and of <hi>Iohn,</hi> do assure us, that whatever Monarch, shall while the <hi>Papacy</hi> continues, go to smallow up the <hi>Ten Kings</hi> which received <hi>Their Power</hi> upon the Fall of the Western Empire, he must miscarry in the Attempt. The <hi>French Phaetons</hi> Epitaph seems written in that, <hi>Sure Word of Prophecy!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[Since the making of this Conjecture, there are Arriv'd unto us, the News of a Victory obtain'd by the <hi>English</hi> over the <hi>French,</hi> which further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms our Conjecture; and causes us to sing, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs Chariots, and his Host, has the Lord cast down into the Sea; Thy Right-hand has dashed in pieces the Enemy!]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, <hi>In the Salvation of</hi> England, the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot but <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> and <hi>New-England</hi> also will <hi>be Glad.</hi>

to Extirpate the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus here. <hi>New-England</hi> may complain of the Devil, as in Psal. 129. 1, 2. <hi>Many a time have they Afflicted me, from my Youth, may,</hi> New-England <hi>now say; many a time have they Afflicted me from my Youth; yet they have not prevailed against me.</hi> But now there is a more than Ordinary <hi>Affliction,</hi> with which the <hi>Devil</hi> is Galling of us: and such an one as is indeed Unparallellable. The Things Confessed by <hi>Witches</hi> and the Things Endured by <hi>Others,</hi> laid together, amount unto this account of our Affliction. The <hi>Devil,</hi> Exhibiting himself ordinarily as a small <hi>Black man,</hi> has decoy'd a fearful Knot of Proud, Froward, Ignorant, Envious, and Malicious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to List themselves in his Horrid Service, by Entring their Names in a <hi>Book</hi> by him Tendred unto them. These <hi>Witches,</hi> whereof above a Score have now <hi>Confessed, and shown their Deeds,</hi> and some are now Tormented by the Devils, for <hi>Confessing,</hi> have met in Hellish <hi>Randezvouzes,</hi> wherein the Confessors do say, they have had their Diabolical Sacraments, imitating the <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi> of our Lord. In these Hellish Meetings, these Monsters have associated themselves to do no less a Thing than, <hi>To Destroy the Kingdom of our Lord Iesus Christ, in these parts of the World;</hi> and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hereunto, First, they each of them have their <hi>Spectres,</hi> or Devils, Commission'd by them, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting of them, to be the Engines of their Malice. By these wicked <hi>Spectres,</hi> they Sieze poor people about the Country, with Various and bloody
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43586:42"/>
                                 <hi>Torments;</hi> and of those Evidently Preternatural Torments there are some have Dy'd. They have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched some, even so far as to make them <hi>Self-Destroyers:</hi> and others are in many Towns here and there Languishing under their <hi>Evil Hands.</hi> The People thus Afflicted, are miserably Scratched and Bitten, so that the Marks are most <hi>Visible</hi> to all the World, but the causes utterly <hi>Invisible;</hi> and the same <hi>Invisible</hi> Furies, do most Visibly stick <hi>Pins</hi> into the Bodies of the Afflicted, and <hi>Scald</hi> them, &amp; hideously Distort, and Disjoint all their members, besides a thousand other sorts of Plagues beyond these of any Natural Diseases which they give unto them. Yea, they sometimes drag the poor People out of their Chambers, and Carry them over <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Hills,</hi> for diverse Miles together. A large part of the Persons tortured by these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical <hi>Spectres,</hi> are horribly Tempted by them, sometimes with fair Promises, and sometimes with hard Threatenings, but alwayes with felt Miseries, to sign the <hi>Devils Laws,</hi> in a Spectral <hi>Book</hi> laid before them; which two or three of these poor Sufferers, being by their Tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Sufferings overcome to do, they have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately been released from all their Miseries, &amp; they appear'd in <hi>Spectre</hi> then to Torture those that were before their Fellow-Sufferers. The <hi>Witches</hi> which by their Covenant with the Devil, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Owners of <hi>Spectres,</hi> are oftentimes by their own <hi>Spectres</hi> Required and Compelled to give their Consent, for the Molestation of some, which they had no mind otherwise to fall upon; and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43586:42"/>
Cruel Depredations are then made upon the Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. In the Prosecution of these <hi>Witchcrafts,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a thousand other unaccountable Things, the <hi>Spectres</hi> have an odd Faculty of Cloathing the most Substantial and Corporeal Instruments of Torture, with <hi>Invisibility,</hi> while the Wounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by given have been the most palpable Things in the World; so that the Sufferers assaulted with Instruments of Iron wholly <hi>unseen</hi> to the Standers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, tho' to their cost seen by themselves, have upon snatching, wrested the Instruments out of the <hi>Spectres</hi> Hands, and every one has then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately not only <hi>beheld,</hi> but <hi>handled,</hi> an Iron Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken by a Devil from a Neighbour. These wicked <hi>Spectres</hi> have proceeded so far, as to Steal several Quantities of Mony from divers people, part of which Money has before sufficient Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors been dropt out of the Air into the Hands of the Sufferers, while the <hi>Spectres</hi> have been urging them to Subscribe their <hi>Covenant with Death.</hi> In such extravagant wayes, have these Wretches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, the <hi>Dragooning</hi> of as many as they can, into their own Combination, and the <hi>Destroying</hi> of others, with Lingring, Spreading, Deadly Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; till our Country should at last become too hot for us. Among the Ghastly Instances of the <hi>Success</hi> which those Bloody Witches have had, we have seen even some of their own <hi>Children,</hi> so De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated unto the Devil, that in their Infancy, it is found, the <hi>Imps</hi> have Sucked them, and Rendred them Venemous to a Prodigy.

Devils <hi>First</hi> Batteries, upon the Town, where the <hi>First</hi> Church of our Lord in this Colony was Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, producing those Distractions, which have almost Ruined the Town.

                              <p>This is the <hi>Descent</hi> which, as it seems, the Devil has now made upon us.

When a Truculent <hi>Nero,</hi> a <hi>Devil</hi> of a man, was turned, in upon the World, it was said in, 1. Pet. 5. 6, <hi>Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God.</hi> How much more now ought we to <hi>Humble ourselves,</hi> under that <hi>Mighty Hand</hi> of that God who indeed has the Devil in a <hi>Chain,</hi> but has horribly lengthened out the <hi>Chain!</hi>

When the Old People of God, heard any <hi>Blasphemies</hi> tearing of his Ever-Blessed Name to pieces, they were to <hi>Rend their Cloaths</hi> at what they heard. I am sure, that we have cause to <hi>Rend our Hearts</hi> this Day, when we see what an High Treason has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against the most High God, by the Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts in our Neighbourhood. We may say; and shall we not be <hi>Humbled</hi> when we say it? <hi>We have seen an horrible thing done in our Land!</hi> O 'tis a most humbling thing, to think, that ever there should be such an abomination among us, as for a Crue of Humane Race, to renounce their <hi>Maker,</hi> and to unite with the <hi>Devil,</hi> for the Troubling of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and for people to be, (as is by some confess'd) <hi>Baptized</hi> by a <hi>Fiend</hi> using this form upon them, <hi>Thou art mine, and I have a full power over thee!</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards communicating in an Hellish <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> by that Fiend Admnistred unto them.

Great Britain</hi> alone, and this also in our Dayes of <hi>Greatest Light,</hi> has had that in it, which may divert the Calumnies of an Ill-natured World, from Centring here. They are the words of the Devout Bishop <hi>Hall, Satans Prevalency in this Age, is most clear in the marvellous Number of Witches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in all places. Now Hundreds are discovered in one Shire; and, if Fame Deceive us not, in a Village of Fourteen Houses in the North, are found so many of this Damned Brood. Yea, and those of both Sexes, who have Professed much Knowledge, Holiness, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, are drawn into this Damnable Practice.</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Doctor in the first of those Passages, may refer to what happened in the Year 1645. When so many Vassals of the Devil were Detected, that there were <hi>Thirty</hi> Try'd at one time, whereas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Fourteen</hi> were Hang'd, and an Hundred more Detained in the Prisons of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Essex.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things which many of these Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, one was, That they were to undergo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Punishments,</hi> if they did not such and such <hi>Hurts,</hi> as were appointed them. And, among the Rest that were then Executed, there was an Old Parson, called, <hi>Lowis,</hi> who Confessed, that he had a Couple of <hi>Imps,</hi> whereof <hi>One</hi> was alwayes put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him upon the doing of Mischief; Once par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,

that <hi>Imp</hi> calling for his Consent so to do, went immediately and Sunk a <hi>Ship,</hi> then under Sail.

Nevertheless, I am sure that <hi>we,</hi> the People of <hi>New-England,</hi> have cause enough to <hi>Humble</hi> our selves under our most <hi>Humbling</hi> Circumstances. We must no more, be, <hi>Haughty, because of the Lords Holy Mountain among us;</hi> No, it becomes us rather to be, <hi>Humble, because we have been such an Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Unholy Devils!</hi>

And it may be that the <hi>wrath</hi> which we have had against one another has had
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43586:46"/>
more then a little Influence upon the coming down of the Divel in that <hi>wrath</hi> which now amazes us. Have not many of us been <hi>Devils</hi> one unto another for Slanderings, for Backbitings, for Animosities? For <hi>this,</hi> among other causes, perhaps, God has permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Devils</hi> to be Worrying, as they now are, among us. But it is high time to leave off all <hi>Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,</hi> when the <hi>Devil</hi> himself is falling upon us: and it is <hi>no time</hi> for us to be Censuring and Reviling one another, with a <hi>Devilish Wrath,</hi> when the <hi>Wrath</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> is annoying of us. The way for us to out-wit the Devil, in the <hi>Wiles</hi> with which he now <hi>Vexes</hi> us, would be for us, to join as one man in our cries to God, for the Directing, and Issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Thorny Business; but if we do not <hi>Lift up</hi> our Hands to Heaven, <hi>Without Wrath,</hi> we cannot then do it <hi>without Doubt,</hi> of speeding in it. I am ashamed when I read French Authors giving this Character of Englishmen <hi>[Ils se haissent Les uns les autres, et sont en Division Continuelle.] They hate one one another, and are always Quarrelling one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And I shall be much more ashamed, if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Character of <hi>New-Englanders;</hi> which is indeed, what the Devil would have. <hi>Satan</hi> would make us <hi>Bruise</hi> one another, by breaking of the <hi>Peace</hi> among us; but O let us disappoint him.

keeness, in the disputes which the Devil has raised among us; and if we would use to one another none but the, <hi>Soft Answers, which Turn away Wrath:</hi> I should hope that we might light upon such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, as would quickly Extricate us out of our <hi>Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths.</hi> But the Old <hi>Incendiary</hi> of the world, is come from Hell, with <hi>Sparks</hi> of Hell-Fire Flashing on every side of him; and we make ourselves <hi>Tynder</hi> to the Sparks. When the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> III. kept the Feast of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> at the City <hi>Mentz,</hi> there arose a Dissension among some of the People there, which came from words to Blows, and at last it passed on to the Shedding of Blood. After the Tumult was over, when they came to that clause in their Devotions, <hi>Thou hast made this day Glorious;</hi> the Devil to the unexpressible Terrour of that vast Assembly, made the Temple Ring with that Outcry <hi>But I have made this Day Quarrelsome!</hi> We are truly come into a day, which by being well managed might be very <hi>Glorious,</hi> for the exterminating of those, <hi>Accursed Things,</hi> which have hitherto been the Clogs of our Prosperity; but if we make this day <hi>Quarrelsome,</hi> thro' any <hi>Raging Confidences,</hi> Alas, <hi>O Lord, my Flesh Trembles for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Iudgments. Erasmus,</hi> among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Historians, tells us, that at a Town in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> a Witch or Devil, appear'd on the Top of a Chimney, Threatning to set the Town on <hi>Fire:</hi> and at length, Scattering a Pot of Ashes abroad, the Town was presently and Horribly Burn't unto the Ground.

                                 <hi>A Reformation of our Provoking Evils,</hi> as the only way to avoid that <hi>Wrath</hi> of His, which does not only <hi>Threaten,</hi> but <hi>Consume</hi> us. 'Tis because we have been Deaf to those <hi>Calls,</hi> that we are now by a provoked God, laid open to the <hi>Wrath</hi> of the Devil himself. It is said in Prov. 16. 7. <hi>When a mans ways please the Lord, He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth even his Enemies to be at peace with him.</hi> The Devil is our Grand <hi>Enemy:</hi> and tho' we would not be at peace <hi>with</hi> him, yet we would be at peace <hi>from</hi> him; that is, we would have him unable to Disquiet our <hi>Peace.</hi> But inasmuch as the <hi>Wrath</hi> which we Endure from this <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> will allow us no <hi>Peace,</hi> we may be sure, <hi>Our Ways have not pleased the Lord.</hi> It is because we have <hi>Broken the Hedge</hi> of Gods <hi>Precepts,</hi> that the Hedge of Gods <hi>Provodence</hi> is not so Entire as it uses to be about us; but <hi>Serpents</hi> are <hi>Biting</hi> of us. O let us then set our selves to make our <hi>Peace</hi> with our God, whom we have <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased</hi> by our Iniquities: and let us not imagine that we can Encounter the <hi>Wrath</hi> of the Devil, while there is the <hi>Wrath</hi> of God Almighty to set that Mastiff upon us. REFORMATION! REFORMATION! has been the Repeated <hi>Cry,</hi> of all the Judgments, that have hitherto been upon us: because we have been as <hi>Deaf Adders</hi> thereunto, the <hi>Adders</hi> of the Infernal Pit are now hissing about us, At length, as it was of old said in Luc 16. 30. <hi>If one went unto them, from the Dead, they will Repent;</hi> Even so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There are some come unto us from the <hi>Damned.</hi>

The Great God has Loosed the Bars of the Pit, so that many <hi>Damned Spirits</hi> are come in among us, to make us <hi>Repent</hi> of our Misdemeanours. The means which the Lord had formerly Employ'd for our <hi>Awakening,</hi> were such, that he might well have said, <hi>What could I have done more?</hi> and yet after all, He has done <hi>more,</hi> in some regards, than was ever done for the Awakening of any People in the World. The Things now done to Awaken our Enquiries after our <hi>Provoking Evils,</hi> and our Endeavours to Reform those Evils; are most EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRAORDINARY Things; For which cause I would freely speak it, If we now do not some EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRAORDINARY Things in Returning to God, we are the most <hi>Incurable,</hi> and I wish it be not quickly said, the most <hi>Miserable,</hi> People under the Sun. Believe me, 'tis a Time for all people to do something EXTRAORDINARY <hi>In Searching and in Trying of their Ways, and in Turning to the Lord.</hi> It is at an EXTRAORDINARY Rate of <hi>Circumspection</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Mindedness,</hi> that we should all now main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a <hi>Walk with God.</hi> At such a Time as This, ought <hi>Magistrates</hi> to Do something EXTRAOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DINARY in promoting of what is Laudable, and in Restraining and Chastising of <hi>Evil Doers.</hi> At such a Time as This, ought <hi>Ministers</hi> to Do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing EXTRAORDINARY in pulling the Souls of men out of the <hi>Snares</hi> of the Devil, not only by publick Preaching, but by personal Visits and Counsels, <hi>from House to House.</hi> At such a Time as This, ought <hi>Churches</hi> to Do something EXTRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ORDINARY,

in <hi>Renewing</hi> of their Covenants, and in <hi>Remembring,</hi> and <hi>Reviving</hi> the Obligations of what they have Renewed. Some Admirable Designs about the <hi>Reformation</hi> of Manners, have lately been on foot in the English Nation, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of the most Excellent Admonitions, which have been given for it, by the Letters of Their Majesties. Besides the vigorous Agreements of the <hi>Iustices</hi> here and there in the Kingdom; assisted by Godly Gentlemen and Informers, to Execute the <hi>Laws</hi> upon Profane Offenders: there has been started, A PROPOSAL, for the well-affected peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in every Parish, to enter into orderly <hi>Societies,</hi> whereof every Member shall bind himself, not only to <hi>Avoid</hi> Profaneness in himself, but also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto their Place, to do their utmost in first <hi>Reproving,</hi> and, if it must be so, then <hi>Exposing,</hi> and so <hi>Punishing,</hi> as the Law directs, for, others that shall be guilty.

O Let us then at last, <hi>Consider our Wayes.</hi> 'Tis a strange passage recorded by Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> in the Life of his Father, That the People of his Parish refusing to be Reclaimed from their <hi>Sabbath Breaking,</hi> by all the zealous Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which that Good man bore against it; at last, on a Night after the people had Retired Home from a Revelling Profanation of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> there was heard a Great Noise, with Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of Chains, up and down the Town, and an horrid Scent of Brimstone fill'd the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Upon which the <hi>Guilty Consciences</hi> of the Wretches, told them, the Devil was come to fetch them away: and it so terrify'd them, that an Eminent <hi>Reformation</hi> follow'd the Sermons which that man of God Preached thereupon.

Sinners, Behold, and <hi>Wonder,</hi> lest you <hi>Perish;</hi> the very <hi>Devils</hi> are Walking about our Streets, with Lengthened <hi>Chains,</hi> making a dreadful Noise in our Ears, and <hi>Brimstone,</hi> even without a Metaphor, is making an Hellish and Horrid Stench in our Nostrils.

But it becomes us, with a like Ardour, to bring our poor <hi>Children</hi> with us, as we shall do, when we come ourselves, into the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God. It would break an heart of Stone, to have seen, what I have lately seen; Even poor Children of several Ages, even from seven to twenty more or less, <hi>Confessing</hi> their Familiarity with Devils; but at the same time, in Doleful bitter Lamentations, that made a Little Pour traiture of <hi>Hell</hi> it self, Expostulating with their execrable Parents, for <hi>Devoting</hi> them to the Devil in their Infancy, and so <hi>Entailing</hi> of Devillism upon them! Now, as the Psalmist could say, <hi>My Zeal hath Consumed me, because my Enemies have forgotten thy Words:</hi> Even so, let the nefarious wickedness of those that have Explicitly dedicated their Children to the Devil, even with Devillish Symbols, of such a Dedication, Provoke our <hi>Zeal</hi> to have our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Sincerely, Signally, and openly <hi>Consecrated</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; with an <hi>Education</hi> afterwards assuring and confirming that Consecration.</p>

Here are <hi>Charms</hi> indeed! Sacred and Blessed <hi>Charms,</hi> which the Devil cannot stand before. A <hi>Promise</hi> of God, being well managed in the <hi>Hands</hi> of them, that are much upon their <hi>Knees,</hi> will so, <hi>Resist the Devil,</hi> that he will <hi>Flee from us.</hi> At every other Weapon, the <hi>Devils</hi> will be too hard for us; the <hi>Spiritual Wickednesses in High Places,</hi> have manifestly the Upper Hand of us; that <hi>Old Serpent</hi> will be too Old for us, too cunning, too subtil; they will soon <hi>out-wit</hi> us, if we think to Encounter them with any <hi>Wit</hi> of our own. But when we come to <hi>Prayers,</hi> Incessant and Vehement <hi>Prayers</hi> before the Lord, <hi>there</hi> we shall be too hard for them.

This his Brother appear'd unto him, in the Morning, about five a Clock at <hi>Boston,</hi> having on him a <hi>Bengale</hi> Gown, which he usually wore, with a Napkin Ty'd about his Head; His Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was very Pale, Ghastly, Deadly, and he had a Bloody Wound On one Side of his Forehead! <hi>Brother!</hi> saies the Affrighted <hi>Ioseph.</hi> Brother! Answered the Apparition. Said <hi>Ioseph, What's the matter, Brother! How came you here!</hi> The Apparition reply'd, <hi>Brother, I have been most Barbarously and Injuriously Butchered, by a Debauch'd, Drunken Fellow, to whom</hi> I <hi>never did any wrong in my life.</hi> Whereupon he gave a particular Description of the Murderer; adding, <hi>Brother, This Fellow, changing his Name, is attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to come cover unto</hi> New-England, <hi>in</hi> Foy <hi>or</hi> Wild; <hi>I would pray you, on the first Arrival of either of these, to get an Order from the Governour, to Seiz the person, whom I have now described; and then do you Indict him for the Murder of me your Brother: I'le Stand by you, and prove the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.</hi> And so he vanished. Mr. <hi>Beacon</hi> was extreamly astonished at what he had seen and heard; and the People of the Family not only observed an extraordinary Alteration upon him, for the Week following, but have also given me under their Hands a: full Testimony, that he then gave them an Account of this Apparition.</p>
                           <p>All this while, Mr., <hi>Beacon</hi> had no Advice of any thing amiss attending his Brother then in <hi>England;</hi> but about the latter end of <hi>Iune</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,

                           <p>The Venerable Baxter very truly sais, <hi>Iudge</hi> Hale <hi>was a Person, than whom no Man, was more backward, to Condemn a Witch, without full Evidence.</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p n="1">I. <hi>Rose Cullender,</hi> and <hi>Amy Duny,</hi> were severally Indicted, for Bewitching <hi>Elizabeth Durent Ann Durent, Iane Bocking, Susan Chandler, William Durent,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43586:59"/>
Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Deborah Pacy.</hi> And the evidence, whereon they were Convicted, stood upon diverse particular Circumstances.</p>
                           <p n="2">
                              <hi>II. Ann Durent, Susan Chandler,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeh Pacy,</hi> when they came into the Hall, to give Instructions for the drawing the Bills of Indictments, they fell into strange and violent Fitts, so that they were unable to give in their Depositions, not only then but also During the whole Assizes. <hi>William Durent</hi> being an Infant, his Mother Swore, That <hi>Amy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> looking after her Child one Day in her absence, did at her return confess, that she had <hi>given suck to the Child:</hi> (tho' she were an Old Woman:) Whereat, when <hi>Durent</hi> expressed her displeasure, <hi>Duny</hi> went away with Discontents and Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                           <p>The Night after, the Child fell into strange and sad Fitts, wherein it continued for Diverse Weeks. One Doctor <hi>Iacob</hi> advised her to hang up the Childs Blanket, in the Chimney Corner all Day, and at Night, when she went to put the Child in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, if she found any Thing in it then to throw it without fear into the Fire. Accordingly, at Night, there fell a great Toad out of the Blanket, which ran up &amp; down the Hearth. A Boy, catch't it, &amp; held it in the Fire with the Tongs: where it made an horrible Noise, and Flash'd like to Gun-Powder, with a report like that of a Pistol: Whereupon the Toad was no more to be seen, The next Day a kinswoman of <hi>Duny's,</hi> told the Deponent, that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43586:59"/>
her Aunt was all grievously scorch'd with the Fire, and the Deponent going to her House, found her in such a Condition. <hi>Duny</hi> told her, she might thank her for it; but she should live to see some of her Children Dead, and her self upon Crutches. But after the Burning of the Toad, this Child Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                           <p>This Deponent further Testify'd, That Her Daughter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being about the Age of Ten Years, was taken in like manner, as her first Child was, and in her Fitts complained much of <hi>Amy Duny,</hi> and said, that she did appear to Her, and afflict her in such manner as the former. One Day she found <hi>Amy Duny</hi> in her House, and thrusting her out of Doors, <hi>Duny</hi> said, <hi>You need not be so Angry, your Child won't live long.</hi> And within three Days the Child Dyed. The Deponent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the was Her self, not long after taken with such a Lameness, in both her Leggs, that she was forced to go upon Crutches; and she was now in Court upon them. [It was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that immediately upon the Juries bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Duny</hi> Guilty, <hi>Durent</hi> was restored unto the use of her Limbs, and went Home without Her Crutches.]</p>
                           <p n="3">III. As for <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Deborah Pacy,</hi> one Aged Eleven years, the other Nine; the elder, being in Court, was made utterly senseless, during all the time of the Triall: or at least speechless. By the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Judge, <hi>Duny</hi> was privately brought to <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43586:60"/>
Pacy,</hi> and she touched her Hand: whereupon the child, without, so much as seeing her, suddenly leap'd up and flew upon the prisoner; the younger was too ill, to be brought unto the Assizes. But <hi>Samuel Pacy,</hi> their Father, testify'd, that his Daughter <hi>Deborah,</hi> was taken with a sudden lameness; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the grumbling of <hi>Amy Duny,</hi> for being denyed something, where this child was then sitting, the child was taken with an extreeme pain in her sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,, like the pricking of pins; and shrieking at a dreadful manner, like a Whelp, rather then a Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal creature. The Physicians could not conjecture the cause of the Distemper; but <hi>Amy Duny</hi> being a woman of Ill Fame, and the child in fitts crying out of <hi>Amy Duny,</hi> as affrighting her with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition of her person, the deponent suspected her, and procured her to be set in the stocks. While she was there, she said in the hearing of two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, <hi>Mr</hi> Pacy <hi>keeps a great stir about his child, but let him stay till he has done as much by his Children, as I have done by mine:</hi> and being asked, What she had done to her Children, she answered, <hi>She had been fain to open her Childs mouth with a Tap to give it Victuals.</hi> The Deponent added, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two Days, the Fits of his Daughters were such, that they could not preserve either Life or Breath, without the help of a Tap. And that the Children cry'd out of <hi>Amy Duny,</hi> and of <hi>Rose Cullender,</hi> as afflicting them, with their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. The Fits of the Children, were various.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43586:60"/>
They would sometimes be Lame on one side; sometimes on t' other. Sometimes very sore; sometimes restored unto their Limbs, and then Deaf, or Blind, or Dumb, for a long while to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Upon the Recovery of their Speech, they would Cough extreamly; and with much Flegm, they would bring up Crooked Pins; &amp; one time, a Two-penny Nail, with a very broad Head. Commonly at the end of every Fit, they would cast up a Pin. When the Children Read, they could not pronounce the Name of, <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>Iesus</hi> or <hi>Christ,</hi> but would fall into Fitts; and say, Amy Duny <hi>says, I must not use that Nami.</hi> When they came to the Name of <hi>Satan,</hi> or <hi>Devil,</hi> they would clap their Fingers on the Book, crying out, <hi>This bites, but it makes me speak right well!</hi> The Children in their Fitts, would often, cry out, <hi>There stands</hi> Amy Duny, <hi>or,</hi> Rose Cullen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and they would afterwards relate, <hi>That these Witches appearing before them, threatned them, that if they told what they saw or heard, they would Torment them ten times more than ever they did before.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">V. <hi>Margaret Arnold,</hi> the Sister of Mr. <hi>Pacy,</hi> testify'd unto the like Sufferings being upon the Children, at her House, whither her Brother had Removed them. And that sometimes, the Children <hi>(only)</hi> would see things like Mice, run about the House; and one of them sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly snap't one with the Tongs, and threw it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43586:61"/>
the Fire, where it screeched out like a Rat. At another time, a thing like a Bee, flew at the Face of the younger Child; the Child fell into a Fitt; and at last Vomited up a, <hi>Two-pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nail,</hi> with a Broad Head; affirming, <hi>That the Bee brought this Nail, and forced it into her mouth.</hi> The Child would in like manner be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted with Flies, which brought Crooked Pins, unto her, and made her first swallow them, and then Vomit them. She one Day caught, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible <hi>Mouse,</hi> and throwing it into the Fire, it Flash'd like to Gun-Powder. None besides the Child saw the <hi>Mouse,</hi> but every one saw the <hi>Flash.</hi> She also declared, out of her Fitts, that in them, <hi>Amy Duny,</hi> much tempted her to Destroy Her self.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. As for <hi>Ann Durent,</hi> her Father Testifyed That upon a Discontent of <hi>Rose Cullender,</hi> His Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was taken with much Illness in her Stomach and great and sore Pains, like the pricking of pins: and then Swooning Fitts, from which Recovering she declared, <hi>She had seen the Apparition of</hi> Rose Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender, <hi>Threatning to Torment her.</hi> She likewise Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited up diverse Pins. The Maid was Present at Court, but when <hi>Cullender</hi> look'd upon her, she fell into such Fitts, as made her utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to declare any thing.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ann Baldwin,</hi> deposed the same.</p>
                           <p n="7">VII. <hi>Iane Bocking,</hi> was too weak, to be at
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43586:61"/>
the Assizes. But her Mother Testify'd, that Her Daughter having formerly been Afflicted with Swooning Fitts, and Recovered of them; was now taken with a great Pain in her Stomach; and New Swooning Fitts. That she took little Food, but every Day Vomited Crooked Pins. In her first Fitts, she would Extend her Arms, and use Postures; as if she catched at something, and when her Clutched Hands were forced open, they would find several Pins diversely Crooked, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably lodged there. She would also maintain a Discourse with some that were Invisibly present, when casting abroad her Arms, she would often say, <hi>I will not have it!</hi> but at last say; <hi>Then I will have it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                              </hi> and closing her Hand, which when they presently after opened, a Lath-Nail was found in it. But Her great complaints were of being Visited by the shapes of <hi>Amy Duny,</hi> and <hi>Rose Cullender.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. As for <hi>Susan Chandler,</hi> Her Mother Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, That being at the search of <hi>Rose Cullender,</hi> they found on her Belly a thing like a Teat, of an Inch long; which the <hi>said Rose</hi> ascribed to a strain. But near her Privy parts, they found Thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>
                              </gap> more, that were smaller than the former. At the end of the long Teat, there was a little Hole, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, as if newly Sucked; and upon straining it, a white milky matter issued out. The Deponent further said, That her Daughter being one day concerned at <hi>Rose Cullenders: taking her by the Hand, she fell very sick, and at Night cry'd out,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43586:62"/>
That</hi> Rose Cullender <hi>woald come to Bed unto her.</hi> Her Fitts grew violent, and in the Intervals of them, she declared, <hi>That she saw</hi> Rose Cullender <hi>in them, and once having of a great Dog with her.</hi> She also vomited up crooked Pins; and when she was brought into Court, she fell into her Fitts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She Recovered her self in some Time, and was asked by the Court, whether she was in a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to take an Oath, and give Evidence. She said, she could; but having been Sworn, she fell into her Fitts again, and, <hi>Burn her! Burn her!</hi> were all the words that she could obtain power to speak. Her Father likewise gave the same Testimony with her Mother; as to all but the Search.</p>
                           <p n="9">IX. Here was the Sum of the Evidence: which Mr. Serjeant <hi>Keeling;</hi> thought not sufficient to Convict the Prisoners. For admitting the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were Bewitched, yet, said he, it can never be Apply'd unto the Prisoners, upon the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only of the Parties Afflicted; inasmuch as no person whatsoever could then be in Safety.</p>
                           <p>Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> a very Learned Person then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, gave his Opinion, that these persons were Bewitched. He added, That in <hi>Denmark,</hi> there had been lately a great Discovery of Witches; who used the very same way of Afflicting people, by Conveying Pins and Nails into them. His Opi nion was, that the Devil in Witchcrafts, did Work upon the Bodies of Men and Women, upon a <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Foundation;</hi> and that he did Extraordinarily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43586:62"/>
them, with such Distempers as their Bodies were most subject unto.</p>
                           <p n="10">X. The Experiment about the <hi>Usefulness,</hi> yea, or <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And yet it was also found that once upon the touch of an innocent person, the like effect follow'd, which put the whole Court unto a stand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <p n="11">XI. However, to strengthen the Credit of what had been already produced against the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners. One <hi>Iohn Soam</hi> testify'd, That bringing home his Hay in three Carts, one of the Carts wrenched the Window of <hi>Rose Cullenders</hi> House, whereupon she flew out, with violent Threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings against the Deponent. The other two Carts, passed by twice, Loaded, that Day afterwards; but the Cart which touched <hi>Cullenders</hi> House, was twice or thrice that Day overturned. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving again Loaded it, as they brought it thro' the Gate which Leads out of the Field, the Cart stuck so fast in the Gates Head, that they could not possibly get it thro', but were forced to cut down the Post of the Gate, to make the Cart pass thro', altho' they could
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43586:63"/>
not perceive that the Cart did of either side touch the Gate-Post. They afterwards, did with much Difficulty get it home to the yard; but could not for their Lives get the Cart nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They were fain to unload at a great Distance; and when they were Tired, the Noses of them that came to Assist them, would burst forth a Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; so they were fain to give over till next morning: and then they unloaded without any Difficult.</p>

               <head>I. THE TRYAL of G. B. At a Court of <hi>Dyer and Terminer,</hi> Held in <hi>Salem.</hi> 1692.</head>
               <p>GLad should I have been, if I had never known the Name of this man; or never had this occasion to mention so much as the first Letters of his Name. But the Government requiring some Account, of his Trial, to be Inserted in this Book, it becomes me with all Obedience, to submit unto the Order.</p>
               <p n="1">I. This <hi>G. B.</hi> was Indicted for <hi>Witchcrafts;</hi> and in the Prosecution of the Charge against him, he was Accused by five or six of the Bewitched, as the Author of their Miseries; he was Accused by eight of the Confessing Witches, as being an Head Actor at some of their Hellish Randezvouzes, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43586:64"/>
one who had the promise of being a <hi>King</hi> in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Kingdom, now going to be Erected; he was Accused by nine persons, for extraordinary Lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and such Feats of Strength, as could not be done without a Diabolical Assistance. And for other such Things he was Accused, until about Thirty Testimonies were brought in against him; nor were these, judg'd the half of what might have been considered, for his Conviction: however they were enough to fix the Character of a <hi>Witch</hi> upon him, according to the Rules of Reasoning, by the Judicious <hi>Gaule,</hi> in that Case directed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Court being sensible, that the <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Parties Bewitched,</hi> use to have a Room a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Suspicions,</hi> or <hi>Presumptions,</hi> brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one Indicted for Witchcraft, there were now heard the Testimonies of several Persons, who were most notoriously Bewitched, and every day Tortured by Invisible Hands, and these now all charged the Spectres of <hi>G. B.</hi> to have a share in their Torments. At the Examination of this <hi>G. B.</hi> the Bewitched People were grievously harassed, with Preternatural Mischiefs, which could not possibly be Dissembled; and they still ascribed it unto the Endeavours of <hi>G. B.</hi> to kill them. And now upon his Trial, one of the Bewitched Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons testify'd, That in her Agonies, a little Black hair'd man came to her, saying his Name was B<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and bidding her set her hand unto a Book which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he show'd unto her; and bragging that he was a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43586:65"/>
                  <hi>Conjurer</hi> above the ordinary Rank of Witches; That he often persecuted her, with the offer of that Book, saying, <hi>She should be well, and need fear no body, if she would but Sign it:</hi> but he inflicted cruel Pains and Hures upon her, because of her Denying so to do. The Testimonies of the other Sufferers concurred with these; and it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that whereas <hi>Biting,</hi> was one of the ways which the Witches used, for the vexing of the Sufferers, when they cry'd out of G. B. biting them, the print of the Teeth, would be seen on the Flesh of the Complainers; and just such a sett of <hi>Teeth,</hi> as G. B'<hi>s</hi> would then appear upon them, which could be distinguished from those of some other mens. Others of them testify'd, That in their Torments, G. B. tempted them, to go unto a Sacrament, unto which they perceived him with a sound of Trumpet Summoning of other Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s; who quickly after the Sound would come from all Quarters unto the Rendezvouz. One of them falling into a kind of Trance, afterwards af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ed, That G. B. had carried her into a very high Mountain, where he show'd her mighty and glorious Kingdoms, and said, <hi>He would give them all to her, if she would write in his Book;</hi> but she told him, <hi>They were none of his to give;</hi> and refused the motions; enduring of much misery for that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal.</p>
               <p>It cost the Court a wonderful deal of Trouble, to hear the Testimonies of the Sufferers; for when they were going to give in their Depositions, they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43586:65"/>
would for a long while be taken with fitts, that made them uncapable of saying any thing. The Chief Judge asked the prisoner, who he thought hindred these witnesses from giving their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies? and he answered, <hi>He supposed, it was the Divel?</hi> That Honourable person, then reply'd, <hi>How comes the Divel so loathe to have any Testimony born against you?</hi> Which cast him into very great confusion.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It has been a frequent thing for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched people, to be entertained with Apparitions of <hi>Ghosts</hi> of murdered people, at the same time, that the <hi>Spectres</hi> of the witches trouble them. These Ghosts do always affright the Beholders, more than all the other spectral Representations; and when they exhibit themselves, they cry out, of being Murdered by the witchcrafts or other violences of the persons who are then in spectre present. It is further considerable, that once or twice, these <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions</hi> have been seen by others at the very same time that they have shown them selves to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched; &amp; seldom have there been these <hi>Apparitions</hi> but when somthing unusual &amp; suspected had attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Death of the party thus Appearing. Some that have bin accused by these <hi>Apparitions,</hi> accosting of the Bewitched People, who had never heard a word of any such persons, ever being in the world, have upon a fair examination freely, and fully, confessed the murders of those very persons, altho' these also did not know how the <hi>Apparitions</hi> had complained of them. Accordingly several of the Bewitched,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43586:66"/>
had given in their Testimony, that they had been troubled with the <hi>Apparitions</hi> of two women, who said, that they were <hi>G. Bs.</hi> two wives; and that he had been the Death of them; and that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates must be told of it, before whom if <hi>B.</hi> upon his trial deny'd it, they did not know but that they should appear again in the Court. Now, <hi>G. B.</hi> had been infamous for the Barbarous usage of his two successive <hi>wives,</hi> all the Country over. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over; It was testifi'd, the spectre of <hi>G. B.</hi> threatning of the sufferers told them, he had killed (besides others) Mrs <hi>Lawson</hi> and her Daughter <hi>Ann.</hi> And it was noted, That these were the vertuous wife and Daughter, of one at whom this <hi>G. B.</hi> might have a prejudice for his being serviceable at <hi>Salem-village,</hi> from whence himself had in Ill Terms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved some years before: &amp; that when they dy'd, which was long since, there were some odd circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances about them, which made some of the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents there suspect something of witchraft, tho' none Imagined from what Quarter it should come.</p>
               <p>Well, G. B. being now upon his Triall, one of the Bewitched persons was cast into Horror at the Ghosts of B's. two deceased wives, then appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him, and crying for, <hi>Vengeance,</hi> against him. Hereupon several of the Bewitched persons were successively called in, who all not knowing what the former had seen and said, concurred in their Horror, of the Apparition, which they affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that he had before him. But he, tho' much appalled, utterly deny'd that he discerned anything of it; nor was it any part of his <hi>Conviction.</hi>

IV Judicious Writers, have assigned it a great place, in the Conviction of <hi>witches, when persons are Impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by other Notorious witches, to be as Ill as themselves; especially, if the persons have been much noted for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Worship of God.</hi> Now, as there might have been Testimonies Enough of G. B's. Antipathy to <hi>Prayer</hi> and the other Ordinances of God, tho' by his profession singularly obliged thereunto; so, there now came in against the prisoner, the Testimonies of several persons, who confessed their own having been Horrible <hi>Witches,</hi> and ever since their confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had been themselves terribly Tortured by the Devils and other Witches, even like the other Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers; and therein undergone the pains of many <hi>Deaths</hi> for their Confessions.</p>
               <p>These now Testify'd, that <hi>G. B.</hi> had been at Witch-Meetings with them; and that he was the Person who had Seduced, and Compelled them into the snares of Witchcraft: That he promised them <hi>Fine Cloaths,</hi> for doing it; that he brought Poppets to them, and thorns to stick into those Poppets, for the afflicting of other People: And that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them, with the rest of the Crue, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch all <hi>Salem-Village,</hi> but besure to do it Gradually, if they would prevail in what they did.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>LancashireWitches</hi> were condemn'd, I don't Remember that there was any considerable further Evidence, than that of the Bewitched, and then that of some that confessed. We see so much already a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>G. B.</hi> But this being indeed not <hi>Enough,</hi> there
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43586:67"/>
were, other things to render what had been already produced <hi>credible.</hi>

B. that he had ensnared himself, by several Instances which he had formerly given of a Preternatural strength, and which were now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced against him. He was a very Puny man; yet he had often done things beyond the strength of a Giant. A Gun of about seven foot barrel, and so heavy that strong men could not steadily hold it out, with both hands; there were several Testimonies, given in by Persons of Credit and Honour, that he made nothing of taking up such a Gun behind the Lock, with but one hand, and holding it out like a Pistol, at Arms-end. G. B. in his Vindication was so foolish as to say, <hi>That an Indian was there, and held it out at the same time:</hi> Whereas, none of the Spectators ever saw any such <hi>Indian;</hi> but they suppos'd the <hi>Black man</hi> (as the Witches call the <hi>Devil;</hi> and they generally say he resembles an <hi>Indian)</hi> might give him that Assistence. There was Evidence, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, brought in, that he made nothing of Taking up whole Barrels fill'd with <hi>Malasses,</hi> or <hi>Cider,</hi> in very Disadvantagious Postures, and Carrying of

them through the Difficultest Places, out of a Canoo to the Shore.</p>
               <p>[Yea, there were Two Testimonies, that G.

Indeed one of these Witnesses, was over perswaded by some persons, to be out of the way, upon G. B. 's Trial; but he came afterwards, with sorrow for his withdraw, and gave in his Testimony: Nor were either of these Witnesses made use of as evidences in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>T'was testifyed, That keeping his two Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Wives in a strange kind of Slavery, he would when he came home from abroad, pretend to tell the Talk which any had with them.

of it. That he used all means to make his Wives Write, Sign, Seal, and Swear a Covenant, never to Reveal any of his Secrets. That his Wives had privately complained unto the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours about frightful Apparitions of EvilSpirits, with which their House was sometimes infested; and that many such things have been Whispered among the Neighbourhood.

What the Man's Name was?</hi> his countenance was much altered; nor could he say, who 'twas. But the Court began to think, that he then step'd aside, only that by the assistance of the <hi>Black Man,</hi> he might put on his <hi>Invisibility,</hi> and in that <hi>Fascinating Mist,</hi> gratify his own Jealous humour, to hear what they said of him. Which trick of rendring themselves <hi>Invisible,</hi> our Witches do in their confessions pretend that they sometimes are Masters of; and it it is the more credible, because there is Demonstration that they often render many other things utterly <hi>Invisible.</hi>
