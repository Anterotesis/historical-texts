            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the right Honorable Lord, <hi>Frauncis,</hi> Earle of Bedford, Knight of the noble order of the Garter, one of her Maiesties most honorable priuie Counsell, IOHN VDALL wisheth increase, and continuance of vertue and godlines.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE greatest difference that the Philosophers could finde (right Honorable) betweene man and beast, was the rule of reason, wherby they could perceiue that man could giue iudgement of things present and things past, and comparing them together, could (after a sort) prognosticate of things to come, which moued them according to theyr power and vnderstanding, to labour night and day in continuall meditation of the excellencie of the same, to seeke the adorning and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thereof, with all those things which brute beasts for lacke of reason coulde not haue: as namely, the continuall searching out of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:1410:3"/>
causes, the daily consideration of the effects, and operations of things in this world: and the particular qualities of euery seuerall beast, bird, fish, tree, herbe, worme, fruite, stone, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie other creature whatsoeuer. The benefite of whose dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce redoundeth euen to our great good, and consolation, as the Physitian verie well knoweth, and the diseased patient sensibly feeleth: yea, and (which more is) they stayed not themselues in this alone, but labouring still to beautifie that same diuine part of mans mind (I meane reason) they inuented another kynde of flower, whiche they called Morall Philosophie, wherewithall their meaning was, to haue the effects of reason rightly ruled, to shine foorth most brightly in euery particular action of mans life, putting all their contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations by this meanes, in assiduall and dayly practise: wherein, how excellent they were, and how forcibly they vsed it in their conuersation, and also how equally it directed all their deedes by iustice and equitie, their owne writings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining yet, and their notable acts recorded in histories, do better &amp; more plentifully declare, then either I can, or my present purpose may suffer me. Onely thus much is to be saide, that their vertues were so excellent, that we aime stil at them, and their common wealths so well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that we make them our continuall plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme &amp; patterne: and the nearer we come vnto diuers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the better we thinke our gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment established. Now it is not vnknowne vnto your honor, nor to any other that haue the true feeling of Gods grace working in their hearts,
<pb facs="tcp:1410:3"/>
and the Sunne of righteousnes shining in theyr consciences: that the Lord our God, the creator of all things, our redeemer, preseruer and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, hath giuen vnto vs not only the knowledge of all these things (in some measure) which they had in great aboundance, but (which more is) a farre surpassing and more excellent difference, to seuer vs withall from the rest of his creatures, then euer they had, or once thought of, to wit, the knowledge of his loue and fauour towards vs in his Sonne Iesus Christ. For albeit it be true that reason is the essentiall and formall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as they call it, betweene man and beast, yet we see euen in them some sparke, and as it were, some speciall kind of reason: for to try the same in particular effects, we see that a Dog can discerne his maister from another man, yea, though he be twenty yeares from him, if it be true that Homer reporteth of Vlisses his dog,<note place="margin">Odiss. 17.</note> &amp; him that vseth to hurt him he can shun, and can fawne on him that cherisheth him. The bird also can foretell whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> raine wil fall. The Emit in the time of sommer, maketh prouision for winter. Many there be, such like as these which we reade of in Pliny &amp; Aristotle, writing of the nature of beasts, and whiche by our owne experience we daily see. But this is so farre from seeming to be reuealed to any other creature, that it is a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and a strange thing to many of vs, that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bruite beasts by reason, &amp; therfore which is the drift of this whole discourse, it standeth vs vpon which professe the name of Iesus Christ, which do acknowledge him to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God the Father, and sealed vnto vs by God the holy

Ghost, for our eternall saluation: to haue an especiall care, that as Christ sayth of the wicked, (that they be wiser in their generation, then the children of light) so it be not sayde of vs,<note place="margin">Luke. 16, 8.</note> that the Paganes, Heathen, and Gentile Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, be not found in the sight of God more diligent in their humane profession, then we in the profession of Iesus Christ: I meane more glorious in shewing foorth the fruite of their Philosophy in their actions, then we of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie in our life and conuersation. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I would to God that we could truly and rightly follow their steps in one thing, which is this: I reade of them that the more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they obteined in their Philosophy, the more they abandoned themselues from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the world, so that one casteth his gold into the sea,<note place="margin">Crates.</note> another carried all his substance with him wheresoeuer he went: another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himselfe with a tub or tunne to dwell in,<note place="margin">Bias.</note> in steede of his house:<note place="margin">Diogenes.</note> all of them whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they possessed, they did willingly employ it to the encrease of knowledge in themselues and others. But do we so? no. We seeke how to serue God and Mammon too:<note place="margin">Matth. 6, 24.</note> we labour to become religious in shewe, and couetous in deede: We desire to come to Christ by night with Nicodemus,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3, 4.</note> for feare of worldly losses, we seeke to crie Lord, Lord, but we haue no care to do the works of the Lord.<note place="margin">Matth. 7, 21. 2. Tim 3, 5. Matth. 20, 22.</note> We make a shewe of godlinesse, but we denie the power thereof: we wish to sit at the right and left hand of Iesus in his kingdome, but we are loth to drinke of his cup. (All in one word) We professe Iesus
<pb facs="tcp:1410:4"/>
Christ,<note place="margin">Iude verse. 4.</note> but turne the grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse. Hence it is that wickednesse doth so abound, that Sathan hath preuailed so much, and that so few endeuour a godly life: euen for that the enemie can perswade them that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion will serue, that a shewe is sufficient. But howsoeuer it be, that so many be drunke with this cup of Sathans poison, against whome in truth, the Heathen Philosophers that neuer knew God, shall rise in the day of iudgement and condemne them, for that they haue beene more carefull to shew the fruite of their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in vpright dealing (though it was in vaine) then these haue bene, yet it behoueth all them that see these things, and are greeued with the consideration thereof, and are not spotted with the same brand, to be so much the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as the euill is common, that they smell not of their abhomination, that they depart from them,<note place="margin">Reuel. 18, 4.</note> and be not partakers of their sinnes, that they hate the garment spotted by the flesh, that they fashion not themselues like vnto thys world,<note place="margin">Iude verse. 2, 3. Rom. 12, 2.</note> but that they be changed in their shape, by the renewing of their mindes, and that thereby their profession may be adorned,<note place="margin">Tit. 2, 10.</note> and the truth thereof in their hearts and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces forceablie established. When I considered these things (right Honorable) and sought out of Gods booke (which is the looking glasse discouering all enormities) wherein the chiefe cause heereof should consist: I perceyued (so farre as my small knowledge could atteyne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) that the lacke of the right vse of Gods word, and heedefull care to be gouerned by the
<pb facs="tcp:1410:5"/>
same, did ingender these, and infinite other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations: and therefore for mine owne comfort, and the instruction of others, I dyd make choyse of the history of Peters denying of Christ to entreate vpon: which being ended, for certayne considerations heereafter mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I haue so neere as I could, penned it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it was spoken: Most humblie beseeching your Honour, that the same may proceede vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wings of your defence and protection, which I doubt not shall be by that meanes of the godly sort, the better accepted, and of the cankered caterpiller the lesse touched, so shall I be bound (which notwithstanding is my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) to pray vnto the Lord God of heauen, for the encrease and continuance of the graces of his holie spirit vnto your honour, to guide and direct the same in all your good and godly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises whatsoeuer, that thereby Gods holie name heere vpon earth may be glorified, hys children mainteined and cherished, sinne and iniquitie cut downe and quenched, Iesus Christ his Gospell promoted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced, and your owne conscience vnfaynedly comforted.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there is nothing set</hi> downe in the worde of God, which is not in his singular wisedome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, either to teache them the will of the Lord,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 16.</note> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that they must professe, or to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them with sufficient armour, to conuince their aduersaries, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them how to frame their liues and conuersation according to hys will, or to reproue them that walke inordinately, or lastly, to comforte them being distressed and afflicted in this world:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 15, 4.</note> so there is no example set before our eyes, in the whole booke of God, more necessary for vs continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be meditated vpon, then this of <hi>Peters</hi> fall. For in the same, is firste painted out vnto vs, the miserable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
<pb facs="tcp:1410:10"/>
of man, being left vnto himselfe: then the excéeding mercie of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man. Secondly we may sée in it the beginnings, procéedings, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how all men doo sinne, whether it be the godly falling by infirmitie, or the wicked transgressing thorough infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and then how and by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées the godly be reclaimed and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe. So that in this historie we haue two things offered to our conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. First, <hi>Peters</hi> fall. Secondly, his rising againe. In his fall we note the causes that mooued him therevnto, and the maner how it was. The causes be either in himselfe, or accidentarie without himselfe: within himselfe, his presumption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in departing from the word of God, and leaning vppon his owne power, and his slowe following: the causes without himself be his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, the high Priests seruants, and the place where he was, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warme fire. The maner how he did fall, is first in bare deniall: then with binding it with an oth: and lastly, by curssing himselfe if euer he knew Christ. In his rising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb facs="tcp:1410:10"/>
are likewise the causes and the maner how: the causes without himself and within himselfe: without himselfe, the crowing of the Cocke, &amp; the looking back of Iesus: within himselfe, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance what Christ had said, and what he had done, the manner how he rise, his going out, and his sorrowing.</p>
            <p>The firste cause of his fall (as you sée) was his presumption, and that is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> also in two things. The first is, in not leaning vnto the wordes of his Lorde and maister. For Christ told him that he should denie him. But he notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing being either blinded with the consideration of his owne power, (as hereafter shall appeare) or else carried away with a preposterous zeale to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him whether soeuer he went, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that though all men should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake him, yet he would not. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is most worthy the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if we beginne at the first man that euer was, and continue thorough out the whole scriptures, we shal finde that the little regarde giuen vnto the worde of God was the beginning of
<pb facs="tcp:1410:11"/>
their fall.</p>
            <p>The father of mankinde, the firste founder of his misterie <hi>Adam,</hi> hauing receiued this especiall commandement (of the trée of knowledge of good and euill,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2, 17.</note> thou shalt not eate.) Yet this bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put out of his heart, partly thorough the subtiltie of Sathan (wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he was assayled) partly by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of the woman (whome great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he loued) and partly with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and delicacie of the Apple (with whiche he was allured:) He notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing did take of it, and eating of the trée forbidden, fell from the Lorde his God, and was cast out of that place of pleasure,<note place="margin">3.23.</note> where before he dwelled. So did <hi>Caine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4.8.</note> forgetting the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, yea and the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, kill his brother <hi>Abell.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.24.</note>
               <hi>Lamech</hi> not considering that the Lord God had made man and woman to bée one flesh,<note place="margin">4.19.</note> tooke vnto him two wiues, and so fell from the Lorde. <hi>Saule</hi> hauing recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a precept to destroy <hi>Amalecke,</hi> and all that pertayned vnto them,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15, 3.</note> that he should haue no compassion on them,
<pb facs="tcp:1410:11"/>
but shoulde slaie both man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, both infant and suckling, both Oxen and Shéepe, and Camels, and Asses: yet directing not hys dooings according to hys commission, but yéelding vnto hys owne fantasie, in sparing the King <hi>Agag,</hi> and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Shéepe, and fat Oxen to sacrifice, (as was pretended) vnto the Lorde, was rewarded with depriuation from his Kingdome. The lyke may be said of the rebellious <hi>Israelites</hi> in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exo.</hi> 16, 2.17, 3.</note> (who hauing the promise of Gods speciall protection) yet murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red often times. The same is playne in the rebellious <hi>Iewes</hi> in the tyme of the Prophetes, and brieflie thorough out the whole booke of God: that when soeuer the Prophetes be resisted, the Apostles persecuted, or any other sinne whatsoeuer committed: whether it be of the godlie falling by infirmitie, or by the wicked offending of obstinacie. The first originall and beginning is this, that the worde of the Lorde in that respecte, is eyther not knowen, or not remembred, and therefore Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
<pb facs="tcp:1410:12"/>
strooke verie déepe, and in verie déede, at the surest roote of mans safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, when he put it into the head of his sonne and heire Antichrist, the childe of perdition (the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>) to keepe the people from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods word, for he knew well ynough, that the worde of God béeing manifest vnto all the world, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumente to kéepe man from grosse sinnes, for verie shame and feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and many in faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto the Lord for loue, and zeale vnto his glory, and desire of their owne saluation, whiche otherwise shoulde wander in darkenesse, and in the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of death: because that they bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blinde for want of knowledge, should haue swallowed many moates of iniquitie: but to let him goe, and come nearer vnto our selues: what is the cause that euen in this light, and glorious Sunne beames of Christ his Gospell, so many be so softed and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in idolatrie and superstition, that they are not ashamed with whorishe faces, not blushing to maintaine, and
<pb facs="tcp:1410:12"/>
defend the heathenish fashion of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of God in Images (for theyr owne shame hath fomed out the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of the Image it selfe) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that the seconde Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is blotted out of theyr heart,<note place="margin">

For GOD pronounceth them that

The whoremaister goeth on in his filthines, because he forgetteth the commaundement of God: Thou shalt not commit adulterie, and the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: that whoremongers, and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, God will iudge.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb</hi> 13, 4.</note> To conclude the like is truly to be thought of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sinnes, that the casting off the worde of God behinde their backs, and treading (Gods vengeance threatned against sinne) vnder theyr féete, is the first step vnto that iniquitie whiche they commit. Nowe if we will applie this to our edification and benefite, we must learne by the harmes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, to be more warie and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspecte: If we sée that others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their transgressions, by neglecting the word of God, that we must begin our obedience in imbracing it, in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

<pb facs="tcp:1410:17"/>
humilitie of Spirit, let vs marke what reasons the holye Ghoste vseth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade vs therevnto. They bée especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally two most forcible and strong. The firste is the consideration of our estate by nature: as namely the mettal where of wée bée made. It is not only Earth, whych we dayly treade vnder our féete, but euen the very duste and slime of the Earth:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2, 7.</note> we are robbed and vtterly spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of all our good gyftes whatsoeuer, and so lye wallowyng in the myre of Sinne.

                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 14, 3. <hi>Iob.</hi> 7, 1.</note> no not one: our condition in thys worlde is moste miserable. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall warrefare: our age is as the lengthe of a spanne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 39, 5, 6.</note> our substaunce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining we knowe not to whome, and whiche of all other is moste miserable after thys lyfe (not called to grace in this Pilgrimage) the praye of Sathan, the firebrande of Hell. So that the ryghte and due consideration of thys, is able for to pull downe the stouteste Champion in the worlde, and to
<pb facs="tcp:1410:18"/>
consume all the figge leaues of vanity, and pryde of mans hearte whatsoeuer. And indeede it is moste effectuall in the Children of God.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 18, 27.</note> It mooued <hi>Abraham</hi> to terme hym selfe duste and ashes. It made <hi>Moyses</hi> saye,<note place="margin">

So then if they beyng mooued wyth the consideration of theyr naturall estate, haue thus pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed theyr time with all humilitie: much more it is our dutye so to doe, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng that our infirmities be many mo than theirs, whiche ought to abase vs lower than they. A seconde argument: the Spirite of God vseth in the whole Scriptures to mooue all men to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and that is thys: to consider whence they haue that good thyng whyche they possesse, whither it be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, honour, pleasure, lyfe, or whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it is, all commeth from the Lorde. And therefore no man may arrogate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
<pb facs="tcp:1410:18"/>
thyng vnto hym selfe in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte of them. Whiche reason the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paule</hi> vseth in expresse wordes, to beate downe the pryde of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</note> saying: what haste thou y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thou haste not receyued: if thou hast recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it, why reioycest thou as thoughe thou haste not receyued it. So then this argument ought to bée in force wyth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye one of vs. For if thou be rych, who dyd giue it vnto thée:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.21.</note> The Lord giueth and is able to take awaye. If thou bee in estimation in the worlde:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.7.</note> The Lorde setteth vp and pulleth downe:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.3.</note> If thou haste cunning or skill in anye thyng whatsoeuer: And if thou arte come to the knowledge of Gods worde and faith in Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.8.</note> It is the gift of GOD, and not of thy selfe. So that in all thynges whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, thou art to humble thy self, know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing this, that thou hast nothing of thy selfe but a lumpe of Sinne. And if god hath bestowed his giftes vppon thée in greater measure than vpon others thy Brethren, that are as déere vnto hym, as thou arte, thou hast no iuste occasion
<pb facs="tcp:1410:19"/>
to be puffed vp therewithal: but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwyse. For if thou be the steward of much, thine account shall be for muche: if thou hast fiue Tallents the Lord wil look for the increase of fine: If thou hast more riches than others, it is bestowed vpon thée,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat,</hi> 25.20</note> that thou maiest relieue and succoure those that want. Not to lay vp in store for thy selfe for many yeares: or to bestowe it in excesse of pride or ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting.<note place="margin">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd a certaine maid, &amp;c.</hi> We haue séene the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of his fall, and howe by degrées he commeth to the fall it selfe. For when once he had reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gods word, &amp; was puffed vp in the perswasion of his owne power, set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the wycked, and swadled in the warmth of prosperitye, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth now for <hi>Peter,</hi> but euen at al assaies, and by euerye light occasion to denye his profession and forsweare hys maister. And in trueth, the first assaulte was not strong: for it was but a
<pb facs="tcp:1410:31"/>
woman, a party very weak. But indéed if she be bent to trouble Gods children, very ready to compasse hir matters. As we may sée in <hi>Iesabell, Herodias, Irene</hi> the Empresse and such like, marke this well: The highe Prieste persecuteth Christ, his seruauntes apprehende him and bring him to their Maister, yea and his maide also helpeth the matter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde. Here we may sée the patron of a familie rightly disposed in his kind, as is the maister, so be his seruantes. All a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée in this to persecute Christ: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede it hath béene, is, and euer will bée, that the wicked housholders, yea the wicked Kinges haue had generally all their seruants and subiects of their own disposition. <hi>Ahab</hi> being a wicked Kyng, they did so generally follow him, that <hi>Eliah</hi> thought onely himselfe to serue God,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 19, 10.</note> and all the rest of the land to haue followed <hi>Baall.</hi> So it was likewise in all the time of the wicked <hi>Kinges,</hi> and so it is in all wicked housholders. For if he be a Papist, hys Seruantes be so, or else they abide not wyth him long. If he be a <hi>Neuter</hi> and care for no religion,
<pb facs="tcp:1410:31"/>
his seruantes are not kept in order, and so they likewise become of the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: so that the saying of <hi>Salomon</hi> is verified in this case,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pro,</hi> 29, 12.</note> if the Prince be giuen to lyes, all his seruants are wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. And what haue we to learne by thys? Surely a profitable doctrine for al them that haue gouernement of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that they fearing God and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his Gospell, beware that the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world be not wiser in their generation than they:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke.</hi> 16, 8.</note> that is, that the wicked bée not founde more carefull to dispose their families to their owne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, than the Godly bée. And I knowe not howe they can looke vnto thys bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but by following the example of <hi>Dauid</hi> in choosing Seruauntes, and of <hi>Abraham</hi> in teaching them. For the prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> knowing that he should bée King, casteth in his mynde a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hande, what kynde of persons he wil retaine into his seruice. Myne eyes (saythe he) shall bée vnto the faythful of the Land,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 101, 6.7.</note> that they may dwell with me. He that walketh in a perfecte waye, he shall serue me. There shall
<pb facs="tcp:1410:32"/>
no deceitfull man dwell in my house, he that telleth lies shall not remaine in my sight. Thus we see what kinde of persons <hi>Dauid</hi> will haue. This ought duely to be looked vnto of all them that doe professe the same God that he did: but we shall sée it farre otherwise in the moste, for so that he may serue his turne for that purpose, wherevnto he will allot him, It is not regarded whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he bée Papist or Atheist, godlye or faythlesse, whither his Religion be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward GOD or the diuell. But <hi>Dauid</hi> had this consideration in hys mynde, that none could do him faithfull seruice sauing they onely whose heartes were true to the Lord, which is a thing most sure. For well he may doo his duty for a time in hys calling, but surely he will at length play the slipperye marchaunt wyth thée in one thyng or other. Now to <hi>Abraham</hi> whome we must follow in instructing of our Seruauntes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 17, 13.</note> who at the commaundement of God, did cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise all the men children in hys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, they were (no doubt of it) wel in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>structed in the Religion of the Lorde,
<pb facs="tcp:1410:32"/>
that obeyed therevnto so willynglye without any resistaunce. And therefore it is, that the Lorde maketh this especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reason, why he should shewe the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment intended agaynste <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.,</hi> 8, 19.</note> because he knew that <hi>Abraham</hi> would commande his sonnes and his housholde after him, that they kéepe the waye of the Lorde. So that the thing whych we are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe in <hi>Abraham</hi> is this: that euerye householder be diligent to teach his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants their duties out of Gods worde, and trayne them vp in the feare of the Lord. It is a thing worthy to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that we finde diuers families in the scriptures conuerted vnto the Lord with their maisters, as namely the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and the Jailer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 16, 32, 10.2</note> to shewe vnto vs, that all the Seruauntes ought to bée taught the way of the Lord, as well as their Maisters. Well notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it was but a simple Gyrle: yet <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> flatly saith, I knewe not the man. <hi>Peter</hi> had not such a politicke heade as the denyers nowe a dayes haue: Those I meane, that in harte and déede deny
<pb facs="tcp:1410:33"/>
Christ, but in worde deny him not. For if you come to hym that is greatlye sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of Poperye, and knowne to haue béene of that stampe, if he bée a formal fellow, suche a one as will not stande to the daunger of professing the same, and tell hym that he is verily a Papist, for he hathe beene séene at Masse, and his déedes and other dealings bewray him: he will not say I knowe not the Pope, I neuer came in company wyth masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, but his answere will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be thus: Sure I must confesse I haue in my tyme leaned that waye, but I am not nowe of that mynde: I haue reneued my copie (onely because of his newe Landlord) and my opinion is altered: And so he being an <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micke,</hi> rather than a sure beléeuer, maketh Religion to bée but an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. O <hi>Peter</hi> thou lackest thys subtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for thou mightest with this haue stopped the Damosels mouthe at the first, thou myghtest haue sayde: Surely I confesse I did followe thys fellowe, because I had some pleasure in hys wonders that he dyd: But nowe I
<pb facs="tcp:1410:33"/>
holde wyth the Scribes and Pharisies, and doe beléeue the Lawe of <hi>Moyses.</hi> But subteltie had not entered so farre into the Church of GOD as nowe it hathe: the vaile of Hipocrisie was not so close as in these dayes it is. And truely that kynde of people is nowe the rifest, and yet the woorste of all other. For <hi>Dauid</hi> had manye greate iniuries done vnto hym: but that whych his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended friend did, was the greatest grief of all, in so muche that he saithe: if it had béen his enimie, he could haue born it. But it was euen he with whome he had singular consultations in the word of GOD.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 56, 12,</note> And therfore if <hi>Dauid</hi> were so troubled with suche, then we haue greately to looke vnto our selues, and to auoide them as néere as we may. For most certayne it is, that the Churche of God hathe not at this day a greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie than they that bee nourished, kepte, fostered and promoted in hyr owne lappe, that through pretence of Religion, become euen betraiers of Christ, and hinderers of the procedings
<pb facs="tcp:1410:34"/>
of his gospel. And sure it is to be wished that all men woulde boldelye professe that which in hart they embrace: that the one partie might be vtterly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For he that with a Papist is a Papist, with a professour is a professor, lyke the weathercocke turning wyth the wynde: an vnconstant Camelion, euery where and no where, is the sorest enimie to Religion, and therefore guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of no small punishment. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God sayth thus of suche, I knowe thy workes, thou arte neyther hoat nor nor colde:<note place="margin">

               <hi>He denied before them al, &amp;c.</hi> Now the holy Ghoste setteth downe the parties, before whom he denied: namely, before
<pb facs="tcp:1410:34"/>
them all: which circumstance aggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth greatly the sinne of <hi>Peter.</hi> For he had heard his Mayster teache thys les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. That whosoeuer shoulde deny him before men,<note place="margin">

Thys ought to mooue vs to labour in the worde, and prayer most earnestlye. that our confession and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of Fayth may bée constant and surely grounded, that we neuer deny our Sauiour before anye man: For denying hym before weake beléeuers, (besides that we procure Christ to deny vs before God) we doe as muche as in vs lyeth, to ouerthrowe so many soules into Hell. And if it bée before the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked whiche be the enimies of God, and his trueth, we doo set open the window to their blasphemye, and so we bée the meanes whereby the worde of God is euill spoken off.

               <hi>Peter remembred, &amp;c.</hi> Now followe the causes within himselfe, but marke this first, the Cocke did crow, no doubt of it, more did heare him then <hi>Peter</hi>: but because he was ordeyned as a meanes to call <hi>Peter</hi> home, therefore he only being guilty, was pricked in heart, and none else moued. So God hath ordeyned the Preaching of hys worde to be an instrument to put all men in minde of their faults, and that they mighte amend. And such is the force thereof, that the worde preached generally, doth mooue euery mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science which is guiltie of that crime, whiche is reprooued. And therefore there be manie wicked men of the worlde, that doo imagine the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher to harpe onely vppon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they be guiltie: as if he speake against Papistrie, euerie massemonger

And in déede (though they turne it to a fault in the Preacher) this shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto vs the wonderfull vertue of Gods word, that can speake so to euery mans heart and thought. Therefore when thou hearest thy owne faults re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked, &amp; euen that which thou though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test all the world had not knowen, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly reuealed: doo not thinke that he speaketh it of choller, or hath learned it of thy trustie familiars, but thinke rather that Gods spirite whiche sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth all mens thoughtes, doth speake vnto thée, that thou shouldest amende it. For as <hi>Peter</hi> béeing guiltie alone, was onely pricked in conscience and did repent, so it is thy duetie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider thy owne estate, and repent thée of thy fault, that God may be mercifull vnto thée.</p>

And tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly this is a thing very méete, that al the children of god doo not only forsake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">

If then thou hast béene familiar with mockers &amp; deriders of gods worde and his ministers, and desirest to frame thy self from that vice, and determinest with thy self to leaue it, sée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou shake off the society of deriders.

                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 6, 5.</note> because so often as we sin, we depart from God, walking after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of our own flesh: this turning must begin at the hart: for the thoughtes of mans hart are altogither wicked natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> turning vnto god must begin at the renuing of the same: so com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandeth the Lorde by the Prophet say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:<note place="margin">

            <p>The feare of this maketh vs to séeke what waye to haue Gods wrath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed agaynste vs, which is onely done by Fayth in Iesus Christe, who came into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world for that purpose, that he might be a mediator and reconciler of sinners vnto God his Father: so that euery one that shall come to the fauour of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, must certainly and stedfastly with out wauering beléeue, that Christ his bloud hath béene shed for the satisfaction of Gods wrath agaynste hym for hys sins.

not so. Therefore it is said, that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance consisteth in the mortifying of the fleshe, and quickening of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: that is, in crucifying and killing within himselfe the world and flesh, to wit, all sinne whatsoeuer, and the quickening of the spirite,<note place="margin">

And because this can not be done perfectly, no not in the best, by reason of sin and iniquitie, that cleaueth so fast vnto them, therefore they thinke it their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so long as they carrie about with them this bodie of sinne, to grone vnder the burthen thereof and to vse all those meanes that God hath set downe for them in his word: to continue and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in repentance and amendment of life without ceassing, that Gods holie name may be glorified, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences surely setled in the mercies of the Lorde, and sinne daily more and more abolished, the whiche the Lorde God of his infinite mercie graunt vnto all them that earnestly séeke and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for it, <hi>Amen.</hi>
