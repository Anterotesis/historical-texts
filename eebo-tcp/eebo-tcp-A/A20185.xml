            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I doubt not, but am verily perſwaded, that this Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Prayer, which our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus taught his diſciples; penned by one that hath ſo well deſerued of the Church of God; by publiſhing ſo many good &amp; profitable Treatiſes, ſhal finde ſome

For what wilt thou doe, either for all the benefits that thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, or for thoſe things that are required for thy vſe, or to preuent any dangers, that may be feared? I ſay, what wilt thou doe, if thou wilt not imitate the holy Prophet, and call vpon the name of the Lord? and how canſt thou better call vpon it, then as the Lord hath appointed? and what profit ſhalt thou haue by calling vpon him after that manner, except thou knoweſt the meaning of the ſpirit, in thoſe words which thou poureſt out before him?

the <hi>holy one of God</hi> hath giuen thee in charge, <hi>after this manner, pray ye;</hi> this ſeruant of God ſhall ſo inſtruct thee, that according to the practiſe of the holy Apoſtle, thou ſhalt <hi>pray with the ſpirit, &amp; with vnderſtanding alſo,</hi> and this <hi>one thing is neceſſary</hi>: For all the commandements of the Lord, are ſo full of counſell, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie word hath his weight, yea euery ſillable containes a ſecret, ſo that we may all ſay with the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>How can I vnderstand, except ſome man ſhould guide me</hi>?

                  <p>True it is, that in S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſenſe, God tempteth no man, that is, moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no man to ſinne, but as hée ſayth, euery man when hée is tempted is led away, and ſnared of his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence.</p>
                  <p>Gods tempting of men, is after two ſorts, reſpecting the praiſe of his iuſtice, and the prayſe of his mercy.</p>
                  <p>Touching the firſt, he doth ſomtimes, for former euils, throw vs to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, yet hée is not the author of euill when after this ſort hée leadeth vs into temtation, for he doth it iuſtly for ſome
<pb facs="tcp:13928:39"/>
notable euill which he ſéeth in vs.</p>
                  <p>Touching the ſecond, he tempteth vs for the prayſe of his mercy, when he tryeth and prooueth vs by corrections and chaſtiſements, as pouertie, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, contempt, afflictions, &amp;c. In which reſpect,<note place="margin">

                     </hi> and S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation: for after he is tried, he ſhall receiue the crowne of life, which God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them that loue him, Iames</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>In this ſence <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> were tempted, that is, tryed.</p>
                  <p>Then we ſée how God tempteth after one ſort, &amp; Sathan after another. God for our good, by humbling and trying of vs. The Diuell for our hurt and vtter deſtruction. Therefore, though God lead men into temptation, yet is he not the author of euill.</p>
                  <p>There be foure reſpects, in which God may be a worker in temptations, and yet frée from ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he tempteth by offering occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and obiects, to trie whether a man will ſinne or not, as a maſter that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:13928:39"/>
a purſe of money in his ſeruants way, which he ſuſpecteth. This triall is no ſinne in the Maiſter, though the ſeruant ſinne in ſtealing: <hi>Thou ſhalt not hearken vnto the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or dreamer of dreames, for the LORD thy GOD prooueth thee, whether thou loue the LORD thy GOD with all thy heart, Deut.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God leadeth into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by withdrawing of his grace: neither can this be a ſinne in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is bound to no man to giue him grace, and here is a difference betwéen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the tempting of God, and of Sathan: God holds backe grace when he temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, the Diuell ſuggeſts euill motions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, euery action, ſo farre forth as it is an action, is good, and of GOD, for in him we liue, mooue, and haue our being: Therefore God is a worker in temptations, ſo farre foorth as they are actions. One man kils another, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moouing of the body in the doing of this villany is of God, but the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the action, is from man and the Diuell: a man rideth vpon a lame horſe

                  <p>The fourth way, is in regard o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the end, for God tempts his ſeruants to correct and humble them for their ſinnes, to trie their patience, faith, and loue, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Theſe wordes therefore, as hath béene ſayd, are an explanation of the former, for when a man is deliuered from euill, he is not led into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the cauſe being taken away, the

                  <p>The ſumme of all, is this, that for as much as we are by nature ſo féeble and weake, that we are not able of our ſelues to ſtand one minute of an houre againſt our ſpirituall enemies, that therefore God would vphold vs, and ſtrengthen vs by the power of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that wée faint not in this ſpirituall combat: therefore our Sauiour ſayth, <hi>Watch and pray, that you enter not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to temptation: for the Spirit is willing, but the Fleſh is weake.</hi>
