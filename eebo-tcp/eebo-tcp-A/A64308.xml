            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have often complained, that so anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and noble a Nation as ours, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
by the Fame of their Arms and
Exploits abroad, so applauded and envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for their wise and happy Institutions
at home, so flourishing in Arts and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and so adorned by excellent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in other Kinds, should not yet have
produced one good or approved general
History of <hi>England.</hi> That of <hi>France</hi>
has been composed with great Industry,
by <hi>des Serres,</hi> with Iudgment and
Candor by <hi>Mezeray.</hi> That of <hi>Spain</hi>
with great Diligence and eloquent Stile,
by <hi>Mariana.</hi> That of the Empire,
with much Pains and good Order, as
<pb facs="tcp:49830:3"/>
well as Learning, by <hi>Pedro de Mexia,</hi>
but ours have been written by such mean
and vulgar Authors, so tedious in their
Relations, or rather Collections, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious
in the Choice of what was fit
to be told or to be let alone, with so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Order, and in so wretched a Style;
that as it is a Shame to be ignorant in
the Affairs of our own Country, so 'tis
hardly worth the Time or Pains to be
informed, since for that End a Man
must read over a Library rather than a
Book, and after all, must be content to
forget more than he remembers.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, some Parcels or short Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
of our History have been left us
by Persons of great Worth and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
much honoured or esteemed in
their Times; as, Part of <hi>Edward</hi>
the fourth and <hi>Richard</hi> the third by
Sir <hi>Thomas Moor; Henry</hi> the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
by Sir <hi>Francis Bacon; Henry</hi>
the eighth by the Lord <hi>Herbert; Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49830:3"/>
the sixth by Sir <hi>John Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood;</hi>
and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by Mr.
<hi>Camden.</hi> There are besides these,
many voluminous Authors of ancient
Times, in <hi>Latin,</hi> and of modern in
<hi>English,</hi> with some Forreigners, as
<hi>Froissart</hi> and <hi>Polidore Virgil;</hi> out
of all which might be framed a full and
just Body of our general History, if col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
with Pains and Care, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
with good Order; for the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
is only wanting, and not the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
for such a Building.</p>
            <p>I will confess, I had it in my
Thoughts at one Time of my Life, and
the most proper for such a Work, to
make an Abridgment of our <hi>English</hi>
Story, having observed that <hi>Meze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi>'s
<hi>Abrege</hi> of his own, was more
esteemed, and much more read than
his larger Volume; but those Thoughts
were soon diverted by other Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherein I had the Hopes, as
<pb facs="tcp:49830:4"/>
well as the Intentions of doing some
greater Sevices to my Country. I have
since endeavoured to engage some of my
Friends in the same Design, whom I
thought capable of atchieving it, but
have not prevailed; some pretending
Modesty, and others too much valuing
Ease.</p>
            <p>Therefore to invite and encourage
some worthy Spirit, and true Lover of
our Country to pursue this Attempt; I
have consented to the publishing of this
Introduction to the History of <hi>England,</hi>
wherein I have traced a short Account
of this Island, the Names, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
and Constitutions thereof, from
the first Originals, as far as I could
find any Ground of probable Story, or
of fair Conjecture, since Philosophers
tell us, that none can be said to know
things well, who does not know them in
their Beginnings. I have further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
it, through the great and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
<pb facs="tcp:49830:4"/>
Changes of Names, People,
Customs, and Laws that passed here,
until the End of the first <hi>Norman</hi>
Reign, which made the last and great
Period of this Kingdom, leaving the
Successions and Constitutions since that
Time, so fixed and Established as to
have lasted for the Space of above six
hundred Years, withont any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Alteration from so long a Course
of Time, or such Variety of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
as have since arrived in the
World.</p>
            <p>I have hereby beaten through all the
rough and dark Ways of this Iourney,
the rest lies fair and easie through a
plain and open Country, and I should
think my self happy to see it well pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
by some abler Hand, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of our Nation, and the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of our own as well as forreign
Readers, who shall be curious to know
<pb facs="tcp:49830:5"/>
our Story. I wish it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with the same good Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and with much better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
than this small Endeavour of
mine.</p>

            <head>AN
INTRODUCTION
TO THE
HISTORY
OF
ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>BRitain</hi> was by the Ancients
accounted the greatest I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland
of the known World,
and for ought is yet certain, may
be so still, notwithstanding the
later Discoveries of <hi>Madagascar</hi> and
<hi>Iapan,</hi> which are by some brought
into Competition. It extends from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49830:6"/>
North to South about ten Degrees,
and about two hundred Miles in
the Breadth of its most extended
Angles. It was anciently called
<hi>Albion,</hi> which seems to have been
softned from <hi>Alpion,</hi> the word <hi>Alp</hi>
in some of the Original Western
Languages, signifying generally
very high Lands or Hills, as this
Isle appears to those who approach
it from the Continent. But of
those Times there is no Certainty
remains in Story, more than that
it was so called, and very little
known to the rest of the World.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Romans,</hi> and some time
before <hi>Cesar,</hi> it was called <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi>
concerning which Name very
much Debate, and no Agreement
has been among the modern Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of our Country, or of others.
After raking into all the Rubbish
of those Authors; That which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49830:6"/>
seems to me most probable, is, that
the Strangers who came over into
this Island upon the score of Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,
from the Coasts of <hi>Gaul</hi> or
<hi>Germany,</hi> called the Inhabitants by
one common Name of <hi>Briths,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them from the Custom among
them of painting their naked Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and small Shields with an azure
Blew, which by them was called
<hi>Brith,</hi> and distinguish'd them from
Strangers who came among them:
From this Name of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
the <hi>Romans</hi> upon their Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Conquests, and Colonies
establish'd in <hi>Gaul,</hi> which brought
them first acquainted with this
Island, called it <hi>Britannia,</hi> by giving
a Latin termination to a barbarous
Name, and the same which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to have been usual with them,
by the Appellations of many other
Countries, that fell under their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49830:7"/>
Commerce or Conquests, as <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania,
Lusitania, Aquitania,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
others commonly known.
The curious may observe this Care
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in giving their own
Terminations to many barbarous
Countries, and forming easie and
pleasant Sounds out of the harshest,
and most offensive, to such elegant
Tongues and Ears as theirs: I shall
instance only in three, among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more, that are obvious to such
as please themselves with these Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations.
The Province of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
in <hi>France</hi> was called among
the Natives <hi>Al Mor,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
<hi>Ad mare,</hi> or near the Sea;
from this the <hi>Romans</hi> called it <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morica.</hi>
The Isle between the
Branches of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which divide
for some distance before they fall
into the Sea, was called by the
Old <hi>Germans Vat awe,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49830:7"/>
fat or fruitful Earth; and
from this was framed the Latin
word <hi>Batavia.</hi> The North-East
part of <hi>Scotland</hi> was by the Natives
called <hi>Cal Dun,</hi> which signifies a
Hill of Hazel, with which it was
covered; from whence the <hi>Romans</hi>
gave it the Name of <hi>Caledonia:</hi>
All which have lasted in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
to this Day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> were little known
abroad, before the first Entrance of
the <hi>Romans</hi> into their Isle, or the
Preparations and Enquiries they
made in order to that Expedition:
Their Coasts only opposite to <hi>Gaul</hi>
and <hi>Belgium,</hi> were frequented by
Merchants from thence, who came
thereby acquainted with them, but
little with the inland Provinces:
And these were the Men from
whom <hi>Cesar</hi> drew his best Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
concerning the Country he
ntended to Invade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49830:8"/>
All that we find related of them
by any credible Witnesses or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
before the <hi>Romans</hi> entred,
is, That the whole Country was
filled with infinite numbers of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
mightily abounding in all sorts
of Cattle or Beasts, both Wild and
Tame; Their Houses poorly Built,
and scattered all over the Country,
without Observance of Order or
Distance, by which Villages are
composed: But the <hi>Britains</hi> were
placed as every Man liked, and at
smaller or greater Distances, as they
were invited by the Fertility of
Soil, or the Convenience of Wood
or of Water. They lived most
upon Milk, or Flesh which they
got by Hunting; Little upon Corn,
which was not in much Esteem or
Plenty among them. What Cloaths
they wore to cover any Parts of
their Bodies, were usually of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49830:8"/>
Skins of Beasts; but much of their
Body, as Arms, Legs, and Thighs,
was left naked, and in many of
them, All; What was naked, was
painted with Blew. This was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
among them, whether
esteemed an Adornment, or of
Terror to their Adversaries, or to
distinguish them from all their
Neighbors that came among them,
as Friends or as Enemies.</p>
            <p>Their Towns were most upon
their Coasts, and founded for the
Advantage of Havens, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Strangers from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
to Buy and Sell, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
Wares with those of the
Island. These Inhabitants were
much more Civilized than those of
the inland Country, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
and Frequentation of other
Nations, especially the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who
had long before been Civilized by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49830:9"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
exported out of the Isle,
were chiefly Hydes and Tin; which
last was peculiar to this Country,
and in much Use abroad, both in
nearer and remoter Regions, where
this Island was chiefly known by
the Product of this Commodity,
convey'd among them at so great
Distances, and so much in Request.
Some Silver they had, but not in
common Use, as having few Mines,
and little Knowledge how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them, either in the Digging
or Refining: Pearls they had too,
and frequently found among them,
but neither clear, nor coloured like
those of the Orient, and therefore
in low esteem among the <hi>Romans:</hi>
But little Iron, and that used ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for Arms, or for Rings, which
was a sort of Money current among
them: The rest was of Brass, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49830:9"/>
was brought from abroad, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
only for this Use.</p>
            <p>Their Language, Customs, and
Religion were generally the same
with those of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> before the
<hi>Roman</hi> Conquests in that Province,
which were much earlier than in
<hi>Britain:</hi> This affinity made them
frequently assist the <hi>Gauls</hi> upon the
Coasts, in their Wars against the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and gave the first Occasion
of <hi>Cesars</hi> invading <hi>Britain</hi> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
and Safety, as well as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
and Glory.</p>
            <p>Their Government was like that
of the ancient <hi>Gauls,</hi> of several
small Nations under several petty
Princes; which seem the Original
Governments of the World, and
deduced from the natural Force
and Right of Paternal Dominion;
Such were the <hi>Hords</hi> among the
<hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Clans</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49830:10"/>
               <hi>Septs</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Whether these
small <hi>British</hi> Principalities descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Succession, or were elected
by the Advantages of Age, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or Valour in the Families of
the Prince, is not recorded. But
upon great or common Dangers,
the chief Commander of all their
Forces, was chosen by common
Consent in general Assemblies; as
<hi>Cesar</hi> relates of <hi>Cassivelaunus</hi> against
his Invasion. The same was done
upon their Revolts against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Colonies, under <hi>Caractacus</hi> and
<hi>Voadicea;</hi> For among them, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were admitted to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities
and general Commands,
by the Right of Succession, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Birth, or Eminence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Qualities.</p>
            <p>Their Forces consisted chiefly
in their Foot, and yet they could
draw great numbers of Horse into
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49830:10"/>
the Field upon great Occasions; they
likewise used Chariots in Fight;
which with short Scythes fasten'd
to the ends of the Axle-trees,
gave cruel Wounds, great Terror,
made fierce Charges upon the Ranks
of their Enemies, and were of
much Force to Break, or to Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them. Their common Arms
were small Shields, but very large
Swords, which expressed more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of Wounding their Enemies,
than Defending themselves. They
were esteemed a very brave and
fierce People, till their Bodies came
to be softned, and their Courages
debased by the Luxury as well as
Servitude, which the <hi>Romans</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
among them.</p>
            <p>In their Religion and their Laws
they were wholly governed by their
<hi>Druids,</hi> as were the ancient <hi>Gauls,</hi>
who are said to have been furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49830:11"/>
with the chiefest and most learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of theirs, out of <hi>Britain,</hi> esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Nursery of the ancient <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids,</hi>
so renowned in Story: These
were the only Persons, of any sort
of Learning in these Nations, which
was derived by long Tradition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, consisted in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Heavens, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Stars and their Courses,
and thereby the Presages of many
Events, or at least Seasons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Vulgar is chiefly concern'd.
The rest was their Doctrines of
Religion, Forms of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and Instructions in Morality,
which consisted in Justice and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.
Their Lives were simple
and innocent, in Woods, Caves;
and hollow Trees: Their Food of
Acorns, Berries, or other Maste;
their Drink, Water: Which made
them respected and admired, not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49830:11"/>
only for knowing more than other
Men, but for despising what all
others valued and pursued, and by
their great Virtue and Temperance
they were suffered patiently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
and correct the Vices and
Crimes, from which themselves
were free. All this together gave
them such Authority and Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among the People, that they
were not only the Priests, but the
Judges too, throughout the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
No Laws were instituted by
Princes or common Assemblies,
without the Proposal or Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Druids;</hi> No Person was
punished by Bonds, Strokes, or
Death, without the Judgment and
Sentence of the <hi>Druids:</hi> From a
Belief, that Men would never sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Loss of their Liberties,
or their Lives, unless they believed
it was inflicted upon them by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49830:12"/>
One Custom there was among
the <hi>Britains</hi> which seems peculiar
to themselves, and not found in the
Stories of any other Nations, either
Civil or Barbarous, which was a
Society of Wives among certain
numbers, and by common consent.
Every Man married a single Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who was always after and
alone esteemed his Wife: But it
was usual for five or six, ten or
twelve, or more, either Brothers or
Friends, as they could agree, to have
all their Wives in common: En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
hapned among them as they
were invited by Desire, or favoured
by Opportunity. Every Womans
Children were attributed to him
that had married her; but all had
a share in the Care and Defence of
the whole Society, since no Man
knew which were his own. Though
this Custom be alledged as a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49830:12"/>
how savage or barbarous a
People the <hi>Britains</hi> were, yet I know
not why it should appear more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
than the community of
VVomen in some other Countries;
the deflowering of Virgins by the
Priest the first Night of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
the unlimited number of
Wives and Concubines; not to
mention the Marriage of Sisters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the ancient <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians;</hi>
and the borrowing and
lending of VVives among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
On t'other side it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for some excuse of these our
Ancestors, that by such a Custom
they avoided the common mischiefs
of Jealousie, the injuries of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
the Confinement of single
Marriages, the Luxury and Expence
of many VVives or Concubines,
and the partiality of Parents in the
Education of all their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49830:13"/>
All which are Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that have fallen under the Care
of many famous Law-givers. But
the best excuse was made upon this
occasion by a <hi>British</hi> VVoman (in
the time of <hi>Severus</hi>) who being
grown familiar with <hi>Iulia Augusta,</hi>
and other chief Ladies of that
Court, and having observed what
passed there behind the Curtain,
was one day reproached for this
Custom of the <hi>Britains,</hi> as Infamous
in the VVomen, as well as Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in the Men. She answered
coldly, we do that openly with the
best of our Men, which you do
privately with the worst of yours.
However it be, such were the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and the Customs of <hi>Britain,</hi>
when the <hi>Romans</hi> first invaded their
Island under the Ensigns of <hi>Iulius
Cesar.</hi> This famous <hi>Roman</hi> Leader
then Governour of <hi>Gaul,</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49830:13"/>
subdued all that Province, and
the bordering parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> was
the first we read of with any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
that enter'd <hi>Britain</hi> with
Foreign Arms. His Forces were
composed of <hi>Germans, Batavians,</hi>
and <hi>Gauls,</hi> besides the best of his
Old <hi>Roman</hi> Legions: Yet in two
Expeditions he made into this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland,
he rather encreased the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
than the Dominion of <hi>Rome;</hi>
and gave <hi>Britain</hi> the Honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the last Triumph of that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Republick, which had before
subdued and reduced into Provinces
so many Kingdoms and Common-wealths
in <hi>Europe, Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Britains with their naked
Troops made a Brave Opposition
against this Veterane Army, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fierce encounters with mutual
Losses; and various Successes; till
Dissention entering among the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49830:14"/>
Princes, some of them jealous
of <hi>Cassivelaunus,</hi> or his Greatness,
fled over to <hi>Cesar,</hi> submitted to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and desired their Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Others followed their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
till <hi>Cassivelaunus</hi> weakned by
these Desertions, resolved likewise
to make the best Terms he could
for himself and the rest; he sends
to <hi>Cesar,</hi> acknowledges the <hi>Roman</hi>
State, agrees upon a certain Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
and delivers Hostages. And
here began the Fate of <hi>Britain,</hi> to
make way for Foreign Conquests
by their Divisions at home.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> were pleased with
the Name of a New Conquest,
and glad to end an Adventure with
some Honour, which they found
was not further to be pursued, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
long Time and much Danger;
and having discovered rather than
subdued the Southern Parts only
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49830:14"/>
of the Island, returned into <hi>Gaul</hi>
with their whole Forces, and left
the <hi>Britains</hi> to their own Customs,
Laws, and Governments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cesar</hi> being esteemed the best
Writer, as well as the greatest
Captain of his Age, or perhaps of
any other; has with his own Pen
left us the best Account, not only
of this Enterprise, but of this Island
too, till then, little known to the
rest of the World.</p>
            <p>Those Tales we have of what
passed there before his time, of
<hi>Brute</hi> and his <hi>Trojans,</hi> of many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
and Successions, are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with the Rust of Time, or
involved in the Vanity of Fables,
or pretended Traditions; which
seem to all Men obscure or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
but to me, forged at Pleasure,
by the Wit or Folly of their first
Authors, and not to be regarded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:49830:15"/>
From the first Entrance of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar's</hi>
Triumphant Arms, we have
some constant Light in the Story
of <hi>Britain,</hi> tho often very weak and
uncertain, from the Obscurity of
those Barbarous Nations, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
the Northern Parts of the
Island; and from the Ignorance of
those Illiterate Ages, that passed
from the Decay to the Restoration
of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Languages
and Learning, in the Western Parts
of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquests advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in this Island during the Reigns
of so many Emperors, the bravest
of the Natives, who could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
that Subjection, retired into
the Mountainous and Rocky Parts
of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where they
preserved their Liberty some time
longer, but fell at last, with the
rest, into the common Servitude.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49830:15"/>
But the greatest numbers, and of
the hardest Bodies as well as Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
among the <hi>Britains,</hi> after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
brave Attempts for Defence of
their Country and Liberty, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Defeats by the invincible <hi>Romans,</hi>
still retired Northward from the
Encroachments of the Conqueror,
till they were at last beaten out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the rough and savage Parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the two Fryths, where the
<hi>Romans</hi> afterwards built a Wall.
These native <hi>Britains</hi> were by them
called <hi>Picts,</hi> from the Custom they
still retained of Painting their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and their Shields. And this I
take for the most probable Account
of the Nation so termed by the
<hi>Romans</hi> (for among themselves they
were called <hi>Albins</hi>) though much
Pains and Invention has been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by many Authors, to make
them a Foreign Race of People,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49830:16"/>
who, from they know not what
Country, and at they know not
what Time, invaded and possessed
<hi>Caledonia,</hi> or the Northern Parts of
<hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis more difficult to find out the
Original of the <hi>Scots,</hi> or the Time
of their Entrance upon those
North-west Regions; but as far
as can be gathered out of the Dust
or Rubbish of such barbarous
Times and Writings, and what
remains still of known Appellations
and Events, it seems probable, that
vast numbers of a savage People,
called <hi>Scyths,</hi> at some certain time,
began and atchieved the Conquest
of the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts both of <hi>Britain</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by an easie Change
of the word, were called <hi>Scots,</hi> and
from them, those two Countries
were called <hi>Scotia major,</hi> and <hi>Scotia
minor.</hi> Whether the <hi>Scots</hi> landed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49830:16"/>
first in <hi>Ireland</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> I leave
disputed and undetermined among
their Authors: But it seems agreed,
that both those Countries were for
some Course of Time, stiled <hi>Scotiae,</hi>
and that both the Northwest Parts
of <hi>Scotland</hi> as well as <hi>Ireland,</hi> were
called <hi>Ierne.</hi> I am apt to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
that when these <hi>Scots</hi> seated
themselves in those Parts of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
they divided themselves into
two Races or Nations, whereof
those who inhabited the North-East
Parts, called themselves <hi>Albin-Scots,</hi>
the Name of the Natives
there, being then <hi>Albins,</hi> and the
rest who possessed the North-west
Parts were called <hi>Iren-Scots,</hi> from
a River of that Country, which
gave it the Name of <hi>Ierne;</hi> and
this Name was communicated to
all the rest of that Race, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
and possessed the North of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49830:17"/>
               <hi>Ireland,</hi> which from them was stiled
by the <hi>Saxons Iren-land,</hi> and by Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviation,
<hi>Ireland.</hi> And the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Name seems to have belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
rather to those Parts of <hi>Scotland</hi>
than <hi>Ireland,</hi> since it is given us by
the ancientest Latin Verse that
mentions it, with the Epithet of
<hi>Glacialis Ierne,</hi> which agrees little
with the Clymate of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That these fierce Invaders were
<hi>Scythians</hi> or <hi>Scyths</hi> (which was
their Vulgar Termination) is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
conjectured, if not ascertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not only from their Name, but
from the Seat of that Continent,
which is nearest to the North of
<hi>Scotland:</hi> This is <hi>Norway,</hi> and is
the utmost Western Province of
that vast Northern Region which
extends from thence to the farthest
Bounds of <hi>Tartary</hi> upon the Eastern
Ocean, and was by the Ancients
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49830:17"/>
comprehended in that general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
of <hi>Scythia,</hi> as well as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into several other Barbarous
Names and Countries. Besides, 'tis
both usual and rational, that such
great Transmigrations of People
should be made from a worse to
a better Clymate or Soil, rather
than to a worse, which makes this
probable, to have proceeded from
<hi>Norway,</hi> than from lower and more
fertile parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the
Island which is the nearest part of
Land to that Continent of <hi>Norway,</hi>
retains still the Name of <hi>Schetland,</hi>
as the first point which is reported
to have been touched by the <hi>Scots,</hi>
or <hi>Scyths,</hi> in this Navigation.</p>
            <p>Another Argument may be drawn
from several Customs still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among the Old Northern <hi>Irish,</hi>
which are recorded to have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
among some of the <hi>Scythian</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49830:18"/>
Nations, removing their Houses or
Creats, from one place to another
according to the Seasons: Burning
of their Corn instead of Beating
or Treading in other Countries:
Eating Blood they drew from living
Cattle; Feeding generally upon
Milk, and using little other Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,
besides the Pasture and
Breed of Cattle. To this is added,
that the Mantle or Plad, seems to
have been the Garment in use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Western <hi>Scythians,</hi> as
they continue still among the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
<hi>Irish,</hi> and the Highland <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For their Language, it must be
confess'd, there is not left the least
Trace by which we may seek out
the Original of this Nation; for
it is neither known, nor recorded
to have been used any where else in
the World, besides <hi>Ireland,</hi> the
High-lands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Isle
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49830:18"/>
of Man, and must be allowed to be
an Original Language, without
any Affinity to the Old British, or
any other upon the Continent, and
perhaps with less mixture, than any
other of those Original Languages
yet remaining in any parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
The Conjecture raised of its having
come from <hi>Spain,</hi> because some
<hi>Spanish</hi> words are observed in it,
appears too light to be regarded,
when those very words are of the
modern <hi>Spanish,</hi> which is a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
not above seven or eight
Hundred Years Old, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
chiefly out of Old <hi>Roman</hi>
and <hi>Gothick,</hi> with a later intrusion of
the <hi>Saracen</hi> among them: And yet
I know no better ground than this,
for the other Tradition of <hi>Ireland</hi>
having been anciently planted from
<hi>Spain,</hi> and esteem the few <hi>Spanish</hi>
words to have been introduced on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

by Traffick of the South-west
parts of <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seems probable, that from what
part soever of the Continent this
Nation Sailed upon this Adventure,
they were driven away by the force
or fear of some other Invaders, and
in so great numbers, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
remaining, neither preserved
any where their Name or Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
but were either destroy'd by
the Conquerors, or blended into
the Masse of the new Nations, who
seated themselves in their Country,
as we find the Old <hi>British</hi> to have
been in <hi>England,</hi> by the Conquests
and Inundations of the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time of this Expedition is
yet less in view, nor does <hi>Buchanan,</hi>
or any other Author that I know of,
pretend to tell, or so much as conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
further, than upon a supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Scots</hi> coming first out
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49830:20"/>
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> without alledging any
Authority for that neither. I know
no way of making any guesses at a
matter so obscure, without recourse
to the Runick Learning and Stories,
by which we find that the <hi>Asiatick
Scythians,</hi> under the Names of
<hi>Getes</hi> or <hi>Goths,</hi> and the Conduct of
<hi>Odin</hi> their Captain, (their Law-giver
at first, and afterwards one
of their Gods) are esteemed to
have begun their Expedition into
the North-west parts of <hi>Europe,</hi>
about the time that the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms
began first to make a great noise,
and give great fears in <hi>Asia,</hi> which
was in the Reigns of <hi>Antiochus</hi> first,
and then of <hi>Mithridates.</hi> How
long the Arms of <hi>Odin</hi> and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
were imployed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
and Settlement of that vast
Kingdom, which contained all the
Tracts of Country surrounding the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49830:21"/>
Baltick Sea, is not agreed upon
in these Runick Stories; but 'tis
necessary, <hi>Norway</hi> must have been
the last they possessed in their We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Progress, and I am apt to
think, the <hi>Scyths</hi> may have been
driven by them, to seek nearer Seats
in our Islands; and that 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
to have been some time of
the first Century. Whenever it
was, it seems more agreed, that
after the first Entrance of the <hi>Scots</hi>
into <hi>Caledonia,</hi> they subdued much
of the Country, mingled with the
the rest of the Native <hi>Picts,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
long to infest the Frontier
Parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies in
<hi>Britain,</hi> with great fierceness, and
many various Events; and would
possibly have made much greater
noise and impressions upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
if their greater Numbers
had not been drawn another way,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49830:21"/>
by so great a Drain as that of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which they totally conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and long possessed.</p>
            <p>This is the best Account I have
been ever able to give my self of
these ancient Times and Events in
the Northern Parts of our Islands,
being a matter that has imployed
so many unskilful Pens, in so much
idle Trash, and worthless Stuff,
as they have left upon it; but all
involved in such groundless Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
and vanity of Fables, so
obscured by the length of Time,
and darkness of unlearned Ages,
or covered over with such gross
Forgeries, made at Pleasure by
their first Inventers, that I know
few ancient Authors upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
worth the pains of Perusal,
and of dividing or refining so little
Gold, out of so much course Oar,
or from so much Dross. And I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49830:22"/>
have the rather made this Excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
because I have met with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Story more Obscure, and
often observed with wonder, that
we should know less of <hi>Ireland,</hi> than
of any other Country in <hi>Europe.</hi>
For, besides its having been anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
planted by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
their Name, and then after
several Centuries been subdued,
and much of it planted by the
<hi>Danes;</hi> we know nothing certain
of the Affairs or Revolutions of
that Island, till the <hi>English</hi> began
their Conquests there, under the
Ensigns of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second. For
the <hi>Danish</hi> Establishments there,
we neither know the Time nor the
manner they either began or end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
though many Monuments still
remain of the Towns and Castles
they Built, and many Records a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
some Families in <hi>Denmark,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49830:22"/>
of the Lands and Possessions they
long held and enjoyed in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall now return to that part
of our Island which was more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
by the <hi>Romans</hi> termed <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
was Conquered by the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Arms, and reduced into a
Province by the wise Institutions
of that renowned Nation; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
once found the end of the
Thread, it will be easie to wind
off the Bottom; and being a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
treated by so many Authors,
and pretty well agreed, I shall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
my self no further, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the Thread as it leads through
the several Revolutions that have
happened in this noble Island, till
the last <hi>Norman</hi> Period, by which
the present Succession and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
seem to have been Establish'd,
and has ever since continued.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:49830:23"/>
The <hi>Roman</hi> Arms entered <hi>Britain</hi>
under the first and most renowned
of their Emperors, which was <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caesar:</hi> But it was not a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
worth such an Eagle, and so left
by him, to be pursued by the
Lieutenants of the succeeding Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.</p>
            <p>The fecond Expedition into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
was made by <hi>Claudius,</hi> under
the Conduct of <hi>Plautius,</hi> and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
under <hi>Ostorius,</hi> and other <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Commanders, with great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses.
The Southern Coasts, with
most of the inland Parts thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
adjacent, were wholly subdued
and secured by Fortifying Camps,
Building Castles, and Planting
many Colonies. The rest seemed
at a Gaze, and to promise Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
at the first, rather than any
Disturbances, to the Progress of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms. Till provoked
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49830:23"/>
by the Oppression of some of the
Pretors, and their corrupt Officers;
The <hi>Britains</hi> towards the North,
made head under <hi>Caractacus,</hi> and
continued for nine years, not only
a brave Defence, but threatned some
fatal Dangers to the <hi>Roman</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
till in a decisive Battel, by
the advantage of armed and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined
Veteran Soldiers, against
loose Troops of naked Men; The
<hi>Britains</hi> were totally vanquished,
<hi>Caractacus</hi> taken Prisoner, and sent
to make a part of a famous <hi>British</hi>
Triumph at <hi>Rome.</hi> Yet one strong
Endeavour more was made for their
Liberty, in the time of <hi>Nero;</hi>
when <hi>Paulinus</hi> going with the best
part of his Army to subdue the Isle
of <hi>Anglesey;</hi> The <hi>Britains</hi> presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
upon so great a Distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Governour and his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,
made a general Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49830:24"/>
under <hi>Voadicea,</hi> fell upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
in all Places, took their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
destroyed the chief Seats of
their Power at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Verulam,</hi>
and pursued their Advantages with
such Slaughter and Revenge, that
above seventy Thousand <hi>Romans,</hi>
or their Auxiliaries, were killed
by the Fury of this general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt:
Yet <hi>Paulinus</hi> returning with
his Army, encountred the <hi>British</hi>
Forces in a set Battel, overthrew
their whole Powers, pursued his
Victory, with the Slaughter of
eighty Thousand; forced <hi>Voadicea</hi>
to Poison her self in Despair: And
here ended, not only the <hi>British</hi>
Liberties, but their very Hopes too,
or any considerable Attempts ever
to recover them.</p>
            <p>Under <hi>Vespatian</hi> and <hi>Domitian,
Iulius Agricola</hi> first discovered it to
be an Island, Sailing round it with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49830:24"/>
his Fleets, and extended and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Bounds of his Province to
the Neck of Land between the
two Fryths about <hi>Sterling</hi> and
<hi>Glasco;</hi> and returning, applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Arts of Peace and Civil
Institutions, brought in the Use
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws and Customs,
Habits and Arms, Language and
Manners, Baths and Feasts, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and Learning: By all which
he pretended to soften the Minds,
and change the very Natures of a
barbarous People, very difficult to
be subdued by other means, how
violent soever. This wise Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
pursued by his Successors in the
Government, succeeded so well,
that the <hi>Romans</hi> had little trouble
afterwards in <hi>Britain,</hi> besides the
Defence of their Province upon the
Northern Borders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:49830:25"/>
After these Establishments, the
<hi>Romans</hi> called all that part of the
Island lying Northward from the
two Fryths, <hi>Caledonia;</hi> leaving the
Name of <hi>Britannia</hi> to the rest which
was reduced to their Obedience,
and from that time remained a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Province. To defend it from
the Irruptions of these fierce and
numerous People on the North
side, <hi>Agricola</hi> began, and in some
manner finished, a Wall or Vallum,
upon that narrow space of Land
that lies between the two Fryths
or Bayes of the Eastern and We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Seas; upon which <hi>Glasco</hi>
and <hi>Sterling</hi> are seated. He forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
this Pass between the two
Points, with Towers and Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts,
to make it defensible against
those barbarous Nations who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
the Northern side of that
Country which the <hi>Romans</hi> esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49830:25"/>
not worth the Conquering, and
provided only for Security of the
rest of the Island. Many Ruins of
this Vallum were lately, and for
ought I know, may be still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and among the rest, a small
round Tower built of Stone, but so
exactly Cut, as every one to Joynt
into another, with admirable Art
and Firmness, though without any
use of Morter or Iron. And this was
esteemed to have been a Temple of
<hi>Terminus,</hi> and Built there as the
utmost Bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
This was afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
and stronger fortified by
<hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Severus:</hi> Nor is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
agreed by Authors which of
them began or finish'd it, and
whether the last made not another
Vallum between the two Seas
more Southward, and of a much
greater Length: But I think the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49830:26"/>
first more probable. However,
this was a Defence intended and
atchieved by the <hi>Romans,</hi> against
those bold and brave Remainders
of the <hi>Northern Britains</hi> assisted by
the <hi>Scots,</hi> who yet frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
and infested the Province,
during the time the <hi>Romans</hi> held
this Island, which was till the
Reign of <hi>Honorius,</hi> and for the
space of about four hundred and
sixty Years.</p>
            <p>Upon the Divisions in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire, which was grown a
Prey to their Armies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
disposed by their inconstant
Humours; The Pretenders often
fought their Battels, and decided
their Quarrels in <hi>Gallia,</hi> as well
several of the Commanders there
who arrived at the Empire, as seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
others who fell in the pursuit
of that fatal Purple, and left only
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49830:26"/>
the Name of Tyrants behind them
in the Stories of that Age. For
the assistance of these Factions, the
<hi>British</hi> Legions were at several
Times and Occasions drawn away
into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and with them great
Numbers of the bravest of the
<hi>British</hi> Youth, who were affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, and
instructed in their Language, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and Discipline of their Arms.
As the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces decreased in
<hi>Britain,</hi> the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> still the
more boldly infested the Northern
Parts, crossing the Fryths, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
about the Coasts in little
Boats of Wicker, covered with
Leather, filled all, where they
came, with Spoil and Slaughter,
till repelled by what remained of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces, they retired still
into their Northern Nest, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the next occasion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49830:27"/>
and Revenge upon the
Neighbouring <hi>Britains,</hi> whenever
the <hi>Romans</hi> were drawn away into
remoter Parts of the Island. These
Enterprises were often repeated,
and as often as repress'd, for some
time, till in the Reign of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Valentinian</hi> upon the mighty
Inundations of those barbarous
Northern Nations, which under
the Names of <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi>
invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Numbers, Fury, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to <hi>Rome</hi> it self, all the <hi>Roman</hi>
Legions were at last drawn out of
<hi>Britain,</hi> with most of the <hi>Britains</hi>
that were fit for Military Service,
to relieve the Emperor, who was
pursued by the <hi>Goths</hi> into <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
and there besieged in a strong
Passage or Town he pretended to
Defend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49830:27"/>
The <hi>Romans</hi> taking their last
Leave of this Province here, left
the <hi>Britains</hi> to their own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Choice of their own
Kings and Leaders, with the best
Instructions for the Exercise of
their Arms and Discipline, and the
Repairs and Defence of the Wall
or Rampart they had raised against
their Northern Foes. But these,
finding the whole Country desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Roman</hi> Bands, exhausted
of their own bravest Youth, and
weakned by their new Divisions,
began to pour in greater Numbers
than ever into the Northern Parts,
and ravaged all before them, with
greater Rage and Fury. The poor
<hi>Britains</hi> sent over their miserable
Epistle for Relief (still upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord)
to the renowned <hi>Aetius,</hi>
who had by several famous Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
for a time, repelled the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49830:28"/>
of the <hi>Gothick</hi> Arms; which
was addressed in these words: <hi>To</hi>
Aetius <hi>thrice Consul; The Groans of
the</hi> Britains; and told him, after
other lamentable Complaints; <hi>That
the barbarous People drove them to the
Sea, and the Sea back to the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
People; between which, they had
only left the Choice of these two Deaths,
either to be killed by the one, or drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the other.</hi> But having no Hopes
given them by the <hi>Roman</hi> General,
of any Succours from that Side,
they began to consider what other
Nation they might call over to
their Relief. The <hi>Saxons</hi> were
one Branch of those <hi>Gothick</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which swarming from the
Northern Hive, had under the
Conduct of <hi>Odin,</hi> possessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
anciently of all those migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Tracts of Land that surround
the Baltick Sea. A Branch of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49830:28"/>
these, under the Name of <hi>Suevi,</hi>
(from whom the Baltick was of
old called <hi>Mare Suevicum</hi>) had some
time before <hi>Cesars</hi> Wars in <hi>Gaul,</hi>
invaded and subdued very large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Territories in <hi>Germany</hi> from
the Coast of the North-west Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to the South-eastern Parts,
whereof <hi>Suabia</hi> still retains the
Memory and the Name. These
<hi>Suevi</hi> or <hi>Suabi</hi> were for their
Strength and Valour grown so
Formidable to all the <hi>German</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they had Conquered, and
forced to seek new Seats; That
those upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> sending Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to <hi>Cesar,</hi> told him, <hi>They
would neither seek War with the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
<hi>nor avoid it; That they esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves as Valiant as any other
Nation, excepting only the</hi> Suevi, <hi>for
whom the very immortal Gods were
not a Match.</hi> These <hi>Suevi</hi> became
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49830:29"/>
afterwards divided into two several
Nations, and by Limits agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. Those towards the
South-east of <hi>Germany</hi> were called
<hi>Francs,</hi> from their great Love of
Liberty, and their Valour in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
it, and never submitting to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Subjection, as many
other <hi>German</hi> Nations had done;
These upon the fatal Decline of
that Empire, invaded <hi>Gaul</hi> under
the leading of <hi>Pharamond,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the succeeding Kings of his
Race, conquered the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and established that noble
and ancient Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Branch of the <hi>Suevi,</hi>
possessed themselves of all those
Tracts of Land in <hi>Germany</hi> that
lie between the <hi>Elve</hi> and the lower
<hi>Rhine,</hi> had extended their Seats all
over the Coasts of the North-west
Sea, and from thence exercised their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49830:29"/>
Arms and fierce Courages, in all
sorts of Spoils and Pyracies, not
only upon Merchants or Traders
at Sea, but upon the Maritime
Coasts of <hi>Britain,</hi> opposite to those
Countries about the Mouth of the
<hi>Rhine,</hi> or thereunto adjacent. These
fierce People were called <hi>Saxons,</hi>
from a Weapon generally used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, and made like a Sythe
with the Edge reversed, which in
in their Language were termed
Seaxes.</p>
            <p>To these <hi>Vortigern,</hi> chosen King
by the deserted and afflicted <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
made Address for Aid against
the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> who had now
made Inroads as far as <hi>Trent.</hi> Their
desires of Relief, and offers of
Seats in <hi>Britain,</hi> were soon accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and granted by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who
under the Conduct of <hi>Hengist</hi> and
<hi>Horsa,</hi> of the Race of <hi>Odin,</hi> came
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49830:30"/>
over with great Numbers, to the
Assistance of the <hi>Britains,</hi> in the
year 450. They joyned with the
Natives at first, as Friends and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
had the Isle of <hi>Thanet</hi> assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them at their Landing, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasion of greater numbers,
the County of <hi>Kent</hi> for their Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and Habitation. They marched
against the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> and
in Conjunction with the <hi>British</hi>
Arms, overthrew their Forces, in
several Battels or Encounters with
those cruel Ravagers, and beat them
back into the most Northern Parts
of the Province. After this, by
Consent of the <hi>Britains, Hengist</hi>
and <hi>Horsa</hi> sent for their two Sons
or near Kinsmen, to come over
with a new Army of <hi>Saxons</hi> by
Sea, into those Northern Parts;
who seated their Colony about
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> upon pretence of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49830:30"/>
guarding that Frontier against the
<hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> and their Incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the <hi>Britains,</hi> which they
did with great Bravery and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
and thereby left those Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
contented or forced, to bound
their Territories with those rough
and mountainous Countries that
lye between the two Seas, near the
River <hi>Tweed,</hi> and which ever since
continued, as the Borders between
the two Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> into which, the Island
came afterwards to be divided.</p>
            <p>The Province, now delivered
and secured from their ancient Foes,
Dissentions began to arise between
the <hi>Britains</hi> and their new Allies;
The <hi>Saxons,</hi> valuing too high the
assistance they had given, and the
<hi>Britains</hi> perhaps too low what they
had received, till the first allured
by so fair a Prey, and the fertile
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49830:31"/>
Soil of so sweet a Country, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
still greater numbers from the
Continent, establish'd two <hi>Saxon</hi>
Kingdoms, one in the Southern,
and t'other in the Northern Parts;
and from both these sides invaded
the <hi>Britains,</hi> who for some time
defended themselves and their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
with various Successes, and
with the greater hatred and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
the <hi>Saxons</hi> being all Pagans,
and the <hi>British</hi> generally Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
which Religion seems to have
been planted here in the first Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
but to have taken Root, and
spred chiefly under <hi>Constantius,</hi> who
was long Governour of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Province here, a great favourer of
Christianity, and Father of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
the Great.</p>
            <p>In the time of these first Wars
between the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Britains,
Ambrosius</hi> reigned over the last, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49830:31"/>
either as General of his Armies, or
his Successor in the Kingdom,
<hi>Arthur,</hi> so famous in the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or rather in the Romances of
succeeding Ages, and who is said
to have gained twelve Battels over
the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and to have left the
<hi>Britains</hi> in the middle of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
for some time to secure from
these fierce Enemies, till Peace and
Luxury had again softned them,
and by new Dissentions among
themselves, exposed their whole
Province to become an easie Prey
to so fierce and numerous Invaders.
The time of King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Reign
or Atchievments (if any such there
were) must have been between
the Years 460 and 500. But this
whole Story is left so uncertain
or obscure by those poor Writers,
who have pretended to leave the
Tales, rather than the History of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49830:32"/>
those times behind them, that it
remains in doubt, whether to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
them as a part of the Story
of that, or the Fables of succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ages. Whatever there was of
plain Stuff, the Embroidery of it,
with the Knights of the Round
Table, their Orders and their Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry,
and the rest of that kind,
seems to have been introduced by
that Vein of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Romances,
which many Ages after filled the
World with so much of that idle
Trash, and chose for the Subject
of them, the Adventures and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
of the first Christian pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Heroes, who renowned such
fictitious Names, by extravagant
Actions or Adventures against the
<hi>Pagans</hi> or the <hi>Saracens,</hi> either in
<hi>Spain</hi> or other parts of <hi>Europe</hi> and
<hi>Asia.</hi> And among these, 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
those Writers found room
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49830:32"/>
for the many Legends of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Arthur,</hi> and his Romantick
Adventures against the Heathen
<hi>Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Year 500, for one
Century or thereabouts, the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Forces were employed in subduing
the midland Parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
between their two first Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
Colonies or Kingdoms in
the South or <hi>Kent,</hi> and in the
North, or about <hi>Northumberland;</hi>
and to furnish Men for such At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievments,
and the new Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so great Tracts of Country,
after the Conquest and Devastation
of the Old, mighty numbers of
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Race came over into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
in several Expeditions, and
Landing at several Places; That
which is recorded to have made
sudden and easie way for their final
Conquests, was a Treaty they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49830:33"/>
into with the <hi>Britains,</hi> where
upon a Parley mediated between
them, Three Hundred of the Chief
on each side, agreed to meet and
conclude the Treaty in a great
Plain: In the midst of Talk and
Drink, which had part in this
Commerce, the <hi>Saxons</hi> provoking
maliciously, and the <hi>Britains</hi> inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
resenting, fell to quarrel;
first in Words, and at last to
Blows: When the <hi>Saxons</hi> upon a
Sign agreed between them, drew
out short Swords they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
under their upper Garments,
fell upon the unarmed <hi>Britains,</hi>
slew their whole number in the
Field, who being the best and
bravest of their Nation, left the
rest exposed, without Heart or
Head, to the Fury and Progress
of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Arms. These heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Success, and proud of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49830:33"/>
so great Possessions and Territories,
invited and allured still greater
Numbers of their own from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
who being of several
Branches, and from several Coasts,
arrived here under several Names;
among whom the Angles from
<hi>Schonen</hi> and <hi>Iutland,</hi> swarmed over
in such numbers, that they gave a
new Name at length, to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
which from them was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Angle-land,</hi> and for easier sound
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Saxons</hi> pursued their Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
with Courage and Fierceness,
equal to the Multitudes of their
Nation, that swarmed over into
this Island, and with such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
Course of Fortune and
Victories, after the year 500. that
by the end of the next Century,
they had subdued the whole Body
of the Province, and establish'd in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49830:34"/>
it seven several Kingdoms, which
were by the Writers of those
Times, stiled the Heptarchy of the
<hi>Saxons.</hi> They had expelled the
<hi>Britains</hi> out of the fairest and best
of their ancient Possessions, and
driven their greatest numbers, who
escaped the Conqueror's Fury, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Cornwal,</hi> Countries
mountainous and barren, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
on three sides by the Sea,
and towards the Land, of difficult
Access. Some great Colonies of
them, wholly abandoned their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country to their fierce Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
sailed over into the North-west
Parts of <hi>France,</hi> where pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
new Seats, they gave a new
Appellation to that <hi>Peninsula,</hi> which
preserves still the Name and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of <hi>Britain</hi> there, though about
this time, almost worn out at
home.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49830:34"/>
This is the Account commonly
given of the <hi>British</hi> Colonies first
establishing themselves in that
Canton of <hi>Gaul;</hi> But there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
given by some learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of their own, and drawn, as
they say, either from ancient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chives
or Traditions among them,
and which to me seems the most
probable. When upon the <hi>Roman</hi>
Wars in <hi>Gaul,</hi> among several Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
to the Empire, great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the <hi>Britains,</hi> as well as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Forces in that Island, were
drawn over to assist the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Parties. 'Tis said that very
great Multitudes of the <hi>British</hi>
having followed the unfortunate
side, retired as fast as they could
to that part of the Sea-coast near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to their Isle, and most likely to
furnish them with Ships for their
Transportation: But, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49830:35"/>
of their Native Country,
from the furious Inroads of the
<hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> so discouraged their
Return, that by Consent of the
<hi>Gauls</hi> their Friends, they establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves in the furthest <hi>North-west</hi>
Parts of that Province, which
has since that time, retained their
Language and their Name. And
this agrees with the Legend of
King <hi>Arthur,</hi> who is said to have
been a young Prince or Leader,
sent from the <hi>Britains</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> to
assist their Country-men here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Saxons.</hi> Whatever the
Beginnings of this Colony were,
or at what time, 'tis at least agreed
to have been much augmented by
the Resort of so many <hi>Britains,</hi> as
sought Refuge there from the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Cruelty.</p>
            <p>The weak and poor Remainders
of the old <hi>Britains,</hi> who were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49830:35"/>
among the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
were wholly spoiled of their Lands
and Goods, which were fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Mercy of the Conquerors,
who sharing them all among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
left the remaining <hi>Britains</hi>
in a Condition of downright Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude.
Used them for Tilling
Ground, Feeding Cattle, and other
Servile Works, in House or Field,
sometimes Farming out certain
parts of Land to them, at certain
Rents or Profits, but held always
at the Will and Pleasure of the
Landlord. The Children that
were born of these miserable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
belonged to the Lord of the
Soil, like the rest of the Stock or
Cattle upon it, and thus began Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenage
in <hi>England,</hi> which lasted
till the time or end of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Seventh's Reign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:49830:36"/>
Soon after the year 600. the
<hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>England</hi> having ended
their old Quarrel with the <hi>Britains,</hi>
began new ones among themselves;
and according to the usual Circle of
human Affairs, War ended in
Peace, Peace in Plenty and Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury,
these in Pride; and Pride in
Contention, till the Circle ended in
new Wars. The <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes,
of the seven Kingdoms they had
erected in <hi>Britain,</hi> fell into Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of one anothers Greatness,
Disputes about the Bounds of their
several Principalities, or about Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
or Usurpations, pretended
or exercised in one or other of
them; These were followed by
formal Wars among them, the
stronger swallowing up the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and these having recourse to
their Neighbours, for defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
encroaching Power. Many
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49830:36"/>
fierce Encounters, Sieges, Battels,
Spoils, and Devastations of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
succeeded in the progress and
decision of these mutual Injuries
and Invasions between the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Kings, for above Two Hundred
Years; but the account of them is
very poorly given us, with little
order or agreement of Times or
Actions, by the few and mean Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of those barbarous and illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Ages, and perhaps the rough
course of those lawless Times and
Actions, would have been too ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble
a Subject for a good Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</p>
            <p>About the Year 8, o. after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
various Events and Revolutions
between the several Races of the
Heptarchy, <hi>Ecbert</hi> descended from
the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kings, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited
most of the Successions
from the Prowess and Exploits of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49830:37"/>
his Ancestors, and acquired others
by his own, became the first sole
King or Monarch of <hi>England,</hi> as
it now was distinguished from the
Principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> possessed by
the old <hi>Britains,</hi> and from that
part of the Island to the North
of <hi>Tweed,</hi> possessed by the <hi>Picts</hi>
and <hi>Scots,</hi> and by the <hi>Saxons</hi> stiled
by one common Name of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This famous Adventure of the
<hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> was atchieved
by the Force and Confluence of
such Multitudes from the Coasts
of <hi>Germany,</hi> which lie between the
<hi>Belgick</hi> and <hi>Baltick</hi> Shores, that
some Parts of their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
were left almost dispeopled, to
fill again by new Swarms from
the great Northern Hive, and the
Number of <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Angles,
Iutes,</hi> and other Nations that came
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49830:37"/>
over, were not only sufficient to
Conquer and Wast this whole
Province, but even to Plant and
People it soon again, with nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and new Inhabitants. So as
by them, succeeded in this Island,
not only a Change of Government,
as by the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms; but a
Change of the very People or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that inhabited or possessed
the Lands of this whole Province:
This induced a Change likewise
of Names, of Language, of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
of Laws, of Arms, of
Discipline, of Possessions, of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
of Religion, and even of the
whole Face of Nature, through
this whole Kingdom. So as we
may justly date the Original of all
these amongst us, as well as our
Nation it self, from these our
<hi>Saxon</hi> Ancestors: <hi>Britain</hi> which
was before a <hi>Roman</hi> Province, was
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49830:38"/>
now grown a <hi>Saxon</hi> Kingdom;
and instead of its former Name
was called <hi>England:</hi> The Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
which was either Latin or
British, was now grown wholly
Saxon or English: The Land that
was before divided into <hi>Roman</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies
or Governments, was so now
into Shires, with Names given to
them by the Saxons, as they first
possessed, or afterwards thought fit
to distinguish them.</p>
            <p>The Habits in Peace, and Arms
in War, the Titles of Officers in
both, as well as of great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
to their Kings, or great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors
of Lands, came to be all
according to the Saxon Forms and
Usage. The Laws of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
which before were <hi>Roman,</hi>
changed now into Old Saxon
Customs or Constitutions. Their
Princes or Leaders of their several
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49830:38"/>
Nations, became <hi>Konings</hi> or Kings
of the Territories, they had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.
They reserved part of the
Lands to themselves for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
and shared the rest among
their chief Commanders, by great
Divisions, and among their Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
by smaller shares. The first,
who had the great Divisions, were
called Earls or Barons, those of
the smaller were Knights; and
the smallest of all were Freemen,
who possessed some Proportions of
free Lands, and were thereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from the Villens, that
held nothing but at the Will of
the Landlord.</p>
            <p>In this universal Transformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Religion it self had a share,
like all the rest, and received new
Forms and Orders, with the new
Inhabitants, whilst all that was
<hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>British,</hi> expired together
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49830:39"/>
in this Country: The <hi>Britains</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
early to receive the Christian
Faith; and as is reported from
some of the Disciples themselves:
And this was so propagated among
them, that when the <hi>Romans</hi> left
the Province, they were generally
Christians, and had their Priests
and Bishops from the ancient and
Apostolick Institution. The <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
were a sort of Idolatrous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
that worshipped several Gods
peculiar to themselves, among
whom <hi>Woden, Thor,</hi> and <hi>Frea</hi> were
the chief, which left their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
still preserved by the common
names of three days in the Week:
This Religious Worship they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
with them and continued
long in <hi>England,</hi> till they subdued
the <hi>Britains,</hi> reduced it under their
Heptarchy of <hi>Saxons</hi> Kings, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
the <hi>British</hi> Christians, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49830:39"/>
drove them with their Religion,
into <hi>Wales,</hi> where they continued
under their Primitive Priests and
Bishops, who with their Monks,
were all under the Surintendance
of one Arch-Priest or Bishop of
<hi>Carleon</hi> or <hi>Chester,</hi> the Bound of
the <hi>British</hi> Principality. About the
year 600. or soon after, Pope <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi>
sent <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk to
Preach the Gospel in <hi>England</hi> to
the Heathen <hi>Saxons,</hi> who landing
at <hi>Dover,</hi> was received with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
by <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of the
South-<hi>Saxons;</hi> and being admitted
with four or five of his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as well-meaning Men, to teach
and explain the Doctrin and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Christianity, among these
ignorant and barbarous People, they
so well succeeded, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
at first, great numbers of
the common sort, and at length
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49830:40"/>
the King himself, whose example
gave easie way for introducing the
Christian Faith into his whole
Kingdom, which from thence
spread into all the Countries sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Heptarchy. Thus
Religion came to be Establish'd in
<hi>England,</hi> under the Rites and Forms
and Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church;
by which <hi>Austin</hi> was instituted
chief Bishop in <hi>England,</hi> and seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Saxon</hi> King at <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
But his Jurisdiction though admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Territories,
was not received by the <hi>British</hi>
Priests or People in <hi>Wales,</hi> though
endeavoured by many missions from
<hi>Austin</hi> and his Successors, and even
by Wars and Persecutions of the
<hi>Saxons,</hi> upon the Old <hi>British</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
at the instigation of the
New <hi>Romish</hi> Priests, in one of
which near <hi>Carleon,</hi> Twelve Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49830:40"/>
of the poor <hi>British</hi> Monks are
said to have been slaughtered, while
they were apart in the Field at
their Prayers for the success of the
<hi>British</hi> Army.</p>
            <p>With this Account of a new
face and state of Persons and of
Things both Natural, Civil, and
Religious, establish'd in <hi>England,</hi>
I return to the Period I left, of
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Heptarchy, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extinguish'd by long and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Revolutions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
made way for the Reign of
<hi>Ecbert,</hi> the first sole King or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of <hi>England</hi> about the year
830.</p>
            <p>It might have been reasonably
expected, that a wise and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Prince, at the Head of so
great a Dominion, and so brave
and numerous a People, as the
<hi>English</hi> after the Expulsion of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49830:41"/>
the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> out of his
Country into the rough Northern
Parts, and of the <hi>Britains</hi> into the
North-west Corners of the Island,
should not only have enjoyed the
Fruits of Peace and Quiet, but
left much Felicity as well as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to many succeeding Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
both of Prince and People.
Yet such is the instability of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Affairs, and the weakness of
their best Conjectures, That <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
was hardly warm in his united
Throne, when both he and his
Subjects began to be alarmed and
perplexed at the approach of new
and unknown Enemies; and this
Island exposed to New Invasions.</p>
            <p>About this time, a mighty
Swarm of the Old Northern Hive,
who had possessed the Seats about
the Baltick (almost deserted by
such numbers of <hi>Goths, Vandals</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:49830:41"/>
and <hi>Saxons,</hi> as had issued out of
them some Centuries before) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
under the Names of <hi>Danes</hi>
and <hi>Normans,</hi> to infest at first the
Sea, and at length the Lands of
the <hi>Belgick, Gallick,</hi> and <hi>British</hi>
Shores, filling all where they came,
with Slaughters, Spoils, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastations.
The <hi>Normans</hi> first o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-run
the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces upon
the Mouth of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and gave
them new Names of <hi>Holland</hi> and
<hi>Zealand</hi> to those parts adjacent to
the Sea: Afterwards they sailed
with mighty Numbers into the
Mouth of the <hi>Sean,</hi> and with great
fierceness subdued that Northern
part of <hi>France,</hi> which from them
first received, and ever since re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Name of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and
became the State of a great <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Duke, and his Successors for
several Generations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:49830:42"/>
In the mean time, the <hi>Danes</hi>
began their Inroads and furious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions
upon the Coasts of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
with mighty numbers of
Ships, full of fierce and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
People, sometimes entring
the <hi>Thames,</hi> sometimes the <hi>Humber,</hi>
other times Coasting as far as <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter,</hi>
Landing where-ever they
found the Shores unguarded, filling
all with Ravage, Slaughter, Spoil,
and Devastations of the Country;
where they found any strong Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
retiring to their Ships,
sailing home laden with Spoil;
and by such encouragements, giving
Life to new Expeditions the next
Season of the Year. The bravest
Blood of the <hi>English</hi> had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
in their own Civil Wars,
during the Contentions of the
Heptarchy; since those ended, the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49830:42"/>
rest were grown slothful with
Peace and with Luxury, softned
with new Devotions of their
Priests and their Monks, with
Pennances, and Pilgrimages, and
great numbers running into Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and grown as unequal a
Match now for the <hi>Danes,</hi> as the
<hi>British</hi> had been for the <hi>Saxons</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Yet this Century passed not
without many various Successes
between the two Nations; many
Victories and many Defeats on
both sides, so that twelve Battels
are said to have been Fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them in one Year. The
<hi>Danes</hi> divided their Force into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Camps, removed them from
one part of the Country to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as they were forced by neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Provisions, or invited by
hopes of new Spoils, or the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and divisions of the <hi>English:</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:49830:43"/>
At length, fortified Posts and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
built Castles for defence of
Borders, one against the other,
which gave the beginning to those
numerous Forts and Castles that
were scattered over the whole
Country, and lasted so long, as to
remain many of them, to this very
Age. The <hi>English</hi> sometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed
these Invasions, sometimes
purchased the Safety of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
by great Sums of Money,
which occasioned great Exactions
of their Kings upon the People,
and that great Discontents; While
the <hi>Danes</hi> encreasing still, by new
Supplies of Numbers and Force,
began to mingle among the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of those parts they had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
made Truces and Treaties,
and thereupon grew to live more
peaceably under the Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the <hi>English</hi> Kings.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49830:43"/>
               <hi>Alfred,</hi> to prevent the danger of
New Invasions, began to Build
Ships for the Defence of his
Coasts, and <hi>Edgar</hi> a Prince of
great Wisdom and Felicity in his
Reign, applying all his thoughts
to the encrease and greatness of his
Naval Forces, as the true strength
and safety of his Kingdom, raised
them to that height both of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and Force, and disposed them
with that Order, for the Guard of
the Seas round the whole Island,
as proved not only sufficient to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his own Coasts from any new
Invasions, but the Seas themselves
from the Rovers and Spoilers of
those Northern Nations, who had
so long infested them: So that all
Traders were glad to come under
his Protection. Which gave a rise
to that Right, so long claimed by
the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49830:44"/>
of the Seas, about the
year 960.</p>
            <p>But these provisions for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Kingdom, began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
with the Life of <hi>Edgar,</hi> and
neglected in the succeeding Reigns,
made way for new Expeditions of
the <hi>Danes,</hi> who exacted new Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
from the Kings, and Spoils
from the Subjects, till <hi>Ethelred</hi>
compounding with them for his
own Safety, and their peaceable
living in <hi>England,</hi> and fortifying
himself by an Alliance with <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> laid a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
for the general Massacre of the
<hi>Danes,</hi> spred abroad and living
peaceably throughout the Realm,
which was carried on with that
secrecy and concurrence of all the
<hi>English,</hi> that it was executed upon
one day, and the whole Nation of
the <hi>Danes</hi> massacred in <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the year 1002.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:49830:44"/>
This cruel and perfidious Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre,
of so many Thousands, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of ending the long miseries
of this Kingdom from the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences,
Invasions and Intrusions of
the <hi>Danes,</hi> made way for new and
greater Calamities than before: For
<hi>Swane</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by the Slaughter of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here, and among them of his
own Sister, and animated by the
Successes of so many private Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions;
soon after landed with
great Forces, formed several Camps
of <hi>Danes</hi> in several parts of <hi>England,</hi>
filled all with Spoil and Slaughter,
forced <hi>Ethelred</hi> to fly for Relief
into <hi>Normandy;</hi> and though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
again, yet being a weak and
cruel Prince, and thereby ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
and ill obeyed by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
he never recovered Strength
enough to oppose the Forces and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49830:45"/>
Numbers of the <hi>Danes,</hi> to whom
many of the <hi>English</hi> Nobles, as
well as Commoners, had in his
absence submitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Swane</hi> died before he could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve
this Adventure, but left his
Son <hi>Canute</hi> in a Course of such
prosperous Fortunes, and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
so broken or divided, that
coming out of <hi>Denmark</hi> with new
Forces in two hundred Ships, he
reduced <hi>Edmund</hi> Son of <hi>Ethelred,</hi>
first to a Division of the whole
Kingdom between them, and after
his untimely Death, was by the
whole Nobility of the Realm ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
and received for King
of <hi>England.</hi> This fierce Prince
cut off some of the Royal Line,
and forced others into Exile, Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
long, and left the Crown for
two Successions to his <hi>Danish</hi>
Race, who all swore to Govern
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49830:45"/>
the Realm by the Laws which had
been established, or rather digested
by <hi>Edward</hi> the First, and <hi>Edgar,</hi>
out of the Old <hi>Saxon</hi> Customs and
Constitutions. But <hi>Hardecaute,</hi>
last of the <hi>Danish</hi> Kings dying sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
at a Feast in the year 1042.
left the Race so hated, by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
and Exaction of several
Tributes upon his People, that
<hi>Edward</hi> surnamed the Confessor,
and Grandson to <hi>Edgar,</hi> coming
out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> where he had
been long protected, found an easie
accession to the Crown, by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Concurrence, both of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and People, and with great
Applause restored the <hi>Saxon</hi> Race
in the year 1043.</p>
            <p>Thus expired, not only the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
but all Attempts or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions
of the <hi>Danes</hi> in <hi>England;</hi>
which though continued and often
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49830:46"/>
renewed, with mighty Numbers,
for above two hundred years, yet
left no change of Laws, Customs,
Language, or Religion, nor other
Traces of their Establishments
here, besides the many Castles they
built, and many Families they left
behind them, who after the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor to
the Crown, wholly submitting to
his Government, and peaceably
inhabiting, came to incorporate
and make a part of the <hi>English</hi>
Nation without any distinction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor Reigned
long, reduced the Laws of <hi>Edward,
Alfred,</hi> and <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Reigns into
more Form and Order, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by them. His Wars were
successful both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and
<hi>Wales,</hi> though managed by his
Leaders, and without his presence.
But being a Prince of a soft and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49830:46"/>
easie Nature, he gave way to the
growing Power and Arrogance of
Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> and his Sons, who
had been the chief Instruments of
advancing him to the Throne, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Condition of Marrying Earl
<hi>Godwin</hi>'s Daughter. After he was
settled in the Kingdom, either
upon gratitude and inclination to
the People and Customs of a
Country where he had lived long,
and been well received when he
was banished from his own: He
invited many of his <hi>Norman</hi> Friends
into <hi>England,</hi> employ'd them in
his greatest Offices either of Church
or State, and upon some quarrels
between them and the <hi>English,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
too much partiality to the
<hi>Normans:</hi> This gave <hi>Godwin</hi> and
his Son <hi>Harold,</hi> occasion or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of raising and heading great
Discontents of the <hi>English</hi> against
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49830:47"/>
the <hi>Norman</hi> Favorites, and at last
Insurrections against the King;
who soft in his Nature, devout in
his temper, and now declined in
his Age, endeavoured rather to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
these troubles by Articles than
by Arms, and thereby left <hi>Harold</hi>
too powerful for a Subject, and
aspiring to the Crown. <hi>Edward</hi>
had no Children; and though he
seemed desirous to leave the Crown
to his Nephew, yet distrusting
his weakness to defend it against
so powerful a Rival, it does not
appear, or is not agreed among
Authors, whether he made any
disposition of it at his Death or no,
or whether any such at least, as
was afterwards pretended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harald</hi> alledged, that he was
appointed by <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor
to succeed him, was believed by
some, and allowed by more, who
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49830:47"/>
followed his Power rather than his
Right, and was immediately after
the King's Death, elected or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Crown.</p>
            <p>His first trouble was from his
own Brother, who being the Elder,
had obtained assistance from <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
to set up a Title or Pretence
to the Kingdom, though he could
have no other, but that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had usurped it. <hi>Harald</hi> having
marched into the North, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
his Brother and his Army
of Strangers or Discontents, with
great slaughter at <hi>Stamford,</hi> was
suddenly recalled by a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and fatal Storm from the
South. For <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>
surnamed the Conqueror,
was landed at <hi>Hastings</hi> with a
mighty Army of stout <hi>Norman</hi>
Soldiers, to pursue a Right he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to the Succession of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49830:48"/>
Crown after the Death of <hi>Edward.</hi>
What this was, is but obscurely
proved or defended. But the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
was, that <hi>Edward</hi> had by Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
left him Successor of the
Crown; and that <hi>Harald</hi> while he
was last in <hi>Normandy,</hi> had likewise
assured him of his Assistance to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
him to the Kingdom upon
the Death of the King; and the
Duke therefore sent to put him in
mind of that Engagement. But
<hi>Harald</hi> was in possession, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
neither of these Claims, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to defend well what he had
gotten ill, since the apparent Right
was in <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> descended
from the true <hi>Saxon</hi> Race, and
from a Brother of <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor.
To decide these Disputes,
between the two powerful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
(while the just Right lay
unregarded for want of Force to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49830:48"/>
support it) a fierce and bloody
Battel was Fought near <hi>Hastings,</hi>
which continued for a whole day,
with great Bravery and Slaughter
on both sides; but ended with the
Death of <hi>Harald,</hi> most of the
bravest Captains, and above Sixty
Thousand Soldiers of the <hi>English</hi>
Nation, who resolved to defend a
Domestick Usurper against a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Invader; and by the loss of
their Lives, made easie way for the
undisputed Succession of <hi>William</hi>
the Conqueror, to the Crown of
<hi>England</hi> about the year 1066. or
as some account, 1068.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Norman</hi> Prince was Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Son of <hi>Robert</hi> the Sixth Duke
of <hi>Normandy,</hi> by <hi>Arlette,</hi> a very
Beautiful Virgin of <hi>Falaize,</hi> with
whom he fell in Love, as she stood
gazing at her Door, whilst he passed
through that Town: So that he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49830:49"/>
was the Issue of a sudden and strong
Inclination, like a noble Plant,
raised in a hot Bed, which gave
it such Force and Vigour, as made
it prosper and grow to so great a
Height: Nor is it unlikely that
the ancient Heroes derived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from some Gods, to cover
the Misfortunes or Follies, the
Rapes or Loves of some fair Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,
or else the Passions of some
frail Wives, who loved a Gallant
better than a Husband: And the
force of such Encounters, might
have Part in the Constitution of a
young Hero, and give a Natural
Vigour, Spirit, and Lustre to the
Children, from the Flames where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were conceived. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this young Conqueror owed
his Greatness to his Birth, and his
Fortunes to his personal Merit,
from the strength of his Temper
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49830:49"/>
and vigour of his Mind: For he
had a Body of Iron, as well as a
Heart of Steel; Yet his Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals
were at least equal to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
natural Advantages, and he
appears as Wise in his politick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
as he was Bold in his
Enterprises, or Brave and Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in the Atchievment of his
great Adventures.</p>
            <p>His Father <hi>Robert</hi> growing Old,
fell into a Fit of Devotion, frequent
enough in that Age; which made
him resolve upon a Visit to the
holy Sepulcher: His Nobles used
all Arguments they could to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him, but chiefly from the
want of lawful Issue, and the
Competition like to arise upon his
Death, between several great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders,
which might prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to his Country, and perhaps
fatal to the <hi>Norman</hi> State. But
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49830:50"/>
he persisted in the Design of his
Journy, and told them he had a
young Son, that he believed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to be his own, and of whose
Person and Disposition he had great
Hopes, and therefore resolved to
leave him his Successor in the
Dutchy; recommended him to
their Care and Loyalty, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the King of <hi>France</hi> to be
his Guardian, and the Duke of
<hi>Britain</hi> his Governour, who was
one of the fairest Pretenders to the
Succession of that Dutchy, after
the failing of <hi>Robert</hi>'s Line; An
unusual Strain or Testimony of
the good Faith and Meaning of
that Age, where Honour was so
much more in Request than Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
that such a Prince could trust
a Son of reproached Birth and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Right, to a powerful Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
the likeliest to Invade him,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49830:50"/>
and to a Pretender that stood the
fairest to contest his Title.</p>
            <p>The Prince was not above Nine
or Ten Years Old, when Duke
<hi>Robert</hi> caused his Nobles and Chief
<hi>Norman</hi> Subjects, to Swear Feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to him, and afterwards car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him to do Homage to <hi>Henry</hi>
the First, King of <hi>France,</hi> for the
Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi> according to
the Custom of the former Dukes,
since their first Accords with that.
Crown, after their Conquests and
Establishments in that Part of
<hi>France,</hi> which was before called
<hi>Neustry,</hi> and took the Name of
<hi>Normandy</hi> from those fierce Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
These coming from the
Coasts of <hi>Norway</hi> in two several
Expeditions, with mighty Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of a Brave, but Barbarous
People, had about Two Hundred
Years before, first ravaged the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49830:51"/>
Coasts of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi>
then entred the Mouth of the <hi>Sein,</hi>
subjected the Country by unresist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Arms, then taking the City of
<hi>Rouen,</hi> Capital of that Province,
upon Composition, and made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads
from thence into the Isle of
<hi>France,</hi> and near <hi>Paris</hi> it self, with
such Fury and Success, that the
King of <hi>France</hi> embroiled then at
home, thought fit to tame these
Lyons, rather than longer to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
them, and threw them, that
noble and fruitful Morsel of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
to asswage their Hunger,
yielding it up wholly to their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>Roul,</hi> upon Conditions of his
turning Christian, and his holding
that Dutchy from the Crown of
<hi>France,</hi> for him and his Successors.</p>
            <p>After these Ceremonies were
past of the Homages received in
<hi>Normandy,</hi> and given in <hi>France;</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:49830:51"/>
the old Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> delivered his
young Son himself into the Hands
and Tutelage of the <hi>French</hi> King,
upon the Confidence of great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
he had formerly done him,
in Disputes about the Crown;
and immediately after these Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions,
began his Voyage into
<hi>Asia,</hi> where he lived not long, and
left his Son to be the Founder of
his own Fortunes, rather than
Heir of his Fathers; which he
found exposed to all sorts of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
from the tenderness of his
Age, the reproach of his Birth, a
suspected Guardian, a disputed Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and a distracted State.</p>
            <p>After the News of Duke <hi>Robert</hi>'s
Decease, the Nobles of <hi>Normandy</hi>
by him intrusted with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
during his Sons Minority,
found themselves soon involved in
many Difficulties, by the open
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49830:52"/>
Factions of some Nobles, who
envied their Greatness; and by the
private Practices of others, who
being derived from some of the
former Dukes, resolved to set up
their Pretences to the Succession,
but masqued their Designs at first,
and herded with the common Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
against the present Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration.
The Governours,
faithful to the Trust reposed in
them by the Father, and the Feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they had sworn to the Son,
esteemed the Presence of the young
Prince necessary to support their
Authority and his Title, and
thereupon prevailed with the King
of <hi>France,</hi> to send him into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy;</hi>
which he did accordingly,
with great Honour to himself, and
Kindness to the young Duke, as
well as Satisfaction to all his Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Subjects; but to the Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49830:52"/>
of those, who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Discontents rather against
the Governours, than the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</p>
            <p>No Prince ever came so early
into the Cares and Thorns of a
Crown, nor felt them longer, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in Difficulties and Toils,
in Hardships and Dangers; His
Life exposed to the Arms of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
the Plots of Assassins: His
Reign embroiled by the Revolts
of his Subjects, the Invasions of
his Neighbours; and his whole
Life, though very long, spent in
the necessary and dangerous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of his own Title and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or in the ambitious Designs
of acquiring greater: Yet none
ever surmounted all with more
Constancy of Mind, Prudence of
Conduct, and Felicity of Fortune;
By all which, he seems born to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49830:53"/>
have been rather a great Prince,
than a happy Man.</p>
            <p>His first Contests and Dangers,
arose from the declared Competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Pretenders to the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Dutchy, who favoured
by the Defects of his Birth, and
grounding their Title upon their
own legitimate Descent; found so
many Followers at home, and such
Assistance from some neighbouring
Princes, that agreeing together
against the present Possessor, though
disputing among themselves upon
their own Rights, they raised
great Forces, and constrained the
young Duke to appear, not only at
the Head of his Counsels, but of
his Armies too, by that time he
was full seventeen Years old.</p>
            <p>These civil Wars continued long
with many various Successes, bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Encounters, defeating and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49830:53"/>
of Troops, surprising, sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
besieging, relieving of Towns,
and wasting of Countries, till at
last, the Duke by his Vigilance,
Prudence, Courage, and Industry,
subdued totally, not only the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
but the Hearts of all his Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors
and Enemies at home, and
forced them to quit both <hi>Normandy</hi>
and <hi>France,</hi> and seek new Fortunes
or at least Protection in <hi>Italy,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Banners and Service of those
Northern Princes, who had first by
assisting their Friends, and then pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
their own fortunes, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Masters of <hi>Apulia, Calabria,</hi>
and <hi>Sicily.</hi> So great was the Prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess
and Conduct of those brave <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Adventurers,</hi> that from <hi>Pruhans,</hi>
as the <hi>French</hi> called them, because
they could not stay at home, but
left their own Country to seek
Room in foreign and distant Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49830:54"/>
they became Possessors and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns,
in less than two hundred
Years, of one noble Dutchy in
<hi>France,</hi> a great Kingdom in the best
Parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> and a greater yet, and
more renowned in the <hi>British Isle,</hi>
and thereby exchanged the savage
Woods and barren Mountains of
<hi>Norway,</hi> for three of the fruitfullest,
fairest, and most pleasant Countries
in the Western Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and which had been observed both
before and since, to produce the
bravest Bodies and Courages of any
Provinces among their Neighbour
Nations.</p>
            <p>The Defeats and final Overthrow
of Competitors at home, gave Duke
<hi>William</hi> no long Quiet, for another
appeared from abroad, more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
than any of the former:
This was <hi>Martel</hi> Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> that
was not only a Prince of great Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49830:54"/>
but yet more formidable,
by the Alliance and Assistance of
the King of <hi>France,</hi> who jealous
of the <hi>Norman Greatness,</hi> thought
it both wise and just to prevent its
further Growth, and abate a
Neighbour's Power, before it grew
too high, and perhaps out of his
Reach, by the Conduct, Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Fortune of such an aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Prince.</p>
            <p>To this end, and upon small
Pretences (which never fail a strong
Invader) he encouraged, if not set
on foot the Earl of <hi>Anjou</hi>'s Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
gave him first his Countenance and
Assistance, to justfie his Claim
and pursue it by Arms, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
engaged in an open and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
War against the Duke; this
he prosecuted with much Passion
and Violence, imploying in it not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49830:55"/>
only all the Forces he could raise,
but his own Person to command
them, attended by many, the chief
Nobles of his Kingdom, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great Persons of his Allies.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>William</hi> lost nothing of
his Temper or Courage upon the
Approaches of so great a Storm,
but prepared first for his Defence,
till flesht with Success in many
Encounters, and trusting to the
Bravery and Affections of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
though much inferior to the
<hi>French,</hi> he brought the Quarrel to
the Decision of two fierce Battels
in two pitched Fields: The first
ended in an entire Victory on the
Duke's side, with the Slaughter of
three Parts of his Enemies, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to above thirty thousand Men:
This Loss however rather enraged
than discouraged the King of
<hi>France,</hi> who gave himself or his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49830:55"/>
Enemies no Quiet, till he engaged
the <hi>Normans</hi> in a second Battel, with
greater Forces and Rage on both
sides, but with the same Success
the former had ended. In this Field
the King of <hi>France</hi> lost the Flower
of his Army, the greatest part of
his Nobles, and hardly escaped
himself in Person. But that little
availed this unfortunate Prince,
who was so sensible of the Loss,
and as he thought, dishonour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by so unequal a Match, that
he had not the Heart to survive it
long, but died of Grief, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
gave an end to this War, and
left Duke <hi>William</hi> a calm and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Reign, till he disturbed his
own and his Neighbours Quiet,
by new and greater Adventures.
But to discover their Causes, and
judge better of the Events, we
must have recourse to the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49830:56"/>
of the former Reigns, both
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the
great Commerce and Intelligences
that were thereby grown, for many
years past, between these two
Courts and Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward,</hi> for his Piety, surnamed
the Confessor, the last King of
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Race in <hi>England,</hi> had by
the Persecution of his Enemies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Reign of <hi>Harde-Cnute</hi> the
<hi>Dane,</hi> been forced to leave <hi>England,</hi>
and seek shelter in <hi>Normandy,</hi> where
he was kindly received, nobly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by the Duke, lived long
there with many <hi>English;</hi> who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to his Right, followed his
Fortunes, and shared in the Causes
and Reliefs of his Banishment;
some found Imployments, others
Alliances, All, favour and kind
reception in <hi>Normandy.</hi> These mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
good Offices, produced so
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49830:56"/>
much kindness between the Givers
and Receivers, that 'tis by some
Writers reported, King <hi>Edward</hi>
during his Residence in the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Court, promised Duke <hi>Robert,</hi>
that in case he recovered the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England,</hi> and died without
Issue, He would leave him the
Crown. The first happening, and
<hi>Edward</hi> restored by the Power of
Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> or rather the general
Discontents of the <hi>English</hi> against
the <hi>Danish</hi> Race and Government;
'Tis certain, King <hi>Edward</hi> after his
Restoration, or rather first Acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the Crown, ever appeared
more favourable and partial to the
<hi>Normans,</hi> than was well resented
by his <hi>English</hi> Subjects in general;
but Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> and his Son <hi>Harold</hi>
were so offended, that they made
it the Cause or Pretence of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Insurrection, and were
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49830:57"/>
forced upon the ill Success there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to leave the Kingdom, and fly
into <hi>Flanders,</hi> though after restored
and received by the King, rather
by Force than any free and willing
Consent.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>William</hi> after the end of
his Wars with <hi>France,</hi> had turned
his Thoughts to the common Arts
and Entertainments of Peace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating
the Abuses of his State,
and the Disorders introduced by a
long Course of Wars and Violence,
adorning his Palaces and Houses of
Pleasure, building Churches and
Abbies, and endowing them with
great Bounty and Piety: After
which he made a Journy into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
where he was received and
entertained by King <hi>Edward,</hi> with
the same Kindness himself had
found in the <hi>Norman</hi> Court; for
which, like a good Prince, he was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49830:57"/>
much pleased to make this Return
of Gratitude as well as Justice. In
this Visit, 'tis said by some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
that the Duke gained so far
upon the Esteem and Kindness of
the King, that he then renewed
to the Son in <hi>England,</hi> the promise
he had formerly made the Father
in <hi>Normandy,</hi> of leaving him the
Crown by Testament, in case he
died without Issue.</p>
            <p>Some time after the Duke's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
<hi>Harold</hi> Son to Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi>
and Heir of his great Possessions
and Dependances in <hi>England,</hi> was
forced by a Storm (as he at least
pretended) upon the Coasts of
<hi>Normandy;</hi> and to refresh himself
after the Toils and Dangers of his
Sea Voyage, went first to the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Court, and after some stay
there, to that of <hi>France;</hi> and was
in both entertained like a Person,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49830:58"/>
known to be of so great Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Power in <hi>England.</hi> But
his last Visit at <hi>Paris</hi> was thought
designed only to cover the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of his first in <hi>Normandy;</hi>
Where he engaged to assist that
Duke with all his Friends and
Force in his Claim to the Crown
of <hi>England</hi> upon King <hi>Edward</hi>'s
Death; which happening not long
after, <hi>William</hi> claimed the Crown
by virtue of a Testament from that
King, and of an Engagement from
<hi>Harold:</hi> But he on the contrary,
denied any such Testament from
the deceased Prince, alledged an
Appointment made by him at his
Death for <hi>Harold</hi> to succeed him,
disowned any Promise made in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Duke, and making the
best use of the Credit and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
gained by his Father and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in a crasie and diseased State,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49830:58"/>
during the soft Reign, of a weak
though pious King; <hi>Harold</hi> set up
bodly for himself, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Right, beyond the Peoples
submission (interpreted for their
Consent) and was Elected King, by
those Nobles and Commons of
his Friends, or indifferent Persons,
who assembled at his Coronation,
leaving to <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted,
but yet unregarded Right
of Succession; and to <hi>William,</hi> a
disputed Plea, from the alledged
Testament of the deceased King.</p>
            <p>The Duke, fond of those ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Hopes he had framed early,
and nourished long, and spighted
at the perfidious dealing of <hi>Harold</hi>
towards him, and his Insolence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>English</hi> Nation, in seising
the Crown and Government,
against all Justice, or so much as
Pretence of Right (which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49830:59"/>
made use of to cover the
most lawless Actions) assembles
his Estates of <hi>Normandy,</hi> exposes
to them his Claim to <hi>England,</hi> the
Wrong done him by <hi>Harold,</hi> his
Resolutions of prosecuting both
with his utmost Power: The Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as well as Justice of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise;
The hopes of Success from
his own Right, and the hatred in
<hi>England</hi> of the Usurper, as well
as the Friends and Intelligences he
had in that Kingdom; The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Spoils and Possessions, by
the Conquest of his Enemies, and
the Share he intended his Friends
and Followers, according to each
Man's Merit, and Contribution to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Advancement of his
Designs.</p>
            <p>Though the generality of the
<hi>Normans</hi> in this Assembly, were
not at first very much moved by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49830:59"/>
these Discourses, as either doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Right or Success of so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
an Adventure; yet they
could not discourage what they
were unwilling to promote, since
they found the Prince had it so
much at Heart; who prevailed
with several of the greatest Bishops
and Nobles of <hi>Normandy,</hi> to make
him a voluntary Offer of what
Moneys, Men, and Ships, they
would each of them furnish to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
this Enterprise, as well as
of their own Personal Attendance
upon him, in so noble and just a
Design.</p>
            <p>This free and magnanimous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
of the greatest among them,
in some Degree spirited not only
the rest of the Assembly, but had
much Influence upon the People
in general, who grew Confident
of the Success: from the Greatness
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49830:60"/>
and Boldness of the Undertakers, so
as they fell into Emulation, who
should Engage soonest, and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
furthest upon this Occasion.</p>
            <p>The Duke, assisted to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
by his Subjects, began
to practice upon the Hopes and
Ambition of his Neighbours, who
weary of the long Quiet they had
lived in at home, since the Part they
had taken in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi>
Wars, begun to grow fond of
some new Action, and to look out
for new Adventures.</p>
            <p>The Duke had gained and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
so high Esteem and general
Reputation by the wise Conduct
of his Government, both in Peace
and in War, by his Justice and
Bounty, his Valour and his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
that he was renowned, not
only among his Subjects and his
Neighbours, but in the remoter
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49830:60"/>
Regions of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi>
and found a Concurrence in this
Design, from many Princes his
Friends, and some who had been
his greatest Enemies; He was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
and assisted with Money or
with Soldiers, by the Dukes of
<hi>Britain</hi> and of <hi>Brabant,</hi> the Counts
of <hi>Bologne</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and his
ancient Competitor the Earl of
<hi>Anjou:</hi> By many Princes of <hi>France,</hi>
the most considered in that Court,
as the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> Earls of
<hi>Poitou</hi> and <hi>Maine,</hi> excited by the
Honour of the Enterprise, or Fame
of the Leader, at a time when the
Infancy of their King gave them
no hopes of Action at home, and
left that Crown unconcerned in
what passed abroad. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
sent some choice Troops, and
experienced Commanders to serve
in this Expedition; and the Pope,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49830:61"/>
induced by the Fame of this Duke's
great Virtues, and Piety in the
whole Course of his Reign, which
had now lasted above Forty years,
sent him a Banner he had blessed
with several Reliques; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
was esteemed, according to the
Devotion of those Times, to have
justified his Title, and even sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his Arms.</p>
            <p>With all these Advantages this
brave Duke began and finished his
mighty Preparations, by a general
Concurrence of his own Nobles
and Subjects, and a Confluence of
most of the bold adventurous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in his Neighbour Provinces,
led by the Desires of Glory or of
Gains; The Princes, trusted his
Faith and his Promises which he
had never forfeited: The Knights
and Soldiers, relyed upon his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and his Fortune, which had
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49830:61"/>
never failed in the long and happy
course of his Reign.</p>
            <p>What the Number was of the
Army he brought over into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
is not distinctly related, or
well agreed; but must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to have been very great, by
that of the Ships wherein they
were imbarqued, which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Eight and Nine Hundred:
Besides, they were all chosen and
brave Troops, excellently Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined,
Commanded by gallant
Officers, strongly united by the
Love of their Prince, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by the common hatred of
<hi>Harold</hi> his Enemy, both at home
and abroad: A known Usurper,
cruel in his Nature, of <hi>Danish</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
and thereby ungrateful to
the <hi>English;</hi> a Hater of his own
Blood, and who had never tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
but over his own Brother;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49830:62"/>
and by a bloody Victory at <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
had lost the bravest of his
Troops, as he had done before the
Hearts of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>The Duke Landed his Army at
<hi>Hastings</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>October;</hi> and expecting a
general Submission of the <hi>English</hi>
to his Right and Title (pretended
from the Testament of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Confessor) or the Desertion of
<hi>Harold</hi> (as an Usurper) by his
own Army; He made at first no
show of invading a Hostile Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
but rather of encamping in
his own. Forbidding all injuries
to any of the Inhabitants; and all
Spoil of the Countrey about him:
And so continued with his whole
Army, in a quiet and peaceable
manner for about a Fortnight, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to refresh his Troops, or to
expect how his Claim to the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49830:62"/>
Crown, and Arrival upon it, would
be received in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after this Time expired, he
was soon rouz'd by the Approach
of <hi>Harold,</hi> who returned from the
Defeat of his Brother, and his <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Assistants,</hi> with all the Forces
he had employed in that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
and all he could invite
or collect out of the Countrey as
he passed. The first were stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Troops, Numerous and Brave,
which he kept for the defence of
his Person and Title, knowing they
were both generally hated in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
The last were ill disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined,
and worse affected, and
served only to increase the number
of his Army, which was very
great.</p>
            <p>Upon approach of his Enemies
he sent Spies into the <hi>Norman</hi>
Camp, who were taken, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49830:63"/>
used by the Duke; carried
through all his Troops, showed
their Discipline and Disposal, and
sent back with Rewards. At their
return they told <hi>Harold,</hi> that the
<hi>Normans</hi> looked rather like an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of Priests than of Soldiers, by
their great Silence and Order in
their Camp, as well as by their
Faces being all shaved.</p>
            <p>'Tis said the Duke before the
Battel, sent an Offer to <hi>Harold,</hi> to
decide the Quarrel between them
by single Combat, and thereby spare
their Subjects Blood: Which <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi>
refused, and said he would
leave it to God to determine. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which, his Brother desired him,
that he would not be present at the
Battel, because he had formerly
Sworn to Duke <hi>William</hi> to assist
his Title upon King <hi>Edward</hi>'s
Death; and rather leave it to them,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49830:63"/>
who had a juster Cause; and should
Fight only for Defence of their
Countrey, and without Breach of
Oath. But the Courage of <hi>Harold</hi>
was more than his Conscience, and
so both parts disposed their Armies
for a pitched Battel next Morning:
After the <hi>English</hi> had passed the
Night in Songs and Feasting, and
the <hi>Normans</hi> in much Devotion.</p>
            <p>The Fight began with great Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and equal Bravery as well as
Order on both sides. The <hi>English</hi>
were cruelly gauled by thick Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Arrows from the <hi>Norman long
Bows,</hi> before the Battle joyned;
which was a Weapon then unused
in <hi>England,</hi> and thereby the more sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising,
by Wounds coming from
Enemies so far out of reach, and
not suddenly to be revenged. But
when they came up to close Fight,
the <hi>Normans</hi> were hewed down by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49830:64"/>
the <hi>English Bills,</hi> which of all Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
gives the most ghastly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
Wounds. Besides, their
Points were so strong and so close
together that no Charges of the
<hi>Norman Horse</hi> could break the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Ranks,</hi> though the Duke assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them so often, and with so
great Bravery, that he had three
Horses killed under him in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
But finding them continue
firm. He at length by a Signal,
caused a sudden Flight to be feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his <hi>Normans</hi> that were most
advanced: Upon which, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
easily deceived by their own
Courage as well as Hopes, began
such an eager Pursuit, as by it they
dissolved their Ranks that had been
otherwise impenetrable. Upon this
Incident, before expected, and soon
discovered by the Duke, and upon
another Signal given, the <hi>Normans</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:49830:64"/>
returned with greater Fury than
before; broke into the disordered
Body of the <hi>English;</hi> routed and
pursued them to a rising Ground,
where their broken Forces made a
Stand, fell again into Order, and
encouraged by the Speeches, but
more by the brave Example of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,</hi>
they renewed the Fight, and
made a mighty Slaughter of the
<hi>Normans,</hi> as they endeavoured to
force them against the disadvantage
of the Hill which they defended.</p>
            <p>The Fierceness and Obstinacy
of this memorable Battel, was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
renewed by the Courage of the
Leaders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where-ever that of the
Souldiers began to faint; till the
<hi>Normans</hi> leaving the Assault of
the Hill, too obstinately defended,
and keeping a little distance, fell
again to their Arrows, with one
of which, <hi>Harold</hi> was shot quite
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49830:65"/>
through the Head, and fell to the
Ground: And by his Death gave
the Victory and the Field to the
<hi>Normans,</hi> which had hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
doubtful on both sides; and
seemed thus far to have been Fought
with equal Courage and with equal
Loss. But the Flight of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
upon <hi>Harold</hi>'s Fall, soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
it, and was followed by
a long and bloody pursuit of the
<hi>Normans,</hi> which continued till
Night; and left mighty Numbers
of the <hi>English</hi> slain in their Flight,
that had been safe in the Battel;
and the rest of them wholly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed,
though covered by the
Night: So different are the effects
of Courage and of Fear, and so
Just the Rewards of both; the
first, which seeks dangers, often
avoids them; the other, often runs
into them, by endeavouring to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49830:65"/>
escape them: Much greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
falling in all Battels, by the
pursuit of those that fly, than by
the Slaughter of those that Fight.</p>
            <p>Nothing seems to show the
greatness of <hi>England,</hi> so much at
this time, as that <hi>Harold</hi> should be
able to assemble so mighty an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
to oppose this Invasion: And
find above Threescore Thousand
Men, Brave enough, not only to
Fight, but to lose their Lives in
his defence: For so many are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to have been slain of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
at this Battel of <hi>Hastings;</hi>
where he lost his Crown and his
Life together, and left the Field
with the Kingdom, to this brave
<hi>Norman</hi> Conquerour. This was
the Man, These the Forces, and
such the Circumstances that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to so famous an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
by which the Fate of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:49830:66"/>
was determined, in or about the
Year 1066.</p>
            <p>The Duke after this famous
Victory, resolved not to lose the
Fruits and Advantages he had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
gained, (which is often done)
for want of Speed or Vigour in
the Prosecution, wherein Celerity
is sometimes of more Consequence
than Force. Therefore, after the
Pursuit of his broken Enemies, and
a short Refreshment of his own
Army; He began immediately his
March towards <hi>London,</hi> where was
all the Strength then left in the
Kingdom, believing if he could
be Master of the Head, the rest of
the Body would follow, without
more Struggle or Resistance.</p>
            <p>In his March, he is said to have
exercised much Cruelty, towards
all he found in Arms, with great
Rigour and Oppression upon the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49830:66"/>
other Inhabitants, and Spoil of the
Countries where he passed, till en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into a Woody Part of <hi>Kent,</hi>
and advancing with his Vanguard
before the rest of his Army; he
found himself almost environed
with mighty Numbers of the <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Men,</hi> who had concealed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Wood by carrying e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Man a great Bough of a Tree,
like a Shield in his Hand. But
when they saw the <hi>Norman Troops,</hi>
and the Duke at the Head of them,
within their Danger, they began
on a sudden to march like a moving
Wood, till approaching their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
they threw down their
Boughs, and discovered on all Sides
a Multitude of brave armed Men,
ready to charge the <hi>Normans</hi> that
stood surprised and amazed at the
Strangeness of the Sight, which
appeared as if a Wood had been, by
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49830:67"/>
some Enchantment, transformed
into an Army: But the <hi>Kentish Men</hi>
approaching, made a Halt, and sent
the Abbot of St. <hi>Austins,</hi> to tell
the Duke, that all the Men of that
Province were there assembled to
defend their Country and their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
or to sell their Lives as
dear as they could; that if he would
swear to preserve them in those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Laws and Customs, under
which they and their Ancestors
had so long lived; they were all
ready to lay down their Arms, and
become his Subjects; if not, he
must prepare to fight with Men
that had resolved to lose their
Lives rather than their Liberties
and Laws. The Duke finding he
was too far advanced to joyn the
Body of his Army before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
and unwilling to venture
all his Fortunes and Hopes against
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49830:67"/>
such numerous Bands as these ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and of so desperate Men,
granted to all the Inhabitants of the
Province of <hi>Kent,</hi> the Preservation
and free Enjoyment of all their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Laws and Customs under the
<hi>Saxon Reigns;</hi> swore the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of his Grant, received their
Homage, and so pursued his March.
This is represented as a forc'd Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
to a subsequent voluntary Act
of this Prince, whereby he made
or confirmed the same Concession,
in general to all the rest of the
Kingdom. And though this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
of the <hi>Kentish Men</hi> be not
recorded with great Evidence of
Truth or Agreement of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
or of Time (for some Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
place it before his first Arrival
at <hi>London,</hi> others after, and upon
an Expedition to reduce the Castle
of <hi>Dover</hi>) yet it is related by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49830:68"/>
Authors, and is so generally
received by vulgar Tradition,
that it seems not to be omitted:
But when, or however it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or whether at all or no, is not
material to the History of this
Prince, or to the following Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Institutions of his Reign.</p>
            <p>In the City of <hi>London,</hi> besides
the great Numbers and Riches of
the Inhabitants, were retired most
of the great Nobles of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
both Ecclesiastical and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
who had not been engaged in
Action of either Side, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
what would be the Issue of this
strong and violent Convulsion of
the State. Upon Decision of the
last Battel, they all consulted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Citizens, what was
best to be advised and done for
their common Interest and Safety,
as well as of the whole Kingdom,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49830:68"/>
which was like to run their Fate,
by following their Example: Many
of the secular Nobles were for col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
what Forces they could,
and making a stand, either in the
Field or in the Town, and thereby
trying their Fortunes, or at the
worst making Conditions, for they
could not bear, that their great
Possessions and Lands should lie
at the Mercy of a Prince, whose
Will might be as boundless as his
Power, and who had so great a
Train, to be rewarded at their Cost,
and by the Spoils, if he pleased of
the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Citizens</hi> feared the hostile
Entrance of an incensed Army, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a weak Resistance, and the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Loss of their Possessions, which
consisting chiefly in Moveables,
might be seized in a Day, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipated,
past any Recovery by
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49830:69"/>
the very Grace of the Prince, or
succeeding Composition between
him and the rest of the Kingdom:
They thought no Forces could be
collected, either in Time upon so
sudden an Approach, or with
Strength enough to make Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
in a Body that had lost so
much Blood, and without a Head
to command them, or upon any
Treaty to manage their common
Interests to the best Advantage, and
so they were disposed to submit to
what they esteemed the Fate of the
Kingdom: The Arch-bishops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and the rest of the Clergy
were a sort of State apart, within
the State it self, having a Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
independent (as they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and were usually allowed in
that Age) upon the secular Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
they held their Lands and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
in the Kingdom, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49830:69"/>
Tenure than the Laiety pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and feared not to lose them
under any Prince that was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
which made them more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
of what Race, or by what
Title he held the Crown, and so
more easie to fall in with the
Stream of any Changes or new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions:
Besides, they were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
with the Fame of this Prince's
Piety, and the Opinion of his
Right having been determined by
the Pope's approving and assisting
it with his Benediction: They
thought, as well as the Citizens,
that this Torrent was not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
that a faint and fruitless Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
would but exasperate the
Duke, and make him <gap reason="illegible: obscured" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> continue
as well as begin his Reign, like a
Conqueror, and therefore esteemed
the wisest Part, was to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
his Right, and thereby tempt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49830:70"/>
or perswade him into a safer and
easier Form of Government, both
for himself and his Subjects, as a
just and lawful King.</p>
            <p>The Clergy was in very great
Authority at this Time, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all sorts of People in the
Kingdom, having enjoyed and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
it here, during the whole
Course of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Reigns after
those Kings became Christians in
this Island; nor could any other
Authority rise so high, and spread
so far, as growing from so many
Roots: They were allowed to be
the Guides and Instructors of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in all spiritual Worship and
Divine Service, and even the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spencers
of those Graces and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures
upon which depended the
Rewards or Punishments of a
future State; which being greater
and longer than those of this Life,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49830:70"/>
gave them more Influence upon the
Minds of Men, than any secular
Jurisdiction that can extend no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
They had mighty Possessions
in Lands throughout the Kingdom,
as well as other Riches, from the
Bounty of pious Princes, of devout
and innocent People, and from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others, who thought to expiate
Crimes, or cover ill Lives by these
kinds of Donation to the Church.
These Possessions were esteemed
sacred, and, as much went into
this Stock every Age, so nothing
ever went out; and all the Lands
in the Kingdom might in the
Course of Ages, have held of the
Church; if this Current had
not been stopped by the Statute of
<hi>Mortmain</hi> in the Time of <hi>Edward</hi>
the first. 'Tis recorded, that of
sixty two thousand Knights Fees
that were reckoned in <hi>England</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49830:71"/>
the Reign of this first <hi>Norman
King,</hi> there were in that of King
<hi>Iohn</hi> twenty eight thousand in the
Hands of the Church. This gave
the Clergy (by the Dependances of
those that held under them in so
great Numbers) a secular Power
annexed to their Ecclesiastical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
They had besides, all the
little Learning which was in those
ignorant Ages, and passes for Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
among those who want both,
gives a Faculty, at least of discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
though perhaps not of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
better than others, and gains
more Attention, and easier Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
from vulgar Auditors: Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they were united more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other State upon one common
Bottom, and in pursuit of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Interest, which was always
pretended to be the Greatness of the
holy Church, but indeed was their
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49830:71"/>
own, and the Honours, Power,
and Riches of the Church-men, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than of the Church. By these
Circumstances, and the Advantage
of such a complicated Strength, the
Clergy came to such an Authority,
that they were Arbiters, if not of
all Affairs, at least of all Contests in
the Kingdom, and turned the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
which way soever they fell in,
were still applied to by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and often by the unjuster Side;
had the chief Sway, and were the
chiefest Instruments in all those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Revolutions of State, irregular
Successions, and even Usurpations
of the Crown that happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Time of the Conquest,
and the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third;
which may easily be observed and
cannot easily be wondered at by all
who read the Story of those Reigns,
and consider what has been said up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49830:72"/>
this Subject, important enough
to excuse this Digression.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Conqueror,
upon his March to <hi>London,</hi> and the
Consultations there how to receive
him. The Opinions and Councils
of the Bishops and Ecclesiasticks
easily prevailed, and seem to have
had more Reason, as well as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
than the rest: So it was
unanimously resolved, not only to
submit to a Power they could not
oppose, but to acknowledge a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
they would not dispute. The
Duke, upon his Approach to the
City, was received with open
Gates and open Arms, at least
without the Appearance of any
Reluctance or Discontent, any
more than of Resistance: He claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Crown at his Arrival, by
the Testament of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
Confessor, without any mention
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49830:72"/>
of Conquest, which was infinitely
grateful to all the Nobles and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of the Realm, whether it
was a Strain of his own Prudence
and good natural Sense, or a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of those <hi>English,</hi> who had
either assisted or invited his Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or Apprehension of so great
and brave a People, if offended by
the Name of Conquest, and irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Dangers or Fears of a
lawless Arbitrary Power, to which
they had not yet their Hearts or
Strength broken enough, easily to
submit.</p>
            <p>He was crowned King at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
by the Arch-bishop of <hi>York,</hi>
who with <hi>Stigand</hi> Arch-bishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> had been the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters
of those Councils, by which
he entred upon so peaceable a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his Reign. At his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation
he took the Oath, usual

               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:49830:74"/>
in the Times, both of the <hi>Saxon</hi>
and <hi>Danish Kings,</hi> which was, To
protect and defend the Church, to
observe the Laws of the Realm,
and to govern his People justly:
After which he caused Fealty to be
sworn to him by all the Bishops,
Barons, and Nobles, with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
of the City, who had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
or attended at his Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and thereupon found himself
on a sudden settled in a calm and
quiet Possession of a Crown he had
so long aspired to, and so lately won
by one single, though violent Blow.</p>
            <p>This King was about two and
Fifty Years old upon his Accession
to this Crown, and is perhaps the
only Instance found in Story, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before or since, in this Island
or the rest of the World, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
and atchieved any great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Enterprise after that Age:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49830:74"/>
Whether the Decline of Nature
leaves not Vigor enough for such
Designs or Actions; or Fortune,
like her Sex, have no Kindness left
for old Men, how much soever she
favoured them when they were
young: But the Talents of Age,
which are Prudence and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
learnt best in the School of
Experience, and seldom joyned if
consistent with the warm Passions
of Youth, were now as necessary
to this Prince, for the Conservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Kingdom, as his long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
Application and bold Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
had been for acquiring it,
and how much he excelled in these
Qualities will be seen by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of his Reign.</p>
            <p>He considered very wisely, that
though he had gained the Crown
by the Assistance of foreign Forces,
and by the Decision of Arms,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49830:75"/>
yet these might not always be so
prosperous, if too often tried, and
the Number or Strength of his
Foreigners, bore no Proportion to
those of so brave and populous a
Nation, if they should unite on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Bottom of common Discontents,
of Dangers, or of Fears, and that
the Safety and Peace of his new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Dominion could be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
only by the general Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Security of his <hi>English Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:</hi>
And this was his first Care,
and was the best provided for by
the two first Actions of his Reign;
one was, That as he had claimed
the Crown, only from the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and wholly
avoided that odious Name of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
so he expressed upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
his Resolution to govern
the Kingdom as a legal Prince, and
leave the ancient Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49830:75"/>
of the <hi>English Nation,</hi> as they
had before enjoyed them: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was, that as he drew no Blood
but what was spilt in the Field,
so he seised only the Lands and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
of those who had been in
Arms against him, before his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to the Crown or after that
Time, by any Revolt or new Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
            <p>This wise Counsel made a clear
and sudden Distinction betwen
those <hi>English</hi> that were to feel any
ill Effects by this late Revolution,
and the rest who were left out of
Danger, and in the same State they
enjoyed under the Race of their
former lawful Kings, and so but
little sensible of the Change: The
forfeited Estates and Lands were
indeed seized with great Severity,
but the greatest Part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors
were silent in the Grave,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49830:76"/>
having been slain in the Battel of
<hi>Hastings,</hi> and Pursuit of that Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
those who remained alive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at once despoiled of all their
Possessions, were broken in their
Hearts, maimed in their Interest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
their Neighbours, and being
but few throughout the Kingdom,
in Comparison of those that were
safe, their Losses or Complaints
were little regarded by the rest, but
like wounded Deer, were deserted,
and even avoided by the Herd.</p>
            <p>Upon the Coronation of the
King at <hi>London,</hi> with the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Nobles and People in that
City, and his Care in publishing
throughout the several Countries;
these two Resolutions concerning
the Safety of their Properties and
Laws: All the Inhabitants of both
the adjacent and remoter Counties,
and of what Degree soever, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49830:76"/>
with universal Consent, submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his Government as to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of Heaven, but most of them
began to express, or al least pretend
a common Joy at the Fate of the
late Usurper, and the prosperous
Fortunes of the present King.</p>
            <p>His next Care was the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of those many and brave Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
and Soldiers, who had
followed him in this Expedition,
which he endeavoured to make
with Justice to his Promises,
and to their several Merits, as far
as the forfeited Lands and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
would reach, or any Treasures
or Debts he found here belonging
to the Crown: The Lands of the
<hi>English Barons</hi> who had opposed
him, he divided among the <hi>Norman
Barons</hi> that had attended him; those
of the Commoners among the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
what Offices were vacant,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49830:77"/>
he supplied with such as he had
not Lands or Money to reward;
such of the <hi>Normans</hi> as he could
not clear Accounts with at present
by any of these Ways, he distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the rich and numerous Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys
of the Kingdom, to be there
entertained till new Employments
should fall, or new Forfeitures or
new Supplies should come into the
King's Coffers by the large Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of the Crown, or the wise Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of his Treasures, which
had always been a Virtue of this
Prince, and exercised in his lower
Fortunes, as far as could agree with
the Bounty of his Nature, towards
those who deserved it by their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
or their Services.</p>
            <p>The Provision he made for so
many poor <hi>Normans,</hi> by disposing
them among the rich Monasteries
to share in their Plenty, seemed at
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49830:77"/>
least a temporary Imposition upon
the Clergy, and a Breach of those
Immunities they had enjoyed in
the <hi>Saxon Reign:</hi> For though one
chief End of the large Donations
made by so many Princes and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Subjects to the Church, was
intended for charitable Uses, by
Relief of the Poor, and the hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Entertainment of Passengers,
Pilgrims, and Strangers, yet this
Use was left voluntary, and at the
Choice of those who possessed these
Revenues: The <hi>Normans</hi> sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them were indeed Strangers
and Poor, but yet the most chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Monks had little Mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, or if they had, were
not willing to receive them within
their Convents, to be, not only Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of their Provisions, but Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers
of their Actions; however,
they complied at present, with the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49830:78"/>
Desires of the King, or the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of the Times, yet they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
took it ill of the King, and
for a Diminution of those Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or of that Favour they had
enjoyed under former Reigns:
Some thought he had an envious
Eye at the vast Riches of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
others, that he was jealous of
their Power, and suspected their
Affections to his Person and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and apprehended as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
a Change among them, upon
the Approach of any new Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as they had shewed upon the
last, in his own Favour. That for
these Reasons he had dispersed his
<hi>Normans</hi> as so many Guards, or at
least as so many Spies among
them: Whetever it was, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this Action bred the first Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness
of the Clergy towards this
King, and being followed by two
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49830:78"/>
other Strains of the same Nature
(which will be observed in their
Time) left an Imposition upon
him Memory, of Hardship, Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Oppression, or Exaction, which
he deserved as little as other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that have a fairer Character
in Story and common Opinion.
For the Monks having been the
only Writers remaining of those
Times, as well as some succeeding
Reigns, have left a Tincture of
their Passions upon the Actions of
the first Kings of this <hi>Norman Race,</hi>
and painted their Virtues and Vices
in fairer or fouler Colours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Ideas they had framed
of them and their several Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Actions in Favour or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the Church, that is, of
Ecclesiastical Persons or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges:
Such an Authority have the
Pens of learned Writers, always
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49830:79"/>
claimed nad possessed, as to pass
the definitive Sentence upon the
Memories of the greatest Princes
in the vulgar Opinion of Posterity.
Nor is it evident whether the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Name of Conqueror which
this King had so carefully avoided,
were entailed upon him by the
Flattery of his Friends or the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of his Enemies, among whom,
the Monkish Writers seem to have
been the chief and most invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
            <p>Whatever Motions were raised
upon this Occasion in the Minds of
the Clergy, none appeared in the
rest of the Body of the Realm, or
Mass of the People, most were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
because they either liked
their new King, or hated the last
Usurper; some were indifferent
to both, while their Estates and
Liberties were out of Danger, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49830:79"/>
such who were displeased with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
disguised their Resentment,
or were not taken notice of in the
Crowd. All conspired to make so
great a Calm succeed in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as is usual after a great Storm
is over; That the King having pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
some Months here in the Cares
and for the Settlement of his new
Dominions in <hi>England,</hi> made a
Journy to visit his old in <hi>Normandy</hi>
about the beginning of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
having been crowned at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
on <hi>Christmas-Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether this was undertaken
upon any Necessity of his Affairs
on that side, or to settle them so
as not to interrupt him here, where
he intended to reside, is not known;
or whether he took a Pleasure and
a Pride to show both his Subjects
and his Neighbours Princes, how
secure he esteemed himself in his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49830:80"/>
new acquired Dominions; but it
looks like a Strain of his usual
Boldness and fearless Temper, and
succeeded well, like the rest of his
Counsels and Resolutions; yet was
not this Journy undertaken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Prudence and Caution, in the
Choice of those Hands with whom
he left the Government in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and of those Persons he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to accompany him in the
Voyage. He committed the Rule
of the Kingdom to his Brother <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> and to <hi>Fitz
Aubar</hi> his near Kinsman, whom he
had lately made Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi>
He took with him into <hi>Normandy,
Stigand</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
who though a great Instrument in
his easie and peaceable Admission
to the Crown, yet had been discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
at his Coronation, which
had been perfomed by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49830:80"/>
of <hi>York,</hi> upon Pretence of
some Fault or Question about the
other's Investiture; with him he
took several other Bishops; the
Earls <hi>Edwin</hi> and <hi>Morchar,</hi> two
Persons of great Power and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances,
with many other <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Noblemen,</hi> of whose Faith or
Affections he was the least confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
and besides these, he took
with him a greater and much more
considerable Hostage for the Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
of <hi>England,</hi> though under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
of honouring him, or being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by his Company; This
was <hi>Edgar,</hi> surnamed <hi>Atheling,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
to <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, and
designed by him for Successor, as
was divulged among those of his
Subjects, that neither favoured the
Right or Pretensions of <hi>Harold,</hi> or
the <hi>Norman Duke.</hi> He had many
Disadvantages to ballance and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49830:81"/>
weigh down his Right which was
undisputed, as his foreign Birth and
Breeding, which was in <hi>Hungary</hi>
during his Father's Exile under the
Reign of <hi>Hardy-Cnute;</hi> The Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
and Hatred of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
<hi>Emma,</hi> a Woman celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in her Time, for the Suspicion
and clearing of her Chastity by the
<hi>Saxon Trial</hi> of Fire Ordeal, but
who having married <hi>Hardy-Cnute</hi>
after the Death of her first Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
had ever after more Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the <hi>Danish</hi> than the <hi>Saxon
Race:</hi> Bedsies, <hi>Edgar,</hi> though of
so good and virtuous Dispositions
as made him be stiled <hi>England's
Darling,</hi> yet they were such as
seemed to become an excellent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Person rather than a Prince, or
at least to have adorned an easie and
peaceful Possession of a Crown, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to force his Way to a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49830:81"/>
legal Right through the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Opposition of two power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Pretenders. However, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputed
Right (which they say ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dies) had left him so many
Friends in the Kingdom, that the
King thought it not safe to leave
him behind, upon his going into
<hi>Normandy,</hi> nor wise to tempt either
him or his new <hi>English Subjects</hi>
with such an Opportunity of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
any Commotions upon so fair
a Pretence.</p>
            <p>Besides these Cautions, he took
with him most of his <hi>French Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers</hi>
into <hi>Normandy,</hi> finding they
were not very agreeable here, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the <hi>English</hi> or to the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and pretending he was not
able to clear his Accounts with all
that assisted him, out of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
or Forfeitures here, and that
he would find out Ways of satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49830:82"/>
them, either in <hi>Normandy,</hi> or by
his Credit and Recommendations
to other Princes, where his own
Bounty or Abilities could not
reach.</p>
            <p>During his Stay in <hi>Normandy,</hi>
which was no less than the whole
Summer, his new Government in
<hi>England</hi> continued quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
though one <hi>Erick,</hi> called the
Forester, endeavoured to disturb
it, by calling in some loose Forces
of the <hi>Welsh,</hi> his Neighbours, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Herefordshire;</hi> but he was soon
suppressed, and they easily forced
back into their own Mountains by
the Vigilance of the Governours,
and the Vigour of those Forces he
had left here, disposed with such
Order, into the several Countries,
as to give Way or Time to no
growing Dangers that should arise
in any one Corner or from any
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49830:82"/>
single Discontent, while the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Humour of the People was
calm, and either satisfied with the
Change, or at a Gaze how this new
World was like to end. So that
the King, after having settled his
Affairs in <hi>Normandy</hi> to his Mind,
returned before Winter to enjoy
the Fruits of so many Dangers and
Toils as his Life had been engaged
in, resolving to spend the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it in <hi>England,</hi> as the nobler
Scene and greater Dominion, and
to cultivate with Care, an Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
he had gained himself with
much Hazard and Pains, and with
greater Glory.</p>
            <p>The King at his Return into
<hi>England,</hi> finding his new Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had continued calm and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
under the Authority of his
Brother and Council, had Reason
to believe it would be easily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49830:83"/>
so, under his own. For,
as the Absence of an ill Prince sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
fails of raising Disquiets and
Commotions among the People
in a Government which is obeyed
only from Fear; so nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
more to the Satisfaction
and Obedience of Subjects, than
the Presence of a good King, and
this is the Reason why all distant
Provinces, governed by Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or subordinate Authorities are
so subject to frequent Seditions
and Revolts, how lawfully soever
they are inherited, or how well
soever they are established after any
new Conquest or Acquisition; the
Force and Influence of Authority
growing still weaker by the
Change of Hands and Distance of
Place: This disposed the new
King to the Resolution he took at
this time, of making <hi>England</hi> the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49830:83"/>
Seat of his Person, as well as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and governing <hi>Normandy</hi> by
his Lieutenants, thereby forcing
the common Affections of Birth,
or Education and Custom, to yield
and comply with Reasons of
State, and preferring a foreign to
his natural Soil, though perhaps
seated in a better Climate, and at
that time more adorned and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
by the Commerce of <hi>France,</hi>
and other Countries upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
            <p>With this Resolution, and in
this Security, he applied himself at
his Return to the Arts of Peace,
and the Orders of his State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he as well excelled as in those of
War, and was framed, not only
for a great Prince but for a good,
to which he was inclined by the
Bounty and Clemency of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Dispositions by the Strength
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49830:84"/>
and Soundness of his Judgment,
and by the Experience of his Age:
His first Care was to provide for
the due Administration and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Laws and Justice,
throughout his Realm, and the
next was to introduce Order into
the common Course of his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
and manage it with so great
Proportion of his Expence to his
Receipts, as might neither leave
the Crown in Necessities, nor
the Subjects in Fears of new or
lawless Exactions and Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
Justice being the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Government, as Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is said to be the Sinew of
War.</p>
            <p>For the first; As he had sworn
at his Coronation, to govern by
the Laws of the Realm; so he
continued the ancient Customs
and Liberties of the People that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49830:84"/>
were called the common Law of
the Kingdom, which he caused to
be in Substance observed, both in
what concerned the Crown and
the Subject, though he introduced
several new Forms in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
or Execution of them: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the ancient Laws or Customs
that concerned the Descent of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Inheritances, or the Penalties
upon several Crimes; There were
two fundamental Laws of the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
or <hi>English Kingdom;</hi> The Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
by Juries of twelve Men,
wherein consisted the chief Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Mens Properties and Lives:
And the Burrough Law, which
was the greatest Security that had
been invented by the Wisdom of
our <hi>Saxon Ancestors,</hi> for the Peace
and Order of the Realm. The
first, I know, is by some Authors
mentioned as having been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49830:85"/>
by this <hi>Norman King</hi> out of
the Laws of that Country: But I
think it evident to have been an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
very ancient among the
<hi>Saxons,</hi> and to have been derived
and observed, during the whole
Succession of the <hi>English Kings,</hi>
and even in the <hi>Danish Reigns,</hi>
without any Interruption. Nor
does there want some Traces or
Appearance of it, from the very
Institutions of <hi>Odin,</hi> the first great
Leader of the <hi>Asiatick Goths</hi> or <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae</hi>
into <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Founder of
that mighty Kingdom, round the
<hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> from whence all the
<hi>Gothick Governments</hi> in these North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west
Parts of the World were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
by the spreading Conquests
of those Northern Races.</p>
            <p>'Tis recorded, that upon the
beginning of his Expedition, he
ordained a Council of twelve Men,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49830:85"/>
who should judge and decide all
Matters that came in Question, and
there being then no other Laws e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablisht
among those vast Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of rough People, going to seek
out new Conquests, and thereby
Seats to inhabit: It is probable
these twelve Men judged all Cases
upon Evidence or matter of fact,
and then gave their Sentence and
appointed Penalties according to
what they esteemed most agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Justice and Equity, so as the
twelve Men were at first both Jurors
and Judges: Their Judgments in Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
both real and criminal being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
approved as just and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
grew into President to succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Judges, and being received by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Submission, introduced the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of certain Sentences being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
in certain Causes and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Punishments being usually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49830:86"/>
upon certain Crimes. In
Process of Time and Multiplicity
of Business, the matter of Fact
continued to be tried by twelve
Men, but the Adjudgment of the
Punishment, and the Sentence
thereupon came to be given by
one or two or more Persons cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
out of such as were best versed
in the Knowledge of what had
been usual in former Judgments
upon like Cases, and as the first
Part was left to the Equals or
Neighbours of the Persons accused
(as most likely to do Justice to
one of their own Rank or Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
so the other was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Persons of Learning or
Knowledge in the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
Records or Traditions of
what had long passed in the
Course of Justice among that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Thus we find it evident that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49830:86"/>
in the <hi>Saxon Reigns</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> Causes
were adjudged by the Aldermen
and Bishop of the several Shires,
with the Assistance of twelve Men
of the same County, who are <gap reason="illegible: obscured" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
said to have been Judges or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants
to the two first, by such as
affirm or pretend this manner of
Trial, to have been drawn by the
Conqueror himself out of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
who is thereby said to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
in this, as well as some
other Forms, the <hi>Norman Laws</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the common Law of <hi>England.</hi>
'Tis true, that the same Custom
or Trial was used in <hi>Normandy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Conquest, and it is most
probable that neither the <hi>English</hi>
received it from the <hi>Normans,</hi> nor
these from the <hi>English;</hi> but that
both Nation deriving their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
from those ancient <hi>Goths,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
in several Customs or Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49830:87"/>
deduced from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Ancestors, which made this
Trial by Juries continue uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
in <hi>England,</hi> not only by the
<hi>Normans,</hi> but by the <hi>Danes</hi> also,
who were but another Swarm of
that great Northern Hive. 'Tis
true, the Terms of Jury and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
were introduced by the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
with many others, in the Stile
and Practice of our Laws, but the
Trials by twelve Men with that
essential Circumstance of their una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
Agreement, was not only
used among the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
but is known to have been
as ancient in <hi>Sweden,</hi> as any <hi>Records</hi>
or Traditions of that Kingdom,
which was the first Seat of the
<hi>Gothick Dominions</hi> in the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west
Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and it still
remains in some Provinces of that
Country. However, King <hi>William</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:49830:87"/>
caused this to be observed as the
common Law of the Kingdom,
and thereby gave great and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Satisfaction to the Body of the
People, both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Normans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Burrough Law had been
likewise anciently establish'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Saxons,</hi> whereby every
Shire was divided into so many
Hundreds or Burroughs, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at first of one hundred Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
therein usually inhabiting; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Hundred into so many Tith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
consisting of ten Families.
If any Person committed or were
accused of any Crime, the Tith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to which he belonged was
bound to produce him to Justice
before the Court of the Hundred
or County: If he fled, they were
to swear they were not Complices
of the Fact, and that they would
procure the Criminal whenever
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49830:88"/>
they could find him, if this failed,
in a certain time they would disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all the Goods he was possess'd
of within their Tithing, to satisfie
the Damage done to a Subject, or
a Fine to the King upon such an
Offence: If neither Person nor
Estate appeared, then the Tith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was answerable to a certain
Proportion, and if that were not
sufficient, then it was laid upon the
Hundred: By this means it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
every Man's Interest as well
as Duty, to prevent all Crimes and
Misdemeanors among their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and to discover the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
since they were otherwise to
share in the Penalty, and as the
rest of the Tithing was bound for
the Behavior of every Freeman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, so every Lord or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
was bound to answer in the
same manner for their Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:49830:88"/>
I know not whether any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Government, either
ancient or modern, ever invented
and instituted any Law or Order,
of greater Wisdom, or of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Force to preserve the Peace and
Safety of any State, and of equal
Utility to the Prince and People,
making Virtue and Innocence of
Life so necessary, by the easie Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
or Discovery, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Punishment of Offenders.
This Law the King caused like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to be severely observed during
his Reign, finding therein his own
Interest as well as his Peoples, and
the great Security of his new set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
Government.</p>
            <p>He confirmed all Mens Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Inheritances, and Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
invading none, either for his
own Benefit, or Reward of his
<hi>Norman Forces,</hi> or Friends, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49830:89"/>
the Possessions of such as
had opposed his Claim to the
Crown, which he pretended to be
a lawful Right, as derived from
the Testament of <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor,
and thereby was made a
Pretence of legal Forfeiture in all
that resisted him: But this Blow
to so many Estates and Families
was given at once, and no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed:
On the contrary, Justice
was administred equally to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Men,</hi> upon the Injuries of the
<hi>Normans,</hi> who presume upon the
King's Favour, in Prejudice of
Right, and of those Laws he had
confirmed or established. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
one memorable Instance remains
upon Record, even in those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
who were most severe upon
the Actions and Memory of this
Prince: It was an Action between
<hi>Warren</hi> a <hi>Norman,</hi> and <hi>Sherburn</hi> an
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49830:89"/>
               <hi>English Man:</hi> The first, by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of a Grant from the King had
entered upon the Lands of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who came into Court, and
pleaded, That he had never bore
Arms against the King, nor oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his Title or Accession to the
Crown, but had lived always
peaceably upon his own Lands,
and so was liable to no Forfeiture
by the common Law, but was
further secured by the King's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
immediately after his
coming to the Crown: Upon
which Plea a just Sentence was
given in favour of <hi>Sherburn,</hi> his
Lands restored, and <hi>Warren</hi> the
<hi>Norman</hi> cast and condemned to the
Costs of the Suit.</p>
            <p>He appointed Justices to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Peace, and administer Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
in every County, pursuant to
that which was used in the <hi>Saxon
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49830:90"/>
Reigns.</hi> For the Pleas of the Crown,
and those of greater Moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Subjects, he created
Judges of the most learned and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
he could find, and ordained
four Terms each Year consisting
of a certain Number of Days,
wherein Justice should be duly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred,
and all Suits heard in
such Places as the King should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
and find most convenient.
Besides these Orders he instituted
the Courts of Chancery and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,
the first for tempering
the Rigor of Laws according to
the Dictates of Conscience and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
and the other for determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Actions concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of the Crown, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Exactions or irregular Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in the Officers who levied or
received them as well as Defaults
or Delays in those from whom it
was due.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:49830:90"/>
For Taxes or Impositions unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual,
it does not appear, that he
levied any excepting one of Six
Shillings upon each Plow-land
throughout the Kingdom, nor is it
well agreed, at what Time or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what Occasion this was raised,
whether by consent of a general
Assembly, or by his own Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
By this indeed he imposed
<hi>Danegelt</hi> upon the Invasion of the
<hi>Danes,</hi> which happened once or
twice in this Reign, though with
little Progress or Success.</p>
            <p>This Tax was first raised by
<hi>Ethelreld</hi> upon the first Enterprise
of the <hi>Danes</hi> upon <hi>England,</hi> and
afterwards used by several of his
Successors upon the like Danger,
sometimes to repulse them by Force
and Arms, sometimes to evade
them by Bargains and Money,
wherewith they compounded for
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49830:91"/>
the present Dangers, but invited o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to come by such mean De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</p>
            <p>This Tax grew odious to the
People whenever it was raised up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any other Pretence than a <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Invasion,</hi> and though it was
sometimes levied, yet very seldom
and cautiously, by some few of the
<hi>Saxon Kings,</hi> and but once or twice
by this <hi>Norman Prince,</hi> and then
most probably upon the true natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Occasions, which had given it
the first Original: Thus, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
it is confounded with the
Tax before mentioned, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
applying it to the <hi>Danish Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
by some Writers, who seem
to take all Occasions of defaming
the Actions and Memory of this
King, and to avoid all just Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of any that were ill resented:
And this proceeded from the ill
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49830:91"/>
Talent of the Monkish Writers,
who measured the Virtues and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Princes, by the Opinion of
their Favour or Disaffection to
the Clergy, whom they accounted
or stiled the Church, though this
general Appellation is known to
comprehend not only such Persons
as were anciently chosen to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
the Offices of divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
but also all believing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
that composed such Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
to whom those Offices were
administred: Of this the King
seemed to be sensible, for though
he was a Prince of known and great
Piety, and so approved by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Popes during his Reign;
yet he appeared very little favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
if not something hard to the
Ecclesiasticks of this Kingdom, and
perhaps something bold with their
Privileges so long enjoy'd under the
devout <hi>Saxon Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:49830:92"/>
For the rest, he contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the usual Revenues of
the Crown; and by his great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Management, as well as
Moderation in his constant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
gained much Ease to the
Crown, and Satisfaction to his
People.</p>
            <p>The chief and ancient Branches
of the Crown Revenue consisted
of, First, the Lands of old reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as a Provision for the King's
Houshold, and so reckoned as
Crown-Lands: These at first
yielded only certain Quantities of
Provisions, as Beefs, Sheep, Wheat,
Hay, Oates, according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Lands, the Tenures by
which they held, and the Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Provisions found necessary
for the King's Houshold; What
Overplus remained, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
for and paid in Money,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49830:92"/>
according to Rates usual and agreed.
The next was a Duty reserved an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
out of every Knight's Fee,
which at first was constantly paid
as a Quit-rent, but being small,
came in time to be neglected by
the Kings, that contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the Military Attendance
of the Knights in their Wars,
and with levying sometimes a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Duty upon great or urgent Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
under the Name of Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuage,
which was burthensom and
odious till the Proportions and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
came to be ascertained.
Those Authors, who will make
the Conquerour to have broken or
changed the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and
introduced those of <hi>Normandy,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
this Duty of Escuage with the
Tenures of Knights Service and
Baronage, to have come over in
this Reign, as well as the Trial
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49830:93"/>
by Juries: But as enough has been
said to clear the last, so it needs
no Proof, that these with the other
Feudal Laws, were all brought
into <hi>Europe</hi> by the ancient <hi>Goths,</hi>
and by them settled in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
which they conquered of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and among the
rest, by the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as
well as by the <hi>Franks</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and
the <hi>Normans</hi> in <hi>Normandy;</hi> where
the use of their States or general
Assemblies were likewise of the
same Original.</p>
            <p>The last common Branch of the
King's Revenue consisted of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures,
both of Lands and Goods,
in Cases of Treason, and Fines or
some known mulctuary Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon other Crimes, which
were distinctly prescribed in the
<hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, even for Manslaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Murther it self; the Rigour
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49830:93"/>
of those Times not extending to
Blood, except in those Cases where
the common Safety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was concerned, by the danger
of the King.</p>
            <p>By all these Orders and Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the Clemency as well as
Justice, wherewith they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred;
the King how new so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his Reign, how disputed his
Title, and how disagreeable his
Person by a foreign Birth, yet so
far gained the general Affections
and Satisfaction of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Realm, who ask no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Security in their Estates
and Properties, that no Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
afterwards raised by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Clergy against his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though in Favour of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Right and Title, were ever
supported by the Commons, who
compose the Mass and Bulk of a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49830:94"/>
Nation, and whose general good
or ill Humour, Satisfaction or
Discontent will ever have the most
forcible Influence for the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Ruin of any State.</p>
            <p>Besides the good and profitable
Institutions and Orders of this
King, already mentioned, so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
approved, and so grateful to
the Commonalty of the Realm,
there were others of a different
Nature, and which had a contrary
Effect by distasting and disobliging
many of the chief Nobility, and
most or all of the Clergy, though
some were so cautious as not to
lose their Dignities or Revenues
by expressing their Resentments.</p>
            <p>The Offences taken by these
last, were, first, the abrogating
or surceasing the Judiciary Power,
exercised by the Bishops during the
<hi>Saxon Times</hi> in each County, where
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49830:94"/>
Justice was administred, and the
Bishop with the Alderman or Earl
of each Shire, sate as Judges in
those Courts, which encreased,
not only their Authority, but
their Revenues too, by a Share
they had with the King in all Fines
rais'd from the Issue of Causes
there determined: But all this was
abolished by the King's Institution
of Justiciaries, to administer Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
upon all Pleas of the Crown,
and others among Subjects at four
Terms of the Year.</p>
            <p>This gave particular Offence to
the Bishops, but another to the
whole Clergy; for whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they held all their Land by
<hi>Franc Almonage,</hi> and subject to no
Duties or Impositions, but such as
they laid upon themselves in their
Ecclesiastical Assemblies: This
Prince finding above a third Part
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49830:95"/>
of the Lands of the Kingdom in
Possession of the Clergy, and the
Forces of the Crown, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in Knights Service, lessened
in Proportion by their Immunity.
He reduced all their Lands to the
common Tenure of Knights Fees
and Baronage, and thereby sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
them to the Attendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the King in his Wars, and to
other Services anciently due, and
sometimes raised upon all Lands
that held in fee from the Crown.
This Innovation touched not only
the Bishops, but all the Abbots
throughout the Kingdom, many
of whom were endowed with so
great Lands and Revenues, that
in Right thereof they were upon
the regular Constitutions of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments,
allowed Session with the
Bishops as Barons in the House of
Lords.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:49830:95"/>
The whole Clergy exclaimed
against this new Institution, not
only as an Indignity and Injustice,
but as an Impiety too, and Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the sacred Rights of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Church, but their Complaints
were without Redress, though
not without ill Consequence.</p>
            <p>The Discontents among many
of the great Nobles arose chiefly
from two Occasion; The first
was the Rigor of the Forrest
Laws, and of their Execution;
And the other was, the King's
too apparent Partiality to his <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To know the Ground or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of these Forrest Laws, it
will be necessary to run up to their
Original. In the first Seisures
and Distributions made of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Lands</hi> by the conquering <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
besides those reserved to the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49830:96"/>
Kings, or divided among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and held by the Tenures, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Knights Service or of
Book-land as it was termed among
the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and thereby distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
from that of Villenage.
There were many great Tracts of
barren, wild, or woody Lands,
left undisposed, and in a manner
waste, so great Numbers of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Inhabitants</hi> having been extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
by the Wars, or retired
into <hi>Wales, Cornwal, Britanny,</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and the new <hi>Saxons</hi> not
content to share among them, any
Lands, but such as were fruitful
and fit to be cultivated: These
were enclosed or improved as well
as inhabited by the new Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and the others left wast as
well as undisposed to any certain
Owners: The whole Country
was, as has been observed, very
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49830:96"/>
full of all Sorts of wild Game in
the Time of the <hi>Britains,</hi> who
lived at large, without any Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
little Property, and subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
much upon Hunting, Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Fowling, which they had
all in common. Upon the enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
or cultivating of the fruitful
Lands by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the wild
Beasts naturally afraid of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
whom they found to be all
Enemies, fled into the wild,
woody, and desolate Tracts of
Land, where they found Shelter,
and fed, though hardly, yet out
of common Sight and Noise:
And hereby all those Parts became
replenish'd with all Sorts of Game,
especially with Red and Fallow-Deer,
and made all those several
Extents of Ground, which were
afterwards called Forrests.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:49830:97"/>
The <hi>Saxon Kings</hi> esteemed these
to belong to the Crown, by their
Right to all Possessions that
have no certain Owner, and by
their never having been disposed
upon the first Divisions of Land
in the <hi>Saxon Kingdoms,</hi> nor after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by any Grants of the
Crown. This Right was not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
nor any Use of it made,
further than for the King's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
which yet was not by them
restrained from the Nobles or
Knights that were Borderers upon
the Forrests, who were so mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in those more simple Ages, as
to commit no Excesses or destroy
the Game, which it was their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
to preserve both for their
Sport and the Quarry, and for
some use made of it for common
Pasturage among all the bordering
Neighbours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:49830:97"/>
               <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror not only
seised upon all these Forrests as
Part of his own Demesns, but
made a very large one in <hi>Hampshire,</hi>
besides those he found, by laying
wast, and leaving uninhabited
great Extents of Land which he
pretended to be fallen to the
Crown, by ancient Succession or
by new Forfeitures; and this he
called the <hi>new Forrest,</hi> which
Name after so long a Course of
Ages, it still retains.</p>
            <p>In all these Forrests he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an absolute Right and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in Pursuance thereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
new and arbitrary Laws of
his own, unused and unknown
before in this Kingdom, and very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the Moderation of the
<hi>Saxon Government.</hi> He confined all
hunting or fowling in these Forrests
to himself, or such as should have
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49830:98"/>
Right to it by his Concessions or
Permissions. He imposed Fines
upon all Trespasses committed in
them according to his own Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and which seemed much to
exceed the Fault or Value of the
thing. These he caused to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
with great Rigor and Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and thereby debarred not only
his Commoners, but his Nobles
too, from a Liberty they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
always enjoy'd, Though he
took care not to provoke the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners,
by leaving Pasturage
free for such of the Neighbours
who lived most upon their Stock,
and thereby took no greeat Offence
at the Restraint from their Sport
which they had not Time from
their Labour much to follow; yet
the Nobles and Knights, who va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
their Sports more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Gains, and made use of their
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49830:98"/>
Riches but for Encrease of their
Pleasures; resented this Restraint
as a sensible Injury, as an Invasion
of their Liberties, and even as an
Affectation of an Arbitrary Power
in this Particular, and from the
Exercise whereof he was only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,
by the Regards of his
Safety and Interest, in others of
more Moment and Consequence:
The great Nobles resented it yet
further, as an Indignity by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
their Privileges with the
Liberties of the Commoners, from
whom they esteemed themselves
distinguished by the usual Regards
and Respects paid them from the
Princes in their Degree, as well
as from the People. Nor does it
appear whether this violent Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Forrest Laws proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his passionate Love of
hunting (the only Pleasure to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49830:99"/>
which this Prince was addicted)
or from his Avarice, by so many
Fines to encrease his Treasure, or
from a Desire of being absolute
and arbitrary in one Part of his
Government, which he found he
could not be with any Safety in the
rest.</p>
            <p>For his Partiality to the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
though it was disguised, or
at least not evident in the common
Forms of his Justice, which run a
free and even Course, yet it was
easily discovered in that of his
Graces and Favour; the Civil
Offices, Ecclesiastical Benefices,
Places of most Trust about his
Person, and in his Realm, were
conferred generally upon his <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and besides these Advantages
and those of the Forfeitures that
fell upon his Entrance; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to have his Countenance,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49830:99"/>
his Conversation, his Confidence,
so that whatsoever the <hi>English</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of the Kingdom, the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
alone seemed to possess the
King.</p>
            <p>This might have been more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable
if the <hi>English</hi> had consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King as much as themselves,
and many of his Circumstances as
well as their own: They were
Strangers to him, or but new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;
they differed in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
in Manners, in Customs;
they had very lately differed in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and from Enemies in War,
were indeed now become Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
but rather as to a Conqueror
than a lawful Prince: The <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
spoke his Native Tongue,
were trained up in the same Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
acquainted with his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
from his Youth, had attended
him in his Court, followed him
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49830:100"/>
in his Wars, at Home and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and thought it but just
they should share in his Fortunes
as they had in his Dangers.</p>
            <p>However, many of the great
aspiring Spirits among the <hi>English
Nobles</hi> could not bear this Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Kings: They thought
the <hi>Normans</hi> ought to be provided
of Rewards or Honours in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
but those of <hi>England</hi>
should be conferred upon <hi>English:</hi>
Besides, they resented the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Testimonies of his Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the <hi>Normans,</hi> as much as
they could have done Injuries to
themselves, like generous Lovers,
who are more jealous and spited to
see their Rivals gain the Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Mistress, than the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
and had rather they should
have her Body than her Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:49830:100"/>
Upon all these Causes the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
of many chief <hi>English No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
and <hi>Prelates</hi> were grown to
such a Height, swelling more
within, the more they were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed;
that they wanted only a
fair Occasion to draw them to a
Head and make them break out
with Violence, and much Pain
and Danger to the State.</p>
            <p>This furnish'd them, either
by Fortune or Design, in the
third, fourth, or fifth Year of the
Conqueror's Reign; for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
are neither distinct, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
in assigning the Causes or the
Times of this King's Actions in
War, or Institutions in Peace,
by which their true Nature, and
that of the Prince would have
been best discovered; whereas
they content themselves to display
their Eloquence, or vent their
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49830:101"/>
Passions by relating general or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Events, what was done,
and what was suffered in his
Reign; by which some of the
<hi>Norman Writers</hi> endeavonr to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
him as a God, and some of
the <hi>English</hi> like a Devil, and both
unjustly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> was Nephew to
<hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputed
as well as undoubted
Heir of the Kingdom from the
<hi>Saxon Race:</hi> It was generally
thought that he had likewise been
designed by King <hi>Edward,</hi> a just
and pious Prince, to succeed him
in the Throne, and that his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
pretended by <hi>Harold,</hi> or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
by the Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
were fictitious, or at least neither
of them evident from any clear and
undoubted Writings or Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
<hi>Edgar</hi> was besides from the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49830:101"/>
Bounty of his Nature, the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of his Temper, the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of his Birth, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
of his unjust Fortunes,
much and generally beloved and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
among all the <hi>English</hi> both
<hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> yet he neither
opposed <hi>Harold</hi>'s Usurpation, nor
the <hi>Normans</hi> Conquest, whether
for want of Spirit to attempt so
great an Adventure, or upon Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
not to oppose such Powers,
as he found unresistable, and in
which so many Circumstances had
conspired, choosing rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himself with the Shades of a
private Condition, out of Danger
and Envy, or at least to attend
some future Occasions that might
open a more probable Way to his
Hopes and his Fortunes.</p>
            <p>He was at <hi>London</hi> among many
other Nobles, when the famous
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49830:102"/>
and decisive Battle was fought at
<hi>Hastings,</hi> and the News brought
of the Duke's Victory, and of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi>'s
Death: Those of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
who were for opposing the
Conqueror, were for declaring
<hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> King; the Citizens
of <hi>London</hi> were at first disposed to
the same Resolution; but the
Bishops and Clergy who had the
greatest Sway among both those
Orders, prevailed in this general
Council for a general Submission
to the Fate of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In Pursuance of this Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> with <hi>Stigand,</hi>
and <hi>Alred</hi> Archbishops of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and <hi>York, Edwin</hi> and <hi>Morchar,</hi>
two of the greatest <hi>English Lords,</hi>
the rest of the Nobles and Bishops
who had attended the Victorious
Duke upon his Way to <hi>London,</hi>
was well received by him, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49830:102"/>
with Bounty as well as Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
so that the young Prince, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
frequently at Court, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
the King into <hi>Normandy,</hi>
returned with him into <hi>England,</hi>
and lived there for some time like
one who had forgot his Birth and
his Title, though they were by
the <hi>English</hi> well remembred: But
at length, either weary of Rest,
or roused by other Spirits more
unquiet than his own, he resolved,
or at least pretended to make a
Journey into <hi>Hungary,</hi> where he
was born during his Father's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile,
had lived long and was much
beloved: He embarqued for <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
with his two Sisters, <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>
and <hi>Christine,</hi> but forced by a
Storm and contrary Winds, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured
by fairer Hopes he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon the Coasts of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
the first was given out, but the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49830:103"/>
last suspected, from the Event of
this Voyage. He was received by
<hi>Malcolm,</hi> the King, with great
Kindness, and Compassion of his
Disasters both at Sea and Land,
was resorted to by all the Nobles
and Gentlemen who had sheltered
themselves in that Kingdom, upon
Hate or Fear of the Conquest in
<hi>England,</hi> and was by them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
and honoured as the
true lawful Heir of that Crown:
Soon after his Arrival, the King
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> enflamed either with
the Beauty of the young Lady, or
with the Hopes of her Brother's
Fortunes, or upon former Concert
with the <hi>English Nobles,</hi> residing
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Intelligence with
others, discontented in <hi>England,</hi>
married the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> eldest
Sister of <hi>Edgar,</hi> and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
newly engaged in the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49830:103"/>
and Family of this noble but
unfortunate Prince.</p>
            <p>The Fame of this Adventure
was no sooner divulged in <hi>England,</hi>
than it raised a great, though diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Motion in the Minds of all
Men there, who were either well
or ill affected to the new King,
filling one Party with new Hopes'
and the other with new Fears, and
reasonably enough in both, from
all common Appearances. Many
Persons of great Note and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in <hi>England,</hi> repaired immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
upon it into <hi>Scotland,</hi> some
by easie Passages out of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Counties, and others out of
the remoter Parts of the Realm,
by more difficult Escapes, either
by Sea or Land. Among these
were the Earls, <hi>Edwin, Morchar,
Hereward, Seward, Gospatrick,</hi>
Men of great Estates and Power,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49830:104"/>
as was believed in <hi>England,</hi> with
many other Nobles and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
But that which seemed yet
of greater Influence and Authority,
was the Repair of <hi>Stigand</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Alred</hi> of
<hi>York,</hi> with divers other Bishops
and Prelates, who having been the
chief Instruments in making Way
for the easie Accession of Duke
<hi>William</hi> to the Crown, and for the
general Submission of the <hi>English</hi>
to his Reign, were presumed now
likely to prove of as great Moment
and Importance for the Restorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Support of a just <hi>English
Title</hi> in <hi>Edgar,</hi> as they had been
for the Admission and Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of one disputed and forreign,
of the <hi>Norman Dukes:</hi> Besides,
the Clergy being accounted the
wise and learned Men of that Age,
were esteemed most likely to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49830:104"/>
judge best of the Rights, and best
to foresee the Events in Disputes
of the Crown, and unlikely to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark
themselves in a Bottom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound,
upon either the Regards of
Justice or Success.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edgar,</hi> exalted with such a
Concourse of Nobles out of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
and the Hopes they gave
him of a greater from the People
there, when he should appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, resolved to lay claim
to that Crown, and with stronger
Arguments than those of a bare
Title or Right of Succession,
how just soever: For the <hi>Scotch
King</hi> had now assisted him with a
great Army, being induced to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
openly in his Quarrel, not
only by the Charms of his Wife,
or Compassion of her Brothers
hard Fortune, but by Reasons of
State as well as of Justice and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49830:105"/>
he feared the dangerous
Neighbourhood of so powerful,
aspiring and fortunate a Prince,
and apprehended his Ambition
would not cease with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of <hi>England,</hi> but extend it to
that of <hi>Scotland</hi> too, and reducing
the whole Island of <hi>Britain</hi> under
one Dominion, for which it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Nature to have been framed;
he thought it both wise and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to give some Stop to this
growing Power, before it became
too well setled at home, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
prepared for new Enterprises a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and that it was better car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
a War into <hi>England,</hi> than
expecting it in <hi>Scotland.</hi> He was
glad of so fair an Occasion to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his Quarrel, and by advancing
the Fortunes of <hi>Edgar</hi> to secure
his own; he had taken Measures
with <hi>Swayn</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49830:105"/>
enter the <hi>Humber</hi> with a powerful
Navy, whilst he with his Army
entred the Northern Provinces by
Land, and with the Sons of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,</hi>
at the same Time to invade
the West by the Assistance of
Forces to be furnished by <hi>Drone</hi>
King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to whom they
had fled upon the <hi>Norman Victory.</hi>
He presumed upon great Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
among the <hi>English</hi> in Favour
of <hi>Edgar,</hi> and by the Authority of
the Nobles his Associates, who
had represented the common Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
in <hi>England</hi> to be as great
as their own.</p>
            <p>These Hopes were not ill groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
nor the Designs ill laid; for
the <hi>Danish Fleet</hi> was ready to sail,
and the Sons of <hi>Harold</hi> with their
<hi>Irish Forces,</hi> landed and raised a
Commotion in the West, at the
same Time that <hi>Edgar</hi> with those
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49830:106"/>
out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> invaded the North,
where he found at first no Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but instead of Enemies, met
with many Friends prepared to
receive him, and increase his
Strength: He made himself Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of <hi>Northumberland, Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the Bishoprick of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
by the Defeat of <hi>Robert</hi> Count
of <hi>Mortain,</hi> who was there slain,
with seven hundred <hi>Normans.</hi> From
thence he marched without Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
as far as <hi>York,</hi> which was
defended by a strong Garrison of
<hi>Norman Soldiers.</hi> He besieged this
City, the Capital and Defence of
all the Northern Counties, and
assaulted it with that Fury, that
he carried the Town by Storm,
where all the <hi>Normans</hi> were put to
the Sword by the Rage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of the <hi>English Nobles</hi> in his
Army, many in the Heat of the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49830:106"/>
Assault, and the rest, after they
were entred and found no more
Resistance. After this Success,
<hi>Edgar</hi> remained some time at <hi>York</hi>
to refresh his Army, after so long
a March, and so warm an Action,
which had cost him the Lives of
many brave Men, and the Wounds
of many more. Besides, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
here to see his Army soon
increased by the Repair of many
Friends and Discontents out of the
Southern Provinces of <hi>England,</hi>
and by the Arrival of the <hi>Danish
Fleet</hi> in the <hi>Humber,</hi> according to
the Concert before agreed, and for
which he knew all had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
            <p>King <hi>William</hi> thus surrounded
with Dangers from the West and
North, and with Jealousies of his
new Subjects, of whose Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he had yet made no Trial, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49830:107"/>
than some few Years Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to his Government, was yet
undaunted at the News of all these
Attempts, nor any ways distracted
by such various either Dangers or
Fears. He applied himself to
those which were nearest by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Forces he had ready, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
into the West, under
experienced Commanders, and
prepared a greater Army both of
<hi>English</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> to march
himself into the North, after the
Commotions in the West should
be appeased: This happened to
be easier and sooner than he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
for the Attempt of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi>'s
Sons with their <hi>Irish Forces,</hi>
proved weak and faint, though
successful in the first Encounter,
wherein <hi>Ednoth,</hi> a brave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
on the King's side was
slain, with several of his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49830:107"/>
but the Sons of <hi>Harold</hi> being
defeated in a second Engagement,
and failing of any considerable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
or Insurrection of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
there, (upon which they had
grounded their chief Hopes) much
disappointed and thereby discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
were easily broken by the
brave <hi>Norman Troops,</hi> and forced to
return with the Remainder of their
<hi>Irish Forces</hi> into <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>William</hi> upon the happy
End of this Adventure, after the
best Orders taken for the Security
of the Southern Parts, in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
marched at the Head of a
brave Army in the North, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Forces of <hi>Edgar</hi> in a set
Battel, and by the Valour of his
Troops, the Discipline and Order
of his Army, and his own excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Conduct, defeated entirely the
united Strength of his Enemies,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49830:108"/>
sieged and took again the City of
<hi>York,</hi> defended by <hi>Waltheof,</hi> Son
to the Earl <hi>Syward,</hi> a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of great Valour, and much
admired in this Action, being said
to have stood firm at a Breach
made in the Wall, and with his
Sword to have cut of the Heads of
many <hi>Normans,</hi> as they pressed to
enter, and could do it but one by
one, by the Narrowness of the
Breach, so bravely defended.</p>
            <p>After this Defeat, and the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of <hi>York, Edgar</hi> retired into
<hi>Scotland</hi> with those of his Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
who were most desperate and
impatient of the <hi>Norman Conquest.</hi>
The rest of the <hi>English Nobles,</hi>
who had escaped the Battel, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
themselves to the King, and
came in upon publick Faith, took
a new Oath of Allegiance, and
were thereupon all pardoned, and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49830:108"/>
many restored, not only to their
Estates, but to Favour with the
King, who had found <hi>Erick</hi> the
Forrester, that had first rebelled
against him after his Coronation,
express great Fidelity, after his
Pardon obtained, and perform
good Service in this Northern Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.
He made <hi>Gospatrick</hi> Earl
of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and employed
him against the Dangers and Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
he apprehended from the
<hi>Scotch.</hi> He was so charmed with
the Valour and Constancy that
<hi>Waltheof</hi> had shewed in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>York</hi> (though so much to
his Cost and the Loss of so many
<hi>Normans</hi> by his Sword) that he
resolved to gain him at what Rate
soever he valued himself, showing
the Nobleness of his own Courage
and Virtue, by loving and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in his Enemies. He
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49830:109"/>
married this young Gentleman to
<hi>Iudith</hi> his Niece, gave him great
Possessions, besides those to which
he was Heir, and used him with
much Confidence, which was for
some time returned with Service
and with Faith.</p>
            <p>Most of the other Nobles that
came in upon Pardon of their Lives,
he despoiled of their Estates and
Offices, and bestowed them upon
his <hi>Norman Friends</hi> and <hi>Followers,;</hi>
some he kept Prisoners, whom he
thought most dangerous, as the
Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi>
and <hi>Edwin,</hi> a Man of the greatest
Power and Dependences, whose
Earldom and great Possessions in
<hi>Yorkshire</hi> were given to <hi>Alain</hi> Earl
of <hi>Britain,</hi> as were those of several
others at the same time, to others
of his Kindred or Friends. In the
room of <hi>Stigand</hi> he made <hi>Lanfranc</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:49830:109"/>
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> an <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
born, but an Abbot in <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
a Person of great Wisdom and
Temper, as well as Learning:
<hi>Thomas,</hi> his Chaplain, he made
Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> and obtained
the Approbation of the Pope, for
their Succession in those Sees (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Lives of the other two)
upon Representation of other
Crimes, or at least Vices, besides
their Rebellion against a King,
whose Title had been confirmed by
the Pope, as well as encouraged.</p>
            <p>'Tis not agreed at what Time
the <hi>Danish Fleet</hi> arrived upon the
Coasts, but 'tis certain they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Humber</hi> with about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Sail, some write that they
returned again without making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Attempt upon the Shore; that
their Commanders were enriched
with great presents from the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49830:110"/>
King, and their Soldiers supplied
with Provisions, and all treated
rather like Friends than Enemies;
whether their Arrival out of Time,
made them despair of any Success,
and whether that were occasioned
by cross Winds at Sea, or cross
Purposes in the <hi>Danish Court,</hi> is not
well known: For <hi>William</hi> the
Conqueror, after he was seated in
the Throne, feared no Insult from
abroad but by <hi>Danish Powers,</hi> and
Pretensions they had still upon <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
and the Preparations (as
was divulged abroad) of <hi>Swain</hi>
their King, for invading it with a
Navy of a thousand Ships. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he endeavoured to ward this
Blow, by slight rather than Force,
thinking his Safety on that side, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
purchased with Treasure than
with Blood. He practised private
Intelligences in the <hi>Danish Court,</hi>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:49830:110"/>
and by Force of Presents and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
gained to his Devotion some
Persons of Credit, and among the
rest, <hi>Adelbert</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
a Man of great Authority in
those Parts, and whose Advices
were much used and esteemed by
the <hi>Danish King.</hi> It was believed
the Artifices and Practices of these
Men eluded the first great Design
of a mighty Invasion, changed it
into an Assistance of the disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
here, with smaller Forces, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
them till the Time was past,
and disposed their Commanders to
return without Action, and their
Master to receive their Excuses
with Approbation, or at least
with Impunity.</p>
            <p>Yet there are other Writers who
say, the <hi>Danes</hi> landed in <hi>England,</hi>
made great Spoils, joyned Prince
<hi>Edgar</hi>'s Forces, wintered in this
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49830:111"/>
Kingdom, and returned in the
Spring, by the King's private Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Rewards among the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
as well as Bounty to the
Soldiers.</p>
            <p>The King after having establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Affairs in the North, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
triumphant to <hi>London,</hi>
where the first Action he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
was to take a new personal
Oath, before <hi>Lanfranc</hi> the new
Archbishop, and all the Lords
then present in that City; to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the ancient Laws of the
Realm established by the Kings of
<hi>England</hi> his Predecessors, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
those of <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor.</p>
            <p>This Action of the Kings was
the more applauded, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
accepted by the <hi>English,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was unconstrained by any
Necessity of his Affairs, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49830:111"/>
of any new Dangers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which he might have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to provide. And 'tis certain,
his Oath taken at his Coronation,
of preserving the ancient Laws of
the Realm, had been the chief
Occasion of his Safety in the late
and dangerous Convulsion of the
State, together with the ill chosen
Time of the <hi>Scotch Invasion,</hi> and the
Revolt of the Lords in Favour of
<hi>Edgar.</hi> For if such Attempts had
been made soon after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
while the Minds of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were generally in Motion, and
in Fear of what might succeed to
the Danger of their Properties, and
their ancient Liberties, upon that
new Revolution, his Throne had
not been only shaken, but in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Danger of being overthrown
by such a violent Concussion. But
the People having lived quietly
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49830:112"/>
some Years, under the Protection
of their ancient Laws, and in an
equal Course of known and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Justice, grew indifferent to
the Change which had been made
in the Rights or Succession of
the Crown, or to any new one
that might succeed. Besides,
though they were well affected to
<hi>Edgar,</hi> yet they disliked the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with which he came attended,
and hated the Entrance of a <hi>Scotch
Army</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> more than they
loved <hi>Edgar.</hi> They thought if he
succeeded, the Dominion would fall
under the <hi>Scotch,</hi> whilst he only
retained the Name; and if they
must be governed by Strangers,
the best was to have those they
were already used to, and so feared
least. The common Subjects of
a Kingdom are not so apt to trouble
themselves about the Rights and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49830:112"/>
Possession of a Crown as about their
own, and seldom engage in the
Quarrels of the first, but upon
some general and strong Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
that the last are in Danger.
So the Discontents and Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Nobles in <hi>England,</hi>
though encouraged and supported
by forreign Forces, yet failed of
Success against this new King and
his Government, because they were
not followed by any general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
or Sublevation of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which left all safe and quiet in
the Southern Parts, and main Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Kingdom, whilst he
marched with his Army against his
Enemies in the North: Nor is the
Safety of a Prince so firm and well
established upon any other Bottom,
as the general Safety, and thereby
Satisfaction of the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which make the Bulk and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49830:113"/>
Strength of all great Kingdoms,
whenever they conspire and unite
in any common Passion or Interest.
For the Nobles, without them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
are but like an Army of Officers
without Soldiers, and make only a
vain Show or weak Noise, unless
raised and encreased by the Voice
of the People, which for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is in a common Latin Proverb
called the Voice of God.</p>
            <p>No Prince ever made greater
or happier Experience of this Truth
than <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, both
in the Events of the last and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Dangers, which he so easily
surmounted, and in the whole
Course of his subsequent Reign,
which was infested by many new
Troubles, either in <hi>England</hi> or in
<hi>Normandy,</hi> that would have proved
fatal to him, if he had been distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the common Discontents or
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49830:113"/>
Insurections of his <hi>English Subjects;</hi>
for his present Calm was not of
long Continuance, the Clouds
soon gathered again and threatned
another Storm, and from the same
Winds, by which the last had been
raised.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Malcolm,</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> still
persisted in the Envy and Fear of
his neighbouring Power and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
still esteemed it his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
to joyn with those of <hi>Edgar</hi>
and his Dependants in <hi>England;</hi>
and thereby weaken the Force, or
disturb the Quiet of the <hi>Norman Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> before it
should by the Favour of Time,
and calm Seasons, take too deep
Root, to be afterwards shaken.
He raised a greater Army than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
with which he threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to invade <hi>England,</hi> and led
them himself, though still in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49830:114"/>
only of <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Title and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
to the Crown. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into new Practises with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the <hi>English Nobles</hi> who had
followed him, though unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the last Expedition, and were
resolved to repair their former
Losses by venturing greater, rather
than give over the Game. Nor
could the Hopes of the discontented
<hi>English</hi> ever die while the Root was
alive, and they were fomented by
the Malice, and encouraged by the
Forces of so powerful a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
joyned with so just Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as those of <hi>Edgar</hi> were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
esteemed.</p>
            <p>When the Preparations in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and Intelligences in <hi>England</hi>
were ripe for Execution, the Earl
<hi>Edwin</hi> made his Escape, and fled
towards the North, but was by
the Way murdered by some of his
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49830:114"/>
own Retinue. The Earls <hi>Morchar</hi>
and <hi>Hereward,</hi> who were already
upon the Wing, for the same
Flight, discouraged by this Misad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
durst not pursue it, but
yet already engaged too far to make
a Retreat, they made Way to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
themselves of the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi>
fortified there the best they could,
and hoped the <hi>Scotch Invasion</hi> would
divert the King's Forces from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
them before Winter, and
that the Season and Scituation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
would there cover them for
some Time.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the <hi>Scotch King</hi>
was discouraged from beginning his
March, by the News of these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asters
among his Confederates in
<hi>England,</hi> and chose rather to send
the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> and Earl
<hi>Syward</hi> out of <hi>Scotland</hi> to relieve
and animate those Lords, retired
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49830:115"/>
to the Isle of <hi>Ely</hi> than to enter <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
without Hopes of their mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some Diversion. But the King,
who never feared or slighted any
Dangers, and knew they were like
Diseases, to be taken in time,
marched immediately with his
Forces to the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> beset it
upon one side with a great Number
of flat bottom Boats, and on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
made a Bridge of two Miles
long, with incredible Diligence
and Labour, and with such Speed,
as both surprised and terrified his
Enemies within. So as despairing
of further Resistance, they all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the King's Mercy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Hereward,</hi> who with some few
Followers escaped through the
Fens, and through many Dangers
arrived safe in <hi>Scotland.</hi> The rest
of the Lords were sent Prisoners to
several Parts of the Kingdom,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49830:115"/>
where some remained during the
King's Life, and others dyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before
him, with whom they
could not be content to live.</p>
            <p>The King, after this small Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
so happily atchieved, and
the present Peace of his Kingdom
restored, yet considering the Root
of all his Dangers was in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and unwilling to take up present
Quiet and Safety, at too great an
Interest of Dangers to come, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to march into <hi>Scotland</hi> with
a powerful Army, and endeavour
to secure himself on that Side, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by a Peace or Victory. He
first sent <hi>Roger</hi> a <hi>Norman,</hi> then <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patrick</hi>
Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> with
Part of his Forces into the North
to oppose the <hi>Scotch Army</hi> that was
already entred those Provinces,
with great Spoils and Ravages of
the Country, and to keep them at
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49830:116"/>
a Bay till the King came up with
the rest of his Army. In the mean
time he assembled his Forces at
<hi>York,</hi> with the best Choice of Men
and Officers, and such Numbers
as he judged necessary for such an
Expedition, composed of <hi>English</hi>
and <hi>Normans,</hi> whose Emulation he
encouraged, with Promises of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and Hopes of establishing
their common Safety by the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of this Enterprise. From <hi>York</hi>
to <hi>Durham</hi> he met with many Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
and Difficulties from the
Wants of his Army, in a Country
which had been so lately wasted by
the <hi>Scotch Forces</hi> and his own, and
with which he was then contented
to prevent another Invasion. But
having surmounted all by his own
Care, and the Patience of his Men
from the Example of their Leaders,
he marched near the Borders with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49830:116"/>
any Opposition, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fame had made him expect
the <hi>Scotch</hi> would give him Battle
in <hi>England,</hi> and not the Trouble of
so long a March.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Malcolm</hi> their King, now
destitute of Hopes or Assistances
from any forreign Confederates, or
any Insurrections in <hi>England,</hi> after
the late Disasters of the discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Lords, began to cool the Heats
of his Blood, and instead of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
invading <hi>England,</hi> changed his
Counsels, and resolved only upon
a defensive War. At the News of
King <hi>William</hi>'s Entrance into the
Northern Provinces, he quitted
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> and with good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
retreated back to the Borders,
and there encamped his Army to
the best Advantage, without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any further Incursions into the
<hi>English Territories,</hi> either to secure
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49830:117"/>
his Provisions, or not to provoke
his Enemies, and render all Terms
of Reconcilement desperate, or
not to endanger his Retreat in Case
of any Disaster.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Borders, and thereby the
<hi>Scotch Army</hi> thought fit likewise to
encamp his own, both to refresh
his Soldiers, harassed by so long and
difficult a March, as also to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Forces of the Enemy, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their Countenance, their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and their Motions, and thereby
judge of their Designs, and direct
his own to the best Advantage:
So that for some Days the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
stood at a Bay, seeming both
prepared for a fierce Encounter,
and yet both content to delay it,
from a mutual Respect they had for
one anothers Forces and Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
They were indeed not much
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49830:117"/>
unequal in Numbers, nor in the
Bravery and Order of their Troops;
both Kings were valiant and wise,
having been trained up in Arms,
inured to Dangers, and much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled
at home in the Beginning
of their Reigns. They were now
animated to a Battle, by their own
Courage as well as their Soldiers,
but yet both considered the Event,
in the Uncertainty and the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
the Loss of a Battle might
prove the Loss of a Crown, and the
Fortune of one Day determine the
Fate of a Kigdom, and they knew
very well, that whoever fights a
Battle, with what Number and
Forces, what Provisions and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
or Appearances soever of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
yet at the best runs a Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and leaves much at the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Fortune, from Accidents not
to be foreseen by any Prudence,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49830:118"/>
or governed by any Conduct or
Skill. These Reflections began
to dispose both Kings to the
Thoughts of ending their Quarrel
by a Peace rather than a Battle, and
though both had the same Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yt each of them was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
first to discover it, least it
might be interpreted to proceed
from Apprehensions of Weakness
or Fears, and thereby dishearten
their own Soldiers, or encourage
their Enemies. The <hi>Scotch</hi> at
length began the Overture, which
was received by King <hi>William,</hi>
with a Show of Indifference, but
with a concealed Joy, and the more
reasonable, as having the greater
Stake, the less to win, and the
more to lose by the Issue of a Battle.
The first Parley was followed by a
Treaty, and this, after some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
by a Peace, concluded as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49830:118"/>
equal Forces, so upon equal
Conditions; each King to content
himself with the ancient Bounds of
their several Kingdoms, whereof
the Borders were agreed. Neither
to invade one anothers Dominions,
nor to assist the Enemies, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and protect the Rebels of each
other; Prisoners in the last or this
War to be on both sides released,
and Subjects who desired to return,
to be on both sides restored to their
Country and Possessions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edgar,</hi> the Principal or most
appearing Cause of the War, was
included and provided for in this
Treaty, to return into <hi>England,</hi>
make his Submission to the King,
renounce any further Claim to the
Crown, and thereupon, not only
to be restored to his own Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with his Friends and Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but to be provided of a large
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49830:119"/>
and honourable Maintenance from
the King during his Life. And
thus this Storm, which threatned
both Kingdoms, with such fatal
Dangers, and long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Consequences,
was of a sudden blown over; a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Calm restored in the whole
Island of <hi>Britain,</hi> and the two
Kings returned to enjoy the Fruits
of a Peace, to which they had both
contributed, by their equal Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and Prudence, as well as by
their equal Preparations for a
War.</p>
            <p>Soon after the King's Return,
<hi>Edgar</hi> repaired into <hi>England,</hi> where
he was very favourably received,
and all Conditions of the Treaty
performed, and ever after observed
with great Faith and Sincereness
on both Parts. He had his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Revenues (agreed by the
Treaty) fairly established; but
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49830:119"/>
being desirous to go to the Wars
of the Holy Land, which was the
common Humour of idle or devout
Princes in that Age: He was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by the King with great
Sums of Money, to prepare and
maintain a noble Equipage for that
Journey. He there gained much
Honour and Esteem, after which,
returning into <hi>England,</hi> he passed
the rest of his whole Life in the
Ease and Security of a large but
private Fortune; and perhaps hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
than he might have done in the
Contests and Dangers of Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
however they might have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.
A rare Example of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in Prince <hi>Edgar,</hi> and of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity
as well as Justice and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
in this King, and very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from several of his Successors,
who defamed their Reigns by the
Death of innocent Princes, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49830:120"/>
only been born to just Rights
of the Crown, without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
Means or Attempts to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
them, or endanger the Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors;
thereby staining their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
with the Blots both of Cruelty
and Fear. For as Clemency is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by Magnanimity and Fearless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Dangers, so is Cruelty by
Cowardise and Fear, and argues
not only a Depravedness of Nature,
but also a Meanness of Courage,
and Imbecillity of Mind; for
which reason it is both hated by all
that are within its Reach and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and despised by all that are
without.</p>
            <p>The King, upon his Return,
began again to apply himself to the
Arts of Peace, which consist chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the preventing of future, as
those of War, in the surmounting
of present Dangers. And as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49830:120"/>
raises the Power of a Crown
so much as weak and private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies
against it, rashly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
by some few Discontents, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supported
by any general Defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the People, faintly pursued,
and ending without Success; so
this Prince found his Throne and
Authority more firmly established
in all Appearance, by the happy
Issue of the two late Wars, and
the unfortunate Events of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
Nobles: And now esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself more at Liberty from
those Regards of his <hi>English Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
and their Laws, which his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settled
State had made necessary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his first Accession to the Crown?
He was provoked by the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of so many of the greatest <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Nobles</hi> after their Fealty sworn
to him: He was perswaded of the
general Disaffection of the rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:49830:121"/>
and that the late Insurrections
would have been found much deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
rooted and farther spread, if
they had been attended with any
Success. He thought the <hi>English
Lords</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> had too great
Dependance of their Tenants and
Vassals upon them, and had them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
too little upon the Prince:
Since they esteemed themselves nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bound to attend him in the
Wars unless they pleased, nor to
furnish the Expences unless by
their own Consent in their general
Assemblies; nor was he satisfied to
have them judge of his Necessities,
whom he thought likeliest to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
them or at least to desire
them. He believed the <hi>English</hi> in
general would, as long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the <hi>Saxon Laws</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> of
<hi>Government,</hi> ever be affected to the
Race of their <hi>Saxon Kings:</hi> And
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49830:121"/>
for this Reason he was thought to
have encouraged the Voyage of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>
for the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> by so large
Supplies of Treasure, under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of that Prince's Honour, but
from true Intentions of his own
Safety. Besides, he found his
Treasures exhausted by the great
Charges of his two last Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the just Rewards he had
promised both his <hi>Normans</hi> and
those of the <hi>English,</hi> who had well
and faithfully served in them.
Though he had once or twice (for
'tis left in doubt) levied the Tax
of <hi>Dane-gelt</hi> upon the Threats of a
<hi>Danish Invasion,</hi> and by an ancient
Prerogative of the <hi>Saxon Kings,</hi>
pretended or exercised upon that
Occasion; yet he found it was
not raised without great Murmur
and Reluctancy of the People as
well as the Nobles, who pretended
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49830:122"/>
to ancient Liberties, of paying no
Taxes imposed without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of their general Assemblies,
which began in this King's or his
Son's Time, first to be stiled Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
according to the <hi>Norman
Phrase,</hi> whereas they had by the
<hi>Saxons</hi> been called <hi>Gemoots,</hi> and by
their Latin Writers, Common
Councils or general Assemblies of
the Kingdom, though how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
is left uncertain, and has
raised much Argument and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
            <p>All these Considerations either
moved or augmented at this Time,
a Design or Inclination of this
King to change the whole Frame
of the <hi>English Government,</hi> to abolish
their ancient Laws and Customs,
and introduce those of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
by which he thought he should be
more absolute, and too powerful
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:49830:122"/>
to be again disturbed by any Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
at home, or any Invasions
from his Enemies abroad.</p>
            <p>So soon as he had digested and
began to discover this Resolution,
'tis not to be imagined what a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Discontent, and indeed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
it raised among all his
<hi>English Subjects,</hi> who under so
great a King, attended by his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Norman Forces,</hi> reckoned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no other Safety, but from the
Preservation of their ancient Laws,
whereof he had hitherto assured
them. Whereupon the whole
People, sad and aggrieved, as well
as the Nobles, in an humble Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but with universal Agreement
tendred an earnest Petition to the
King. Beseeching him, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his Oath made at the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation,
and by the Soul of St.
<hi>Edward,</hi> from whom he had the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49830:123"/>
Crown and Kingdom, under
whose Laws they were born and
bred, that he would not change
them, and deliver them up to new
and strange Laws which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
not.</p>
            <p>Upon this humble, but earnest
Application of the whole <hi>English
Nation,</hi> united in their Desires upon
this Occasion; the King, before
he resolved, thought at least it was
of Weight to deserve the best Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
and thereupon fell into
serious Consultations upon it with
his Council, whom he found much
divided in their Debates. The
<hi>Normans</hi> among them were for his
executing with Vigor what he had
determined, for abolishing wholly
the <hi>English Laws,</hi> introducing the
<hi>Norman,</hi> and maintaining his
Crown and Government, by the
same means he had gained them,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49830:123"/>
which was by Force and Arms.
They were encouraged in this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
by presuming it agreed with
the Kings Inclination, and were
confirmed by the pressing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Advices of his Brother
<hi>Odon,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> a Man of a
violent Nature, arbitrary Humour
and Will; who in the Time of the
King's Absence, and his being left
Vice-gerent, had exercised many Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
and cruel Exactions upon
the People, and had raised more Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and Hatred against the
King's Government, than any
Councils or Actions of his own.</p>
            <p>This ambitious Prelate aspiring
at the Papacy upon the next Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and despairing to obtain it by
any other Means than the Force of
Money, neglected or refrained no
Ways of heaping up Treasure,
thought none so sure of encreasing
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49830:124"/>
his own as by advancing the King's,
by an absolute Power over the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Purses of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> of the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
were of a different Opinion, but
being Parties in the Case, had been
little considered without the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of <hi>Lanfranc</hi> Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> who being born an <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
was impartial to <hi>English</hi> and
<hi>Normans,</hi> esteemed much by both,
and more by the King. He was a
Man of sound natural Sense and
universal Goodness, of general
Knowledge, known Virtue, long
Experience, and approved Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
free and disinteressed, and in
all Councils considering the King
more than himself, and his true
Service and Welfare of the Crown
more than his Humour or his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.
The King ever advised
with him in all the weighty Affairs
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49830:124"/>
of his Reign, allowed his Liberty
and encouraged it, knowing him
to be not only wise and good, but
faithful to his Interests, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
to his Person. Happy in the
Choice or Fortune of such a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor,
and more in the Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of hearing and weighing such
Advises as were never so different
from his own Opinions or Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Nor is any thing more
dangerous for a Prince than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
only with Persons that he
thinks are of his own Mind, or
will be so when they know it, nor
more pernicious in a Counsellor
than to give only such Advices as
he thinks most agreeable to him
that asks or receives them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> upon this great and
weighty Occasion, represented to
the King, how much his Safety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon the general Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49830:125"/>
of his Subjects. That of these
the <hi>English</hi> were much the greater
Part, both in Strength and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
that no People could be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
under any Laws, but such
wherein they were born and bred:
That all Innovations were odious,
but none could be more so than
this, as appeared by so universal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of the <hi>English,</hi> in their
Petition. That the Humility and
Calmness of it was more dangerous
than if any thing had been done in
hot Blood, and the Refusal would
be the more resented. That the
Laws and Constitutions of this
Realm had been digested by the
wisest Councils, and confirmed by
a long Succession of their Kings.
That under them the <hi>Saxons</hi> had
been good and loyal Subjects, and
their Kings, who ruled by these
Laws, never troubled with any
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49830:125"/>
Seditions or Insurrections of their
People. That besides Reason and
Experience, Religion was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Resolution, since the
King had already twice sworn so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly,
to observe them, so as a
Change of them now would be
taxed not only of Injustice, but
Impiety. That nothing was of so
much Moment to a Prince as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and none more than that
of being a Religious Observer of his
Word and Promise, but especially
of his Oaths, without which he
could never be trusted by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
or his Neighbors.</p>
            <p>The King heard and weighed
all their Reasons, and by them
formed his own Judgment, which
he ever trusted in the last Resort.
Upon mature Deliberation, as the
Case required, he at length resolved,
not only to continue the Laws and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49830:126"/>
Customs of the Realm, but to give
the People new, and more evident
Assurances of this resolution, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance
whereof he granted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
them by a publick and open
Charter, and thereby purchased the
Hearts, as well as Satisfaction of
his <hi>English Subjects,</hi> whereof he
reaped the Fruits, in his succeeding
Troubles in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and his
Wars with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet he could not refrain show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kindness he retained for
his own Country and Language,
introducing by Connivance or by
Countenance, several <hi>Norman Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,</hi>
and endeavouring to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
that Language to be general
in the Kingdom. To this End he
caused many Schools to be set up
for teaching that Tongue which
was a <hi>Bastard French,</hi> not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by the <hi>French</hi> themselves,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49830:126"/>
and not at all by the <hi>English.</hi> He
caused the Laws of the Kingdom,
which had been anciently written
in <hi>Saxon,</hi> and by <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
published also in <hi>Latin,</hi> to be
now translated into <hi>Norman.</hi> He
ordered all Pleas in the several
Courts to be made in the same Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and all Petitions presented
the King, and all Business of Court
to be likewise in <hi>Norman.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
new Terms, new Forms
of Pleading and of Process, new
Names of Offices and of Courts,
and with them all the litigious Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
and Subtelties of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Pleas</hi> and <hi>Conveyances</hi> (who
were a witty but contentious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
instead of the old <hi>English Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi>
in their common Suits,
Pleas, or Conveyances, which
were plain, brief; without Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,
made with good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49830:127"/>
kept with good Faith, and
so followed by little Contention,
and that determined by speedy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and Decision of Monthly
Courts in every County.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Saxons</hi> it was usual
to grant Lands and Houses by bare
Words, and with the Delivery of
some trivial Gift, as an Horn, a
Sword, an Arrow, a Helmet, and
yet the simple Honesty of those
Times and People left such Grants
little subject to any Disputes or
Contentions. But the Conqueror
reduced all Grants to Writing, to
Signature, and to Witnesses, which
brought in Cavils, and Actions
grounded upon Punctilious Errors
in Writing, Mistakes in Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which in much writing must
sometimes happen, either by Hast,
Weakness, or perhaps by Fraud
of Conveyancers, and with Design
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49830:127"/>
to leave matter of Contentions, by
which they subsist as Physicians by
Diseases.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all these Arts
of the Prince, and Industry of his
Ministers to introduce the <hi>Norman
Language</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> yet all was
frustrated by the Over-ballance of
Numbers in the Nations, in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the Strangers, and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a general Avertion in the
<hi>English</hi> to change their Language,
which they thought would be suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by that of their Laws and
Liberties: So that in this very
Reign, instead of the <hi>English</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Norman,</hi> the <hi>Normans</hi> began ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
by Force of Intermarriages,
ordinary Commerce and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to use the <hi>English Tongue,</hi>
which has ever since continued and
composed, the main Body of our
Language, though changed like
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49830:128"/>
others, by Mixture of many new
Words and Phrases, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
by this great Revolution,
but by the Uses and Accidents of
each succeeding Age.</p>
            <p>It seems very remarkable, and
very different what happened in
<hi>Scotland</hi> about this Time, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Subject, for upon the great
Recourse of <hi>English</hi> Nobles and
Gentlemen into <hi>Scotland</hi> seeking
Refuge from the first Dangers and
and Terrors of the <hi>Norman Conquest;</hi>
and afterwards of many more who
fled there in Pursuit of <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions,
and joyned with the <hi>Scots</hi>
in two Invasions of <hi>England;</hi> but
chiefly upon <hi>Malcolm</hi>'s fond Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of his <hi>English Wife,</hi> Sister
to Prince <hi>Edgar,</hi> his Learning and
commonly using or favouring her
Language, the usual Compliance
and Conformity of Courtiers to the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49830:128"/>
Customs of their Prince, and the
general Humour of Kindness in
the <hi>Scots,</hi> at that time to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Rights of <hi>Edgar,</hi> and to all
his Adherents, that lost their own
Country to follow his Fortunes;
the <hi>English Language</hi> grew in this
King's Reign to be generally spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
not only in the Court of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but in several Counties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
adjacent, and among most of
the Nobles in remoter Provinces,
and so it has ever since remained,
as have many <hi>English Families</hi> in
those Parts, habituated, and with
Time naturalized among them;
and the ancient barbarous <hi>Scotch
Tongue</hi> has been left current, only
in the more Northern or North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west
and mountainous Parts of that
Kingdom, and in the Islands that
seeem to have been first and most
entirely possessed by the <hi>Scyths</hi> or
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49830:129"/>
               <hi>Scots,</hi> who so long ago invaded
and conquered the Northern Parts
of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The contrary of this unusual
Change in Language, appears to
have succeeded in <hi>England,</hi> since in
a little time nothing remained of
the <hi>Norman Language</hi> in common
Use, besides the Translation of our
common Law, which though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the ancient <hi>Saxon
Streams,</hi> yet the Sound, and
Forms, and Practice came to be
<hi>Norman,</hi> like Rivers which still
run from their original Sources,
but yet often change their Taste,
from the Soils through which they
take their Course, and sometimes
from Accidents of great Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which for the present change
them, but leave them to return to
their natural Streams. A singular
and instructive Example, how
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49830:129"/>
strange a Difference there is in the
Compliance of a Nation, with the
Humour of a Prince they love, or
of one they fear.</p>
            <p>Besides these Changes in the
Language of our Laws, and the
Forms of Pleas which were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
disaffected by the <hi>English Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi>
this <hi>Norman King,</hi> either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Pretence of Justice and Piety,
or else of Necessity and Safety, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished
several ancient <hi>Saxon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,</hi>
and made several new,
which how reasonable or how use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
soever, yet bred ill Blood among
the Nobles and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi>
though the People contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the Continuance of
their ancient Laws, and thought
all they did or suffered for the
King's Service, well rewarded,
while they might preserve what
they called the Laws of <hi>Edward</hi>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:49830:130"/>
the Confessor: And the King was
so wise as often to renew his Oath,
to maintain them for the general
Satisfaction of the People.</p>
            <p>For the rest, he took all Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
and Judgment in civil Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
wholly out of the Hands of the
Bishops, where it had been placed
in the whole <hi>Saxon Succession,</hi> after
their Conversion to Christianity.
And restrained the Clergy to the
Exercise and Administration of
their Ecclesiastical Power. He
endeavoured to abolish two ancient
Forms of Trial used among the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
with great Reverence, even
during their Christian Worship,
though they were but Remainders
of their old Pagan Superstition,
but so rooted in the Opinion of the
People, as not to be dispossessed by
new Reason or Religion; These
were the Trials <hi>Ordeal,</hi> and of <hi>Camp-fight.</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:49830:130"/>
The first was either by Fire
or by Water, and used only in
Criminal Cases, where the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was strong, the Suspicions
great, but no Proofs evident. In
that of Fire the Person accused
was brought into an open Place
upon even Ground, several Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shares
heated red hot were laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, at unequal Distances,
over which they were to walk
blindfold, and if they escaped any
Harm were adjudged innocent; if
their Feet were burned by treading
upon the hot Irons, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as guilty. In the other of
Water the accused were thrown
into the Water, if they sunk im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
they were esteemed inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
and guilty if they swam, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because it seemed against the
Nature of heavy Bodies, or that
the clear Element would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49830:131"/>
them, but rejected them as
polluted Persons. The first Trial
was for those of better Condition,
and the other for those of inferiour,
and both were chiefly used upon
Accusations of Unchastity, of
Poysoning or of Sorcery.</p>
            <p>These Trials, though grounded
upon no Reason, yet were thought
approved by long Experience, and
the rather I suppose, because any
sncceeding Proofs of Innocence
were as difficult to find, as any
precedent Evidence of Guilt. And
they were commonly called the
Judgments of God, and performed
with solemn Oraisons, and other
Ceremonies that amused or rather
enchanted the ignorant People in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Opinion of their being sacred
as well as just.</p>
            <p>The Trials of <hi>Camp-fight</hi> were
performed by single Combat, in
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:49830:131"/>
Lists appointed for that Purpose,
between the Accuser and Accused,
and were usual in Actions both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and criminal, where no evident
Proof of Fact appeared from Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
or other Circumstances:
The Victor was acquitted, and
the Vanquished, if not killed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Field, was condemned.
These were performed with great
Solemnities, and either in Presence
of the King who granted the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
or of certain Judges, by him
appointed for that particular Case:
Both these Sorts of Trials this King
abolished as unchristian and unjust,
and reduced all Causes to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Equals or of a Jury of
twelve Neighbours, and by legal
Forms: Yet the last was some
few times used in succeeding
Reigns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:49830:132"/>
In the Beginnings of his Reign
the Kingdom had been much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by Outlaws and by Robbers,
and many <hi>Normans</hi> were secretly
murthered by the Hatred of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>
as they passed alone upon the
Ways or the Fields, especially in
the Night. To remedy this last
Mischief, he imposed a heavy Fine
upon the Hundred where the
Body of any <hi>Norman</hi> should be
found slain, whether any Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
were made or no of the Author
or Complices of the Fact. For
all Rapes and Robberies, he caused
them to be punished so severely by
cruel Mutilations of Members, and
Hardships of Labour, as left them
miserable Spectacles or Warnings
of their Crimes, during the rest of
their Lives. By the Rigour of
these Courses, and cutting off the
chief Cause of such Offences which
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49830:132"/>
grow from Idleness and Expences;
he reduced the whole Realm to
such Security, that 'tis recorded in
his Time, how a fair Maiden with
a Purse of Gold in her Hand,
might have travelled through the
Realm without any Danger offered
to her Honour or her Money.</p>
            <p>Besides, to prevent any Crimes
that might be committed by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
or Encouragement of the
Night. He ordered a Bell to be
rung in each Parish at eight a
Clock in the Winter, and nine in
the Summer, after which every
Man was to cover his Fire, and
stir no more abroad that Night:
And this was for that Reason call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Corfew or Couvrefew Bell.</p>
            <p>For the Safety of his State he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
several Castles in many Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
most convenient of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
among which was the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49830:133"/>
of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>New-Castle</hi> upon
<hi>Tyne</hi> (either built or by this King
much enlarged) and garrisoned
them by <hi>Norman</hi> or <hi>English Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
but all such as he most trusted,
and who were ready in Arms upon
all Occasions. Yet these Forts
were look'd upon by the <hi>English</hi> as
unnecessary in the Times of Peace,
and as Bridles upon the Liberties
of the People, rather than Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Dangers of the Crown.</p>
            <p>After these Institutions he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
himself to the Increase, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Establishment of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
and having (as he believed)
satisfied the People in general, by
the Confirmation of their ancient
and beloved Laws; he thought he
might be bolder with the Clergy
whom he knew to be generally his
Enemies, and whose Clamours he
the less feared, from his own known
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49830:133"/>
Piety, in frequenting Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
in building and endowing
several Monasteries, in Presents to
many Churches both in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Normandy,</hi> but especially in great
Treasures which he sent frequently
to <hi>Rome.</hi> Therefore, upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of his Enemies in the two last
Revolts (and such as were design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be their Complices) having
conveyed their Plate, Money, and
Jewels into the several Monasteries
throughout the Kingdom; he
caused all the rich Abbies to be
searched, their Money, Plate, and
Jewels which were not necessary or
of common Use in Divine Service,
to be seized; and thereby brought
at once a mighty Treasure into his
Coffers, but an inveterate Hatred
of the Clergy upon his Person and
Reign; and this was the last of
those Actions that by the enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49830:134"/>
Pens of the Monkish Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of that Age, left such a Charge
upon the Memory of this Prince,
by the Imputation of Cruelty,
Oppression, Violence, Exaction,
and the Breach or Change of Laws
of the Kingdom either Human or
Divine, though the same Authors
little consider how ill this agrees
with the high Characters they
themselves give of his Personal
Qualities and Virtues. Nor is it
probable that so vicious Actions
should proceed from so virtuous
Dispositions, or that so noble and
excellent Qualities of any Prince
should be esteemed by the present
Age, or celebrated to Posterity,
which had been accompanied by
cruel, infamous or depraved Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
during his Life.</p>
            <p>Having with these Spoils of the
Clergy, as well as by the many
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49830:134"/>
Forfeitures of the revolted Nobles,
replenished his Coffers for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
he extended the Care of his
Revenue, not only to what might
arrive in his own Life, but also in
the Times of succeeding Kings.
To this End he sent Commissioners
into all the several Counties of the
whole Realm, who took an exact
Survey, and described in a Censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Roll or Book, all the Lands,
Titles and Tenures throughout the
whole Kingdom. In this were
distinctly set down, not only eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Barony, each Knight's Fee, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Plow-land, but also what
Owners, by what Tenures, at
what Rents or Duties they held,
and what Stock they were posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of, and how many Villans
upon their respective Estates. All
Lands that held anciently of the
Crown, or were by this King dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49830:135"/>
upon Forfeitures, he subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to the usual Tenures of Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
or Knight's Fees, reserving in
all the Dominion in chief to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
some Quitrents or Fines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Death and Alienation, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Custody of all Heirs of
such Lands as were left under Age,
and the Disposal of their Fortunes,
besides what was assigned for their
Maintenance till they came to Years
of disposing their Estates and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>This Book was composed after
two old Examples of the same
kind, in the Times of <hi>Ethelbert</hi>
and <hi>Alfred,</hi> and was laid up as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
in the Church of <hi>Winchester,</hi>
and for that Reason as graver Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
say, was called <hi>Liber Domus
Dei,</hi> and by Abbreviation, <hi>Domes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
Book.</hi> The vulgar Account is,
that the Name was derived from
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49830:135"/>
the Nature, and so called because
every Man was to receive his
Doom by that Book, upon any
Dispute about the Value, Tenure,
Payments, or Services of his
Lands, upon Collection of the
King's ordinary Revenue, or the
raising of any extraordinary Taxes
or Impositions. And to make a
President for the future, or to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the great Expences the King
had been at, for the compiling this
great Roll of the Kingdom, six
Shillings was raised upon every
Plow-land, which made the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of it less agreeable to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
though every Man's Right
thereby received a new Evidence,
and no Injustice was complained
of, in the Digestion of so difficult a
Work, and of so various a Nature.
By this means the King came to
an easie and exact Knowledge of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49830:136"/>
his whole constant Revenue, and
so proportioned it to his Expences,
and the necessary Cares of having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a Fond or Reserve of present
Treasure in his Coffers; that after
this Time we never find him plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in any Difficulties, for want of
Money to supply many great Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
that ensued in his Reign, nor
tempted to impose any Taxes upon
his Subjects, or other Duties than
what were common and known,
and paid without Pressure or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
among the Commonalty
of the Realm; so as after all these
Institutions, he passed several Years
in great Tranquility at home, as
well as Honour from all his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Princes.</p>
            <p>About the thirteenth Year of his
Reign, he went into <hi>Normandy,</hi>
leaving his Brother <hi>Odon,</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> and created Earl of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49830:136"/>
               <hi>Kent,</hi> his Vice-gerent in <hi>England;</hi>
and little apprehending any Storm
after so long a Fit of fair weather,
or that He had left any ill Blood
behind him, that was like to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to a Head; with such an
Inflamation, and so dangerous
Symptoms, as soon after appeared.
But no Condition of Human Life
is ever perfectly secure, nor any
Force of Greatness or of Prudence,
beyond the Reach of Envy, and
the Blows of Fortune. Princes
as well as private Men, are often
in most Danger at those Times,
and in those Parts, they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the safest, as strong Towers
are sometimes taken on those sides
that are thought impregnable, and
so left undefended or little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This conquering King esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself now at Ease, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of his Life, and not only
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49830:137"/>
safe in his own Strength, but the
Satisfaction of his Subjects. The
<hi>English</hi> he had pleased in general,
by the Preservation of their ancient
Laws; the bravest and warmest
Blood of their Nobles was drawn
in the Battle of <hi>Hastings,</hi> or the
Wars with <hi>Scotland;</hi> their Power
was weakened by so many Confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
and the Retreat of many
more into <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
The <hi>Normans</hi> were strong and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
in <hi>England,</hi> and were his
own by Birth and by Interest;
the Ballance of these two Parties
seemed the Safety of the whole,
and it was not to be imagined, that
both should combine in any Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Crown. Besides, there
was left no Pretension of any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Right or Title than his
own, since <hi>Edgar</hi> had laid down
his, not only in Shew, but with
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49830:137"/>
firm Resolutions never to resume
them.</p>
            <p>But many of the <hi>English</hi> Nobles
still hated the Name of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
resented the Change of
Forms and Language in their
Laws, the Introduction of any
new Customs, but especially the
Rigor of the Forrest Laws, which
they knew to be arbitrary, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
not only a restraint of their
innocent Liberties, but an Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in particular to themselves.
Some of the chief <hi>Norman</hi> Lords,
who had obtained great Possessions
by the King's Bounty, and the
Confiscations of the <hi>English</hi> being
now invested in their Lands and
their Titles, began to grow fond
of their Laws, as the safest Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,
and though they had gained
their great Estates by the Favour of
the King, yet they were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:49830:138"/>
to hold them at his Pleasure,
and so joyned with the <hi>English</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in the Complaints of too great
Power, exercised by the King,
and the Jealousies of greater yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
to the Prejudice of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Constitutions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Diminution of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
or Dependances of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
Some of both Nations, and
equally ambitious Spirits, who
had been most favoured and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the King, yet valuing their
own Merits too high, or their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
too low, thought they had
nothing, because they had not all
they pretended, esteemed the King's
Favour or Bounty to any others, as
Injury to themselves, and were as
unsatisfied with what they had
gained, as others with what they
had lost.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:49830:138"/>
These Dispositions floating at
first in the Minds of several great
Nobles, both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Norman,</hi>
and enflamed by such of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks,
who had Credit in the
great Families of both Nations,
grew at length to downright Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,
of dispossessing the King
of his Crown, and introducing the
<hi>Danes,</hi> who were allied to many
great Lords in <hi>England,</hi> and were
esteemed by the <hi>Normans</hi> of the
same Race with their Ancestors.
The chief of this Conspiracy were
the Earls of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> of
greatest Power among the <hi>English</hi>
Nobility; <hi>Fitz-Auber,</hi> a <hi>Norman,</hi>
of near Kindred to the King, and
who had assisted him with forty
Ships, upon his <hi>English Expedition,</hi>
and been recompenced with migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Possessions in <hi>England,</hi> and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
Earl of <hi>Hereford.</hi> The Earl
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49830:139"/>
               <hi>Waltheof,</hi> who had been pardoned
his Revolt, upon the <hi>Scotch Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
married to the King's Niece,
and ever since intimately trusted,
as well as favoured by the King.
These entred secretly into Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
with <hi>Swain,</hi> King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
and with <hi>Harold</hi>'s Sons,
who were still refuged in <hi>Ireland:</hi>
The first ingaged to invade the
Northern Parts with a Navy of
three hundred Sail, the last, by
the Assistance of <hi>Drone</hi> King of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> to attempt the Western
Coasts with sixty Ships, and the
discontented Lords to make a
strong Insurrection in some of the
Northern Provinces, upon Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the <hi>Danish</hi> Fleet, which
was concerted to be soon after the
Kings intended Journey into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:49830:139"/>
These Measures were laid with
such Caution, and pursued with
such Secrecy, that all was ready
to be executed, before the King in
<hi>Normandy,</hi> or his Ministers in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
had either Notice or Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of any such Dangers or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.
<hi>Fitz-Auber</hi> had asked the
King's Leave some Months before
his <hi>Norman Iourney,</hi> to marry his
Sister to the Earl of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and
pretended some small Discontent at
his Refusal. Not long after his
Departure, he declared the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and the Day appointed to
consummate it in <hi>Norfolk</hi> with great
Solemnity, and the Recourse of
the nearest Relations, and most
intimate Friends on both sides, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom were the Earl <hi>Walthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of</hi>
and <hi>Eustace</hi> Earl of <hi>Bologne,</hi> who
came over on Purpose, to assist at
the Consultations here designed.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:49830:140"/>
At this meeting all was agreed in
what Parts of the Kingdom, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what Leaders the several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections
should be made, upon
what Pretences, and the Time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be when the <hi>Danish</hi>
Fleet should appear upon the
Coast.</p>
            <p>But some Delays intervening,
which are fatal to all Conspiracies
that are trusted into many Hands,
this was discovered some Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Danes</hi> arrived, but by
whom of the Accomplices is left
uncertain, though some write that
it was by Earl <hi>Waltheof,</hi> upon the
Conscience of so great an Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to the King.</p>
            <p>After the full and particular
Discovery of the whole Plot, and
all the chief Conspirators; <hi>Odon</hi>
the Vice-gerent, with the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and Advice of the King's
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:49830:140"/>
Council, immediately dispatched
away several Parties of the King's
best Troops, into the several Parts
where the Insurrections were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to begin, seised upon many
of the Conspirators, before others
had Notice of the Discovery, broke
the rest before they could draw to
a Head; took Earl <hi>Waltheof</hi> and
<hi>Fitz-Auber</hi> Prisoners, who were
beheaded upon this Occasion, and
many others imprisoned. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Execution was by the
King's Command out of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
or by the Rigor of his Brother <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and upon Pretence of Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
in so dangerous a Conjuncture,
is not recorded; but 'tis agreed,
that these two were the only No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
that were executed in <hi>England</hi>
during the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the
Conqueror, notwithstanding so
many Revolts, and so much Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49830:141"/>
to punish and revenge them;
which serves to make up that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of Clemency of Nature, that
is allowed this Prince, among his
other Virtues, even by those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
who are severest upon his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>Both the <hi>Danes</hi> and the <hi>Irish</hi>
Fleets were upon the <hi>English</hi>
Coasts, when they first received
the News of their Cenfederates
Discovery and Disasters, upon
which they returned to <hi>Denmark</hi>
and to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and after this Time
the <hi>Danes</hi> never again attempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Invasion upon <hi>England,</hi> nor
was this Conqueror any more infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
or disturbed by any of his <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Subjects, during the rest of
his Reign, finding the Conspiracy
wholly suppressed, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in perfect Tranquility upon
his Return, which he had yet
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49830:141"/>
hastened out of <hi>Normandy,</hi> upon
the Intelligence of his Danger in
<hi>England,</hi> and Ignorance how deep
it was rooted, or where it might
end.</p>
            <p>Nor was it easie to conjecture,
since it was believed by wise Men
in that Age, that the Weakness
and ill Success of this Conspiracy
proceeded chiefly from the Want
of some popular Pretension, that
might have raised a Commotion
of the People in Favour of the
Lords, and that if this had been
designed in Defence of <hi>Edgar</hi>'s
known Rights to the Crown, and
spirited by that Prince at the Head
of so many <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi>
Lords, as were engaged in it, the
Throne had been endangered by
this last Shake. But the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Prince <hi>Edgar</hi> had made his
first Pretensions too late, and his
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49830:142"/>
last Submissions too soon; and
the <hi>Danish</hi> Title was hated by the
Commons of <hi>England,</hi> though fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by many of the Nobles, and
thereby wanted the Foundation,
proper and necessary to raise any
firm Building. Thus the Infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of some Princes may be occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
only by ill timing their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
when to attempt, and when
to desist, in the justest Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;
and the Greatness of others
may be raised and preserved by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreseen
Accidents, where the
greatest Reach of Foresight and
Conduct might have failed. For
had <hi>Edgar</hi> been at Liberty to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
his Rights, upon this Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi>
Nobility, he might probably have
gained the Crown; and had not
some of the chief Complices disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the Conspiracy, the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:49830:142"/>
might as probably have lost
it.</p>
            <p>However these Fortunes came
to attend him, thus far of his
Reign, yet here the Curtain may be
drawn over the happy Scenes of
this Prince's Life, for the next
that must open, will represent him
in the Decline of his Age, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiled
in Domestick Quarrels,
which could neither end in Glory
nor in Gains, assaulted by his own
Children, opposed by his Native
Subjects, forced to use Strangers
to reduce them to Duty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
after two dangerous Revolts,
and when these Troubles were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased,
after much Anguish of
Mind, and many Dangers, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by a trivial Accident, and
without any Design in a foreign
War with a powerful Prince,
which though pursued with his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:49830:143"/>
Vigor and Fortune, it first
cost him his Health, and at last his
Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror had by
his Wife <hi>Matild,</hi> Daugter to <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi>
Count of <hi>Flanders,</hi> four Sons,
<hi>Robert, Richard, William,</hi> and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
besides several Daughters.
<hi>Richard</hi> was a Prince of the greatest
Hopes, but unfortunately killed by
a Stag, while he was hunting in
the new Forrest; his untimely
Fall was much lamented by the
King, but less by the People, who
interpreted it as a Judgment upon
him for the mighty Wasts he had
made to extend the Bounds of that
Forrest, and for the Rigor and
Oppression of the Forrest Laws.
The other three survived their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but with very different For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
as well as Merits, and very
unequally distributed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:49830:143"/>
The King, before his Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into <hi>England,</hi> had promised
his eldest Son <hi>Robert</hi> the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Normandy,</hi> in case he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
the Kingdom he then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
this Promise was made
before the King of <hi>France,</hi> and
challenged by <hi>Robert</hi> after the
King's first Establishment upon
the <hi>English</hi> Throne. But the King,
though he denied not the Promise
he had made, yet long delayed the
Performance, upon Pretence of
his unsettled State in <hi>England,</hi>
from the Discontents of his Nobles
and the <hi>Scotch Invasions,</hi> which
made it necessary for him to keep
<hi>Normandy</hi> as a Retreat upon any
great Misfortune, or Revolution
in <hi>England.</hi> Duke <hi>Robert</hi> seemed
content with these Reasons, whilst
they were justified by the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of any Dangers in <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:49830:144"/>
but perceiving they were ceased,
and yet the Delays continued, he
grew at length impatient, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the fourteenth Year of the
King's Reign assumed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Normandy,</hi> as sovereign,
and in his own Right, caused the
Barons to swear Fealty to him, as
to the Duke, and not as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Lieutenant, and was received
and obeyed by the <hi>Normans,</hi> who
grew weary of a subordinate Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and thought they
deserved the Presence of their
Prince among them, which they
had enjoyed since the first Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of their Possessions in
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, <hi>Robert</hi> was generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
as a Prince courteous, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and brave, though withal,
ambitious, unquiet, and uncertain,
yet these Dispositions, both of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:49830:144"/>
Prince and People, had not alone
induced him to engage in so bold a
Resolution, with such a Breach of
his Duty and his Trust, without
the Practises and Instigations of
the King of <hi>France,</hi> who grown
jealous of King <hi>William</hi>'s Greatness,
and envious of his Felicity, found
no better way of lessening both,
than to kindle this Fire in his own
House, and thereby the most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
to disquiet his Mind, as well
as to disjoynt his State, and divide
his Power. He therefore, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encouraged <hi>Robert,</hi> but combined
with him in this Attempt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to support him with his
Forces, if his Father disputed lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
the Justice of his Claim.</p>
            <p>The King, though at first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed
at the News of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence
in his Son, yet believing it
had no deeper Root, but what
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:49830:145"/>
would soon wither or be cut off,
by his Presence in <hi>Normandy,</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
immediately what Forces he
could raise, and with an Army of
his <hi>English</hi> Subjects, sailed over
now to invade <hi>Normandy,</hi> as he had
done before to invade <hi>England</hi> with
his <hi>Normans.</hi> A strange Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to befal one Prince, in so
short a Period of Time, and which
made as great a Change in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
as his Fortunes; for the
great Alacrity and Faithfulness
which the <hi>English</hi> expressed towards
him in this Expedition, gained so
far upon his Affections and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that in the rest of his Reign
and his succeeding Wars, he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to place his chief Trust in the
Courage and Loyalty of his <hi>English</hi>
Subjects.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> informed of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Preparations, neglected not
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:49830:145"/>
his own, and though surprised at
the Suddenness of his Arrival, to
which the Winds had conspired,
he could not oppose his Landing;
yet soon after he was in the Field at
the Head of a brave <hi>Norman</hi> Army,
and of two thousand Men at Arms
which the King of <hi>France</hi> had sent
to his Assistance. With these
Forces he marched against the
King, fell upon his Vanguard, and
by the Success of an Ambush he
had laid in an advantageous Pass;
he broke them, killed some, and
put the rest to Flight; then he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
against the main Body,
where the King commanded, and
by an unnatural Chance, he charged
his old Father with such Fury,
that by the Stroak of his Launce, he
wounded him in the Arm, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew
him to the Ground. The
King calling out upon his Fall, his
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:49830:146"/>
Son immediately knew his Voice,
and stung upon the sudden, with
the Conscience of his Crime and
his Duty, he leaped from his Horse,
raised his Father up from the
Ground, fell down upon his Knees,
begged Pardon of his Offence, with
Offers upon it, to return to his
Duty and Obedience. The King
moved by the same Force of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
received his Submissions, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave
him, and embracing him, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Adventure in Tears of Joy,
which had begun in Blood. The
Armies were as easily reconciled as
their Leaders, and all together
marched to <hi>Rouen,</hi> where the King
was received with all Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Joy, and the Duke compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented
upon his happy Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement
with his Father, nor were
those the last in this Croud of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycers,
who had been the chief in
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:49830:146"/>
promoting the Quarrel between
them.</p>
            <p>The King made no long Stay in
<hi>Normandy,</hi> dissembling the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or Resentment of what Part
the <hi>French King</hi> had played in this
Affair, but after having re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Quiet and Order of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
returned with his whole
Forces into <hi>England,</hi> left his Son
in the Government of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
trusting to his Duty, and the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
of his Subject there, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
had passed to give him the
least Suspicions of either. A true
Strain of the noble and fearless
Nature of this Prince, who was
rather made to surmount all Dangers
he encountred, by brave Actions
and judicious Councils, than either
to invite or anticipate his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
by Distrust and vain Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions,
which are but the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:49830:147"/>
Distractions of weak and timorous
Minds.</p>
            <p>Yet this Sincereness and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the King had not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
they deserved, for Duke <hi>Robert</hi>
having once tasted the Sovereign
Power, could not long digest any
Dependance upon another Will, and
lying still open to the Practises of
<hi>France,</hi> upon his Levity and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
relapsed the next Year into
his former Distemper, and assumed
again the Sovereignty of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
and as Duke thereof in his own
Right, which was again acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
and obeyed by the <hi>Normans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King upon the News of
this second Defection in his Son and
his Subjects, fell into great Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in it is said to have cursed
his Son, and the Hour wherein he
begat him, but soon returning to
himself, with his usual Judgment
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49830:147"/>
and Composure of Mind, gave pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Orders for preparing a much
greater Army and Navy, than he
had used in last Years Expedition;
and though both were shattered by
great Storms, he met with at Sea,
yet upon his Arrival in <hi>Normandy,</hi>
either the Fame of his Forces, or
the Lightness of his Son's Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or Remorse of his Duty, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> to offer
again his Submissions, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his Commands. The King
again received them, pardoned both
his Son and his revolted Subjects,
but forced now to more Caution
than he had used before, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
settled once more, the Peace
and Quiet of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and placed
the Government in safer Hands, he
took his Son with him into <hi>England,</hi>
and imployed him in the hard rough
Wars of <hi>Scotland</hi> against <hi>Malcolm,</hi>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:49830:148"/>
who upon the King's Absence and
Confidence of being long detained
by the <hi>Norman</hi> Revolt, and Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>France,</hi> had taken Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to pass the Borders with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and ravage the Northern Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though Duke <hi>Robert</hi> gained no
great Honour by this Expedition,
yet the King gained his End: For
the <hi>Scotch</hi> disheartned by his unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Return, and more by his
perfect Reconcilement with his
Son, returned home, upon the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the <hi>English</hi> Army, and
renewed the Peace which lasted the
rest of the two Kings Lives.</p>
            <p>About the same time, incensed
against the <hi>Welsh,</hi> for many Inroads
and Spoils upon the Frontier Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
he sent an Army against them,
subdued the plain and accessible
Parts of their Country, drove them
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:49830:148"/>
to the fast Holds of their Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
forced them to sue for Peace,
which he granted upon Homage
done him by their Prince, and upon
Hostages given for Performance of
the other Conditions.</p>
            <p>This fortunate and victorious
King seemed now to have passed
all the tempestuous Seasons of his
Life, and secure of Repose for
what remained, which was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
or most agreeable to the great
Decline of his Age. He was at
Peace with all his Neighbours, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
and honoured by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
feared by his Enemies, and
the Troubles of his Family were
wholly appeased, so that it was
hard for any Man to conjecture from
what Side any new Storm should
arise. But the Decrees of Heaven
are wrapped up in the Clouds, and
the Events of future things, hidden
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:49830:149"/>
in the Dark, from the Eyes of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Men. The wisest Councils
may be discomposed by the smallest
Accidents, and the securest Peace
of States and Kingdoms may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
by the lightest Passions as
well as the deep Designs of those
who govern them: For though
the wise Reflections of the best
Historians, as well as the common
Reasonings of private Men, are apt
to ascribe the Actions and Councils
of Princes to Interests or Reasons
of State, yet whoever can trace
them to their true Spring, will be
often forced to derive them from
the same Passions and personal Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
which govern the Affairs
of private Lives, as will be evident
in the Sequel of this King's Reign.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Normans</hi> were desirous to
have a Prince of their Race reside
among them; the King was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:49830:149"/>
to venture again, the ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of his Son Robert's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
or Inconstancy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sent him over into <hi>Normandy,</hi>
but joyned in Commission with his
youngest Son <hi>Henry,</hi> whose Duty
and Affection he most relied on,
both to observe the Actions, and
temper the Levity of his eldest
Brother.</p>
            <p>These two Princes agreed better
than is usual to Associates in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and governing the Province
with Moderation and Prudence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
Affairs there to such Order
and Tranquility, that having little
Business at home, they went to
seek some Diversion abroad, and
made a Visit to the King of <hi>France</hi>
then at <hi>Constance,</hi> who received
them with great Honour and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and as was thought, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Design of renewing old Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:49830:150"/>
with Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Prejudice: Whatever Affairs
might busie the Thoughts of that
King and the Duke, those of <hi>Lewis</hi>
the young Dauphin, and Prince
<hi>Henry</hi> were taken up with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Entertainments of Youth and
of Leisure, Love, Hunting, Play,
and other such Divertisements,
wherein the Similitude of Age and
of Customs made them constant
Companions. It happened one
Evening, that the Dauphin playing
at Chess at the Prince's Lodging,
lost a great many Games, and much
Money to Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> and grew
thereupon first into ill Humour,
and at length into ill Language,
which being returned by the Prince,
the Dauphin fell into Passion, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him Son of a Bastard, and
threw some of the Chessmen at his
Head: Upon which Prince <hi>Henry</hi>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:49830:150"/>
enraged, took up the Chess-board,
and struck the Dauphin with such
Fury on the Head, that he laid him
bleeding on the Ground, and had
killed him if his Brother <hi>Robert</hi> had
not retained him, and made him
sensible how much more it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to make his Escape than
pursue his Revenge, and thereupon
they went down immediately, took
Horse, and by the Help of their
Speed, or their own good Fortune,
got safe to <hi>Pontoise</hi> before they could
be reached by the <hi>French</hi> that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
them,</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France,</hi> exasperated
by this Accident and Indignity to
his Son, which revived an invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Malice or Envy he had against
King <hi>William,</hi> first demanded Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
but at the same time
prepared for Revenge, both by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
an Army to invade <hi>Normandy,</hi>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:49830:151"/>
and taking private Measures with
Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> to divest his Brother
<hi>Henry</hi> of his Share in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and leave the Dominion of
that Dutchy to the Duke according
to his former Pretensions, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon his Father's Promise,
wherein the King of <hi>France,</hi> as a
Witness, still pretended to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> seeing the
War inevitable, enters upon it with
his usual Vigor, and with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Celerity transporting a brave
<hi>English</hi> Army, invades <hi>France,</hi> and
takes several Towns in <hi>Poictou,</hi>
whilst the <hi>French</hi> took the City of
<hi>Vernon,</hi> by which Hostilities on both
sides, the first War began between
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which seemed
afterwards to have been entailed
upon the Posterity and Successors
of these two Princes, for so many
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:49830:151"/>
Generations, to have drawn more
noble Blood, and been attended
with more memorable Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
than any other National
Quarrel we read of, in any ancient
or modern Story.</p>
            <p>King <hi>William,</hi> after taking of
several Towns, and spoiling much
Country in <hi>Poictou</hi> and <hi>Xantonge,</hi>
returned to <hi>Rouen,</hi> where, by the
Benignity of his own Nature, and
Levity of his Son's, he was the
third time reconciled to Duke <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
and thereby disappointed those
Hopes, the King of <hi>France</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
from his Practises with
that Prince (and, as some write,
with his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> too) and
defeated his Pretext of assisting his
Right in the Dominion of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Philip</hi> bent upon this War,
by other Incentives, than those which
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:49830:152"/>
appeared from the Favour of Duke
<hi>Robert</hi>'s Pretensions, or Revenge of
the Dauphin's Injury, and moved,
both with the Jealousie of the
King's Greatness, and the Envy of
his Glory and Felicity, resolved to
prosecute obstinately the Quarrel
he had rashly begun, and not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeming
the sudden though violent
Motions of a youthful Heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Princes, a Ground
sufficient to bear the Weight of a
formal and declared War; upon
the News and Spight of Duke <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>'s
Reconciliation with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he sent to the King to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Homage of him both for
<hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>England:</hi> King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
answered that he was ready to
do him the Homage accustomed
for <hi>Normandy,</hi> but would do him
none for <hi>England,</hi> which he held
only of God and his Sword. The
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:49830:152"/>
               <hi>French King</hi> hereupon declared open
War against him, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
and pursued with great Heats
and Animosities on both sides,
with equal Forces, but unequal
Fortune; which favoured either the
Justice of the King's Cause, the
Valour of his Troops, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of their Leader upon all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters.</p>
            <p>He marched into <hi>France,</hi> took
<hi>Nantes</hi> and burnt it, with many
Villages about it, saying, That to
destroy the Wasps, their Nests
must be burnt. In the Heat of this
Action, and by that of the Fires,
which he too near approached, he
fell into a Distemper which forced
him to retire his Army, and return
to <hi>Rouen,</hi> where he lay sick for
some time, with ill Symptoms,
that gave his Friends Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Hopes to his Enemies.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:49830:153"/>
During the Expectation of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
both sides were quiet, by a
sort of tacit and voluntary Truce
between them. The King of
<hi>France</hi> talking of his Sickness, and
mocking at the Corpulency to
which he was grown of late Years,
said, King <hi>William</hi> was gone only
to lay his great Belly at <hi>Rouen,</hi> and
that he doubted he must be at
Charge to set up Lights at his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising.
The King of <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
told this Scoff, sent King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
Word, That he was ready to
sit up after his lying in, and that
when he was churched, he would
save him the Charge of setting up
Lights, and come himself, and
light a thousand Fires in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No Injuries are so sensible to
Mankind in general, as those of
Scorn, and no Quarrels pursued
between Princes, with so much
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:49830:153"/>
Sharpness and Violence, as those
which arise from personal Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or private Passions, to which
they are subject like other Mortal
Men. The King recovered, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
the greatest Forces he could
raise, both of <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi>
marches into the Isle of <hi>France,</hi>
with Fire and Spoil, where-ever
he came, approaches within Sight
of <hi>Paris,</hi> where that King was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.
There King <hi>William</hi> sent
him word that he was up and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and would be glad to see
him abroad too.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>French King</hi> resolved to
let this Fury pass, and appeared
not in the Field, which was left to
the Mercy and Ravage of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
The King, riding about to
observe his Advantages, and give
his Orders, and straining his Horse
to leap a Ditch in his Way, brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:49830:154"/>
the Bottom of his Belly against
the Pommel of his Saddle, with
such a Weight, and so much Pain,
as gave him a Relapse of his Illness
so lately recovered, forced him to
march his Army back into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
and to go himself to <hi>Rouen.</hi>
Here his Bruise turned to a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and his Sickness encreasing
with the Anguish of his Wound,
gave too soon and true Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Danger: Yet he lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
for some time, which he
made use of to do many Acts of
great Charity, and give other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of Piety and Resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Will of God, as well as
to dispose the Succession and Affairs
of his State; leaving by his Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy</hi> to
his eldest Son <hi>Robert,</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>William</hi> his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Son, and all his Treasures,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:49830:154"/>
which were very great, to <hi>Henry</hi>
his third. After this he ended his
Life in the full Career of Fortune
and Victory, which attended him
to his Grave, through the long
Course of more than threescore
Years Reign. For he began that
in <hi>Normandy</hi> about ten Years old,
and continued it above fourty Years
before his <hi>English Expedition,</hi> after
which he reigned above twenty
Years in <hi>England,</hi> and died in or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the seventy second Year of
his Age, and the Year of our
Lord 1087.</p>
            <p>Several Writers show their ill
Talent to this Prince, in making
particular Remarks, how his Corps
was immediately forsaken by all his
Friends and Followers, as soon as
he expired; how the Monks of an
Abbey he had founded, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
induced to come of Charity, and
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:49830:155"/>
take the care of his Body and his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
which he had ordered to be at
<hi>Caen</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and in a Church
he had there built. How the
Ground that was opened to receive
him was claimed at that instant,
by a Knight of the Country, who
alledged it had belonged to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
and himself, and was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
or unjusty seised from them
by the King, so that his Funeral
was fain to be deferred till an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
was made, and the Value
of the Ground paid to the Claimer,
with other invidious Circumstances,
which may argue the Ingratitude,
Avarice, or other Vices of his
Servants or Subjects then living,
but not defame the Memory, or
obscure the Glory of the Dead.</p>
            <p>Thus ended all that was Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of this noble King, and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Conqueror; for his Fame
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:49830:155"/>
will never die, but remain for ever
in the most lasting Records of
Time, and Monuments of Glory,
among the Princes most celebrated
for their brave Atchievements in
War, their wise Institutions in
Peace, the Length and Prosperity
of their Lives and their Reigns.
In all which he must with Justice
be confessed not to have been equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by many, if indeed by any we
read of in Story.</p>
            <p>I have made no mention of any
great Councils or Assemblies held
in this King's Reign, because I
find no clear Evidence of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Constitution, the Times
or the Occasions of them, whether
like those used in the <hi>Saxon Reigns,</hi>
or like the Parliaments in <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
or whether that Style was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
here, in this King's Time
or that of his Sons who succeeded
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:49830:156"/>
him. It appears, that he often
assembled the Nobles and Barons
of the Realm; but whether upon
the Solemnity of some great Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
or some Occasions of more
Importance, either for the Honour
of his Court, or Consultation of
his Affairs, I find not so well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
nor so easie to determine
as some will have it. It is agreed
only that there were two general
Assemblies of the Clergy; one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the sixth Year of his Reign,
upon a Controversie between the
Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi>
about the Primacy, which was
therein determined in favour of the
first: The other about erecting
some new Bishopricks, or transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Sees from some decayed
and smaller Towns, to others
grown in that Age more populous
and opulent. The <hi>Lichfield Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle</hi>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:49830:156"/>
also relates how in the fourth
Year of his Reign he summoned
out of every County, the Nobles,
the Wise Men, and such as were
learned in their own Law; that he
might from them learn what were
their ancient Laws and Customs.
After which the Laws of St. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
were conserved, and by him
confirmed throughout the whole
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I have not been so particular as
other Writers, in the Names of
Places or of Persons, or Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Years; because in such Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of Times and Variety of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
I find them very hard to be
ascertained. Besides, the Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
among Writers is so great, in
assigning the Years to the several
Actions of this Prince, that so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
an Affair, as that of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the Doomesday Book, is by
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:49830:157"/>
some referred to the eighth, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to the thirteenth, and by
some to the nineteenth Year of his
Reign: And many others are left
in the same Uncertainty.</p>
            <p>I have likewise omitted the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
and Remarks wherein some
Writers have busied their Pens, of
strange Comets, Inclemencies of
Seasons, raging Diseases, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
Fires, that are said to have
happened in this Age and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and are represented by some
as Judgments of God upon this
King's Reign. Because I rather e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
them Accidents of Time or
Chance, such as happen in one
Part or other of the World, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
every Age, at some Periods
of time, or from some Influence
of Stars, or by the conspiring of
some natural or casual Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
and neither argue the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:49830:157"/>
or Vices of Princes, nor serve
for Example or Instruction to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
which are the great Ends of
History, and ought to be the chief
Care of all Historians.</p>
            <p>For this Reason, as well as to
comply with common Custom, it
may not be improper or unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to end the wise, politick, and
prosperous Reign with the just
Character of this renowned Prince.
Since all great Actions in the
World, and Revolutions of States
may be truly derived, from the
Genius of the Persons, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and govern them, so as by
comparing both together, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Causes as well as Events;
it may be easie to discern, by what
Personal Qualities and Dispositions
of Princes, the happy and glorious
Successes of their own Fortunes,
with the Greatness and Felicity of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:49830:158"/>
their States, are generally atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
for, to attribute such great
Events to Time or to Chance, were
to destroy the Examples, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the Consequences of all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and Vices among Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William,</hi> surnamed the <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi>
was of the tallest Stature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
those common in his Age
and Country; his Size large, and
his Body strong built, but well
proportioned: His Strength such,
as few of his Court could draw his
Bow: His Health was great and
constant, which made him very
active in his Business and his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
till about the Decline of his
Age he grew something corpulent;
from all which, I suppose came the
Story in some <hi>Norman Writers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that
he was eight Foot high, or the Size
of <hi>Hercules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:49830:158"/>
As he was of goodly Personage,
so his Face was lovely, but of a
Masculine Beauty, the Loins being
strong rather than delicate; his
Eyes were quick and lively, but
when moved something fierce; his
Complection Sanguine, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
very pleasant, when he
was gay and familiar; when he
was serious something severe.</p>
            <p>His Pastimes were chiefly hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and feasting; in the first he
spent much Time, used great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
and yet much Moderation
of Diet. In his Feasts, which
were designed for Magnificence or
Conversation, to know or to be
known among his Nobles, and
not for Luxury; he was courteous,
affable, familiar, and often plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
and which made him the more
so to his Company, was easie at
those Times in granting Suits and
Pardons</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:49830:159"/>
It is by all agreed, that he was
chaste and temperate, which, with
a happy Constitution, and much
Exercise, preserved not only his
Health but Vigor to the last De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
of his Age.</p>
            <p>He was of sound natural Sense,
and shewed it not only in his own
Conduct and Reasoning upon all
great Occasions, but also in the
Choice of his Ministers and
Friends, wherein no Prince was
happier or wiser than he.</p>
            <p>He talked little, never vaunted,
observed much, was very secret,
and used only <hi>Lanfranc</hi> Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with an universal
Confidence, both as a Counsellor
and a Friend, to whom he was
ever meek and gentle, though to
others something austere, as if this
Conqueror had been himself subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Wisdom and Virtue of
that excellent Man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:49830:159"/>
In his Purposes he was steddy
but not obstinate, and though
constant to his Ends, yet appliable
to Occasions, as appeared by his
favouring and trusting the <hi>Normans</hi>
in his Troubles of <hi>England,</hi> and the
<hi>English</hi> in those of <hi>Normandy;</hi> and
was either very wise or very happy
in the Arts of gaining Enemies and
retaining Friends, having never lost
but one, which was <hi>Fitz-Auber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was a Prince deep in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
bold in his Enterprises, firm
in his Prosecution, excelling in the
Order and Discipline of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and choice in his Officers
both of his Army and his State.
But admirable in Expedition and
Dispatch of Civil as well as Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Affairs, never deferring till to
Morrow, what should be done to
Day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:49830:160"/>
Above all, he was careful and
prudent in the Management of his
Treasure, and finding a Temper
between the Bounty of his own
Nature, and the Necessity of his
Affairs, proportioning always the
Expences of his Gifts, his Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
his Enterprizes, to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
he was master of for defraying
them, designing nothing out of
his Compass, and thereby compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all he seemed to design.</p>
            <p>He was religious in frequenting
Divine Service, giving much
Alms, building Abbies, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing
them, sending Presents of
Crosses of Gold, rich Vestures and
Plate to many other Churches, and
much Treasure to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was a great Lover of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and though he despised the
loose, ignorant <hi>Saxon</hi> Clergy he
found in <hi>England,</hi> yet he took
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:49830:160"/>
Care and Pleasure to fill Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Dignities here with Persons
of great Worth and Learning from
abroad, as <hi>Lanfranc, Durand, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm,</hi>
with many more.</p>
            <p>He was a Lover of Virtue in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and Hater of Vice, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
naturally very kind to his half
Brother <hi>Odon</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi>
having made him Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi>
given him great Revenues, entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
him in his Absence with the
Government of the Realm, yet
finding him a Man of incurable
Ambition, Avarice, Cruelty, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
and Prophaneness, he at
length wholly disgraced him, and
kept him in Prison during all the
rest of his Reign; which seems to
have been a just Punishment of his
Crimes, and Sacrifice to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>
he had cruelly oppressed in
the King's Absence, rather than a
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:49830:161"/>
greediness of his Treasures, as
some envious Writers would make
it appear.</p>
            <p>Yet by the Consent of them all,
and the most partial or malicious
to his Memory, as well as others;
He is agreed to have been a Prince
of great Strength, Wisdom, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
Clemency, Magnificence,
Wit, Courtesie, Charity, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
and Piety. This short
Character, and by all agreed, is
enough to vindicate the Memory
of this noble Prince and famous
Conqueror, from the Aspersions
or Detractions of several malicious
or partial Authors, who have more
unfaithfully represented his Reign,
than any other Period of our <hi>English
History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having taken a full View of
this King in his Actions and his
Person, it remains only that we
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:49830:161"/>
consider the Consequences that
both of them had, upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of this Kingdom, which
will be best discovered by the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
of what it lost, what it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and what it gained by this
famous Conquest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> thereby must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
to have lost; first, very great
Numbers of brave <hi>English Men,</hi>
who fell in the Battle of <hi>Hastings,</hi>
and in two Wars afterwards by the
Revolt of the Nobles, and Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Scots</hi> in Favor of <hi>Edgar
Atheling.</hi> Likewise many Nobles
and Gentlemen who disdaining all
Subjection to a forreign and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
Power, retired into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Ireland, Denmark,</hi> and after
the Extinction of their Hopes, by
the Suppression of all Endeavours
in Favour of <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Right, never
returned, but left their Families
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:49830:162"/>
habituated in those Countries,
choosing, if they must live under
a forreign Dominion, to do it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abroad than at home.</p>
            <p>In the next Place, <hi>England</hi> lost
the true Line of their ancient <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Kings,</hi> who were a Race of just,
good, and pious Princes, governed
by such known Laws, and with such
Moderation, and were so beloved
of their People, as makes it obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Writers that no popular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
ever happened in any of
the <hi>Saxon Reigns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>England</hi> by the Conquest
lost in a great Measure, the old
Plainness and Simplicity of the
<hi>Saxon Times</hi> and Customs of Life,
who were generally a People of
good Meaning, plain Dealing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with their own, little cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or imitating their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and living frugally upon the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:49830:162"/>
Product of their own fruitful Soil:
For the Profusion of Meats at our
<hi>English</hi> Tables came in with the
<hi>Danes,</hi> and the Luxury of them
was introduced first by the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and after encreased by the
more frequent Use of Wines, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Accession of <hi>Guienne</hi> to this
Crown.</p>
            <p>What we preserved is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in three Particulars not usual
upon great Conquests; for, first,
we preserved our Name, which
was lost by the <hi>Saxon Invasions,</hi> but
that of <hi>England</hi> then (succeeding the
other of <hi>Britain</hi>) has ever since con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
            <p>Next; we preserved our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
or the old <hi>English Tongue,</hi>
which has made the Body and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of what still remains,
though much enlarged and polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
since those Times, by the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:49830:163"/>
transplanting many Words out of
forreign Languages, especially <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
and <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the last Place, we preserved
our Forms of Government, our
Laws and Institutions, which have
been so much celebrated by ancient
Writers, and have been so obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
defended by our Ancestors,
and are by Chancellor <hi>Fortescue,</hi>
who writ in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Sixth, averred to have been preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
through the five several Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in this Island; of <hi>Normans,
Danes, Saxons, Romans,</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
and so to have continued for
a longer Course of Time, than
those of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nation known in Story.
But this I doubt is not so easily
proved as affirmed, though it may
be with more Certainty of the three
first, which is sufficient to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:49830:163"/>
the Antiquity of our Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
without Recourse to
strained or uncertain Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>For what we gained by our Loss
in this Conquest, though it seems
a Contradiction, yet it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in many more Particulars
than the other two.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>England</hi> grew much
greater both in Dominion and
Power abroad, and also in Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and State at home, by the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of so much Territory upon
the Continent. For though the
<hi>Normans</hi> by the Conquest gained
much of the <hi>English Lands</hi> and
Riches, yet <hi>England</hi> gained <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>
which by it became a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
to this Crown.</p>
            <p>Next it gained greater Strength
by the great Numbers of <hi>Normans</hi>
and <hi>French,</hi> that came over with
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:49830:164"/>
the Conqueror, and after his Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
here; and incorporated
with the <hi>English Nation,</hi> joyning
with them in the same Language,
Laws, and Interests.</p>
            <p>Then we gained much by the great
Encrease of our Naval Power, and
Multitude of Ships, wherein <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>
then abounded, by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of more and better Havens,
than in later Ages.</p>
            <p>This, with the perpetual Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
and other Parts of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
gave us a mighty Encrease
of Trade and Commerce, and
thereby of Treasure to the Crown
and Kingdom, which appeared
first in so great a Mass, as was left
by the Conqueror to Prince <hi>Henry</hi>
his younger Son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England,</hi> by the Conquest,
gained likewise a natural Right to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:49830:164"/>
the Dominion of the narrow Seas,
which had been before acquired
only by the great Naval Power of
<hi>Edgar</hi> and other <hi>Saxon Kings.</hi> But
the Dominion of narrow Seas,
seems naturally to belong, like that
of Rivers, to those who possess the
Banks or Coasts on both sides:
And so to have strengthened the
former Title, by so long a Coast,
as that of <hi>Normandy</hi> of one side,
and of <hi>England</hi> on the other side of
the Channel.</p>
            <p>Besides, by this Conquest we
gained more Learning, more Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
more Refinement of Language,
Customs, and Manners, from the
great Resort of other Strangers, as
well as Mixture of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, we gained all our
Consideration abroad, by carrying
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49830:165"/>
our Arms so often and so glorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as well as extending our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
into forreign Countries;
so that whereas our <hi>Saxon Kings</hi>
were little known abroad, further
than by the Fame of their Devotion
and Piety, or their Journeys, Gifts,
and Oblations, made to <hi>Rome,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Conquest, the Crown of
<hi>England</hi> grew first to be feared by
our Neighbours, to have constant
Intercourse with other forreign
Princes, to take Part and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
in all the Affairs of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,</hi>
and by the following Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
of <hi>Anjou</hi> and <hi>Guien,</hi> came
in a short time to be esteemed
without Controversie, while they
possessed those Dominions, the
greatest Power of any Kingdom
then in <hi>Christendom,</hi> as appears by so
many glorious Adventures, and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:49830:165"/>
Successes of their Arms in <hi>France,
Spain, Brittany, Flanders, Sicily,</hi> and
the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all these happy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of this Famous Conquest,
all the succeding Kings of <hi>England</hi>
seem justly to have done this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
the Honor of dating from
him, the first great Period of
their Reigns, by which those of
the <hi>Saxons</hi> and other preceding Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
or Governments here, are
left us in Story, but like so many
antique, broken, or defaced Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
which may still represent
something of the Customs and
Fashions of those Ages, though
little of the true Lines, Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or Resemblance. But all
that has succeeded, since this
King's Reign, though not drawn
by any one skilful Hand, or by
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:49830:166"/>
the Life, yet is represented in
so clear a Light, as leaves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little, either obscure or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
in the History of our
Kingdom, or the Succession of our
Kings.</p>
