            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the moſt part, long ſince anſwered; as alſo lately by the Book Entituled, <hi>An Antidote,</hi> &amp;c. (Though becauſe his Second and Third Edition have ſome Additions to his firſt, and that being new vamped, for a better Market, he may expect a <hi>Melius inquirendum</hi> after a while: Yet ſhould we follow the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this <hi>Rattle-Snake,</hi> againſt the Church, of which he pretends to be a Member (but at preſent a ſuſpended one) we might, in Retaliation, not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Cobler of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> but the <hi>Scotch</hi> Eloquence, and that Maſter-Piece, the Ground of the <hi>Contempt</hi> of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, By the Obſervation we have made on the Relation ſubſcribed by ſome of the <hi>Norfolk-</hi>Clergy, dated, <hi>Octob.</hi> the <hi>12th.</hi> 1698. We cannot forbear thinking, that as their Confederacy is deep, ſo it aims at nothing leſs than the Ruine of us, and our Poſterity, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring us Blaſphemers, and Enemies to the Government, and to be treated as ſuch.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Norfolk-</hi>Relation from the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy aforeſaid, charges the ſaid People with <hi>Blaſphemy:</hi> Firſt, <hi>Againſt God.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,

               <hi>Againſt Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Againſt the Holy Scriptures, with Contempt of Civil Magiſtracy, and the Ordinances which Jeſus Chriſt Inſtituted,</hi> viz, <hi>Baptiſm by Water, and the Lord's Supper by Bread and Wine.</hi> And Laſtly, <hi>That the Light within, as taught by us, leaves us without any certain Rule, and expoſes us to the Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies aforeſaid, with many others.</hi> Now, becauſe this Charge refers to Doctrine, rather than Fact, or particular Perſons, we think our ſelves concerned to ſay ſomething in <hi>Vindication</hi> of our Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to wipe off the Dirt thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be caſt upon us, in giving our <hi>Reader</hi> a plain Account of our Principles, from the Perverſions of our Enemies.</p>
            <p>But to manifeſt how Uncharitably and Unjuſtly the ſaid <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> with reſpect to the ſaid Charge, we are contented the <hi>Reader</hi> goes no further than their own Printed Relation, dated <hi>Nov.</hi> 12. 1698. not doubting but by that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Relation, and the Letters therewith Printed, he will meet with intire Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, with reſpect to the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

and Juſtneſs of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in that Affair, and how ready they were to come to the Teſt, and to bring the pretended Charge upon the Stage, and to Purge themſelves from the Guilt of the ſame: Provided they might be accommodated with what the <hi>Common Law</hi> allows Malefactors, <hi>viz.</hi> a Copy of their Indictment, but this could not be obtained. And tho' the ſaid <hi>Clergy</hi> have thought fit to Print the Charge in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, without any Proof, we think our ſelves obliged to Vindicate our Profeſſion, by freely declaring (as now we do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Mental Reſervation) our ſincere Belief of the very things they moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly Charge us with denying.</p>

               <p>Yet we are very ready to declare to the whole World, that we cannot think Men and Women <hi>can be ſaved</hi> by their belief of the One <hi>without the Senſe and Experience of the Other;</hi> and that is what we oppoſe,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36363:16"/>
and not his Bleſſed Manifeſtation in the Fleſh. We ſay that he then overcame our Common Enemy, foiled him in the open Field, and in our Nature triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over him that had overcome and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over it in our Fore-Father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and his Poſterity: And that as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Chriſt overcame him in our Nature, in his own Perſon, ſo, <hi>by his Divine Grace</hi> being received and obeyed by us, he overcomes <hi>Satan</hi> in us: That is, he detects the Enemy by his Light in the Conſcience, and <hi>enables</hi> the Creature to reſiſt him, and all his Fiery Darts; and finally, ſo to Fight the Good Fight of Faith, as to <hi>overcome</hi> him, and lay hold on Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>And this is the Diſpenſation of <hi>Grace,</hi> which we declare <hi>has appeared to all,</hi> more or leſs; teaching thoſe that will receive it, <hi>to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſt, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World; looking for</hi> (which none elſe can juſtly do) <hi>the bleſſed Hope, and glorious Appearing of the Great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13. And as from the Teachings,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36363:16"/>
Experience, and Motion of this Grace, we miniſter to others, ſo the very drift of our Miniſtry is to turn Peoples Minds to this Grace in themſelves, that they may all come to do, <hi>even the good and acceptable Will of God, and work out their Salvation with fear and trembling, and make their High and Heavenly Calling and Election ſure;</hi> which none <hi>elſe</hi> can do, whatever be their <hi>Profeſſion, Church</hi> and <hi>Character: For ſuch as Men ſow they muſt reap; and his Servants we are, whom we obey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Regeneration</hi> we muſt know, or we cannot be Children of God, and Heirs of Eternal Glory: And to be Born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>an other</hi> Spirit and Principle muſt <hi>prevail,</hi> to <hi>leaven, ſeaſon,</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> us, [than either the Spirit of the World, or our own depraved Spirits] and this can be no other Spirit than that which dwelt in Chriſt, for unleſs that dwell in us, we can be none of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. And this Spirit begins in <hi>Conviction,</hi> and ends in <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Perſeverance:</hi> And the one follows the other; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion being the Conſequence of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36363:17"/>
obey'd,</hi> and Perſeverance a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Fruit</hi> of Converſion, and of being Born of God: For ſuch Sin not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Seed of God abides in them, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9. but through Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, continue to the end, and obtain the Promiſe, even Everlaſting Life.</p>
               <p>But we do acknowledge that Chriſt, through his Holy <hi>Doing</hi> and <hi>Suffering,</hi> (for being a <hi>Son</hi> he learned <hi>Obedience)</hi> has obtained Mercy of God his Father for Mankind; and that his Obedience has an Influence to our Salvation, in all the Parts and Branches of it; ſince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he became a Conqueror, and <hi>led Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity Captive, and obtained Gifts for Men, with divers Great Promiſes, that thereby we might be partakers of the Divine Nature, having</hi> (firſt) <hi>eſcaped the</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption <hi>that is in the World through Luſt:</hi> In ſhort, we do Believe and Confeſs that the <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus affects our Salvation throughout, as well from the Power and Pollution of Sin, as from the Guilt; He being a Conqueror as well as a Sacrifice, and both, through Suffering: Yet they that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36363:17"/>
reject his Divine Gift, ſo obtained, and which he has given to them, by which to ſee their Sin, and the ſinfulneſs of it, and to repent and turn away from it, and do ſo no more; and not wait upon God for daily ſtrength to reſiſt the Fiery Darts of the Enemy, and to be Comforted thro' the Obedience of Faith in and to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace of the Son of God; ſuch do not pleaſe God, nor truly are in a ſtate of true Chriſtianity and Salvation. <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, to the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> at the Well, <hi>hadſt thou known the Gift of God, and who it is that ſpeaketh to thee,</hi> &amp;c. People know not Chriſt, and God, whom to know is Life Eternal, <hi>John</hi> 17. becauſe they are Ignorant of the Gift of God, <hi>John</hi> 4. 10. <hi>viz.</hi> a meaſure of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God that is given to every one to profit with, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. which reveals Chriſt and God to the Soul. <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> cannot do it; <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> cannot do it; <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi> cannot do it: For they that by <hi>wiſdom</hi> knew not God, had theſe things for their <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> They were ſtrong, deep and accurate in them;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36363:18"/>
but alas, they were <hi>clouded, ſhut up,</hi> and ſet farther off from the Inward and Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Knowledge of God, becauſe they ſought for it in them, and thought to find God there. But the <hi>Key of David</hi> is another thing, which ſhuts and <hi>no Man</hi> opens; and opens, and no Man ſhuts: And this Key have all they that receive the <hi>Gift of God</hi> into their Hearts, which opens to them, the Knowledge of God and themſelves, and gives them quite <hi>another Sight, Taſte,</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> of things, than their meer <hi>Education</hi> or <hi>Traditional</hi> Knowledge afforded them.</p>
               <p>This is the beginning of the <hi>New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of God, and thus it is we come to be New Creatures: And we are bound to declare there is no other way, beſides this, by which People can come into Chriſt, or to be true Chriſtians, or receive the Advantage that came by the Death and Sufferings of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore we ſay, and upon good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, even that of our <hi>own Experience,</hi> and that of the Scriptures of Truth, Chriſt will prove <hi>no Saving Sacrifice</hi> for them that <hi>refuſe</hi> him for their <hi>Example.</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:36363:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
They that <hi>reject</hi> the Gift, <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>Giver,</hi> inſtead of denying themſelves <hi>daily</hi> for the <hi>Giver's</hi> ſake. O that People were wiſe, that they would conſider their lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter End, and the things that make for the Peace thereof! Why ſhould they <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> in a vain hope of Life, <hi>while Death Reigns?</hi> Of living <hi>with</hi> God, who live not <hi>to</hi> him, nor walk with him? <hi>Awake</hi> thou that ſleepeth in thy Sin, or, at beſt, in thy Self-righteouſneſs, and Chriſt ſhall give thee Life! For he is the <hi>Lord from Heaven, the quickning Spirit,</hi> that quickens us by his Spirit, if we do not <hi>reſiſt</hi> it, and <hi>quench</hi> it by our Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but receive, love and obey it, in all the Holy Leadings and Teachings of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15. To which Holy Spirit we commend the <hi>Reader,</hi> that he may the better ſee where he is, and alſo come to the true Belief and Advantage of the <hi>Doings</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of our Dear and Bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who ſaves from the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Pollution,</hi> as well as Guilt of Sin, all thoſe that <hi>hear his knocks, and opens the Door of their Hearts</hi> to him, that he may
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36363:19"/>
come in and work a real and thorough Reformation in, and for them: And ſo the <hi>Benefit, Virtue,</hi> and <hi>Efficacy</hi> of his <hi>Doings</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> without us, will come to be livingly applied and felt, and fellowſhip with Chriſt in his Death and Sufferings known, according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apoſtle; which, thoſe that live in that which made him ſuffer, <hi>know</hi> not, though they <hi>profeſs</hi> to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his Death and Sufferings. Much more might be ſaid as to this matter; but to conclude this Subject, we wonder not that we ſhould be miſtaken, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrued and miſ-repreſented, in what we <hi>believe in order to Salvation,</hi> ſince our Betters have been ſo treated in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times; nor indeed is it only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Doctrines</hi> or <hi>Principles,</hi> for our <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> in <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> have had the ſame Succeſs: But this is what we earneſtly deſire, that however bold Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>are</hi> pleaſed to make with us, they would not <hi>deceive</hi> themſelves in the great things of their own Salvation: That while they would ſeem to own all to Chriſt, they are not found <hi>diſowned</hi> of

Chriſt in the laſt Day. Read the 7th of <hi>Matthew;</hi> it is he that <hi>hears</hi> Chriſt, the great Word of God, and <hi>does</hi> what he enjoyns, what he commands, and by his Bleſſed Example, recommends, that is a <hi>Wiſe Builder,</hi> that has founded his Houſe well, and built with good Materials, and whoſe Houſe will ſtand the laſt ſhake and Judgment. For which cauſe we are often plain, cloſe and earneſt with People to conſider, that Chriſt came not to <hi>ſave them in,</hi> but <hi>from their Sins;</hi> and that they that think to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and releaſe themſelves of his <hi>Yoke</hi> and <hi>Burden,</hi> his <hi>Croſs</hi> and Example (and ſecure themſelves, by Complementing Chriſt with his having done <hi>all for them,</hi> while he has wrought <hi>little or nothing in them,</hi> nor they parted with any thing for the love of him) will finally awake in a dreadful ſurpriſe, at the ſound of the laſt Trumpet, and that irrevokable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: <hi>Depart from me, ye workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, I know you not.</hi> Which terrible End, may all timely avoid, by <hi>hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to Wiſdom's Voice, and <hi>turning</hi> at her Reproof, that ſhe may lead them in

               <p>BEcauſe we, with many others, have denied that Ridged Satisfaction which ſome hold, as that God could not <hi>Poſſibly</hi> ſave Men <hi>any other way</hi> than by Condemning and Puniſhing his Innocent Son unto Death, with the <hi>utmoſt</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Severity; and that his Wrath or Juſtice is <hi>now ſo fully Satisfied</hi> for Sin paſt, preſent, and to come, as that he will <hi>now</hi> Look upon Man <hi>holy</hi> for Chriſt's ſake, tho' <hi>unholy</hi> in himſelf, and as if he was in Chriſt, tho' not <hi>a new Creature.</hi> We are made <hi>Deniers</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> at large.</p>
               <p>Whereas we Sincerely Believe our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was that moſt accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36363:20"/>
Sacrifice to God for the Sin of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that whatſoever ſin is forgiven, is <hi>not</hi> forgiven only <hi>becauſe</hi> of Repentance, but for <hi>his</hi> ſake that <hi>dyed,</hi> and offered him ſelf through the Eternal Spirit, an Offering once for all.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification</hi> truly underſtood are placed in ſo ſtrict an Union, that the one is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Conſequence of the other, and what we ſay of them, is what agrees with the ſuffrage of Scripture, and for the moſt part in the terms of it; always believing that in Points where there ariſes any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be it from the Obſcurity of Expreſſion, Miſtranſlation, or the Duſt raiſed by the Heats of <hi>Partial</hi> Writers, or <hi>Nice Criticks</hi> it is ever beſt to keep cloſe to the Text and <hi>maintain</hi> Charity in the reſt. We ſhall therefore firſt ſpeak <hi>Negatively,</hi> what we do not own, (which perhaps hath given occaſion to thoſe who have been more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty than wiſe to judge us defective in our Belief of the Efficacy of the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt to Juſtification:) As,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> We cannot believe that Chriſt is the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> but the <hi>Effect</hi> of God's Love,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36363:21"/>
according to the Teſtimony of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Diſciple <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 3. <hi>God hath</hi> ſo <hi>loved the World, that he hath</hi> given <hi>his only Begotten Son into the World, that</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We cannot ſay, God <hi>could not</hi> have taken another way to have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Sinners, than by the Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his Son, to ſatisfie his Juſtice, or that Chriſt's Death and Sufferings were a <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>rigid</hi> Satisfaction for that Eternal Death and Miſery due to Man for Sin and Tranſgreſſion: For ſuch a Notion were to make God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy little concerned in Man's Salvation; and indeed, we are at too great a diſtance from his Infinite Wiſdom and Power, to judge of the <hi>Liberty</hi> or <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of his Actings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We cannot ſay Jeſus Chriſt was the <hi>greateſt Sinner</hi> in the World (becauſe he bore our Sins on the Croſs, or becauſe he was made Sin for us, who never <hi>knew any Sin)</hi> an <hi>Expreſſion</hi> of great <hi>Levity</hi> and <hi>Unſoundneſs,</hi> yet often ſaid by great Preachers and Profeſſors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:36363:21"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We cannot Believe that Chriſt's Death and Sufferings <hi>ſo</hi> ſatisfies God, or juſtifies Men, as that they are <hi>thereby</hi> accepted of God. They are, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thereby put into a State capable of being accepted of God, and <hi>through</hi> the Obedience of Faith, and Sanctification of the Spirit, are in a State of Acceptance: For we can never think a Man juſtified before God, while <hi>Self-condemned;</hi> or that any Man can be in Chriſt, who is not a <hi>New Creature,</hi> or that God looks upon Men <hi>otherwiſe</hi> than they are. We think it a State of <hi>Preſumption,</hi> and not of <hi>Salvation,</hi> to call Jeſus, <hi>Lord,</hi> and not by the Work of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, Maſter,</hi> and he not <hi>Maſter of our Affections, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> and not ſaved by him from <hi>Sin, Redeemer,</hi> and yet not redeemed by him from <hi>Paſſion, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, Vanity, Honours, vain Friendſhips,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of this World: Which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever do, will deceive themſelves; for <hi>God will not be mocked; ſuch as Men ſow, ſuch muſt they reap.</hi> And tho' Chriſt did <hi>Die</hi> for us, yet we muſt, by the Aſſiſtance of his Grace, <hi>work out our Salvation with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36363:22"/>
Fear and Trembling:</hi> As he died <hi>for Sin,</hi> ſo we muſt die <hi>to Sin,</hi> or we cannot be ſaid to be ſaved by the Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, or throughly Juſtified and Accepted with God. But now <hi>poſſitively,</hi> what we own, as to <hi>Juſtification</hi> comes next.</p>
               <p>We do believe, that Jeſus Chriſt was our Holy <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>Attonement,</hi> and <hi>Propitiation;</hi> that he bore our Iniquities, and that by his <hi>Stripes</hi> we were healed of the Wounds <hi>Adam</hi> gave us in his Fall; and that God is juſt in forgiving true Penitents, upon the Credit of that Holy Offering Chriſt made of himſelf to God for us; and that what he did and ſuffer'd, ſatisfied and pleaſed God, it being for the take of fallen Man that had diſpleaſed <hi>Him:</hi> And that by the Offering up of himſelf once for all, through the Eternal Spirit, he hath for ever perfected thoſe (in all times) that are ſanctified, <hi>who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. Mark that.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, <hi>Juſtification</hi> conſiſts of two parts, or hath a two-fold Conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification from the Guilt of Sin,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36363:22"/>
and Juſtification from the Power and Pollution of Sin, and in this ſenſe Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication gives Man a full and clear Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance before God. For want of this latter part, it is that ſo many Souls Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly inclin'd, are often under Doubts, Scruples and Diſpondencies, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that their Teachers tell them of the Extent and Efficacy of the firſt part of Juſtification. And it is too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral an Unhappineſs among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity, that they are apt to cloke their own <hi>Active and Paſſive Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, with the Active and Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt.</hi> The firſt part of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, we do reverently and humbly Acknowledge is, <hi>only</hi> for the ſake of the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt; nothing we can do, <hi>though by the Operation of the Holy Spirit,</hi> being able to cancel Old Debts, or wipe out Old Scores: It is the Power and Efficacy of that Propitiatory Offering, upon Faith and Repentance, that Juſtifies us from the Sins that are paſt, and it is the Power of Chriſt's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in our Hearts that purifies and makes us acceptable before God. For till the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36363:23"/>
Heart of Man is turned from Sin, God will never accept of it: He Reproves, Rebukes, and Condems thoſe that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sin there, and therefore ſuch cannot be ſaid to be in a <hi>Juſtified State;</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and Juſtification being <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries:</hi> So that they that hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Juſtified State, by the Active and Paſſive Obedience of Chriſt, while they are not Actively and Paſſively Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, are under a <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>dangerous Deluſion,</hi> and for crying out againſt this Sin-pleaſing <hi>Imagination,</hi> not to ſay <hi>Doctrine,</hi> we are Staged and Reproached, as Deniers and Deſpiſers of the Death and Sufferings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But be it known to ſuch, they add to Chriſt's <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and crucifie to themſelves <hi>afreſh</hi> the Son of God, and trample the Blood of the Covenant under their Feet, that walk unholily under a Profeſſion of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for God will not acquit the Guilty, nor juſtifie the Diſobedient and Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Such deceive themſelves, and at the Great and Final Judgment their Sentence will not be, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed,</hi> becauſe it
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:36363:23"/>
cannot be ſaid to them, <hi>Well done Good and Faithful,</hi> for they cannot be ſo eſteemed that live and die in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable and Condemnable State; but, <hi>Go ye Curſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, Oh Reader! Reſt not thy ſelf <hi>wholly</hi> ſatisfied with what Chriſt has done for thee in his Bleſſed Perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee, but preſs to know his Power and Kingdom <hi>within thee,</hi> that the <hi>ſtrong Man,</hi> that has too long kept thy Houſe, may be <hi>bound,</hi> and his Goods <hi>ſpoiled;</hi> his Works <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> and Sin <hi>ended;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 7. <hi>For which end,</hi> ſays that Beloved Diſciple, <hi>Chriſt was manifeſted,</hi> that all things may become New; <hi>New Heavens, and New Earth, in which Righteouſneſs dwells.</hi> Thus thou wilt come to glorifie God in thy Body, and in thy Spirit, which are his; and live to him, and not to thy ſelf. Thy Love, Joy, Worſhip, and Obedience; thy Life, Converſation, and Practice; thy Study, Mediation, and Devotion, will be <hi>Spiritual:</hi> For the Father and the Son will make their <hi>abode</hi> with thee, and Chriſt will <hi>manifeſt</hi> himſelf to thee; for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36363:24"/>
                  <hi>the Secrets of the Lord are with them that fear him:</hi> And an Holy <hi>Unction</hi> or <hi>Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> have all thoſe, which leads them <hi>into all Truth,</hi> and they need not the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Men: They are better Taught, being Inſtructed by the <hi>Divine Oracle;</hi> no bare <hi>Hear-ſay,</hi> or <hi>Traditional</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but freſh and living Witneſſes: Thoſe that have ſeen with their <hi>own Eyes,</hi> and heard with their <hi>own Ears,</hi> and have handled with their <hi>own Hands</hi> the Word of Life, in the divers Operations of it, to their Souls Salvation. In this they Meet, in this they Preach, and in this they Pray and Praiſe. Behold the <hi>New Covenant</hi> fulfilled, the Church and Worſhip of Chriſt, the Great <hi>Anointed</hi> of God, and the Great <hi>Anointing</hi> of God, in his Holy, High Prieſthood and Offices in his Church.</p>

               <p>And becauſe we are a People, whoſe Education hath not afforded us an <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy</hi> of Language, ſome Paſſages may perhaps have been <hi>miſ-expreſs'd,</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly worded; as for Inſtance, One

of us hath denied in his Book, the Soul to be <hi>Finite,</hi> by which he plainly meant <hi>Mortal,</hi> or <hi>Final;</hi> to die, or have an end, which <hi>Finis</hi> ſignifies, from whence <hi>Finite</hi> comes, our uncharitable Oppoſers have concluded, we hold the Soul to be <hi>Infinite,</hi> and conſequently God: Whereas the Words before and after, as well as the Nature of the things, ſhews plainly, he <hi>only</hi> meant that it is <hi>Eternal,</hi> and ſo not <hi>Finite;</hi> that is, not <hi>Terminable,</hi> or that which ſhall come to an end.</p>
               <p>And alſo, becauſe we have not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our ſelves about Matters of Faith, in the many and <hi>Critical</hi> Words that Man's Wiſdom teacheth, but in the Words which the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> teacheth, we have been eſteemed either <hi>Ignorant</hi> or <hi>Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and <hi>Unſound:</hi> Whereas it is really Matter of Conſcience to us, to deliver our Belief in ſuch Words as the Holy Spirit in Scripture teacheth; and if we add more for Illuſtration, it is from an Experience of the Work of the ſame Spirit in our ſelves, which ſeems to us the trueſt way of Expounding Scripture, in what concerns Saving Knowledge.</p>

               <head>XVII. <hi>Concerning Separation,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>BEcauſe we are ſeparated from the publick <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> it is too generally concluded, that we deny the <hi>Doctrines</hi> received by the Church, and conſequently introduce a new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Whereas we <hi>differ</hi> leaſt, where we are thought to <hi>differ</hi> moſt: For ſetting aſide ſome School Terms, we hold the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of thoſe Doctrines believed by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as to <hi>God, Chriſt, Spirit, Scripture, Repentance, Sanctification, Remiſſion of Sin, Holy Living, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Juſt and Unjuſt to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rewards and Puniſhments.</hi> But that wherein we <hi>differ</hi> moſt, is about <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Converſation,</hi> and the <hi>Inward Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of the Soul by the Work of God's Spirit thereon, in Purſuance of theſe good and generally Received Doctrines. For 'tis the Spirit of God only Convinces and Converts the Soul, and makes thoſe that were <hi>Dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins,</hi> and in the <hi>Luſts, Pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>Faſhions</hi> of this World, <hi>alive to God;</hi> that is, <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:36363:26"/>
of his Mind and Will, and of their Duty to do them; and brings to know God, and his Attributes, by the <hi>Power of them upon their own Souls;</hi> and leads to Worſhip God rightly, which is <hi>in his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and in Truth,</hi> with Hearts Sanctified by the Truth, which is a living and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Worſhip, and ſtands in <hi>Power,</hi> not Formality, nor <hi>in the Traditions, and Preſcriptions of Men,</hi> in <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,</hi> but in the Holy Spirit. Firſt, in ſhewing us our real Wants; and then in helping <hi>our Infirmities</hi> with <hi>Sighs and Groans,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Words,</hi> to pray for a ſuitable ſupply for which we in our Meetings <hi>wait</hi> upon God, to <hi>quicken</hi> and <hi>prepare</hi> us, that we may worſhip him <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably</hi> and <hi>Profitably,</hi> for they go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now becauſe we are ſatisfied that all Worſhip to God, and Exhortations to Men, as <hi>Praying, Praiſing,</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> and every other Religious Duty ought to be Spiritually Performed; and finding ſo little of it among Profeſſors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; the Spirit of God having not that <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Guidance</hi> of them, in their Lives and Worſhip, as It ought to have;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36363:26"/>
and ſeeing them too generally ſatisfied with a Miniſtry and Worſhip of <hi>Man's making,</hi> being not qualified, nor led by God's Spirit thereunto; we cannot find that Comfort and Edification our Souls crave and want under ſo cold a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Worſhip. And for this cauſe, and no preſumptious Contempt, or ſelfiſh Separation, or worldly Intereſts are we, and ſtand we at this day, a ſeparate Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the Publick Communion; and in this we can comfortably Appeal and Recommend our ſelves to God, the <hi>great and laſt Judge</hi> of the Acts and Deeds of the Sons of Men.</p>

               <p>BEcauſe at the time of our Friends firſt appearing in this Age, there were a Sect of People, newly ſprang up, and <hi>truly</hi> called <hi>Ranters,</hi> that were the <hi>Reverſs</hi> to the <hi>Quakers</hi> (for they feared and quaked at <hi>nothing,</hi> but made a mock at Fearing of God, and at Sin, and at Hell) who pretended that <hi>Love</hi> made <hi>Fear</hi> needleſs, and that nothing was Sin, but to them that <hi>thought</hi> it ſo; and that

                  <hi>none</hi> ſhould be Damned at laſt, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Practices exactly correſponded with their Evil Principles: From hence, ſome, ignorantly, and too many malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly involved us and ours with <hi>them;</hi> and many of <hi>their</hi> Exorbitances were thereby placed to our account, tho' with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Reaſon, Truth, or Juſtice.</p>
               <p>And becauſe ſome that were convinced of God's Truth, afterwards diſhonoured their Profeſſion, thro' their <hi>Unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to it; and that ſome, out of <hi>weakneſs</hi> perhaps, may have improperly worded what they intended to ſay, the whole Body of our Friends have been made <hi>Criminal,</hi> and the Religion or Principles we profeſs, have been condemned, and repreſented to the World as <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy;</hi> an Uſage ſo unjuſt, that doutleſs, according to <hi>Lex Tallionis,</hi> our Adverſaries would think it intolerable to be ſo treated by us.</p>
               <p>But as we deſire not to render <hi>Evil</hi> for <hi>Evil,</hi> our <hi>Great Biſhop</hi> having taught us <hi>another</hi> Leſſon, and <hi>better</hi> Practices, ſo we deſire God Almighty to forgive our <hi>Cauſleſs</hi> Enemies, for his Son's ſake,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36363:27"/>
as we moſt freely and heartily forgive them: Believing ſome may be zealouſly affected for their <hi>Educational</hi> Form of Religion, and as zealous againſt us for our Separation, and we are the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to judge ſo, becauſe many of us were <hi>once</hi> in the <hi>ſame</hi> way, and had ſuch thoughts of thoſe that were gone before us. But it hath pleas'd the Father of Mercies, to do by many of us, as he did by <hi>Saul,</hi> that <hi>Zealous,</hi> though <hi>Miſtaken</hi> Perſecutor of the ſincere Followers of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 3, 4, 5, 6. For as we heard an unuſual <hi>Inward</hi> but <hi>Powerful</hi> Voice, ſo we alſo had a more inward clear and diſtinguiſhing Sight, by the <hi>Illumination</hi> of that <hi>Light</hi> which was <hi>more</hi> than <hi>Natural,</hi> and ſhined into our dark and ſinful Hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6, 7.

Vanity, ſay (generally ſpeaking) We were not diſobedient to that Heavenly Viſion <hi>(Acts</hi> 26. 19.) we had of Him, our Selves, the World, and that Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion, where we had our Education, And ſince by that ſight God gave us, we ſaw he was Pure and Holy, and that without <hi>Holineſs</hi> none ever could, or can ſee him to their Joy, and that we were unfit to approach his holy Altar; yea, the whole World lay in Wickedneſs; and that Profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, where we had our Education, was <hi>ſo far</hi> from having the <hi>Power</hi> of Godlineſs, that for the moſt part it <hi>want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> the right <hi>Form;</hi> from <hi>ſuch</hi> therefore, we had a <hi>Divine Authority, to turn away,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.

For we deſired to be <hi>not</hi> of thoſe that turned aſide from the Footſteps of the Flocks of the Companions. Nor was it Affectation to Popularity, Singularity, or Novelty, that induc'd us to a Separation; but a fervent deſire to know the Lord,

and the Work of his Tranſlating Power upon our Souls, being in earneſt for Heaven, tho' for it we loſt all our Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enjoyments, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>ſolitary</hi> and <hi>ſeeking</hi> State, it pleaſed the Lord to meet with us, and gather us into <hi>Families,</hi> or <hi>Religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,</hi> according to <hi>Pſalm</hi> 58. 6.
