            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>IT pleas'd me ſo well to ſee any thing in Defence of <hi>RELIGION,</hi> under the Name of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> that I was quite of another mind to the <hi>Gentleman</hi> that troubled himſelf with an <hi>Anſwer</hi>; And thought if he had ſaid leſs to his Point, it ſhew'd, to his greateſt Honour, by his own Senſe, the force of his Convictions, and how little ſerv'd him to the Belief of a <hi>Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> ſo much <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Quality,</hi> that have made ſo great a Figure in the world, ſhould give this On-ſet to <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> that had ſo long ſtoln the <hi>Credit</hi> of both, to giver her ſelf Value with Men of Higheſt Rank, might have eſcap'd a <hi>Reprimand</hi> from the <hi>Deiſt</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian</hi>; And This was enough to ſend the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> a Challenge.</p>
            <p>That his Diſcourſe was not labour'd with <hi>Repetitious Thought,</hi> nor <hi>writ</hi> in the Language of the <hi>Schools,</hi> is owing to his better <hi>genius,</hi> and more <hi>ſenſible Education.</hi> It needs no <hi>Apology,</hi> and is its own <hi>Encomium;</hi> To be ſure it is like Himſelf, and That is an <hi>Original.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Evening of his Time, I heartily wiſh him the Felicity of living the irreprovable Life of his Admir'd <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,</hi> eſpecially, ſince be Believes it is not out of his Power, and that ſuch extraordinary Rewards follow it. And This will add a Demonſtration to his Probabilities for <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would then preſs the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to the Imitation of ſo <hi>Illuſtrious an Example,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:106220:3"/>
that thoſe Virtues might be recover'd, that once made the Diſcipline of their Anceſtors ſo much the Honour of their <hi>King,</hi> the Safety of their <hi>Country,</hi> and the juſt Fear and Admiration of all Foreigners.</p>
            <p>For the Perſon that undertook to Anſwer the Dukes Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in my Opinion, he has, with the Duke, abus'd his Time; As all do, that, <hi>Miſtake. Write looſely, beg the Queſtion, pervert the Senſe</hi>; And, to Crown their Work, <hi>Contradict themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hear the <hi>Noble Peer</hi> this Friendſhip, and his <hi>Eſſay</hi> may Challenge it for a <hi>Duty:</hi> But I am particularly <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted</hi> in a <hi>Reply,</hi> by a Reflection the Author gives me in his Anſwer. 'Twere <hi>Juſtice</hi> to vindicate a leſs Man, when aſſaulted in my Name. But there is another Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; His <hi>Arguments</hi> were too low an Entertainment for the <hi>Duke,</hi> and therefore fit for a man of my inferior Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents. While <hi>I</hi> Reprehend his Performance, <hi>I</hi> muſt not be too confident in my own, eſpecially when I have not his <hi>Six Hours Haſte</hi> to offer in excuſe of my ſelf; For, to my <hi>Dulneſs</hi> I muſt own, it has coſt me the beſt part of <hi>Six Days,</hi> and therefore time for me to reſt. Such as it is, <hi>Friendly Reader,</hi> Take, Read, and Judge. I am no <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> for I believe what I Write. If I err, I am to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd: The way, muſt be <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as it is with all reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Men, and as I profeſs my ſelf ſuch, ſo from them I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, the Mercy that all Men need, and deſire, when it comes to their turn to be where I am, I mean, upon the Stage of <hi>Cenſure,</hi> Farewell,</p>

            <head>A DEFENCE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HIs firſt Paragraph contains his wonder, <hi>that the D. ſhould eſpouſe the Cauſe of</hi> Whiggiſm <hi>in her old age, when a caſt Miſtreſs, and ſcorn'd of all.</hi> And all that know the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> humour, would wonder too, if the thing were true; and if not, the wonder turns upon the man's Confidence. It has been the D's fault to love freſher game; But This is as much below his Wit, as the other againſt his Inclination. But if the ſtory cou'd be true, I am not of the Anſwerer's mind; it was not his Pity but Policy to entertain her; perhaps, to know the ſecrets of his <hi>Great Peer,</hi> p. 1. for ſo <hi>Cecil</hi> ſerv'd <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is <hi>Whiggiſm?</hi> He tells us very briefly; 'tis <hi>Tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> &amp; <hi>Perſecution; and that theſe Qualities made her ſo ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Aſſociating Lords.</hi> How this affects the D. that was not of their knot, is un-accountable, and how thoſe L<hi rend="sup">ds.</hi> lov'd the perſecuting part of her, is as hard to underſtand; unleſs he means it of the <hi>Excluſion,</hi> and proſecution of the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi>; and if that be it, He does ill to rail at the <hi>Rom. Cath.</hi> and their Religion too, p. 15.21. <hi>as able to ruine the whole Earth, and lay the foundation of eternal miſchiefs to mankind.</hi> But if <hi>Tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be a part of <hi>Whiggiſm,</hi> it may touch the D. in general: Only in this the man is miſtaken, ſhe came not laſt to his hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was the firſt of all the Peers of <hi>England</hi> that had her: And his credit be it ſpoken, in This he is conſtant, and more the ſame <hi>George</hi> D. of <hi>B.</hi> than this Author fancies him, <hi>p.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>But muſt the D's Book of the weightieſt matters; be diſgrac'd with <hi>Whiggiſm?</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106220:4"/>Muſt ſo Noble a Deſign be blaſted with ſo odious a Name? And his Eſſay Branded without Diſtinction? Don't we all know that the <hi>State Diſſenter</hi> was eſteemed the <hi>Whig,</hi> and the great Offence of <hi>Whiggiſm</hi> the <hi>Interruption of the Line</hi>? Which muſt be the Perſecuting part of <hi>Whiggiſm</hi> in this mans account, or none, And can the Duke be guilty of this, for writing a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe againſt Perſecution of any Body for Religion? If <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence</hi> be <hi>Whiggiſm,</hi> let him remember who it was that lately wanted it. And if Perſecution be <hi>Whiggiſm</hi> too, who it is that he makes <hi>Whiggs</hi> now: Himſelf a great one to be ſure, <hi>page</hi> 28, 29, &amp; 30. In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> it ſeems, <hi>Has enter'd the Liſts, is become a Champion, and a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Protector of</hi> Whiggiſm, alias, <hi>Toleration of Diſſenting Chriſtians</hi>; A greater Honour, I think he could hardly have done him: And in this I am of his mind.</p>
            <p>His ſecond <hi>Paragraph</hi> begins with a queſtion every body may Anſwer, to wit, <hi>If it was not boldly done of him to Anſwer a Peer of his High Rank,</hi> pag. 2. And for my part, I think ſo, and ſomthing worſe; conſidering the Abuſe, Slightneſs, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth and Contradiction with which he has perform'd it. For the Duke cannot think it ill done of him to Anſwer, but to Anſwer ill, no body can think well done, and that's his Caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>But to fight this Noble Peer with Succeſs, he unhappily tells us, <hi>He has armed himſelf with an Invulnerable Conſcience</hi>; And I am afraid ſo, becauſe he ſhows himſelf Inſenſible of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and Indecency to a Peer, that himſelf ſays, <hi>Is of the Higheſt Rate,</hi> in the beginning of his Anſwer, and flies to the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> to ſupport himſelf at the latter end of it.</p>
            <p>But he would have us believe, <hi>His Nature and Education are more ſoft and obliging</hi>; and if we may truſt him, it is pity his Religion ſhould have ſpoil'd him, or that a man ſhould be the worſe for that which ſhould have made him better.</p>
            <p>He ſays, <hi>Though in approaching ſo near his Grace, he cannot be</hi> procul a Jove, <hi>he will be ſure to be</hi> procul a Fulmine. This I preſume was to paſs for Wit, but he is ſomewhat unlucky in it, and either jeers the Duke, or Himſelf; For this is to tell us
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106220:4"/>
the Dukes Arguments have no force; or if they have, he has wit enough to keep out of their way. I might add a third, perhaps he preſumes upon his Goodneſs, which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is more then <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf muſt hope for in ſome Countreys, from the <hi>Malitia</hi> of the Pulpit. But now I think of it, who knows but he meant <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> and that by concealing his Name, he ſhould eſcape the <hi>Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt</hi>; leaſt that might happen to turn the <hi>Wine of his Hopes into the Vinegar of Deſpairs</hi>; his own ſweet Metaphor.</p>
            <p>He ends this <hi>Paragraph</hi> p. 4. with be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſpeaking his own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, <hi>And profeſſing a profound Veneration for his Graces High Character.</hi> He more than once labours to perſwade the Duke to let him abuſe him <hi>Gratis</hi>: To be ſure, I ſhan't op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Charity, but adviſe him to prove himſelf the better Chriſtian by exerciſing it. But methinks it ſhows the mans Fear, and That, his Guilt, as his Hope, the Dukes Goodneſs, and his diffidence in the <hi>Invulnerableneſs</hi> of his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He would have ſomething elſe to truſt too.</p>
            <p>It is an odd thing to beſpeak a mans Sanctuary where he intends the wrong, and preſume upon the Goodneſs of the Perſon to abuſe him ſafely. He profoundly reſpects the Duke, and yet makes him to keep, and be the Champion of <hi>Whiggiſm</hi>; and then too, <hi>When every Body elſe for fear or ſhame has forſaken her.</hi> I will end with this, That he that Intitles a Man to the Sin, does his beſt to Intitle him to the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too: Which in my Judgement ſhows a <hi>wild</hi> and an ill Conſcience in the Anſwerer.</p>
            <p>His third <hi>Paragraph</hi> p. 4. Declares, <hi>His own belief is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable,</hi> and his Book, <hi>That they that don't avoid their own beliefs, to believe as he believes, are juſtly puniſhable</hi>; and why? <hi>Becauſe he believes as the Church believes, that is by Law Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd.</hi> Here's the reaſon of his <hi>Creed</hi>: And they that offer to have any better, are dangerous to the Government, p. 19, 22, and 23.

but that he has a mind to ſhow his Affectation and Ignorence of <hi>French,</hi> by <hi>Opinionatre,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Opiniatrelé,</hi> and cautions us to take head of him, for he does not know, <hi>But he may be Mad before he has done, at leaſt freakiſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly.</hi> He would place it to the Infection of the Dukes Wit; but his Book proves he has eſcap'd the Contagion.</p>

            <p>But this ſticks in his Stomach too, <hi>That Noble Cavaliers ſhould trouble their Heads with Religion</hi>; And who knows but he has reaſon, for 'twere the way to make <hi>Chaplains</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily Learned, or unneceſſary and uſeleſs to their Maſters. <hi>He wonders as much at Noble Cavaliers writing of Religion, as to ſee a Blew Apron Knight correcting</hi> Euclids Elements.

            <p>He concludes with a Story of an <hi>Airy Gentleman</hi> of his Acquaintance (for he's of that Element) that being preſt with the Conſequences of his odd Opinions, would cry, <hi>A Pox upon Conſequences, I hate theſe Conſequences:</hi> VVho the Story belongs to, the Reader muſt judge: But if the Anſwerer be not more Inconſequent then the Duke; I will ſhare in the Blame, that for all him, had no ſhare in the fault.</p>
            <p>In his next Period <hi>pag.</hi> 6, 7. he looks like a man of the <hi>White Apron</hi>; and I think it as Lawful for a <hi>Blew</hi> one to talk of <hi>Euclids Elements,</hi> as for that to medle with Religion; and of the two, that ſpots leaſt: He ſays, <hi>He will not read us an Anatomical Lecture upon his Graces Paper, nor curiouſly diſſect every Nerve and Muſcle.</hi> This is be like to excuſe both his Skill and Courſeneſs; he was for ſhorter work, though it ſavour'd ſomewhat more of the <hi>Butcher.</hi> From hence he ſhifts Callings and turns <hi>Cook,</hi> Couſen-german to t'other; and without ſo much as waſhing his Hands, falls to talk of <hi>Haſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Books, and ſerving them up with</hi> Limon <hi>and</hi> Anchovies. Men uſe the Metaphors of their Calling and Genius; but he ſhows ill Judgment: For an <hi>Aſs</hi> in a <hi>Chair</hi> were as true Painting, as this Wit: That Sauce in my Opinion had done much better with a <hi>Calves-Head.</hi> And now he Promiſes us his matter in a lump, and to ſay true, it looks as if it came out of the Mine of Confuſion, Groſs enough.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106220:6"/>He firſt ſalutes the Dukes <hi>Method to confute the Atheiſt,</hi> p. 8. and will not have the <hi>Mutation of things in the World a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the Eternity of it, no more than the Dukes to render him not the ſame</hi> George <hi>Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>he was forty year ago.</hi> But in this the Gentleman is ſhort, and beſide the Cuſhion: For though I fancy the Duke would ſay him many kind things to be the ſame he was forty years ago, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the ſame <hi>Perſonality</hi> under mutations; to conclude, the World may be Eternal notwithſtanding its proper Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, is a mighty <hi>Non-ſequitur.</hi> For it is to ſay, becauſe a thing is, it muſt always be. I ſhould rather think, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Duke is a Being of time, and once was not, and again will not be that <hi>George</hi> D. of <hi>Buckingham</hi> he is, and therefore he ſuffers thoſe mutations, we ſee him under: It is a good Argument, that the Revolutions we dayly ſee the World ſubject to, makes it, at leaſt probable, that it is a Being of Time, that once was not, and again will not be the VVorld it is.</p>
            <p>In Truth, there is no Parity in his allution, and therefore his Argument is fallacious; for how does this follow, that the World may be <hi>Eternal</hi> for all its Changes, <hi>becauſe</hi> George <hi>D. of</hi> B. <hi>is the ſame he was forty years ſince, notwithſtanding his Bodily Mutations.</hi> I muſt return him his Complement, which he, with leſs reaſon makes the Duke, that his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt is not too Logical. A thing's being the ſame, does not neceſſarily conclude it never had a beginning, and to be ſure its <hi>Mutation,</hi> be it but of Accidents only, does not make its <hi>Eternity</hi> more credible.</p>
            <p>If the Duke were Eternal, for all his Change, it were a good Argument that the World might be ſo too, under all its Revolutions; But that the Dukes being that <hi>Individual</hi> he was forty years ago, for all his Mutations of Body, ſhould prove the World Eternal, notwithſtanding the changes of it, is as un-accountable as his poiſon of Wit, <hi>p.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106220:6"/>I take it to be a better way of Arguing, that if the Duke was Born, grows old, and muſt die, though He be the ſame D. of <hi>B.</hi> he was forty years ago, the World, that feeds him, had a beginning, grows old, and will have an end, though it be the ſame in nature that it was five thouſand years ago. And of this the daily mutation we ſee it ſubject to, are almoſt a Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>For all the Productions of the World <hi>Die,</hi> and all that are nouriſh'd of it End: It can neither give nor feed a life <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Time.</hi> And that it ſelf ſhould yet be <hi>Immortal,</hi> that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes nor keeps any thing elſe ſo, is againſt that parity of Reaſon, which we obſerve about all other things, and cannot refuſe here. All Productions are of the nature of the thing Producing: And tho' it may reaſonably be ordained by ſome Superiour Being, to entertain &amp; nouriſh many Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Mankind, 'tis <hi>Incomprehenſible</hi> that it Self ſhould be Eternal, whoſe Nature &amp; Powers we ſee ſo ſhort &amp; finite by the <hi>Revolutions</hi> and <hi>Mortality</hi> of the <hi>Creatures</hi> they exert and feed. Plain it is, upon our notion of <hi>Creation,</hi> this <hi>Dilemma</hi> vaniſhes, but upon <hi>Production,</hi> it will remain.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be objected: <hi>But the World out lives Man, and the Creatures it produces; and if the abſurdity of the World's being Eternal, is taken from its</hi> Productions <hi>not being like it Self, why does not the World, ſuch as it is, produce or feed a life as durable as its own</hi>? I anſwer, that it differs mightily, Men beget lives longer and ſhorter than their own, <hi>are they not therefore Mortal? or did they not beget them?</hi> It is one thing to talk of <hi>Mortal Production</hi> out of an <hi>Eternal Being,</hi> and another thing to ſay that a <hi>Temporal Being</hi> ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce or nouriſh another leſs durable than it ſelf: Beſides, the Objection granting the Queſtion of the In-eternity of the World, it is eaſie to conceive that the <hi>Supreme Agent,</hi> whoſe Wiſdom and Power made it, contriv'd that excellent Fabrick, Houſe or Stage of Life, more durable than that of any Man or Age, to entertain ſo many Generations of Mankind, as he

               </gap>d by the works of their own hands. They may allow it to thoſe of the <hi>Supreem Agent</hi> to ſurvive them, without the neceſſity of their being Eternal.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Argumentum ad hominem,</hi> the World cannot to him be mutable and Eternal; For 'tis plain, that he allows <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſibility</hi> (which he knows, with <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> takes with it immutability) <hi>to be an Atribute of God, and that God only is Eternal,</hi> p. 9. Now I cannot apprehend why he refuſes <hi>Mutability</hi> to be an Argument againſt <hi>Eternity,</hi> or how the World may be <hi>Eternal</hi> tho' <hi>Mutable,</hi> when he argues that God is only <hi>Impaſſible</hi> or <hi>Immutable,</hi> becauſe he is <hi>Eternal.</hi> Let him have a care of his Airy Gentlemans Fate, <hi>p.</hi> 6. And yet if he be as much a <hi>School-man</hi> as he would have us believe, he muſt know that the Argument the Duke has advanc'd againſt the <hi>Athieſts,</hi> is Celebrated by the <hi>Schools.</hi> And tho' the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Teſtimony is a begging of the queſtion to an <hi>Athieſt,</hi> 'tis doubtleſs <hi>Orthodox</hi> with this Perſon; and he tells us, <hi>That the things that are ſeen, are Temporal, and the faſhion of this World paſſeth away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for all this he fancies the Duke has done little, and that he could do wonders againſt the <hi>Athieſt,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>If he were to diſcourſe him, he would preſs him with this</hi> Dilemma. <hi>If the World be Eternal, it muſt be the cauſe of its own exiſtence, p.</hi> 9. And this he urges without mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>Athiest,</hi> and runs through all the Conſequences of it, with as much confidence and vanity as if he had firſt obliged the World with the knowledge of the ſecret; and when all is done, it is better ſaid by the Duke, and with leſs excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the main queſtion, <hi>p.</hi> 5. And to ſay true, it grows upon every Common in the Countrey. But with his leave, I take the Dukes Argument of the <hi>In-eternity</hi> of the World, from the <hi>Mutability</hi> of it, to be much the better of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106220:7"/>
two; for the abſurbity of any thing being the <hi>Cauſe or Effect of its own exiſtence,</hi> which this man ſays is the conſequence of the Worlds being <hi>Eternal,</hi> being perhaps as applicable to one <hi>Eternal</hi> as another, is no credit to his better way of Diſcourſing an <hi>Athiest,</hi> and proving a <hi>Deity.</hi> For a thing to be the Cauſe or Effect of it ſelf, is, in my poor Opinion, not too <hi>Logical</hi> and I am affraid, too near a Kin to Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe. His making the Duke to hint at nothing elſe in proof of a God, is diſ-ingenious; for there is one thing mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he takes no notice of, <hi>p.</hi> 5. For, ſays the Duke, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the World has been Created out of nothing is not material to our purpoſe, becauſe if a</hi> Supream Intelligent Agent, <hi>has fram'd the World to be what it is, and has made us to be what we are, we ought as much to ſtand in awe of it, as if it had made both <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s and the World out of nothing.</hi> Which plainly imports thus much; That though the matter of the World were <hi>Eternal,</hi> that Being whoſe VViſdom and Power, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpos'd and fram'd it into the Glorious and Regular thing we all ſee it is, ſhew him to be what we call God, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s that we ſhould fear Him; which is beſt done by a ſober and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar life, becauſe that is moſt ſuitable to the Law of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and conſequently the mind of the great <hi>Workman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Built and Skill then of the VVorld, thus proving the <hi>Supreme Intelligence,</hi> and at the ſame time, that he is the object of the Adoration of his Creatures, we are naturally brought to the Dukes next point, too weakly oppoſed by his unweary Answerer, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That Man only of all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, having had conceptions, at leaſt ſuſpicions of a <hi>Deity</hi> and another <hi>World</hi>; It is probable there is <hi>something nearer a Kin to the Nature of God in Man,</hi> than in any other Animal whatſoever, and that <hi>Instinct</hi> of a <hi>Deity</hi> ought to be our Guide and Director in chooſing the beſt way for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>Worship</hi> of God.</q>
This is the paſſage the Gentleman falls upon, and tells us <hi>p.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>That that is as fair a Plea for the</hi> Alcoron; <hi>as the</hi> New Teſtament for <hi>Pythagoras's Golden
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106220:8"/>
Verſes,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul's Epiſtles.</hi> But which way, he leaves us to gueſs? And yet we ſhall not gueſs to ſay that <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras's Golden Verſes</hi> are much nearer a Kin to St. <hi>Paul's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles,</hi> than the <hi>Alcoron</hi> to the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> For the one has great and excellent Truths, without Impoſture; the other not. And tho' leſs Nobly deſcended, and of inferiour Authority, ſo far as they are right, it is no diſhonour to St. <hi>Paul's Epiſtles,</hi> that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> writ Truth, nor to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct that his <hi>Verſes</hi> are ſo far approved by it. And if this Gentleman would but allow the Duke the Law, which is yet leſs than the courteſy of the Learned, he knows how Fruitful the Doctrine of <hi>Idea's</hi> is to the defence of the Dukes Inſtinct.</p>
            <p>To ſay true, it were enough to refer the Reader to the Dukes Paper, and that of his <hi>Anſwerer.</hi> The natural, plain, and eaſie Deduction of the one from <hi>p.</hi> 11. to <hi>p.</hi> 19. the Dis-ingenious Citation, Pervertion and confuſion of the other throughout, will make him think I might have ſpar'd my ſelf the pains of following him here. But that it may appear, beyond all doubt, let us hear him at large how well he grounds his Exceptions.</p>
            <p>He ſays, <hi>if he be not miſtaken,</hi> (and that is modeſtly condition'd,) <hi>his</hi> Grace <hi>muſt mean Humane Reaſon, not regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by any Publick and Politick Reaſon of a Community, but as every private Man's Reaſon dictates to him.</hi> And that then the Duke has this Conſequence,
<q>That it is one of the greateſt crimes a Man can be guilty of, to force us to act or ſin againſt that Inſtinct of Religion, and ſomething a-Kin to the Sin againſt the <hi>H. Ghost.</hi>
               </q>
For this Doctrine, thus haſh'd &amp; dreſt by himſelf, he is angry with me; <hi>And but that his</hi> Grace <hi>is no</hi> Minor, <hi>he ſhould ſuſpect the</hi> Penſilvanian <hi>had Tutor'd him with his Quakeriſtical Doctrine</hi>; Mighty civil to the Duke, and very juſt to Me. I am ſorry the Duke pays ſo dear for my acquaintance, and that I cannot have the Honour to have ſuch a <hi>Pupil</hi> without a Jeer upon His. The Man might have nam'd me plainer if he had pleas'd, without fear of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106220:8"/>
fatal and murdering blow of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> though not without great Scandal. But in this we are both Debtors to his ſingular Goodneſs, that whoſoever got the Child, he reſolves to be Goſſip; and for that purpoſe has provided four Names, which are theſe four enſuing Conſequences.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>that Reaſon is the</hi> Sole <hi>guide of every Man's Religion,</hi> tho' neither <hi>Sole</hi> nor <hi>Reaſon</hi> are any terms of the Duke's Doctrine, and that the D. excuſes the omiſſion of Scripture becauſe of the qualifications of the Men his Diſcourſe was deſign'd too, that he might come cloſe to their own Natures and not beg the Queſtion. But in its due place he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>Christanity</hi> as the beſt Religion, <hi>p.</hi> 18. and then to be ſure he cannot neglect the Scripture.</p>
            <p>His Second conſequence he pins upon the Duke, is as juſt as the former. <hi>That Divine Revelation is not neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>; when it is evidently the meaning of that part of the Duke's Diſcourſe, that People uſe the <hi>Light</hi> that God has given them to chuſe themſelves a Religion by, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> for the beſt. Is it the way to deny re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion to preſs men to chuſe, with the beſt Skill they have, the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that is the trueſt <hi>Revelation.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this Man muſt be beſide himſelf a little, or He could hardly be ſo much beſide the matter.</p>
            <p>His Third Conſequence is yet more diſ-ingenious than the other; for he makes the Duke to ſay, <hi>That it is a most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Sin to lead Men out of the Errours Natural Religion, and bare Reaſon of neceſſity lead Mens to,</hi> whoſe very <hi>Eſſay</hi> was on purpoſe to lead Natural Men by the way of firſt Principles to imbrace revealed Religion. But is it, in good earneſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Sin to <hi>lead</hi> Men out of Errours, becauſe it is a Sin to <hi>force</hi> Men againſt their Conſciences? what Man can have a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier Tallent than this: The very guift of Conſequences. To ſhift <hi>Force</hi> for <hi>Lead,</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> for <hi>Error,</hi> ſhews His to be invulnerable with a Witneſs. In one he forges, &amp; begs the Queſtion in the other: No Man could be more dextrous at it:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106220:9"/>
doubtleſs he will in a while be as much out of humour with Conſequences, as his Airy Gallant; for no Man can make worſe. <hi>I must not perſwade a Man, becauſe I muſt not F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ce him; I muſt not</hi> Lead <hi>a Man, becauſe I must not drag and whip him; In fine, I must not Inform a Man, becauſe I must not knock him on the head.</hi> If this be the Gentlemans <hi>Leading.</hi> I ſhall have a care how I take him for a <hi>Guide.</hi> There's a ſort of Men, whoſe <hi>Mercies</hi> are <hi>Cruelties,</hi> and who with all their pretence to Reveal'd Religion, have not the Juſtice &amp; Mercy of a poor benighted <hi>Pagan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Laſt Conſequence he draws from the Duke's Poſition and Deductions, is this, <hi>That Men who believe a God, and follow the Dictates of Reaſon in his Worſhip, may be Saved in any, in all Religions, provided they know no better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how this Conſequence can with any Juſtice be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the Duke, that ſo expreſly, <hi>p.</hi> 18. prefers the Chriſtian Religion, is paſt my Skill. For unleſs he will make the Duke, to ſay that no Religion is neceſſary to Salvation, when he writes to perſwade People to have one, he muſt confeſs he makes the Chriſtian to be It, becauſe he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>That</hi> to our Belief and Practice; confirming it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the agreeableneſs of its <hi>Doctrine</hi> with what he is prompted by his Pious <hi>Inſtinct</hi> to believe to be true. Can a Man then ſay with any Conſcience that is Juſt, that the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>B.</hi> thinks Men may be Saved in <hi>any and in all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,</hi> when he firſt, makes Religion neceſſary, and then tells us that in his Conſcience he believes the Chriſtian to be the true: As if his buſineſs had been to Prophane, and not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the True Religion.</p>
            <p>And I cannot but wonder how this wild conception came in his head, ſo diſagreeable to the <hi>Duke's Reaſon, Instinct</hi> and <hi>Deductions.</hi> If he had ſaid, <hi>in any, or all Perſwaſions,</hi> he had Magnify'd the <hi>Duke's</hi> Charity, with this diſtinction, that Men of <hi>Sincerity</hi> in all Perſwaſions may be Saved, and not that Men may ſhift Perſwaſions for Intereſt, and yet go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106220:9"/>
tho' if it were ſo, perhaps this <hi>Doctor</hi> might have the better of the two by the Notion; <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> being none of the <hi>Dukes</hi> Vice. But to ſay that men may be Saved <hi>in any, or in all Religions,</hi> is ſomewhat harſh upon the <hi>Duke</hi>; and yet if in all theſe Religions, a Man muſt be, a Man that <hi>believes in God, and lives Virtuouſly,</hi> and in modes of Worſhip, <hi>knows no better,</hi> then the Tradition of his Fathers, it is hard to Damn him; And this Gentleman muſt produce better Authorties for his Severity, before it will have credit with Men of Senſe and Bowels,</p>
            <p>Now though this does not touch the Dukes Diſcourſe any more then his Charity, to admit that a <hi>Diſſenter, a</hi> Roman Catholick, <hi>a</hi> Jew, <hi>a</hi> Turk, <hi>an</hi> Indian <hi>may be ſaved,</hi> let us ſee how well it may be ſupported. St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems to have been of this Mans mind in the Preamble to the Story of <hi>Cornelius, Act.</hi> 10. till better taught: and who knows what this man may be in time. <hi>Of a truth I perceive</hi> (ſays Peter) <hi>that God is no reſpecter of Perſons, but in every Nation he that feareth him, and worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted of him.</hi> This was a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> neither <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> yet Devout, a Juſt man, one Fearing God; And as ſuch, with all, of all Nations of the ſame Quality, declared by this great Apoſtle, <hi>accepted with God:</hi> So that it ſeems here is (greatly doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs againſt this Gentleman's mind) ſome acceptance for the poor Men of the Dukes Inſtinct. Well, but let us ſuppoſe them to be Comparatively <hi>Benighted,</hi> was not <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſo too? Yet we ſee the conſequence, <hi>He was accepted as he was</hi>; and why, but becauſe ſincere, and he knew no better? He ſtood the fairer for revealed Religion; this prepared him for it: Nay, we are told by the ſame unqueſtionable Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>That in the times of Ignorance, God winked.</hi> And ſuch to be ſure he thinks theirs are, and I think are like to be, for all him: For if I miſtake not, the man is for the Promiſe at Home, let what will betide them Abroad. If he can but ſit under his <hi>Own Vine</hi> here, let the <hi>Rore,</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> take the <hi>Turk</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106220:10"/>
all the reſt for him. Extraordinary Itinerary Calls are ceas'd; for there's extraordinary Pains and Perils in the caſe, and though he may love Souls well, yet who ſhall Pay him.</p>
            <p>Well, but if God <hi>Winks at the Ignorant,</hi> muſt this Man be ſo <hi>prying</hi>? And if the Judge of the whole Earth will not be ſtrict, Ought He to turn <hi>Inquiſitor</hi>? Or muſt it be an hainous Error becauſe He ſays it, That Men that Fear God, and follow the Dictates of Reaſon in any Religion, and know no better, may be Saved? Moſt unjuſt then is his Clamour, <hi>againſt the Divinity of</hi> Calviniſts, <hi>as Inhumane,</hi> p. 4. That Damns men, <hi>p.</hi> 13. for not being better than they know how to be.</p>
            <p>But the Man builds the things he deſtroys; For he more than any body believes one of theſe three things; Firſt, That there is no ſuch thing as Salvation, or that men may be Sav'd in the Religion as it is <hi>by Law Eſtabliſh'd</hi> in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, Or that men are bound to ſubmit to the <hi>Religion Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Law,</hi> let the Iſſue in t'other World be what it will: For that Power he gives abſolutely into the Magiſtrates Hand; And who can be Judge upon him? The <hi>Engliſh</hi> of all which I take to be this, that men may be of any or all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, but not in the ſame Country, for fear of Suffering for it; but, <hi>cum furis Romae Romano vivete more.</hi> One after another, at <hi>Rome a Papiſt,</hi> at <hi>London a Proteſtant,</hi> at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople a Mahometan.</hi> This Principle, ſo naturally his own, is the conſequence of his Malice upon the Duke; for he would have the D's deduction of the Reaſonableneſs of Mens chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Religion by the direction of that which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves is neareſt a-kin to the Nature of God, to imply, that for all that, <hi>Men may be of any, and of all Religions</hi>; a pretty way to ſhift with all Winds, and Sail the Compaſs round: But in this he has more than avenged the Dukes quarrel upon himſelf; for he cannot make himſelf more ridiculous then in attempting to make the Duke ſo unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106220:10"/>And he is juſt as fair to <hi>Reaſon</hi> as he has been to the Duke. For if he ſays true, <hi>A man may follow the Dictates of it, and be of all Religions too:</hi> Such a Gipſy is Reaſon with him. And if you ask him, why Reaſon is ſo proſtitute a thing, that nothing comes amiſs to her; His Anſwer is extraordinary, <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it can never lead men to the knowledge of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a Trinity, the Incarnation, Death, Paſſion, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Aſcention, or Divinity of Chriſt. Ergo</hi> what? <hi>Ergo,</hi> It will bow to any elſe, though it be never ſo Idle and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant. Is not this ſad work for a <hi>Doctor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Dictates</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> will fall in with any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they may embrace the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> as well as another, and then he's gone again. He will certainly <hi>hate Conſequences too,</hi> when he has but thought of his own, that ſo <hi>inevitably attended his Conceptions</hi> to the diſadvantage of Religion. But the Dukes <hi>Inſtinct, or that which God has placed in our Hearts, ſo near a-kin to the Nature of God,</hi> he ſays, <hi>muſt be Reaſon,</hi> and that <hi>Reaſon</hi> he makes an arrant <hi>Strumpet</hi>; for he aſſures us, <hi>She is a Prolifick Parent of Idolatry, Superstition, Will-Worſhip, and a thouſand Abſurdities more in Religion,</hi> and quotes <hi>All Times, Places,</hi> and <hi>Ages</hi> for proof, <hi>p.</hi> 14. But as it happens, names not one of them to the point aſſerted.</p>
            <p>Now the little skill I have in Books, tells me quite other things to the Tale of this Anſwerer: That <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> are the moſt Unreaſonable things in the World, that They could never Bribe Her in any Time, and till Senſuality had Darkened and Over-laid Mens Reaſon, It was impoſſible for <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> to obtain that Empire, that in Prejudice of Reaſon, they have at any time got upon the belief of any part of Mankind. And if we will be juſt to <hi>Ethnick</hi> Ages, we find men among them of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Light; That, <hi>As having no Law, became a Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themselves, and that were of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion that kept the Law,</hi> as the Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſpeaks. Such was <hi>Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, Socrates, Plato, Xenocrates, Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106220:11"/>
Antipater, Zeno, Epicteius, Seneca, Plutarch, Cato, Cicero</hi> and others. And to be free with the Dukes Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, I take old <hi>Plutarch</hi> to be much a better <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who calls this <hi>Inſtinct, The everlaſting foundation of Virtue. A Law written, not in Pillars of Wood or Stone, but in the Hearts of men.</hi> But that he may meet with ſome Rebuke; for much is owing him on this account; I ſhall take upon me to examine his Imputations, be it upon this <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> or be that, <hi>Reaſon,</hi> I will not quarrel the word.</p>
            <p>I do ſay then, that He muſt either deny that God hath plac'd any ſuch thing in man, to diſtinguiſh him from other <hi>Animals</hi>; or if that be true, He is to chuſe his Religion without conſulting it. If the firſt, he makes us all <hi>Beaſts</hi> and himſelf an <hi>Atheiſt</hi>; if the laſt, our Religion is in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>evident, we know not what, for we are not to take the Judgment of the Divine Gift in our Election: What a Religion muſt that be? If his Argument were true, here would be indeed as fair a Plea for the <hi>Alcoran</hi> as the <hi>New Testament.</hi> But it were Blaſphemous ſo to ſpeak of the Dukes <hi>Inſtinct</hi> For it is that Notion of God which is innate, and as it were congeneal to Us: We bring it with us into the World. The peculiar Seal and Mark of Divinity: A kind of counter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>part of himſelf in Man; his Picture in little: The Attributes that are Infinite in Him, being here Epitomiz'd and Reſembled in Man, that by It He may have a right knowledge of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſenſe of his Duty. Antiquity offers a cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes both <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian. Justin Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> exceed. But the oppoſition is too mean to draw out ſo great an <hi>Artillery</hi>; It will be time enough when a greater force appears to aſſault ſo venerable a Truth: And in the mean time I will attend him in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, ſuch as they are. But perhaps he will excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe he does not <hi>certainly know</hi> what the Duke means by that part of Us which is neareſt a kin to the Nature of God. For he ſays. <hi>If he be not miſtaken, it muſt be Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:106220:11"/>
But if I be not miſtaken, he had better have known firſt, and not have drawn poſitive Concluſions from doubted Premiſſes. But ſuppoſe the Duke underſtands <hi>Reaſon</hi> by that <hi>Instinct,</hi> rather than a <hi>Divine Gift</hi> to guide our Reaſon and Underſtanding; <hi>will Reaſon plead the cauſe of the</hi> Alcoran <hi>as ſoon as that of the</hi> New Teſtament? VVhat has God done then to make us Reaſonable? I had thought that the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> had been a more reaſonable Book, and that God Almighty had not made Man ſo deceivable a Creature, or fram'd him with ſuch falſe Intellects; and ſubmitted him to ſuch dangerous Errors. And though he might have made him Feeble, yet not ſo ſquint-ey'd or tender-ſighted that he could not ſee ſtraight, or tell colours, or diſtinguiſh an <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> from the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray, is the <hi>Alcoran</hi> as credible as <hi>Chriſt's Sermons upon the Mount, to the Multitude, to his Diſciples?</hi> VVherein we find the moſt excellent <hi>Morality, Piety,</hi> and <hi>Purity of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi>; ſo ſuitable to our Underſtandings, that they ſeem to anſwer the Perfection of Reaſon? I know he will tell us he means it of Revealed Religion, as he does, <hi>p.</hi> 13. <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> (ſays he) <hi>can never lead us to the knowledge of the belief of the Trinity, Reſurrection, Aſcention, or Divinity of the Son of God.</hi> To be led to the knowledge of the belief of any thing, is odly ſaid; but let it paſs: However, there is a difference between Miracles and Fables; Arrant Poperies and Fictions; ſo ill counterfeited too, that a man of ſmall ſight muſt needs diſcern them.</p>
            <p>Tradition, and prejudic'd Education indeed give credit often to ſuch things; but Reaſon does not chuſe, but is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born: Beſides, we have as good Authority for our Saviours Miracles, as for any thing we did not ſee: Of <hi>Mahomets</hi> we have not the like; And this is further to be ſaid, if Reaſon cannot work them, it never oppoſed them: On the contrary, it leads us to believe them, and Revealed Religion for their ſakes; For a man muſt be a Hogg to oppoſe himſelf to ſo
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106220:12"/>
over-coming an Evidence, in lieu of a man that is led by Reaſon.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me as if this Gentleman dare not venture his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with Reaſon, that oppoſes Reaſon to Religion. The <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is ſo far from refuſing Reaſon any ſhare in our <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that it is made a Duty to us to give <hi>a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Chriſtian Hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15. And it were abſurd to give a Reaſon for that which a man Receives without Reaſon, and is impoſſible to Receive by it, or for Reaſon to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; and if it could, it judges ſo ill, that it will as ſoon proſtrate it ſelf to the <hi>Alcoran</hi> as to the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not all the Dukes fault, perhaps he would go a great way to yield him his point, if he did but mean <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Reaſon, or Reaſon regulated by a Community.</hi> This he explains, <hi>p.</hi> 19. For his Community is the Government: But had not this been a fine Receit to keep Chriſtianity out of all Countries? For had this reaſon of Community prevailed, there had been neither <hi>Chriſtians</hi> nor <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Without Racking a Syllable of his excellent Argument; I think I may ſay, it pleads as much for the <hi>Alcoran</hi> as the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and more in <hi>Turkey</hi>; For if the Political Reaſon of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of a Country is ſtill to conclude thoſe that dwell in it; Turks, <hi>muſt be</hi> Turks, Infidels, <hi>must be</hi> Infidels, Idolators, <hi>must be</hi> Idolators <hi>ſtill:</hi> In which alſo I perceive he is a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican,</hi> after all his Railing at <hi>Commonwealths</hi>-men: for the <hi>Community over all Cauſes, with him, Judges.</hi> I don't know but it may run as far as <hi>Excluſion</hi> too: To be ſure it would, if all had agreed; for all meaſures of Right or Wrong, True or Falſe, are by <hi>my Man</hi> humbly ſubmitted to the Political Reaſon of the Community; What is this but to ſay; that every Religion is beſt where it is Eſtabliſh'd, though the moſt disagreeing among themſelves, and any or all of them with the True?</p>
            <p>Nor is this the extent of the Dukes Errour, He is not only for Reaſon, <hi>guiding and chooſing,</hi> but he would have <hi>every
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106220:12"/>
private mans Reaſon Dictate for himſelf.</hi> This is a Peſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Doctrine in the Anſwerers account; and yet ſhould a man chuſe without himſelf, for himſelf, he muſt certainly be beſide himſelf. Who ſhould chooſe for a man but himſelf, if he muſt anſwer for himſelf? It would certainly be moſt unreaſonable to judge a man for a thing he is not allow'd the liberty of his choice in: Nor do I think a man can have any Reaſon to render for his Religion, that receives his Religion <hi>without the ſuffrage of his own Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Has our Bodies Eyes, and our Souls none? Shall our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral part act upon ſight, and our Eternal upon <hi>Trust,</hi> and That not of God, but of Man? That when the poor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer will be <hi>Judge</hi> of his pay, and not truſt his very Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter about the currentneſs of a <hi>Groat,</hi> we ſhould be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction about that Treaſure, which is of Eternal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us: Surely then, Underſtandings are of no uſe in Heaven: But I know not how to believe it. To be a Child in Malice is excellent; But under favour, in Underſtanding, not. To truſt out our Souls upon <hi>Humane Say-ſo</hi>'s, is to go into Coates again; <hi>And to be ſure, a Childs Coat, is a Fools, upon a mans Back.</hi> Let them wear Bibs that <hi>Slabber,</hi> and the <hi>Blind</hi> follow the <hi>Dog</hi> and the <hi>Bell.</hi> In Religion, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity concludes Minors; but Conviction determines Men.</p>
            <p>That this Gentleman ſhould pretend to <hi>Protestancy,</hi> and rail at a mans Judging for himſelf, is abſurd. If the reaſon of the Community muſt guide, let him not be ſo angry with the <hi>Romanists</hi> for ſaying, <hi>Believe as the Church Believes</hi>; when he ſays, <hi>Believe as the State requires:</hi> The one preſſes Conformity <hi>as by the</hi> Catholick <hi>Church Establiſh'd</hi>; the other cryes <hi>as by Law Establiſh'd</hi>; A Doctrine Calculated to all <hi>Meridians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I fear he grants too much for the quarrel, but let Him look to that: For the one pre-ſuppoſes the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to conduct, to juſtify the determination; The other ſcorns her words, but won't bate one jot of Conformity. I ſhall only tell him, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106220:13"/>
taking the <hi>Tranſlation of the Bible</hi> to have been an <hi>Appeal</hi> to the People, made by the firſt Reformers, againſt the Church they Diſſented from; If as this Man ſuggeſts the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of reading it now, be, that we muſt not make any Judgment to our ſelves of what we read, the <hi>Appeal</hi> cannot be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and our Caſe is not mended; On the contrary, it is made a Temptation of Trouble and Miſchief to Us: For, whereas the <hi>Inſpir'd Doctor</hi> tells us, that in Religious matters, <hi>We are to be perſwaded in our own Minds That they commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Themſelves and Doctrines to mens Conſciences,</hi> ſo making Them Judges for Themſelves. <hi>That Conſcience Accuſes and Excuſes, ay, our own Hearts, that all are to walk as they have Received, and not uſurp a Judging Power over our fellow Christians Faith or Liberty</hi>; We are told now, that all our Faith and Worſhip muſt be ſubmitted to the Political reaſon of the Community, we are of, <hi>hit or miſs.</hi> I take this to be leaping blind fold into t'other World in matters of Salvation.</p>
            <p>But it may be, he will tell me, that he has nothing to ſay againſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> conſider'd in its <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>un-deprav'd,</hi> only, <hi>That it cannot lead us to the knowledge of Revealed Religion</hi>; and he ſays as much, <hi>p.</hi> 13. But this will not do, or elſe do worſe then before; For if by Reaſon he means a <hi>Reaſonable Capacity,</hi> he does not mean as the Duke means, and ſays, and then <hi>he is miſtaken indeed in what his Grace calls that part of us that is nearest a kin to the Nature of God,</hi> to wit, His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in Us, and is underſtood by this Noble Peer to be the <hi>Guide and Director</hi> of our Underſtandings in our choice, and, which gives the Rectitude and true Judgment.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if he underſtands <hi>Reaſon</hi> abſtractly, and as the Principle it ſelf; It can no more be deprav'd, then the <hi>Sun</hi> darkn'd by the Miſts and Vapours of the Earth. And truly it is juſt as reaſonable to accuſe the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> with the Death of our Saviour, and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> with the Errors and Impieties of <hi>Christians,</hi> as to charge to the account of Reaſon all the ill things, that men pretending to it, have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106220:13"/>
committed. And yet to do the worſt of them right, the moſt Idolatrous, Unnatural and Senſeleſs Rites the darkeſt Ages of the World ever had, they have diſcharg'd their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and plac'd them, in all times, to the unaccountable Tradition and Authority of their Prieſthood: Where, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this time, I will leave them too: Only I muſt needs ſay, I wiſh the <hi>Dust</hi> this man has ſo vehemently rais'd upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, be not to put out our Eyes too, that we may be leſs Reſty, and lead better. For if ſuch men once get us out of our depth, we are gone. Truſt thick and three-fold. And the more Un-Intelligable, the more Venerable, this will be the Maxim.</p>
            <p>But if I may, I would wonder for all that, how after all, He can ſo expreſly contradict himſelf, as <hi>p.</hi> 14. to allow <hi>Reaſon to Judge,</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 36. To ſend his Readers thither to convince others of their Duty both in their Spiritual and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Capacity. He muſt have relented him mightily, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been in a Fit, is come to himſelf, or elſe his own reaſon has had the wind, and is too many for his Perjudices, or he could not have given himſelf ſo quickly ſo great a Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; But this ſhews the Nature and Power of Reaſon, that it will riſe to its own Evidence and Vindication, even in the moſt Unreaſonable Men.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Author</hi> tells the World, <hi>That granting the Duke to have carried his</hi> Poſtulatum <hi>of the being of a Supream and perfect Power, he would have followed his blow at another rate, and ſent his Reader another Road,</hi> which ſhews the <hi>Duke</hi>'s little, and his better Skill and Courage; tho' he might have been ſo modeſt as to let us have been the Judges of that: <hi>He did not catch this of his</hi> Grace's <hi>Pen.</hi> And pray what would he have done? why, after a flood of words (and that is all.) he tells us, <hi>That he would have ſent them to the Scriptures.</hi> And by this, one would think that the Man had never read the Book he pretends to Anſwer; For that Noble Peer expreſly tells us in the beginning of his Diſcourſe, that he has to do
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106220:14"/>
with Men that deny their Authority, and therefore to uſe it to prove what he aſſerts, were to begg the Queſtion. And I do aſſure him, ſo ſoon as he had <hi>Gain'd the</hi> Poſtulatum <hi>of the being a Supream and perfect Power,</hi> he recommends them to the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> of which I had always underſtood till now, the Scriptures had been the <hi>Creed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, but in caſe of doubtful places he has an Interpreter, a <hi>Judge</hi> for Him at hand too, <hi>and That is the Society of Christians</hi>; why could not he as well have ſaid the <hi>Church</hi>; and then have told us which <hi>Church</hi>; for there is not one of a douzen that don't alledge the <hi>Text</hi> for their Authority. But to do him Right, he has given us a Rule to know her by; he takes it, (<hi>Good Proteſtant</hi>) from <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis,</hi> and a Golden one it is, he aſſures us; But for all that, I fancy it has an Iron Rod at the Tail for him.</p>

Worſhip; and that there are, or may be Laws enough pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to ſecure the State from thoſe civil diſorders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that any ſuch Man might attempt under that pretence. Here, ſuch People would not only juſtly ſuffer, but without a cover too: The Diſgrace and Odium, in the opinion of all, as well as Penalty, falling only upon the Criminals head. I do with the laſt duty and defference a Man can bear to his King and Countrey, Wiſh and Pray for their Proſperty: I would by no means that any Man ſhould be indulg'd to their detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I ſhould beſides my civil obligations, cancel thoſe of Conſcience before Almighty God, if I thought it; But I cannot prevail with my ſelf, to believe that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may not be ſafe by ſome civil Proviſion, with the moſt ſuſpected <hi>Diſſenter</hi>: Elſe 'twere paſt a ſcruple with me that his Liberty ſhould at all times purchaſe the publick ſafety.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman allows <hi>all Diſſenters may not be Guilty</hi>; if ſo, it muſt be a dangerous Execution; Eſpecially when the Juſtice of our humane Laws <hi>had rather an hundred Criminals ſhould eſcape, then that one Innocent ſhould periſh.</hi> But he ſays, <hi>he has not</hi> Momus'<hi>s Windows to ſee, and know them by.</hi> I am ſure he has too much of his mind, or he had not troubled the World with ſuch a bundle of Exceptions: But if he can't diſtinguiſh them, will that excuſe his deſtroying them? I am ſorry this Gentleman's Divinity has no more Bowels, nor better ſence; for if Mankind be left without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Guilt</hi> from <hi>Innocence,</hi> They muſt puniſh in the lump; They muſt be unjuſt.</p>
            <p>This is Judging without <hi>Overt acts</hi>; by gueſs and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy. A way that may make an <hi>Innocent Guilty,</hi> and a <hi>Guilty</hi> Perſon <hi>Innocent.</hi> To be caſt without Evidence is wrong, and what Witneſs is there of that which is only in <hi>foro Conſcientiae?</hi> then what Judge? A piece of cruel <hi>Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm.</hi> I know not what to call it. Not only <hi>Christianity,</hi> but <hi>Gamaliel</hi>; ay, our own Laws would have taught Him a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way of finding out Criminals, yet His excels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:106220:16"/>Well, <hi>But the Laws against Papists,</hi> (He ſays) <hi>are occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian Machinations and King-killing Doctrine, able to ruine the whole Earth, and lay the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Eternal Miſchief to Mankind</hi>; And for thoſe againſt Diſſenters, <hi>They were made, becauſe of their Rebellious, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, Covenanting, Aſſociating, Murdering</hi> Principles. <hi>p.</hi> 15.16.21.22.</p>
            <p>Now though this Man would think it imprudent in me, and I, that it is none of my buſineſs, to vindicate the Perſons charged from His imputations; yet I have ſo much Juſtice, I confeſs, as not to condemn Parties by Particulars, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as to be ſatisfied with their ſolemn diſclaimings of ſuch Practices: For I did never love that one Man ſhould have the making of another Mans Faith or Confeſſion, eſpecially if He were His <hi>Adverſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt tell Him alſo, I cannot admire His <hi>Wiſdom, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> or <hi>Juſtice,</hi> in his Reflection upon the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> after the aſſurances that ſo great an One of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion has given Him and His Friends of their Security and protection: For if they are a People <hi>able to ruine the whole Earth, and lay the Foundations of Eternal Miſchief to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi>; believe me, <hi>England</hi> is in an ill pickle, and tho' I am an ill Judge, He has in it put but a <hi>Scurvy Complement</hi> upon the King.

            <p>For <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> I ſhall ſay no more, than that it may be, the <hi>Wars</hi> made Them, rather than They made the <hi>Wars,</hi> and that things <hi>older than the Act of Oblivion,</hi> are in Law, buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. And with Submiſſion, this Gentlemans <hi>Conſcience,</hi> for ought I know, might have done as well to let Them alone.</p>
            <p>For the late occaſion He takes, let him be juſt, and He will find the <hi>Excluders,</hi> almoſt, every <hi>Sunday</hi> at their Pariſh

Shall I recriminate the uſuage of the late King about the Declaration of <hi>Indulgence?</hi> And ſay, that ſome Men lov'd Him well for their own ends? And that when they were not humour'd exactly, <hi>They would pout, ſlack their Loyalty, and grow paſſive, let things go as they will for them:</hi> A thing almoſt threaten'd by this <hi>Loyal Gentleman, p.</hi> 33.

But I would be modeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that not of Prudence, but Choice, for I hope He would give His <hi>Replicant</hi> the Liberty He expects, and takes with the Great Peer He anſwers.</p>
            <p>And I muſt ſay I cannot but extreamly admire, that leſs than twelve Lines, ſo ſoftly dropt by the Duke in favour of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> ſhould have almoſt as many leaves of little invectives to anſwer them. Believe me, it impeaches His pretences to Chriſtianity, and renders Him to have more of the <hi>Fire brand</hi> than of the <hi>Loyal Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould end here; but there are two things more I think muſt be mentioned, that nothing carrying any pretenſe to Weight may be omitted.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That the reaſon of the Penal Laws is purely Political and not Spiritual, to obviate the Overt-acts, Acts of Treaſon and Rebellion; for a man may be of any Religion to himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately exerciſe it too, not exceeding ſuch a number above their Families.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That Tolleration is the way to overthrow Religion, and with it the Government, eſpecially as now Eſtabliſhed; and is a fatal Enemy to Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt, I ſay, <hi>Fact</hi> muſt Rule us; I would deſire to know if the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> Printed with the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> be purely Political and not Spiritual? I hope, without offence I may ſay, it is not. The Laws of the 23, and 28th. of the

And this is done in one place or another every day. So that it is not true in Fact, <hi>That People may have any Religion to themſelves</hi>; becauſe, both thoſe that keep home, and within the number allow'd by the Act againſt <hi>Conventicles,</hi> and thoſe that exceed it, are notwithſtanding preſented upon the former Statutes of the Queen; Nay, I have known ſome perſons Proſecuted by them all, at one and the ſame time.</p>
            <p>And, with all due reſpect to the Wiſdom of our former <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators,</hi> if this Gentlemans gloſs be true, I think Improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould no more have been Enacted, then Impoſſibilities or Contradictions.

And it is one of the ſtrangeſt things in the World that greater numbers may meet on twenty other occaſions every day, with leſs fear of the Breach of the Peace. As that Religion cannot be good that makes any man the worſe for having it: So I am not for beheading any thing before it is born,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106220:17"/>
or puniſhing People for fear of what they may do. I would hope the beſt, and that if they had that freedom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in the exerciſe of their Religious Perſwaſion, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would teach their Wit, it were too good to hazard, that if their Duty or Gratitude did not oblige them, their very <hi>Intereſt</hi> muſt; and there is hardly one of them ſo ſtupid, as not to underſtand and purſue the ways that preſerve it.</p>
            <p>For that of <hi>Colleration,</hi> it is my Opinion, he does ill to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi>; For if he mean the ſame thing, it needed not have had a freſh Head with other Conſequences; nor was it requiſite that I did further conſider it.</p>
            <p>And I am heartily ſorry, I muſt ſay, that to the end of his Anſwer he hardly fails of his uſual way of Conſtruction: For after having made <hi>Tolleration</hi> as ill a thing as he could, and as ſuch, the Duke to be the <hi>Patron</hi> of it; He falls on with a whole Volly of hard words, asking the Duke, <hi>p.</hi> 27, 28, 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>If he would give</hi> Tolleration <hi>to a Rebellious, Aſſociating, Sanguinary, Inhumane, Blaſphemous, Murdering Conſcience,</hi> ſuch as that of <hi>Calvaniſts, that Decrees Damnation without free Conditions; Kill'd his Maſter, Father and Brother, and that particularly uſed him ſo ill.</hi> But this is ſo far from determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that in ill Language it miſerably begs the queſtion, by the reflection of falſe and Scandalous Conſequences, upon what the Duke ſaid in favour of <hi>Indulgence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there no ſuch thing as <hi>Conſcience,</hi> becauſe it may be falſly pretended? Or ſhall a Sober and Moral Conſcience be deny'd <hi>Indulgence,</hi> becauſe ſome or other may, or do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe it? And that He may have ſomething to think on; I ask if thoſe Calamities were the effects of a <hi>Tolleration?</hi> If ſo, pray when was there one to do us ſo much miſchief? The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, I know, he will have to find one, makes me ask him another queſtion: If <hi>Eaſe</hi> to men in that reſpect, were not the way of greateſt Safety to the Publick, at leaſt, fit to be tryed. I muſt ſay, this Gentleman takes too many things
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106220:18"/>
for granted, and needs a very merciful Adverſary: One that will do leſs then not exact the uttermoſt Farthing, though he himſelf will reap where he hath not Sown, and Compel Conformity where he cannot convince. <hi>The very point,</hi> he ſays, <hi>His Grace has with ſo much Juſtice laſht the</hi> Calviniſts <hi>for,</hi> and that he himſelf did but juſt now call <hi>Inhumane</hi> and <hi>Blaſpemous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Good-Nature with all that little prudence that falls to my ſhare, makes it eaſier to me to believe that a <hi>Chriſtian Tolleration</hi> were the beſt way to prevent the Miſchiefs that are ſaid to be the effects of it. I ſay, by all means <hi>Secure the Government</hi>; But withall, pray let us ſee if that may not be done, by ſome other and eaſier method: It is pity that it ſhould coſt the <hi>Liberties or Eſtates</hi> of ſo vaſt a People as do Diſſent, and, I would hope, without ſo much as an ill Thought to the King or his Government.</p>
            <p>But he is ſo in love with the <hi>Chaſe,</hi> that without any more to do, he ſends us to the <hi>French King,</hi> p. 29. <hi>To take mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for</hi> England <hi>in point of Religion:</hi> Which is pretty well for an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> and a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and perhaps a <hi>Doctor</hi> too. This in any Man had not been well, but in an <hi>Engliſh Protestant,</hi> with his leave, is Impious, ſince it is to draw that <hi>Kings Severity</hi> into Example, and render it a Prudence to be imitated here. A Notion, he has taught me to call, in him, <hi>Atheistical,</hi> becauſe it cannot be done by a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, Whoſe Conſcience,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>will not let him be of any, and of all Religions.</hi> This yields little Conſolation to the <hi>French Proteſtants</hi>: And if he would but think well upon it, not too much to the <hi>Engliſh Church</hi>; For if he ſays true, <hi>That</hi> Lewis <hi>the Fourteenth does well to Compel an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in his own Religion</hi>; He has recommended a Policy that goes a great way to diſcharge the King of His Promiſe, and make us all of his: I don't know whether <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters ſay ſo much as this, that were made the Proof of the <hi>Plot.</hi> This may make <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> amends for <hi>p.</hi> 27, 28, 29.</p>
