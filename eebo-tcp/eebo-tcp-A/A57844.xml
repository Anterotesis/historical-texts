         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> SPEAKER</salute>,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the way we are, we have
gone as farre as words can
carry us: We have voted
our own Rights, and the
Kings Duty: No doubt there
is a Relative Duty between
a King and Subjects; Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
from a Subject to a King, Protection
from a King to His People. The present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie
distance between His Majestie and the
Parliament, makes the whole Kingdome
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96607:3"/>
stand amazed, in a fearfull expectation of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
Calamities to fall upon it: It deeply and
conscionably concerns this House to compose
and settle these threatening ruining distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I am touch'd, I am pier'd
with an apprehension of the Honour of the
House, and successe of this Parliament. The
best way to give a stop to these desperate, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
mischiefs is, To make a fair way for
the Kings return hither; It will likewise give
best satisfaction to the people, and will be
our best Justification. M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> That we
may the better consider the condition we are
now in, let us set our selves three Yeers back:
If any man then, could have credibly told us,
That within three Yeers the Queen shall be
gone out of <hi>England</hi> into the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
for any cause whatsoever, The King
shal remove from his Parliament, from <hi>London</hi>
to <hi>York,</hi> declaring himself not to be safe here,
That there shall be a totall Rebellion in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
Such discords and distempers both in
Church and State here, as now we finde; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
we should have trembled at the thought
of it: Wherefore it is fit we should be sensible
now we are in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96607:3"/>
On the other side, If any man then, could
have crediblie told us, That within three
Yeers ye shall have a Parliament, it would
have been good News; That Ship-monie
shall be taken away by an Act of Parliament,
the Reasons and Grounds of it so rooted out,
as that neither it, nor any thing like it, can
ever grow up again; That Monopolie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, The
high-Commission Court, The Starre-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
The Bishops Votes shall be taken away,
The Councell Table regulated and restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
The Forrests bounded and limitted; That
ye shall have a Trienniall Parliament; and
more then that, A Perpetuall Parliament,
which none shall have power to dissolve
without your selves, we should have thought
this a dream of happinesse; yet now we are
in the reall possession of it, we do not enjoy
it, although His Majestie hath promised and
published he will make all this good to us:
We stand chiefly upon further security; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
the very having of these things, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
fair securitie, mutually securing one
another: there is more securitie offered, even
in this last answer of the Kings, By removing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96607:4"/>
the personall Votes of Popish Lords, By the
Better Education of Papists children, By sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the defects of Laws against Recusants,
besides what else may be enlarged and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by a select Committee of both Houses,
named for that purpose. Wherefore, Sir, let
us beware we do not contend for such a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
unsafe securitie, as may endanger the
losse of what we have already; let us not
think we have nothing, because we have not
all we desire; and though we had, yet we
cannot make a Mathematicall securitie; All
humane Caution is Susceptible of corruption
and failing; Gods providence will not be
bound, successe must be his: He that observes
the wind and rain, shall neither sow nor reap;
if he do nothing till he can secure the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he will have but an ill harvest.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> It now behoves us to call up
all the wisedome we have about us, for we
are at the very brink of Combustion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion:
If blood once begin to touch blood,
we shall presentlie fall into a certain miserie,
and must attend an uncertain successe. God
knows when, and God knows what. Every
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96607:4"/>
man here is bound in conscience to employ
his uttermost endeavours to prevent the effusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of blood; blood is a crying sin, it pollutes
a Land; let us save our Liberties and our
Estates, a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> we  may save our Souls too. Now
I have clearly delivered mine own coscience, I
leave every man freely to his.</p>
