         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
                  <p>'TIs a Cuſtom among Travellers, that
are Perſons of Curioſity, that when
they come to any City or Town of Note, one
of the firſt Queſtions which they put to their
Hoſts is generally, what is moſt-remarkable
in the Place. To this, Monſieur <hi>la Fer,</hi>
Geographer to the <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi>
makes a particular Anſwer, ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the moſt Conſiderable Cities and Towns
of <hi>Europe,</hi> in Eight ſmall Tomes of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
Travels,</hi> ſucceſſively intended to
be preſented to your View; wherein he gives
a neat and ſhort Accompt of what is moſt
worthy the Obſervation of a Quaint and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive
Traveller in all the moſt Eminent
Places of this the Moſt Noble fourth Part
of the World. A pleaſing Pocket Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for a Traveller, where e're he comes, to
deſire to ſee, and not to ask what is to be
ſeen. He gives yee moreover, the true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the ſeveral People, by telling yee
their Predominant Humours; which is no
<pb facs="tcp:32919:4"/>
leſs a uſeful Direction for him to manage his
Converſation with that variety of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
among whom his Curioſity or his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
leads him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Hiſtorical Travels,</hi> will conſiſt of
Eight Volumes, of which the Firſt as you
ſee begins with <hi>France;</hi> The Second will
treat of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal;</hi> The Third
of <hi>Italy;</hi> The Fourth of <hi>Germany, Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi>
and <hi>Hungary;</hi> The Fifth of
<hi>Muſcovy, Turky</hi> and <hi>Tartary;</hi> The
Sixth will encloſe <hi>Poland, Swedeland</hi> and
<hi>Denmark;</hi> The Seventh <hi>Holland</hi> and the
<hi>Low-Countries;</hi> And the Eighth will
Comprehend <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Neither is it to be thought that
theſe are Collections and Relations of the
Author by hear-ſay; for he tells yee that
he had been Abroad in Forreign Countries
about Twelve or Thirteen Years, and that
all that while he made his Remarks upon
the Religion, Cuſtoms, Humours and Strength
of ſeveral Nations, and obſerv'd what was
moſt rare and curious in their Countries:
Confeſſing withal, that he took into his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
the Memoirs of a certain Learned
Friend of his, who had been Two and
Twenty Years Collecting 'em together;
but liv'd not long enough to put 'em in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:32919:4"/>
About the ſame time came forth the
King's Geographer, <hi>de la Croix</hi>'s <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Geographie,</hi> or his <hi>New Method
for the Underſtanding that Science;</hi>
but beſides that, there is little in it but
what has been repeated over and over again,
and that we had nothing to do with learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Geography; I made a Vow, had I been
a Novice, not to learn it by his <hi>New Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi>
which is the Obſcureſt that ever I
met with; in regard he has ſo conceal'd
and hid up his Towns in Referen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Subdiviſions of Provinces, that
he that looks for any City, muſt run from
Poſt to Pillar, and be at a tedious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
Trouble, prevented by the common
Alphabetical Way, before he can find it out.
However I made this Uſe of him, that
where he had any thing Proper for our
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, which <hi>la Ferr</hi> had for brevity omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I thought it but reaſon, that one
Brother ſhould help another; and to that
end, I took out all that was material in
him and made for our Purpoſe. Which
as it ſerves to Complete <hi>la Ferr,</hi> ſo it
does <hi>de la Croix</hi> no Injury; who may go
on with his New Method for all us.</p>
                  <p>'Tis to be confeſs'd, That out of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Propenſity of the French to brag of
their own Country, Monſieur <hi>la Ferr</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:32919:5"/>
ſometimes too apt to fall into Extaſies
and Raptures in Applauſe of the Beauties
and Prodigies of Tranſcending <hi>France,</hi>
and the Conquests of his Invincible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.
But though we could not but leave
ſome ſprinklings of his Folly in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as well becauſe we could not interrupt
his Sence, as to ſhew the Nature of the
French Bird, yet care has been taken
to Prune off the greatest part of thoſe
Impertinencies, and to keep him as cloſe as
poſſible to his Text: For in ſhort, the
Thing in the main is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
as being the moſt Delightful part
of Geography, altogether a Novelty, and
proſecuted with Judgment by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
to the great Benefit and Eaſe of
thoſe, who not having the Opportunity, or
Bodies fitted to endure the Tempers of
various Climates, are by this means en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to Travel over whole Countries
and Regions with their Eyes, and have
all the Curioſities of <hi>Europe</hi> brought home
to their own Studies, at the Labour and
Expence of other Men.</p>

all the other parts of the World,
for number of Inhabitants, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
of the People, the Fertility of
the Soil, the Temper of the Climate,
and the Excellency of the Wine. The
Government is Monarchical, but too
ſeverely Abſolute, tho the Nobility are
brave and Warlike. This Kingdom is
ſeated between the forty ſecond and
fifty firſt degree of Latitude, and the
fifteenth and nineteenth of Longitude.
It is bounded to the Weſt by the
Great Ocean; to the Eaſt, by the

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32919:9"/>

it includes ſo great a number of Fair
Provinces; ſome of which contain
more Cities, Burroughs and Villages
then many Soveraign Kingdoms and
Principalities. But if you add to theſe
the Conqueſts of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII and

Ancients under the name of <hi>Gaul,</hi> is a
Hereditary Kingdom, the Crown of
which cannot deſcend to the Female
Sex, by vertue of the Salique Law.
It always belongs to the Eldeſt Son and
for want of Male Iſſue to the next of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32919:10"/>
Kin. <hi>France</hi> has beheld upon the
Throne Kings of three Races. The firſt
was that of <hi>Meroveus;</hi> the ſecond, that
of <hi>Charlemaigne;</hi> and the third that of
<hi>Hugh Capet. Pharamond</hi> was the firſt
King of <hi>France:</hi> He began to Reign in
the year 400 of our Salvation; and
<hi>Clovis</hi> who was the Fifth King of this
Monarchy, was the firſt who embrac'd
Chriſtianity in 499 being baptiz'd by
St. <hi>Remi,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rheims;</hi> and ever
ſince that time it was that our Kings
have born the Title of Moſt <hi>Chriſtian
King,</hi> and <hi>Eldeſt Son of the Church</hi> which
no other Potentate diſputes with 'em.</p>
                     <p>As to the Humour of the French,
they are lookt upon to have a quick

                     <p>GEographers uſually divide this
Province into the Upper and
Lower <hi>Provence:</hi> The Upper is very
Mountainous and Barren: But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32919:11"/>
compence that defect, the Lower may
be lookt upon as a Terreſtrial Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.

nearneſs to the Sea, and the reſort of

contribute to it. But the Women are

a Court of Aids, a Mint, and a
Generality. There is alſo in it an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity

by <hi>H.</hi> the IV. The Churches are very
beautiful, and the Curious fail not to

                     <p>Some Leagues from <hi>Aix</hi> ſtands a
Burrough call'd <hi>Sallon,</hi> where <hi>Noſtre
Damus,</hi> ſo famous for his Predictions,
was born, and interr'd in the Church
of the <hi>Franciſcan Grey-Fryers;</hi> his Tomb
being half within the Church, and half
without: Which has given an occaſion
for ſome people to ſay, that it was ſo
contriv'd, becauſe it was not known
whether he were a Prophet or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer:
But the Monk that ſhew'd it us,
told us, that <hi>Noſtre Damus</hi> himſelf
had order'd it to be erected after that
manner: For that finding the World to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32919:12"/>
be ſo corrupt as it is, he was deſirous
to leave it in a ſingular manner. For
that having rais'd his Tomb to Man's
height, he caus'd himſelf to be enclos'd
therein while he was living, after he
had made proviſion of Oyl for his
Lamp, Pens, Ink and Paper, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
a Curſe upon him that ſhould
open it before ſuch a time; which by
the Calculation of the Fryer, was to
expire at the beginning of the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Age.</p>
                     <p>And upon my ſaying to the Fryer,
that by the Epitaph which appear'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Tomb, it did not appear that he
was enterr'd alive, but that he di'd the
firſt of <hi>July 1566.</hi> in the 62th year of
his Age; the Monk repli'd, that from
that day he was dead to the World,
and that in engraving the Epitaph, they
had follow'd his directions; all which
was to be juſtifi'd by the Regiſters of
the Convent; and that he would have
part of his Tomb to be in the Street, to
let the World know the remaining
part of Human Life, which perhaps he
employ'd in pious works. For my part,
I had much ado to believe the Monk,
but that the reſpect which is owing to
his Character perſwaded me that he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32919:13"/>
would not ſuffer an Impoſtor to eſcape
his Lips. However it were, I cannot
tell whether honeſt <hi>Noſtre Damus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
or no, but I am ſure he was in
an ill condition, if he let his Lamp go
out, before he had finiſh'd what he had
to write.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beaucaire</hi> is a City ſeated upon the
Banks of the <hi>Rhone,</hi> famous for the
Fair which is there held the 22d of
<hi>July,</hi> which draws to it all the Nations
of <hi>Europe,</hi> and Immenſe Wealth.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide of the River is to
be ſeen the City of <hi>Taraſcon,</hi> where
<hi>Renatus</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi>
built a very fair Caſtle. Some years
ago a certain perſon digging a Vault in
his Cellar, found a Wall with an Iron
Gate, which he caus'd to be open'd,
and then diſcover'd a hollow paſſage,
from whence he heard a moſt dreadful
Noiſe, ſo terrible indeed, that he durſt
not ſatisfie his Curioſity any farther.
However, the Magiſtrates of the City
being inform'd of it, were reſolv'd to
know what it was. To which purpoſe
they proffer'd a condemn'd perſon his
Life, if he would but go and take a
view of that Subterraneal Gallery.</p>
                     <p>This man being fortifi'd with every
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32919:13"/>
thing which he thought neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
a confidence into him, enter'd in.
But before he got five and twenty or
thirty paces, he return'd like a man
hard out of his ſenſes, crying out, That
they might hang him if they pleas'd,
for he would not die a Death which
he did not underſtand. He told 'em
he heard a moſt dreadful Noiſe, which
grew louder and louder the farther he
went. After they had given him time
till the next day to recover himſelf,
they offer'd him new favours, and ſome
Money if he would go to the End of
the Gallery. That allurement made
him reſolve to ſcorn all dangers, and
having recover'd freſh ſtrength, he went
to the Bottom, where he found ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Iron Gate, at which he knockt,
as he ſaid, but no body anſwer'd; he
added alſo, that the roaring Noiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
for half the way, and ſeem'd to
be over his Head.</p>
                     <p>This Rehearſal augmented the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Taraſcon,</hi>
and oblig'd 'em to ſend Work-men to
force open the Gate; but unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or fears over-maſtering their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Duty, there were none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
enough to be found: for they

lookt upon the laſt Gate to be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Gate which led to Hell. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the Magiſtrates found an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to gain their good wills, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
'em that there was ſome vaſt
Treaſure hid there, and that if they
found it to be really ſo, they would
give 'em the twenty fifth part of it.
Upon that, they found Work-men
more than enow, and the Gate being
ſoon open'd, they as ſoon diſcover'd
that the hollow way led to <hi>Beaucaire,</hi>
that it was a Subterranean Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
between one City and the other,
and that the Noiſe was nothing but the
Rapidneſs of the <hi>Rhone,</hi> which rolling
the Stones along with it, caus'd that
hideous rumbling in the Vault. Since
which time, 'tis a common ſaying
among the Bricklayers of <hi>Taraſcon,</hi>
That the Twenty fifth part of <hi>Beaucaire</hi>
belongs to them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arles,</hi> formerly the Capital of a
Kingdom, is ſeated alſo upon the Banks
of the <hi>Rhone,</hi> drawing towards the Sea.
People ſay, the Air is not ſo whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
there, and that there is a paſſage
from thence under Ground to <hi>Nimes,</hi>
but I could never find any certainty in
that report. There are to be ſeen in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32919:14"/>
this City two Porticoes of an admirable
Structure, an Amphitheater and an
Obeliſque, built by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the
Sepulchre of <hi>Rowland,</hi> Nephew to
<hi>Charlemaine.</hi> There is alſo in the
Town-houſe a Marble Statue of <hi>Diana,</hi>
which Goddeſs had formerly a Temple
in an Iſland of the <hi>Rhone</hi> a little below
the City. Travellers that delight in
viewing Ancient Tombs, may find a
great number near <hi>Arles.</hi> For 'tis
ſaid, that the Pagans call'd theſe parts
the <hi>Elyſian Fields,</hi> and that they who
inhabited along the River from <hi>Arles</hi>
to <hi>Lyons,</hi> deſirous that their Bodies
ſhould be there buri'd, they ty'd 'em
to Planks, with Money ſufficient for
their Enterment, and put 'em into the
Water, verily believing that the Stream
would carry 'em to the <hi>Elyſian Fields,</hi>
without going any farther.</p>
                     <p>They alſo ſhew'd me the houſe where
Eight Children, all Twins were born
at one Birth, which the Mother would
needs have thrown into the River all
but the Ninth. And they farther told
me, 'twas through the Judgment of
God that this Woman had ſo many
Children at a time, becauſe ſhe had
tax'd a Beggar-woman of unchaſtneſs
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32919:15"/>
for having Three at one Delivery, who
thereupon wiſht, if ſhe were not a
Whore, that her Accuſer might have
as many as a Sow barrows Piggs at
once. Let the Story be true or falſe,
certain it is, that 'tis not only in theſe
parts where ſuch Prodigies are pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have happen'd; for I have ſeen in
<hi>Holland</hi> the Caſtle of a Lady, who is
reported to have been brought to Bed
at one time of as many Children as
there are days in the year. St. <hi>Maximin</hi>
is a little City in the Neighbourhood
of <hi>Aix,</hi> remarkable for the Holy Vial,
which is there kept, and which draws
Pilgrims to it from all parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
They pretend that in this Holy Vial
there is the Blood and Water which
iſſued from our Saviour's ſide, which
by a Miracle, moves every <hi>Good Friday</hi>
from Eleven a Clock till high Noon.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1679. I was there upon
the ſame day, and what I happen'd to
obſerve was this. They carri'd us up
into a Gallery guarded by ſix Halber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers,
as well to prevent diſorder as
for the ſecurity of their pretious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.
In the midſt of the Gallery in
a kind of by-corner we found a Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin
Frier holding the ſacred Vial in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32919:15"/>
his hand; Which is a Vial much in
the Form of our Hour Glaſſes of Sand,
in which you may perceive a Liquor as
clear as Rock-water, with a little black
Moat that danced up and down in the
Viol, and which ſometimes inclining
to fall down to the Bottom, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
mounted up all of a ſudden to the
Top.</p>
                     <p>This Devotion draws great Profit to
the Convent; So that the Inhabitants
of the place would never care how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the Miracle happen'd. There is
alſo in the ſame Church the Head of
<hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in a Golden Shrine,
and her Body in another.</p>
                     <p>From thence we mounted for four
Hours together, that we might get to
St. <hi>Baume,</hi> through a dreadful Deſert.
In this place they ſay it was, that <hi>Mary
Magdalen</hi> did Pennance, and there is to
be ſeen in a Grotto where the Rock-water
diſtills from all parts, one little
place dry, which was the Place where
<hi>Magdalen</hi> lay. There is in this Nook
a ſmall Convent of <hi>Jacobins,</hi> with one
only Inn belonging to it, where were
above four thouſand Perſons in all, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ill accommodated. The next day
we aſcended above the Clouds; at leaſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32919:16"/>
when we were at St. <hi>Piton,</hi> we ſaw the
Clouds thicken and gather together
under us. This is the Place, as the
Tradition goes, where the Angels
brought Penitent <hi>Magdalen</hi> her Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.
Afterwards we travell'd through
a continual Deſert to <hi>Toulton;</hi> For we
went above eight Leagues before we
met with one Houſe, or a drop of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to drink.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Toulton</hi> is a very fair City ſeated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſhoar of the Mediterranean Sea:
It has a good Haven, where the Kings
biggeſt Men of War ride ſecure from
the injuries of the Weather or the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of an Enemy. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd
it with Walls, for the ſecurity of
the Port and the Arſenal, which is the
chiefeſt the French have upon that
Sea.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marſeilles</hi> is another Sea Port, which
is held to be the ſafeſt in all <hi>Europe.</hi>
The City is very antient; as having
been built ſix hundred thirty three
years before the Birth of Chriſt: and
'tis the uſual place where the Kings
Galleys, which are very numerous, ride.
This Haven is defended by the Fortreſs
of our <hi>Lady of the Guard;</hi> by two
Citadels at the entrance into the Port,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:32919:16"/>
which is barr'd up with a huge chain;
and there are there Forts in the little
Iſlands a league from the City which
ſecure the Road. They are call'd the
Fort of St. <hi>John, Le Rattoneau,</hi> and
the Caſtle <hi>Dif,</hi> furniſh'd with good
Garriſons, and with all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for their Defence. This laſt Caſtle
is remarkable for this, that 'tis the
Place where they ſhut up Youths of
Good Houſes, that vex their Superiors
by their Exorbitant Debaucheries and
Leud behaviour; and where they are
kept ſo long as is thought convenient
with a moderate allowance.</p>
                     <p>The City it ſelf is very Beautiful and
without all contradiction the moſt weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
in the Province, by reaſon of the
Haven, by which means it has all the
Trade of the Levant, <hi>Italy, Spain</hi> and
<hi>Africa</hi> to it ſelf. The Cathedral is
dedicated to St. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> in memory
of this, that the Perſecutors of the
Primitive Church, having put <hi>Lazarus</hi>
together with <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi>
his Siſters, into a Veſſel without
Sails and Seamen, and expoſing it in
that manner to the Mercileſs Waves,
the Veſſel after it had been toſs'd to
and fro for ſome time by the raging
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32919:17"/>
Billows, was by Providence guided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Port of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> where <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
having preach'd the Goſpel was
made Biſhop of the place, and di'd
there.</p>
                     <p>The Slaves at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> all the
length of the Port, keep Barbers
Shops and <hi>Fripperies,</hi> like thoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Pont Neuf</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> where they ſell
all manner of Linnen Cloaths, Breeches,
and other neceſſary Furniture at ſecond
Hand. They who have this leave, are
chain'd there in the Morning, and know
what they muſt give a day to their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.
There are others that make up
together Companies of Fidlers, noiſes
of Trumpets, Hautboys and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
who being all chain'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and attended by a Souldier, go
about from Tavern to Tavern, and
Houſe to Houſe, to play to thoſe that
will give 'em any thing.</p>
                     <p>There is in the Convent of the <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi>
the Head of one called <hi>Borduni,</hi>
the ſon of a Notary Publick of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles</hi>
which is of a Prodigious bigneſs.
For, tho the Man, who liv'd at the
beginning of this Age, were not above
four foot high, his Head takes up the
fourth part of that heighth, and three
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32919:17"/>
foot in compaſs at the ſides. He had
ſo little wit, tho his Head were full of
Brains, that he gave occaſion to the
Proverb, when you would talk of a
Man that wanted ſence, <hi>He has no more
wit</hi> then <hi>Borduni.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When you go out of the City, it
looks as if you were entring into Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs
that are near two Leagues in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
For that in the parts adjoining
to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> there are above ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Country Houſes, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venſals
call <hi>Baſtades,</hi> and which ſtand
ſo near one to another, that many
times there is hardly a Garden between
'em. This is a very great Ornament
to the out parts of the City, and of
great Benefit, when the Town is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with the Peſtilence; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
few of the Burgeſſes but who have
one of thoſe <hi>Baſtades:</hi> for they are ſtill
in fear leſt ſome Veſſel or other ſhould
bring that ſpreading Contagion among
'em. Which is the reaſon that they
are to obſerve an exact Quarantan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Cannon of the Caſtle <hi>Dif,</hi> and
thoſe other Fortreſſes which I have

                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:32919:18"/>
They are excellent Artiſts at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. Of the County of Venaiſſin, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality
of Orange.</head>
                     <p>THE County of <hi>Venaiſſin</hi> is a little
Province enclos'd between <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence</hi>
and the Dauphinate, the Capital
City of which is <hi>Avignon,</hi> which is
ſeated upon the Banks of the <hi>Rhone,</hi>
ſurrounded with the moſt Beautiful
Walls in <hi>Europe.</hi> It has been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the reſidence of the Roman Pontiffs,
and that ſuffices to convince the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that it muſt needs be ſtor'd with
beautiful Edifices both Sacred and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane.
The Popes are alſo ſtill in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of it to this day, and ſend a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
thither; and it was thus that the
Holy See came to have a Title to
it.</p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſixth, taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the neceſſity to which the
Princeſs <hi>Joane,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Charles</hi> II.
Count of <hi>Provence,</hi> to whom <hi>Avignon</hi>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:32919:18"/>
with all dependencies belong'd, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
her ſelf, purchas'd this City of
her for forty eight Thouſand Livres,
Money of <hi>France.</hi> The Contract of
Sale was paſſed the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>June 1348.</hi>
and Hiſtory reports that the Money
was never paid. However it were,
the Princeſs was a Minor at the time
of the Sale, and beſides that, ſhe could
not alienate her Demeans, there being
Laws that expreſly ordain'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
So that this Sale was indeed no
more than a Mortgage. Thereupon
the Parliament of <hi>Provence</hi> reunited the
City of <hi>Avignon,</hi> and the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Venaiſſin</hi> to the Crown. Which
ſhews that the Holy See enjoys it onely
by the liberality of the Kings of <hi>France;</hi>
neither is this the onely nor the moſt
conſiderable benefit which <hi>Rome</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from the French Crown.</p>
                     <p>There is a Jewiſh Synagogue at <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
very naſty and out of Order; and
though they are bound to hear a Frier
Preach every week; they are ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in their Judaiſm, that there are
very few that embrace Chriſtianity.
They all wear yellow Hats, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
'em from Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Avignon</hi> had formerly a ſtately Bridge
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32919:19"/>
over the <hi>Rhone,</hi> but the rapidneſs of
the Stream has carried away a good part
of it. The Pope keeps an Italian Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
in it, and they keep a Guard as
exact there as in the expos'd Frontier
Towns in Time of War. They are
not contented to examine all ſtrangers
that come into the Town, to know
where they lodge, and to direct peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that are not acquainted with the
Town what Inns to go to, but in the
Night time they viſit all thoſe parts
where the new comers lodge, and tell
how many perſons lye in every Bed,
which ſometimes ſurprizes thoſe that
are ignorant of the Cuſtom.</p>
                     <p>The Univerſity of <hi>Avignon,</hi> found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in 1391. was formerly more famous
then now it is. I ſhall not undertake
to deſcribe all the Tombs and Reliques
that are to be ſeen in moſt parts of the
Churches; which would carry me too
far. Nor have I ſeen any thing there
more remarkable then the Fountain of
<hi>Daucluſe,</hi> which dividing it ſelf about

three Leagues broad and four in length.
This Principality depending upon the
County of <hi>Provence,</hi> fell long ſince to
the Counts of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> by the Marriage
of <hi>Claudia de Chalons</hi> with <hi>Henry</hi> of
<hi>Naſſau.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This City had not long ſince a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

upon to be one of the ſtrongeſt Caſtles
in <hi>France:</hi> it had a Well digg'd into
the ſolid Rock above thirty fathom
deep, and a ſubterranean paſſage that
led from the Caſtle to a Houſe of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
about half a league diſtant. But
the Caſtle was raz'd and the City diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantl'd
about twenty years ſince by
the King of <hi>France,</hi> out of a particular
enmity to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> under
pretence that it ſerv'd as a Refuge for the
Proteſtants that were Dragoon'd out
of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However it affords very beautiful
Pieces of Antiquity, and among the

a low Chamber or Room of State; a

This edifice which is commonly call'd
the Tower of the Arch, was formerly
in the middle of the City: afterwards
it came to be one of the Gates of the
City; but now ſtands a good quarter
of a League from it. Which ſhews
that <hi>Orange</hi> was in ancient Time a very
large and beautiful City. When you

                     <p>
                        <hi>Grenoble</hi> is the Capital City of the
Province, ſeated among the Mountains
upon the Banks of the River <hi>Iſere,</hi> which
divides the City into two parts. It is
the Seat of a Parliament, a Chamber
of Accounts, or place for the publick
Receipt of the Finances, a Generality,
a Baillage, a Mint, and a Biſhoprick.
It is adorn'd with Magnificent Buildings,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32919:24"/>
of which the principal are the Palace of
the Duke <hi>de L'Ediguieres,</hi> the Biſhops
Manſion, and the Parlament Houſe.
The Prelates of this Dioceſs aſſume
the Title of Prince, by reaſon of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Donations of the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
at ſeveral times.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome things in the Parts
about <hi>Grenoble,</hi> worthy the curious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of Travellers; chiefly the
ſpatious Charter-houſe, which is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Reſidence of the General of that
Order. Never was Deſert better bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
then this Nook which thoſe Monks
have made choice of for their place of
Retirement: for indeed the Mountain
has ſomething of a dreadful Aſpect.
But when you come to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
you are preſently ſurpriz'd to
meet with ſo goodly a Manſion, ſo
magnificent a Church, and Monks ſo
civil and courteous, where you thought
to find nothing but Precipices and Wild
Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>The Order of the <hi>Chartreux</hi> was
founded in 1084 by St. <hi>Bruno,</hi> who
was the firſt General of it. The Air
is very healthy, the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Fertile; and in a word it may be
ſaid, that a Man is amply recompens'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32919:24"/>
for the trouble and dread in clambring
up, which redoubles when you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to quit that delightful ſolitude;
the deſcent being worſe then the aſcent,
and much more terrible.</p>
                     <p>Among the wonders that environ
<hi>Grenoble,</hi> the burning Fountain is not
the leaſt conſiderable, which darts
forth Flames through the Water a
foot high; whither the young Men and
Virgins go frequently to make Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſees,
and fry Pancakes. Not far
from thence is to be ſeen a Tower
where no venomous Creature will live;
and they which are ſometimes brought
thither dye preſently after.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Valence</hi> is the ſecond City of the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinate,</hi>
and much better ſcituated then
<hi>Grenoble,</hi> as being ſeated on the Banks
of the <hi>Rhone,</hi> and upon the High
Road from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> It is
adorn'd with a Biſhoprick, and a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
for Law and Phyſick; founded
by <hi>Lewis</hi> the Dauphin, Son of <hi>Charles</hi>
VII. in the year 1452. who confirm'd
the Priviledges it enjoys, in the year
1475. when he came to the Crown.
It is alſo the Seat of a Preſidial-court
and a Seneſchalſhip.</p>
                     <p>There is to be ſeen in the Church
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:32919:25"/>
of the Jacobins the Body of a Giant
fifteen foot high, and ſeven in breadth,
ſome of the Bones of which were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd
to <hi>Paris</hi> where they are preſerv'd
in the Kings Cloſet. There is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
without the City very hot in the
Winter, and extreamly cold in the
Summer. The principal Churches are
the Cathedral dedicated to St. <hi>Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris;</hi>
St. <hi>Johns</hi> which is ſaid to have
been a Pantheon in ancient time, the
Abby of St. <hi>Ruff,</hi> and St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church
in the Burrough <hi>Les-valence,</hi> in which is
to be ſeen a Cavern which 'tis ſaid
croſſes under the <hi>Rhone,</hi> near to which
ſtands a Sepulchre, wherein formerly
was found the Body of a Woman co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Gold and Precious Stones,
which appear'd to be freſh, but ſo ſoon
as it was brought into the Air, crumbl'd
to duſt. There was alſo found in the
ſame Tomb a Latin Inſcription in theſe
words, <hi>The Happy</hi> Juſtina <hi>Mother;</hi>
whence ſome infer, that it was the
Empreſs <hi>Juſtina</hi>'s Tomb. Near St.
<hi>Felix</hi>'s Gate there is alſo a Round
Tower which leans forward more at
the top then below; and moſt people
believe that the Tower bow'd out of
reſpect when St. <hi>Felix</hi> enter'd the City.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Pont St. Eſprit,</hi> or <hi>The Holy Ghoſt's
Bridge,</hi> is a very pleaſant City that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
its name from a Bridge built
over the <hi>Rhone</hi> with extraordinary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and expence. It conſiſts of two
and twenty Arches twelve hundred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
long, and fifteen broad; ſo that
it may not be vainly lookt upon to be
one of the largeſt and moſt beautiful
Bridges in <hi>France.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Dauphinate</hi> includes ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cities which have their particular
Ornaments and Beauties, as <hi>Montelimar,
Cret, Die, Gap, Ambrun</hi> and <hi>Vienne,</hi>
which is the firſt City you meet with,
as you enter into the <hi>Dauphinate</hi> through
<hi>Lionnois.</hi> It was formerly inhabited
by the <hi>Allobroges;</hi> at what time <hi>Le
Viennois</hi> was call'd the Iſland of the
<hi>Allobroges</hi> as being ſcituated between
the <hi>Rhone</hi> and the <hi>Iſere.</hi>

                     <p>At <hi>Vienne</hi> they make the Blades of
Swords in ſuch vaſt numbers, that 'tis
the wonder of all people, how the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers
can ſell 'em ſo cheap. But the
reaſon is, becauſe their Engins are ſo
diſpos'd as to be mov'd by the Water,
and that in ſuch a manner, that one
workman can attend ſeveral ſorts of
Workmanſhip at one time <hi>Pilate</hi>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:32919:26"/>

<hi>Tiberius;</hi> There is alſo to be ſeen
the Tower where he was kept a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner;
and the Precipice from whence he
threw himſelf Headlong, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
cover'd with Clouds and Miſts.
<hi>Vienne</hi> had formerly two Caſtles belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
to it which were accounted impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
but they were demoliſh'd, for
fear they might prove a Recepticle for
ſuch as had a deſign to diſturb the
State.</p>

                        <hi>Die,</hi> or <hi>Diva Auguſta,</hi> ſeated upon
the <hi>Drome</hi> among the Mountains, with
a Biſhoprick, ſuffragan to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Vienne.</hi> It was one of the
nineteen principal Cities of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<hi>Vocantis</hi> mention'd by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and
once a Colony of the Romans.</p>
                     <p>

with a Baileage, a Biſhoprick, a
ſtrong Cittadel, and the Fort of <hi>Puy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
But neither the Cittadel nor the
Fort could hinder it from being ruin'd
by the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> Army in the
year 1692.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ambrun</hi> is a Biſhops See, and lyes
among the Mountains at the Foot of a
Rock upon which ſtands a Caſtle. This
City is ſaid to ſtand the higheſt of any
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32919:26"/>
City of <hi>Europe.</hi> It is a Town of great
antiquity; and 'tis ſaid that <hi>Nero</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Citizens of it the right of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which <hi>Galba</hi> afterwards enlarg'd
with new Priviledges. In the year
1692. it was taken by the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> but quitted the ſame year, after
every thing was demoliſh'd that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd

                     <p>Before I leave the <hi>Dauphinate,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
me to make one Obſervation
not unacceptable to the Curious, of a
peculiar Wind that blows at <hi>Nyons,</hi>
ſix leagues from <hi>Orange.</hi> It is call'd
the Wind <hi>Pontius,</hi> from the name of
the Mountain whence it comes. <hi>Nyons</hi>
is ſeated in a Bottom, upon the bank
of a River call'd <hi>Egue,</hi> where there is
a Bridge with one only Arch, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the moſt beautiful in the World.
It is ſaid to be a Piece of Roman work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip,
round like the Letter O, and
to be as deep from the Foundation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Ground as above. And indeed,
altho it be of a Prodigious heighth, yet
there appears but the half of the Circle
above Ground. And I have heard the
People of the place aver, that when
they have gone to ſearch for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
they could never find any.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:32919:27"/>
But they perceiv'd, that ſtill the lower
they digg'd, the narrower the circle
contracted.</p>
                     <p>As to the Wind of <hi>Pontius,</hi> it uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
blows from Midnight till ten or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a Clock in the Morning, and it is
almoſt as cold as the North-wind. It
iſſues out of the Cleft of a Rock, about
a ſmall League from <hi>Nyons</hi> near a Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage.
Into this cleft the people have
often thrown Stones, and let down a
Sounding Line, but could never reach
the Bottom. Nor is the Wind ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in this part, as about a quarter of
a League from thence. Now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the cleft is not very wide, it was
ſtopt up toward the end of the laſt Age,
and ſo it remain'd for ſeven or eight
years; but then they were forc'd to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
it again, in regard the Earth ſurceas'd
to bear, the Olive Trees, Vines, and
other Fruit Trees wither'd, ſo that
their Autumnal Harveſts were very
Barren, and the Inhabitants were ſeiz'd
with Contagious Diſeaſes, which cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a great Mortality among 'em.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Vivarez,</hi> it being a Province
very Mountainous and Barren, Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
take no pleaſure in it; unleſs it
be at <hi>Viviers,</hi> which is the Capital City
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:32919:27"/>
of it, and the See of a Biſhop. You
may alſo viſit <hi>Annonay,</hi> where the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
are very Civil and Courteous; but
where the Common People make it
no ſcruple of Conſcience to diſcharge
their Fuſee's upon you from behind a
Hedge upon any ſlight occaſion.</p>

The Climate is accounted the beſt in

to be a very conſiderable City, and
therefore beautify'd it with a Capitol,
Amphitheaters, and Aqueducts, the
Remainders of which, beſides her
Churches and other Structures are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

Treaſure which could never be taken

to a hundred and ten thouſand pound
weight in Gold, and five millions of

<hi>Cepio,</hi> the Roman Conſul caus'd it to

of Five Baſtions, commanded by a
Fort which is call'd the <hi>Donjon.</hi> Some
Leagues from thence, you meet with
a Fountain of Salt Water, which ſprings
out of a Rock in ſuch abundance, that
about ſix or ſeven Paces from thence it

                        <hi>Narbonne</hi> diſputes the Point of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
with all the other Cities of
<hi>France;</hi> for they pretend that <hi>Narbo,</hi>
K. of the Country was the Founder of
it, long before the Birth of Chriſt. But
that which we find moſt certain is, that
it was in great Requeſt in the time of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> who grac'd it with a Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol
and an Amphitheater, erected Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal
Schools within it, adorn'd it with

of which Favours, the Inhabitants
ſet up a Statue to <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> So that

each other under the Title of Siſters;
and 'tis ſaid, that the Sympathy between
'em was ſo great, that in the Year 145.
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Narbonne</hi> were afflicted both
at the ſame time with a dreadful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration
that happen'd by Accident.
But the greateſt part of the Roman An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities
were ruin'd by the <hi>Goths</hi> and
<hi>Vandals.</hi> This, being a Frontier Town,
is regularly fortifi'd; and the Canal of
Conjunction between the two Seas, a
Royal Undertaking, becoming a great
Prince, derives the beginning of it from
<hi>Narbonne.</hi> It is the Seat of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick;
and the Archbiſhop is Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of the Province, Preſident born

                     <p>
                        <hi>Bezieres,</hi> is a City not far diſtant
from <hi>Narbonne,</hi> ſeated upon a Hill, the
Avenues to which are ſomewhat diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.
It is both Large and Ancient, and
greatly valu'd by the Romans, who ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
there two famous Temples to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi>
and <hi>Julia.</hi> It is ſtill one of the
moſt Delightful Places of Abode in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:32919:31"/>
                        <hi>France.</hi> Inſomuch, that the beauty of
the place, and the fertility of the ſoil,
have begot a Proverb among the People
of the Country, <hi>Que ſi Dieu habitoit ſur
la Terre, il choiſiroit</hi> Bezieres <hi>pour ſa Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jour.
That if God were to live upon the
Earth, he would make choice of</hi> Bezieres
<hi>for his Place of Reſidence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Peſenas</hi> is no leſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
and the Inhabitants are much more
civil and courteous: and no queſtion
but the Reſidence of ſeveral Princes
there from time to time, as the late
Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> deceas'd, and Monſieur
<hi>de Montmoranci,</hi> contributed not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

                     <p>Though I ſhall end this Chapter with
the Cities of <hi>Montpellier</hi> and <hi>Nimes,</hi> 'tis
not becauſe they are leſs conſiderable:
the contrary rather may be ſaid, that
Travellers tarry longer at <hi>Montpellier,</hi>
then in any other City of <hi>Languedoc,</hi>
by reaſon of the Variety of Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which they meet with in the
Place, good Chear, good Company, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity,
Galantry, and Learning; all
which Advantages they meet with
there in a Superlative Degree.</p>
                     <p>The Univerſity is accounted the moſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:32919:32"/>
famous for Phyſick in all <hi>France.</hi> And
it is to be obſerv'd that no Dr. in that
Faculty is to be admitted, till he has
firſt receiv'd ſeven times the Robe and
Bonnet of <hi>Rabelais</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac.</hi>
In ſuch Veneration is that Doctor
among thoſe that govern this Academy.
The reaſon of it is this.</p>
                     <p>The Scholars having committed ſome
Diſorders in the City, which occaſion'd
Complaints againſt the Univerſity at
Court, they were depriv'd of ſome
part of their Liberties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Privileges.
<hi>Rabelais,</hi> who had been a Monk, and
was a perſon of a Luxuriant Wit, being
then at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> could not chooſe
but participate of the Trouble the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demians
were in when they heard the
News. What does he do, but goes to
<hi>Paris,</hi> and preſents himſelf at the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
<hi>du Pratt</hi>'s Houſe? The Swiſs,
who took him for a Fool, ask'd him,
what his Buſineſs was? To which <hi>Rabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais</hi>
anſwer'd him in Latin. Upon
which, the Swiſs not underſtanding a
word he ſaid, call'd for one of the
Chancellor's Officers, who underſtood
the Language; which <hi>Rabelais</hi> finding
out, anſwer'd him in Greek: With
that they brought him a perſon that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:32919:32"/>
underſtood Greek perfectly well; but
to him the Doctor ſpoke Hebrew: and
if they talk'd to him in Hebrew, he
anſwer'd in Syriack or Arabick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So
that having puzzl'd and exhauſted all
the Learning in the Chancellors Houſe,
the Chancellor deſir'd to ſee him him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
at what time having Harangu'd
him in favour of the Students of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier,</hi>
he obtain'd the Reſtoration of
the Privileges that had been taken from
'em. This <hi>Rabelais</hi> was made Curate
of <hi>Meudon,</hi> and dy'd at <hi>Paris</hi> in 1553.
and being a Man of ſuch a pleaſant
Humour, this Epitaph was made upon
him:</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>

                     <p>Near the Convent of the <hi>Cordeleers,</hi>
there is to be ſeen a Lake full of Frogs
that have never been heard to make a
Noiſe, as the people of the County
ſay, ſince St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi> being
interrupted by 'em in his Prayers and
Meditations, commanded 'em to be Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
and 'tis obſerv'd, that if you take
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:32919:33"/>
any of thoſe that make moſt noiſe in
other places, and put 'em into this Lake
they preſently become as Mute as Fiſh.
On the other ſide, if you take 'em out
of this Lake and put 'em in another
place, they ſhall be the firſt that ſhall
fall a <hi>Croaking</hi> and the loudeſt in the

                        <hi>Nimes</hi> is a very fair City, &amp; where the
Inhabitants, were they not ſuch great
Talkers, and leſs Malapert, would be
very good Company. The City is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Ancient; for they affirm, that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mauſus</hi>
the Son of <hi>Hercules</hi> was the
Founder of it, and gave it his own
Name as being call'd in Latin <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mauſis</hi>
or <hi>Nemauſus.</hi> It was formerly
much more ſpatious then it is, as inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
within it ſeven Hills like <hi>Old Rome,</hi>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:32919:33"/>
and the Walls were fortify'd with a
Thouſand Towers.</p>
                     <p>Among the moſt remarkable Pieces
of Antiquity we muſt reckon the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater
erected by the Emperor <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus,</hi>
Four hundred and ſeventy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in compaſs. There are alſo to be
ſeen two Gladiators cut in Stone; the
Wolf that ſuckl'd <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi>
and the Vultures that appear'd to thoſe
two Founders of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is likewiſe to be ſeen at <hi>Nimes,</hi>
a Cavern that runs under-ground as far
as <hi>Arles:</hi> for it was the Cuſtom of the
Romans to have in ſeveral parts ſuch
ſubterraneal Communications between
one City and the other. In the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood
alſo appears a very Curious
Piece of Roman Workmanſhip; that
is to ſay, Three Bridges one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the loweſt of ſix Arches; the
ſecond of two; and the third of thirty:
ſo that the whole Structure may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Fourſcore and two foot high. This
Bridge is call'd <hi>Pont du Gard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall ſay nothing of the <hi>Grotto</hi>'s, the
Garden of St. <hi>Privat,</hi> or of the great
number of Curious Statues; only I may
add this in ſhort, that this City is an
Epitome of the Roman Antiquities:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:32919:34"/>
and give me leave to inſert this one
thing more, that without the City ſome
Remainders of a Building are to be ſeen,
which is ſaid to have been a Temple
of <hi>Diana,</hi> and that the Fountain of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta,</hi>
which is near it, was famous here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
becauſe the Water was made
uſe of to Purifie the Veſtal Nuns.</p>
                     <p>The City is a Town of great Trade,
&amp; there are made in it great Quantities
of Woollen Stuffs. It is alſo the Seat
of Biſhop, a Seneſchalſhip, and a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial

ſomewhat given to Thieving. But the

there are as vertuous People among 'em

and a famous Univerſity
for the Civil and Canon-Law, founded
by <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. and <hi>Lewis</hi> X. in 1473.
It affords very beautiful Pieces of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;

which a Counſellor of the City

                        <hi>Xaintes,</hi> ſeated upon the Banks of the
<hi>Charante,</hi> is beautify'd with many
marks of Antiquity. The Bridge over
the River makes it evident by a Latin

of a Triumphal Arch. The
Church of St. <hi>Peters,</hi> which was the

other Monuments of Roman An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.
It is alſo a Biſhops See, and

Province; ſo very Ancient, that ſome
ſcruple not to affirm it to have been
built by one of the Sons of <hi>Noah.</hi>
But others from the Name of <hi>Veſuna,</hi>
which the Ancients gave it, derive the
Name of it from <hi>Venus,</hi> who was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
worſhipt in this City; where

Temple dedicated to that Goddeſs,
with ſeveral other Antiquities. The
Fountain of <hi>Marlac,</hi> not far off from <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riguex,</hi>
ought to be viſited, for the Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
and Flowing of the Waters that
ſupply it. Which contributes not a
little to confirm the Opinion of thoſe
who ſay, that <hi>Periguex</hi> is built upon a
floating piece of Ground. Some Years
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:32919:38"/>
ago, there was a Well in the Great
Market-Place ſtopt up, which was
thought to be an Abyſs, in regard that
ſeveral People being let down, could
could never find a Bottom; only they
reported upon their coming up again,
that they ſaw a large Plain cover'd with
Water. It may be ſome may put the
Queſtion, whence thoſe People had ſo
much light as to make ſuch a Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very?
To which I ſhall anſwer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as they told me, that it was from
other Wells of the City, and parts
thereabout, which let the light into that
Subterraneal Sea, and by floating Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorns
which they drove before 'em
with Engines.</p>
                     <p>Beſides there are few Houſes in
the City, but the owners if they
dig never ſo little in their Cellars,
preſently meet with Water, which by
the weight, the taſte, and other marks,
ſeems to be the ſame with that of the
Well which was ſtopt up, becauſe the
Harlots were wont to throw their
Children into it.</p>
                     <p>Two Leagues from the City there

which changes it ſelf into Stones of

moſt remarkable things, there is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern

are to be found Apartments pav'd with

                     <p>In the Abby of <hi>Cadouan</hi> at <hi>Sarlat</hi> is

Winding Sheet, wherein they affirm

                        <hi>Cahors</hi> is the Capital City of <hi>Querci</hi>
where the Amphitheater, the Bridges

the Antiquity of it. Pope <hi>John</hi> XXII.
a great diſturber of the peace of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
was born at <hi>Cahors,</hi> and founded
there a Univerſity for the Common
Law in 1332. Wherein he ſhew'd
more love to the place of his Nativity
then to all the World beſides. It is
alſo a Biſhops See which is ſaid to
bring in the greateſt Profit of any other
in <hi>France.</hi> The Cathedral Church is
dedicated to St. <hi>Steven,</hi> and was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
by St. <hi>Martral.</hi> There are
alſo in it ſeveral other Churches and
Monaſteries and a Colledge of Jeſuits,
ever ſince the year 1605. 'Tis alſo the
Seat of a Preſidial Court, from whence
Judgments are carry'd by appeal to the
Parliament of <hi>Tholouſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Part of the Dioceſs of <hi>Montaubon</hi> is
ſeated in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and therefore the
Biſhops have a ſeat in the Dioceſs of
that Province. The Hugonots made

fortify'd it ſo well that it held out three

by K. <hi>Clovis.</hi> After that <hi>Gaiger</hi> Duke
of <hi>Aquitain</hi> took it, and from him it
was retaken by K. <hi>Pepin</hi> in 1212. The

it came to be conſiderable
again; but it will hardly recover the
ill uſage it receiv'd from the Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots

will find little conſiderable in <hi>Rouergne</hi>
except the Steeple of the Cathedral of

ruin'd by the <hi>Goths, Saracens</hi> and

Corn and Wine, and Trades in Tapeſtry,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:32919:41"/>
Bone-lace, Cloth, Knives, and other

                     <p>
                        <hi>Aurillac</hi> is the Capital City of the
Upper <hi>Auvergne,</hi> which was formerly
adorn'd with ſeveral fair Churches, for
the moſt part ruin'd in the Civil Wars.
Among the moſt remarkable things we
have there to be ſeen, the Refectory
of the Carmelites is reckon'd to be the
chiefeſt, which much ſurpaſſes in Neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Bigneſs and Painting all the reſt
of the Convent.</p>
                     <p>The Preſidial Court of <hi>Aurillac</hi> is
lookt upon to be one of the ſevereſt
Tribunals in the whole Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>In this Diviſion of <hi>Auvergne</hi> ſtands
the Mountain <hi>Cantal,</hi> remarkable for
the height of it, and for the Simples
which it produces, tho it be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cold; the other Mountains are alſo
fertile in Paſtorages. The lower <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne</hi>
commonly called <hi>la Limayne</hi> is
not ſo wide in the extent of it as the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:32919:41"/>
Upper. But it is much a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
place to reſide in. The ſoil is
more fertile, and the Inhabitants are
more Civil and Sociable. <hi>Clairmont</hi>
is the Capital City of it. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
is cover'd with Lead, which
the Air has purify'd to that degree,
that people have offer'd a conſiderable
ſumm for the Covering, and to lay on
another of Lead of the ſame thickneſs;
but neither would their Money be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
nor their proffer accepted. There
is in it a Fountain that turns into Stone
as it falls: upon which account, ſome
aver that the Bridge which is there to
be ſeen was the work of this ſtrange
operation of nature. It is eight fathom
wide, ſix in thickneſs, and thirty ſix
long: for which reaſon <hi>Charles</hi> IX.
had the curioſity to ſee it. Several
Councils have been held at <hi>Clairmont;</hi>
among which the moſt famous was that
in the year 1095. at what time by the
ſollicitations of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the II. The cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Croiſade was reſolv'd upon for
the Conqueſt of the Holy Land. <hi>Charles</hi>
the V. aſſembled the States of the
Kingdom in this City. 'Tis believ'd
this City was built out of the Ruins of
the Ancient <hi>Gergovia,</hi> ſo highly applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:32919:42"/>
by <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his Commentaries; and
where there was a Tower which could
not be burnt when that City was all in
Conflagration, by reaſon it was made
of Larch or Larinx wood, which reſiſts
Fire.</p>

                        <hi>Rion</hi> famous for the Antiquity of it
is ſeated upon a Hill, which renders
the Situation and the Proſpect very
pleaſant. The Houſes are well built,
the Streets ſtraight and broad, the
Churches Magnificent, the Monaſteries
ſtately, the Inhabitants ſumptuous:
but nothing makes the City ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
as St. <hi>Amable</hi>'s Tooth, which as
they ſay, infallibly cures the bitings of
mad Dogs, of Serpents or any other
venemous Beaſts. In a word the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation

                     </p>
                     <p>This City is the ſeat of a Mareſchal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
a Preſidial-court, a Generality of

Officers of Juſtice ſit in a Palace built

the Jealouſie of the Inhabitants ſtarted

                     <p>Some few Leagues from <hi>Rion</hi> is to
be ſeen the little City of old <hi>Brioude,</hi>
remarkable for the Bridge that belongs
to it conſiſting of one Arch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is
ſupported by two Mountains of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
height. It was built by <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s
Order; and it is obſervable, that one
Stone falling out of the Building ſome
Ages ſince, could never be put again
into the place from whence it fell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Le Puy</hi> is a City very conſiderable
for the largeneſs of it, the riches of it,
the fertility of the ſoil, and other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.
The great number of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
which are there preſerv'd draws
the Devotion of the people for above
ſeven or eight leagues round. But in
regard the People always magnify Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and multiply Miracles, which
the places where Reliques are depoſited,
are ſeldom ſorry for, it many times
happens that true Devotion is intermix'd
with Superſtition. Amongſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

Gages which that City preſerves,
there is an Image of the Holy Virgin,

                     </p>

Since that time, the preſent King
has ſurrounded it with New and Strong
Fortifications, a good Cittadel, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

The people in their Humour,
partake of the Air of the Sea, which
they breath, and are therefore very

to tell yee that they are ſtor'd with all
ſorts of Fiſh; among the reſt, there is
taken upon the Coaſt of <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> a
certain Fiſh, which at <hi>Marſeilles</hi> is call'd
<hi>Imperador</hi> or the Emperour, but in <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie,
Gracieux Seigneur,</hi> which is very
delightful to the taſt. The <hi>Bretons</hi> are
of a very ſociable Humour, and there
are two ſorts of People, whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
pleaſes 'em better then any other.
The firſt are thoſe that can ſtoutly hold
out to drink with 'em; The next, are
they who in their Diſcourſes, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
make appear their Hatred of the
Normans.</p>
                     <p>For the People of thoſe two Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

                        <hi>Rennes</hi> is the Capital City of <hi>Bretagne,</hi>
divided by the little River of <hi>Vilaine,</hi>
which brings up great Barks to the

a Parlament in this City, which

                        <hi>Nantes</hi> contends for Superiority with
<hi>Rennes,</hi> as being likewiſe a Biſhops See,
and pretending that her Haven ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
her more wealthy, more famous,
and makes an ample amends for the
Parlament, with which the other is
Honour'd. But not to trouble my ſelf
to decide the Controverſie between
theſe two Cities, I ſhall only obſerve
that <hi>Nantes</hi> is very ancient; and ſome
Authors will have it, that <hi>Nantes,</hi> one
of the Progeny of <hi>Noah,</hi> was the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it, and gave it his own Name.

and her Preſidial Court, where there
is a Tower and a Clock, both conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable

Cauſey; the entrance into which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by a Caſtle flank'd with large
Towers, environ'd with good Moats,
where there is a Gariſon and a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
The Biſhoprick of St. <hi>Quidalet</hi>
was tranſlated thither in the Year
1172.</p>
                     <p>I have here two things to obſerve
concerning St. <hi>Malo's,</hi> one of which is
true, the other ſeems to me to be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The firſt is, That every Night
they let out a dozen or fifteen great
Maſtiffs, that preſently run their Rounds
about the City upon the Ramparts, and
infallibly tear to pieces all people that
they meet with. So that before they
ſuffer 'em to walk their Patrolle, there
is a Bell Toll'd for ſome time to give
people notice that the mercileſs Watch
is a coming. Theſe Dogs are kept on
purpoſe to preſerve the City from ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize:
which gave occaſion for ſome
to ſay, <hi>That Dogs had the Guard of
St.</hi> Malo's.</p>
                     <p>My ſecond Remark relates to a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and a Crow that are in the Iſland,
whoſe number never increaſes. When
one of theſe two Dies, all that are in
the Neighbouring Parts flock thither to
take poſſeſſion of the Vacancy, as if it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:32919:55"/>
were an Inheritance; and in regard
they have no Knowledge of <hi>Littleton</hi>'s
Tenures or the Canon-Law, much leſs
of the Genealogy of their Anceſtors,
ſo as to leave their Eſtates to the next
Heirs, they fall to Bloody Wars one
among another: many are ſlain on both
ſides, many are wounded, and many
betake themſelves to Cowardly flight,
and ſave themſelves upon the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent;
and thus at length the ſtrongeſt
carries it, and becomes peaceable Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour
of the Iſland all the reſt of his
days. As to the Surviver, I know not
whether upon the loſs of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
he loſes his Privileges, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he meaſures Beaks and Claws, and
then Duels it out with the new
Comer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Breſt</hi> is the beſt Seaport-Town which
The French have upon the Ocean; for
which reaſon it is the Great Maritime
Arſenal of the Kingdom, and the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouz
of the French Fleets. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Bay is very dangerous by
reaſon of ſeveral Rocks that lye under
Water upon high Tides; but there are
always skilful Pilots ready to carry in
great Ships without any hazard. The
King caus'd this Place to be fortify'd
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:32919:56"/>

                     <head>CHAP. XIX. Of Beauſſe, which Comprehends Orleanois,
Bleſois, and Le Pais Chartrain.</head>
                     <p>IN regard there have been no juſt
Bounds given to this Province, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſeveral Authors, out of a humour
joyn the Neighbouring Provinces to it,
I ſhall not undertake to limit the extent
of it; but following the Opinion of thoſe
who divide it into Upper, Middle and
Lower, which are commonly call'd
<hi>Le Pais Chartrain, Orleanois,</hi> and <hi>Bleſois;</hi>
I ſhall only obſerve what is moſt curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the Principal Cities of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
By the way, you are to obſerve
that this Country is call'd the Granary
of <hi>France,</hi> by reaſon of the great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:32919:58"/>
of Corn which it produces. As for
the People, the <hi>Chartrains</hi> are look'd
upon to be Zealous Catholicks: The
<hi>Orleanois,</hi> ſomewhat addicted to Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and Backbiting: The <hi>Bleſois</hi> are
ſaid to ſpeak the beſt French; yet both
the one and the other are very civil and
obliging.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chartres</hi> is a City ſo Ancient, that
ſome Authors affirm it to have been
built by the <hi>Gomerites,</hi> who were ſent
into <hi>Gaul,</hi> a little after <hi>Noah</hi>'s time.
However, certain it is, that the <hi>Druids</hi>
built this City long before the Birth of
Chriſt, whoſe Nativity they foretold,
and that he ſhould be Born of a Virgin;
which was the reaſon that <hi>Priſcus</hi> the
Roman Governor erected a Temple
there, which he conſecrated <hi>Virgini Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riturae,</hi>
to the Virgin that ſhould bear
a Son. And ſeeing that St. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Athens,</hi> met with an Altar dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown God,</hi> we may the
more readily believe that either by
ſome Prophetick Spirit, or by ſome
other Prerogatives only known to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that the Pagans in the midſt
of their Darkneſs had ſome glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of that knowledge which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
for the Chriſtians. And hence
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:32919:59"/>
I may obſerve, that if ſome Chriſtians
were to be met among the Pagans of
thoſe Times, there are more Pagans to
be found among the Chriſtians at this
day.</p>
                     <p>There is a Well to be ſeen at <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres,</hi>
which is call'd the Saints Well,
becauſe the Romans were wont to
throw the Primitive Chriſtians into it.
There belongs to this City a Preſidial
Court, together with a Biſhops See,
under the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> ever
ſince 1622. for before it depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sens.</hi> There are
to be ſeen in this City many Pieces of
Antiquity, and a great number of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques.
The Cathedral dedicated to the
Holy Virgin is very conſiderable for
the Quire, &amp; the Church under-ground,
and the two Steeples are the Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Forreigners. The Streets are
fair and ſtraight, the Houſes neatly
built, the Market-Places large, and the
River <hi>Eure</hi> affords a Water very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for ſeveral ſorts of Manufacture.
In the Year 1591. <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. took it
from the League, and caus'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

that <hi>Reims</hi> held out in Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>

and a Univerſity for the Law, founded
by St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> and confirm'd by <hi>Philip the
Fair</hi> in 1312. All this advances much
the Honour of the City, but her grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Glory to be the Appanage or Childs
Portion and Title always belonging to
the Second Son of <hi>France,</hi> much more
Exalts the <hi>Idea</hi> that Forreigners have

                     <p>This City is ſeated upon the Banks

                     <p>Among the moſt conſiderable Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
is to be ſeen the Church of the
Holy Croſs, which the Religionaries
ruin'd in the laſt Age; but though
<hi>Henry the Great</hi> caus'd it to be rebuilt,
he has not reſtor'd it the Beauty of her
Priſtin Antiquity. This City was ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

deliver'd: Once by the Prayers
of her Biſhop St. <hi>Aignan,</hi> when <hi>Attila</hi>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:32919:60"/>
time it was ſuccour'd by <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Arc,</hi>
call'd the <hi>Maid of Orleans.</hi> The Kingdom
was then in a Low condition, and upon
the very brink of Ruin; at what time
this Maid, who was no more then a
poor Shepherdeſs, born at <hi>Dompremi</hi>
upon the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> receiv'd a Command
from God to go and ſuccour <hi>Orleans,</hi>
and to Crown <hi>Charles</hi> VII. K. of <hi>France</hi>
at <hi>Reims.</hi> Coming to Court, ſhe made
up to the King, whom ſhe had never
ſeen in her life before; and though he
had nothing to be ſignaliz'd from the
reſt, in the croud of Courtiers that were
in a huddle about him.</p>
                     <p>She told him of the Command ſhe
had receiv'd from Heaven; They gave
her what Men ſhe deſir'd, with which
ſhe defeated the Engliſh and reliev'd
<hi>Orleans.</hi> After that ſhe caus'd the King
to be Crown'd at <hi>Reims,</hi> re-conquer'd
all <hi>Champagne,</hi> and had expell'd the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
quite out of <hi>France,</hi> but that ſhe
had the Misfortune to be taken before
<hi>Compiegne,</hi> which ſhe had laid Siege to.
When the Engliſh had her in their
power, they carri'd her to <hi>Rouen,</hi> and
Burnt her for a Witch. She was call'd
the <hi>Maid</hi> or <hi>Virgin,</hi> becauſe that having
been ſearch'd by ſeveral Matrons in the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:32919:60"/>
preſence of the Queen of <hi>Sicily,</hi> ſhe was
found to be ſo. The <hi>Orleanois</hi> had ſo

be ſeen the Caſtle of <hi>Buri,</hi> in the Court
of which is erected a Pillar, on the

                     <p>The Lake alſo which is in the Dutchy
of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> is very remarkable for this,
that the Water abounds in it for ſeven
Years together; but the next ſeven
Years it lyes quite dry. During which
time you may perceive Caverns in it
that are extreamly deep. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
people alſo know by certain Marks
of the Height of the Water, whether
the ſeven Years that the Water is abſent
will be fruitful or barren.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amboiſe</hi> is a very ancient City,
where <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. was Born; and this
Prince it was who built the Caſtle,
which is the greateſt Ornament of it.
In this Caſtle <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. inſtituted the
Order of the Knights of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> the
Firſt day of <hi>August</hi> in the Year 1469.

the Iſland of <hi>France,</hi> unleſs
they caſt their Eyes upon the Map, they
take it for a Land divided from the

be intercut and intercepted with many
Rivers, however they do not make any
Iſland; only it is a Name which the
Province has deriv'd from little Iſlands
which the <hi>Seine</hi> ſurrounds in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

                        <hi>Paris</hi> is not only the Capital of this
Province, but the Metropolis of the
whole Kingdom; nor is it without
good Reaſon that a certain Author calls
it, <hi>The Queen of the Cities in the World.</hi>
It is ſo ancient, that the Time is not
poſitively known when it began to be
built. Some ſay, that the Foundations
of it were laid before the Death of
<hi>Noah.</hi> However it were, Authors
agree that it is more ancient then <hi>Rome,</hi>
as it is much larger; in regard that
<hi>Rome</hi> is not above Twenty three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

                     <p>In the Year 1622. the Biſhoprick was
Erected into an Archbiſhoprick; The

                     <p>The Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> is the moſt
famous in all <hi>France, Italy, Spain,</hi> or
<hi>Germany;</hi> where all manner of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Sciences are taught. It was
founded in the Year 791. by <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maign,</hi>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:32919:63"/>
                        <hi>Alcuin,</hi> who was the firſt Profeſſor of
it. And I am apt to believe, that to
juſtifie the Opinion of <hi>M. Balzac,</hi> who
calls the Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> the Latin
Country, there needs no more then to
tell yee, that it conſiſts of Fifty five
Colleges, which are always full of an
Infinite Number of Scholars; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Body knows that the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> is a
Nurſery of Learned Men, and the moſt
rigid College in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I do not here propoſe to my ſelf to
make an exact Deſcription of all the
Beauties of <hi>Paris;</hi> for a Volume in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio
would not contain 'em all. I ſhall
only take notice of thoſe things that
render it moſt remarkable, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into a particular Enumeration of
all Particulars. The chiefeſt without
doubt is this, that it is the place where
the Monarchs of <hi>France</hi> have all along
kept their Courts: and when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> which is joyn'd to
that of the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> ſhall be finiſh'd,
with that Order and Magnificence as
it is begun, 'twill be the moſt Noble
Building in the Univerſe. There will
not be only Lodging ſufficient for all
the Court; but alſo for the Miniſters
of State, for all the Officers of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:32919:63"/>
Crown, and all Forreign Ambaſſadors
that come to reſide in the City.</p>
                     <p>The Cathedral Church which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to the Holy Virgin, is a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſeventy four Paces in length, and
Sixty broad, and a Hundred Paces high.
There is to be ſeen the Old and New
Teſtament engrav'd upon the Stones of
the Quire; and over the Door of the
Quire is to be ſeen a Crucifix, with an
Image of our Lady, which are two
Maſter-pieces of Workmanſhip. The
Frontiſpiece of the Church is adorn'd
with three large Portals, over which
are One and twenty Figures of the
King's that Reign'd from <hi>Childebert,</hi> to
<hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Two high ſquare
Towers ſerve it inſtead of a Steeple,
which are eſteem'd to be the faireſt in
<hi>France.</hi> So that 'tis commonly ſaid, If
you would have a perfect Cathedral,
you muſt joyn the Quire of <hi>Bauvaiſe,</hi>
the Body of <hi>Amiens,</hi> the Portal of
<hi>Reimes,</hi> the Steeple of <hi>Chartres,</hi> and the
Towers of <hi>Paris.</hi> From the bottom to
the top of theſe Towers you aſcend
with Three hundred eighty nine Steps;
and at the top there is a Gallery that
leads from one Tower to the other.
To the Church it ſelf belong Seven
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:32919:64"/>
Doors and Forty five Chappels. But
that which is moſt of all to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
at is this, that this Vaſt and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Structure is built upon Piles
driven into the Ground, by reaſon it
ſtands at the farther end of the Iſland
of the Palace. The Quire, the Body
of the Church, and the Chappels are
adorn'd with lovely Pictures, and many
precious Reliques are preſerv'd within
thoſe ſacred Walls.</p>
                     <p>The Holy Chappel of the Palace, is a
Church which is very remarkable, not
only for Antiquities and Reliques, but
for the Workmanſhip of the Building
which is ſupported by Pillars ſo ſmall,
that a Man would wonder how they
are able to bear ſo great a weight. The
moſt famous Reliques that are lockt up
within theſe two Places, are the Crown
of Thorns with which Chriſt was
Crown'd: The Table-Cloath upon
which he Supp'd with his Apoſtles:
The Spunge, and Head of the Spear
wherewith his Side was pierc'd; Some
of the Virgins Milk, <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod, a
piece of St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In
ſhort, not to engage my ſelf to give an
account of all the Churches in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
I ſhall only tell yee that <hi>Paris</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:32919:64"/>
contains One and fifty Pariſhes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of
which the moſt part conſiſt of Twenty
five, Thirty and Thirty five thouſand
Communicants; Two and fifty Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,
Seventy eight Nunneries, and
Thirty Hoſpitals.</p>
                     <p>If we add to this, that there are in
<hi>Paris</hi> Eight hundred and thirty Streets,
Twelve Suburbs, of which St. <hi>German
des Prez</hi> alone is larger then many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Cities; Ten Bridges, Seventy three
Piazza's and Market-Places, though <hi>de
la Croix</hi> ſays but Twenty five, and a
great Number of Palaces or Noble-Men's
Houſes, 'twill be no wonder to
us what <hi>Charles</hi> V. ſaid, That he had
ſeen in <hi>France</hi> a World, a City and a
Village: The World was <hi>Paris;</hi> the
City was <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Village was
<hi>Poitiers.</hi> It would be no difficult thing
to Arm in <hi>Paris</hi> Two hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Men for the Service of the State;
for an Army might be rais'd only of
the People that wear Liveries, from
Eighteen to Thirty Years of Age.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Baſtille</hi> is a Caſtle built near
St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Gate for the Security of
the Arſenal, which is one of the beſt
provided in <hi>Europe.</hi> This Fortreſs is
flank'd with Four Towers, ſurrounded
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:32919:65"/>
with Moats, and furniſh'd with Good
Artillery; and is the Place where
many times Priſoners of State are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd.</p>
                     <p>The Royal Hoſpital for the Infirm, is
a Houſe which <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. caus'd to be
built for the Entertainment of Officers
and Souldiers who are not in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to bear Arms, as having been
Maim'd in the King's Service. And
there may be conveniently Lodg'd in
this Hoſpital Four Thouſand Men,
who keep as exact Guard within the
Place, as if they were in a Garriſon.</p>
                     <p>Now in regard that <hi>Paris</hi> lyes in the
Heart of the Kingdom, there is no
need of keeping any Garriſon in it.
But becauſe it is the general Concourſe
of all ſorts of People, and for that it
frequently happens that Rogues and
Night-Robbers wait their Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and generally practiſe their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies
in Places of great reſort; the
City therefore keeps a ſtanding Watch
of Two hundred and fifty Men, part
Horſe and part Foot, which are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into ſeveral Quarters to walk the
Rounds and ride the Patroule. But in
regard the Criminals make it their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to avoid 'em, the Citizens and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:32919:65"/>
others are frequently ſet upon after the
Watch is paſt, not being able to help
themſelves. 'Tis true, that in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
it were an eaſie thing to ſecure
<hi>Paris</hi> againſt the Robberies and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which are too frequently there
committed, with little Charge to the
City; but it would be a raſhneſs in me
to go about to inſtruct the moſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Magiſtrates in the World.</p>
                     <p>I have already mention'd, that in
<hi>Paris</hi> there are Seventy and three Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Piazza's or Market-Places. I ſhall
only ſpeak of thoſe three which are
the moſt Modern, and which are alſo
the moſt conſiderable. The firſt is
call'd the <hi>Royal Place,</hi> which is in that
part where formerly ſtood the <hi>Palais
des Tournelles,</hi> or of the Parlamental
Court for Criminal Cauſes, near St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonies-Street.</hi>
'Tis very regular, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd
with Thirty ſix Pavillions no
leſs proportionable, and rail'd quite
round with Iron Spikes on all the four
ſides. All the foreparts of the Houſes
round the Piazza are ſupported with
Pillars that make a kind of a Gallery
or Portico, under which People may
walk at all times ſhelter'd from the
Sun and the Rain. <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. began it,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:32919:66"/>
but in regard it was not finiſh'd till in
the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. they ſet up a
Braſs Statue of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> omitting
his Predeceſſor, Erected the 27th. of
<hi>Septemb. 1639.</hi> upon a Pedeſtal of white
Marble, with Inſcriptions on the four
Sides.</p>
                     <p>The Second is the <hi>Place de Victoires</hi>
in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> at the
End of the Street <hi>des Petits Champs;</hi>
which ſome People know better by
<hi>Mazarin</hi>'s <hi>Quarter.</hi> Meſſire <hi>Francois
d'Aubuſſon,</hi> Duke <hi>de Fueillade,</hi> built this
Piazza, as an Eternal Monument of his
Fidelity and Zeal for the Honour of
<hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. in the Year 1686. and
in his Memory Erected in the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of it, the King's Statue of Gilt
Braſs.</p>
                     <p>The Groupe of this Statue is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of three Figures: The one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
the King ſtanding upright in
his Royal Robes: The other Victory,
which ſtands behind, having one foot
upon a Globe, from whence ſhe raiſes
her ſelf, and puts a Crown upon the
King's Head. The Third is a <hi>Cerberus,</hi>
which the King tramples under foot;
alluding to the Triple Alliance, which
the King made a ſhift to break by the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:32919:66"/>
help of a Kind Neighbour. The King's
Statue is Thirteen foot high: and the
Groupe with a <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Club, a Lions
Skin, and a Helmet weighs above
Thirty thouſand weight. The whole
is very neatly Gilt, and rais'd upon a
Pedeſtal of vein'd Marble, two and
twenty foot high, adorn'd with four
Bodies of Braſs in Chains, with Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
denoting the Subjection to which
the King has reduc'd his Enemies. At
the four Entrances into the Place ſtands
a Braſs Lanthorn Gilt, into which
there are Candles put every Night to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
the Place. Which Lanthorns
are ſuſtain'd by three Columns of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
adorn'd with Baſe Reliefs of Braſs
which repreſent the King's Victories.</p>
                     <p>Monſieur <hi>de la Fueillade</hi> foreſeeing
that Time brings all things to ruin, and
defaces the nobleſt Structures; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſirous to preſerve this Monument
entire to perpetuity, made a Deed of
Conveyance of all his Eſtate to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Duke of <hi>Fueillade,</hi> &amp; the Male Heirs
of his Body, and for want of ſuch Iſſue
to the next of Kin, that bore the Name
and Arms of <hi>Aubuſſon,</hi> and for want of
ſuch to the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that whoever inherit ſhall every
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:32919:67"/>
Five and twenty Years reguild the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
Lanthorns and Ornaments at their
own Coſts and Charges, keep all the
ſeveral Pieces of Workmanſhip in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
and find Candles for the Lanthorns
to enlighten the <hi>Piazza.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Third is a very fair and large
Piazza very like the Royal Piazza, only
that it has not Arches round about in
form of a Portico. It joyns to St. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>'s
Street facing the Convents of the
Brown Mendicants and the Capuchins;
and runs as far as the New Street of the
Little Fields. <hi>M. de Louvois</hi> began it,
but ſince his Death, the Buildings have
been diſcontinu'd. 'Tis call'd the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azza
of the Conqueſts,</hi> and was deſign'd
for the ſetting up the King's Statue on
Horſeback, which is already finiſh'd;
and the Ornaments that are to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
it, are to ſet forth the Glorious
Actions of that Monarch.</p>
                     <p>And ſince I am ſpeaking of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Places where the Statues of our
Kings are to be ſeen, I muſt not omit
the Statue of <hi>Henry the Great</hi> erected
upon <hi>Pont Neuf,</hi> juſt againſt the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin
Piazza. It is of Braſs, upon a
Horſe of the ſame Metal, rais'd upon a
Pedeſtal of Marble and Jaſper, adorn'd
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:32919:67"/>
with Baſe Reliefs, and Inſcriptions in
Letters of Gold, denoting the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Victories of that Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pont Neuf,</hi> ſtanding over the Point
of the Iſland of the Palace, was begun
in 1578. under the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> III.
but was not finiſh'd till 1604. when
<hi>Henry</hi> IV. was come to the Crown,
and had in part appeas'd the Troubles
of his Kingdom. It conſiſts of two
Bridges, which the Point of the Iſland
joyns together, ſupported by Twelve
Arches. On both ſides of this Bridge
upon an Elevation of about three foot,
ſtand a great Number of Brokers Shops,
which do not hinder, but that four
Coaches may go a-breaſt in the middle.
It is alſo adorn'd with a Houſe that
ſtands upon Piles, which is commonly
call'd <hi>La Samaritaine,</hi> becauſe of the
Figure of the Samaritan Woman which
is there to be ſeen, together with that
of Chriſt, who inſtructs her that there
is a Water more wholeſom then that
which ſhe ſeeks for.</p>
                     <p>Within theſe few Years there was
another Bridge built much after the
faſhion of <hi>Pont Neuf,</hi> over againſt the
Palace of the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> which is now
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:32919:68"/>
call'd <hi>Pont Royal,</hi> the Royal Bridge, and
ſtands where the Red Bridge ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
There are moreover ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bridges very conſiderable, as the
<hi>Change Bridge,</hi> St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s, the Bridge
of <hi>Noſtredame,</hi> and <hi>Pont Marie;</hi> which
have Houſes on both ſides, ſo high
that they cannot be perceiv'd to ſtand
over the Water.</p>
                     <p>The French Academy is become ſo
famous over <hi>Europe,</hi> that all Men have
a particular Eſteem for all the Learned
Men who have the Honour to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it. It was not Confirm'd by
the King's Edict till the Year 1635.
though it were ſet up five or ſix Years
before, and was inſtituted by Chance.
For that in the Year 1620. certain
Learned Perſons that Lodg'd in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts of the City, reſolv'd to meet
once a Week at one of their Houſes
by Turns, that ſo they might with
more eaſe confer together. And this
was that which gave a Beginning to
this Academy, which was at firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Protection of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu.</hi>
Now the Number of the Academies
is fix'd to Forty.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this Academy, <hi>Paris</hi> has alſo
Three others; The <hi>Academy Royal of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:32919:68"/>
Painting,</hi> which owes the Beginning of
it to <hi>M. de Noyers</hi> Secretary of State,
and Surveyor of the King's Buildings
in the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. They met
at firſt in the Palais Royal, but were
afterwards remov'd into the Galleries
of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> at what time it was
ſettl'd by a Decree of Council in the
Year 1648. The <hi>Academy Royal of
Sciences,</hi> compos'd of a great number
of Learned Phyſicians, Philoſophers,
and Mathematicians, ſettl'd by Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
Miniſter of State, at the Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of M. <hi>du Clos,</hi> and the Abbot of
<hi>Bonzaisi.</hi> And for the ſake of theſe
Learned Men it is, that the King has
erected an <hi>Obſervatory</hi> in the Suburb of
St. <hi>James,</hi> for the making new Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences,
and diſcovery of new Secrets
in Phyſick and Mathematicks. And
laſtly, The <hi>Royal Academy of Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi>
ſettl'd by the ſame Mr. <hi>Colbert</hi>
in 1671.</p>
                     <p>As for the Divertiſements of <hi>Paris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
no body can be ignorant that there are
wanting neither Exquiſite Voices for
<hi>Opera's,</hi> nor good Actors for French
and Italian Comedies; nor any ſort
of excellent Company; whether for
Converſation, Play, or Courtſhip. And
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:32919:69"/>
for Places of Meeting and Walking,
there are the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> the Queen's
Court, and the Groves of <hi>Boulogne</hi> and
<hi>Vincennes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I perceive this Chapter has car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me too far, which obliges me to

Forreigners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That they can never be

                     <p>AFter what I have ſaid of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
Beauty and Magnificence
of <hi>Paris,</hi> 'twill be no hard matter to
believe that the parts about it are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
well peopled; There being
Ten Thouſand Boroughs, Villages or
Caſtles within Ten Leagues round it.
I ſhall only ſay ſomething of the moſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:32919:69"/>
Conſiderable places, not much caring
for the Criticiſms of thoſe who ſhall
cenſure me for not reporting faithfully
all their Beauties. For I declare to 'em
before hand, that I ſhall not engage to
ſatisfie 'em with a Piece of Perfection.
For in ſhort, if a Man ſhould go about
to examine all the Wonders, Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
and Riches of the Royal Seats
not far from <hi>Paris,</hi> it would be enough
to dazle his Eyes; nor can any Man
Contemplate 'em without being raviſh'd
into Extaſie.</p>
                     <p>Since the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Juſt,
<hi>Verſailles</hi> was no more then an Ordinary
Caſtle, conſiſting of a Body of Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
accompani'd with two Wings, and
ending in four <hi>Pavillons.</hi> But in 1661.
the King propoſing to himſelf to make
ſome ſtay there, enlarg'd this Building
with another much more Magnificent.
At length in 1678, the Old Caſtle not
appearing worthy the State and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of ſo Great a Monarch, it was
pull'd down, to make room for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more Superb: for the rearing
of which, all the moſt Famous Maſters
in <hi>Europe</hi> for Architecture, Sculpture
and Painting were ſent for to diſplay
their utmoſt Skill. So that the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:32919:70"/>
of every Apartment out-does
whatever there is of moſt rare in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries: Even the Stables of
<hi>Verſailles</hi> are more Magnificent and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
then the Palaces of ſeveral Princes
of <hi>Europe.</hi> There is a City built on
two ſides of the Caſtle with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Symmetry. The Caſtle is of ſo
large Extent, that not only all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Princeſſes of the Blood have
Large and Convenient Lodgings within
it, but alſo all the Miniſters and Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
of State, and a great number of
other Lords.</p>
                     <p>The Soil about <hi>Verſailles</hi> is naturally
dry and unpleaſant. But <hi>Lewis the Great,</hi>
has enforc'd Nature, as I may ſo ſay, to
be more favourable to that Part which he
had made choice of for his Reſidence.
For the Earth not only produces all the
Plants, the Fruits, the Flowers that
grow in the moſt fertile places in the
World, but by the benefit of the Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
this place abounds ſo much in
Water, that you would take it rather
for a Sea, when all the Engins play,
then for a Garden of Pleaſure. And
what is more particular and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
thoſe Engins throw the
Water up into the Air in different Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:32919:70"/>
You ſhall perceive Galleries of
Water, Triumphal Arches, Pavillions,
Arbors, Theatres, Mountains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The faireſt Receptacles for Water, are
thoſe of <hi>Ceres, Flora, Apollo</hi> and <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
The Banqueting-Hall, the Labyrinth,
the Walk of Water, are Machines
worthy the Curioſity of Strangers.</p>
                     <p>All this Water is drawn from the
<hi>Sein,</hi> by the Aſſiſtance of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Pumps ranvers'd, and carry'd
to <hi>Verſailles</hi> by the only Engin which
is to be ſeen in <hi>Europe;</hi> being the
Invention of the Sieurs <hi>de Ville</hi> and
<hi>Ranequin.</hi> This Piece of Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
which may contend with the
Seven Wonders of the World, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of Fourteen Wheels that have
Eight and twenty Motions, which are
caus'd by Twenty Chains, and Eight
Water Engins, with which they force
up the Water into an Aqueduct of
Thirty ſix Arches ſeated upon the Top
of a Mountain, and Five hundred and
ſeventy Foot from the ſide of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
All theſe Motions work Night
and Day, there being no more then 18
Men, in three different Diviſions to
look after 'em. All people admire
the Effects of the King's Glory and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:32919:71"/>
Grandeur, and the large extent of the
Genius of thoſe Artiſts who invented
this Engin to the higheſt degree of
Perfection.</p>
                     <p>They who will viſit the Apartments
of <hi>Verſailles,</hi> the Gardens, the Park, the
Place where all ſorts of Strange Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are kept; the Grotto's, the Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths,
and the Caſtle of <hi>Trianon,</hi>
which is a real Jewel, all wrought
within and without with Marble of
divers colours, have need of Eight days
time; neither will that ſuffice to view
all theſe Wonders that ſurpaſs Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
                     <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Merli,</hi> but a ſmall
League from <hi>Verſailles,</hi> is another Royal
Seat, whither the King goes uſually
twice a Month, to ſpend two or three
days; during which time, he gives Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to no body, unleſs it be to
his Miniſters, and thoſe that are ſent
for to Council, which his Majeſty holds
there, concerning the moſt Important
Affairs of State.</p>
                     <p>Next to <hi>Verſailles, St. German</hi> on <hi>Laie</hi>
may diſpute for Priority before all the
other Royal Houſes. This place is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for the Birth of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. upon
the 5th. of <hi>Septemb. 1638.</hi> He was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:32919:71"/>
in the Old Caſtle the 21ſt. of
<hi>April, 1643.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides the Regularity and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
of the Caſtle, there are the
Gardens and Grotto's to be ſeen, adorn'd
with a Thouſand Figures of Water.
Among the reſt, in one of theſe Grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's
there is an <hi>Orpheus</hi> playing upon
his Harp, and with the motion of
his Head and his Body keeping time
to his Inſtrument. He is alſo attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a great number of Beaſts that
follow him, as being enchanted with
the Melody of his Harp; which alſo
draws after him Rocks, Trees and
Plants. There is likewiſe Paradiſe,
Hell, the Sea, and the Four Elements
ſo livelily repreſented, that you would
think your ſelf in ſome Enchanted
Place.</p>
                     <p>About a League from <hi>St. Germans,</hi>
upon one ſide of <hi>Paris,</hi> you meet with
the Traytors Wood, divided into two
parts by a ſpacious High-Way. The
Branches which you break off from
one ſide of this Wood ſink; but thoſe
which you break off from the other
ſide ſwim in the Water. In this Wood
it was that the Perfidious <hi>Ganelon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
his Treaſon againſt the Peers
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:32919:72"/>
of <hi>France,</hi> and all the great Captains
of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> which was put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
at the Battel of <hi>Roncevaux,</hi> ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to <hi>France,</hi> in the Paſſage of the <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Clou</hi> is another very beautiful
Royal Seat, belonging to Monſieur, the
King's only Brother. It ſtands upon a
Hill near the Banks of the River <hi>Seine,</hi>
almoſt half way between <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles.</hi>
The Paintings are very Noble,
the Furniture very Rich, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet
of <hi>China;</hi> wherein there are an
infinite number of Curioſities, and vaſt
Riches, is worthy the Grandeur and
Magnificence of the Prince to whom it
belongs.</p>
                     <p>As for the Caſtle of <hi>Madrit, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
I. caus'd it to be built in the Wood
of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> in memory of his being
carry'd a Priſoner into <hi>Spain;</hi> to let the
Spaniards underſtand, that he held it
for no ſhame to have been made a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
of War at the Head of his Army;
which had never befall'n him, had he
contented himſelf to Command in his
Cabinet, as the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> do. They
who believe this Caſtle to be built after
the ſame form as that, where this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
was kept in durance, are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:32919:72"/>
for it is little or nothing like it.
It is nothing ſo magnificent now as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
and the little care that is tak'n
to repair it, ſhews that the King has no
great Fancy for the Seat, nor minds
whether it go to ruin or no.</p>
                     <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Vincennes</hi> is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as being the Place where Priſoners
of War of great Quality are Confin'd;
and many times Priſoners of State;
witneſs the Princes of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Conti,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> in the
Time of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin.</hi> It is very
large, and flank'd with Eight great
Towers. Here are kept the Chains of
the Streets of <hi>Paris;</hi> which <hi>Charles</hi> VI.
took away after he had chaſtiz'd that
City for her Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> is another Royal Seat,
ſo call'd from the great number of
Springs in that place. It lyes about
Twelve Leagues from <hi>Paris:</hi> and in
regard it is a Country proper for Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Court ſpends a great part of the
Autumn in this Place. This Caſtle is
very large, as being ſaid to contain Nine
hundred Chambers, Halls, Cabinets or
Galleries; where Art has quite exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her ſelf to render every thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the Reſidence of our Monarchs.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:32919:73"/>
At <hi>Fontainbleau</hi> it was where Marſhal
<hi>Biron</hi> was diſarm'd by the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and where Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> and
the Sieur <hi>du Pleſſis-Mornai</hi> met in the
Preſence of <hi>Hen. 4.</hi> to Diſpute upon
Matters of Religion; which drew thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the moſt Learned of both Parties:
and 'tis ſaid, that when the two Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
could not agree, the King addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
himſelf to the Cardinal, ask'd him,
Whether all thoſe that were ſeparated
from the Roman Church were damn'd?
His Eminency and the reſt of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Doctors, aſſur'd him, That there
was nothing more certain. After which,
the K. demanding from thoſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Party, whether it were a Point of
their Doctrine, that there was no Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for thoſe that were not of their
Communion? They made anſwer, 'Twas
none of their Opinion; for that they
thought the Mercy of God might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to all Men. <hi>That being ſo,</hi> reply'd
the King, '<hi>tis my Judgment to chooſe the
Certainty before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty:</hi> and ſo
turn'd Roman Catholick.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Chantilli</hi> is a fair Seat belonging to
Monſieur the Prince, whither the Court
often goes for the Recreation of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
It is an Epitome of Art and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:32919:73"/>
'Tis obſerv'd, that <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Anſwer a Letter which he had
receiv'd from the K. of <hi>Spain,</hi> cramm'd
full of Titles, not only of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
which the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and their Anceſtors poſſeſs'd, but of
thoſe they never had; as alſo of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
in the New World, not yet
diſcover'd; took upon him no other
Titles, but only <hi>Citizen</hi> of Paris, <hi>and
Lord of</hi> Chantilli. And there is much
the ſame Story of <hi>Francis</hi> I. who write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Charles</hi> V. fill'd the firſt Page
with only theſe words repeated, King
of <hi>France,</hi> King of <hi>France;</hi> adding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to <hi>Paris,</hi> as <hi>Ruel, Meudon, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flans,

the Entertainment of Kings, whether
in reſpect of their Bigneſs or Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
It remains that I now ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> the Burying-place of
our Monarchs; for which I deſign a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Chapter. Only before I conclude
this, I muſt not omit to tell yee, that
there is at <hi>Alincourt</hi> near <hi>Paris,</hi> the Tomb
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:32919:74"/>
of a Mother and her Children that gave
Occaſion to this Epitaph.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Here lyes the Son, here lyes the Mother,</l>
                        <l>Here lyes the Daughter with the Father,</l>
                        <l>Here lyes the Siſter and the Brother,</l>
                        <l>Here lyes the Husband, here the Wife;</l>
                        <l>All but Three Body's, on my Life.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>To Expound this Riddle, you muſt
know, That a certain Young Stripling
importun'd his Mothers Maid to grant
him you may gueſs what; who told her
Miſtreſs, the Mother of the Young
Man and a Widow. She order'd the
Servant to give him a Meeting in her
Chamber, where the Mother put her
ſelf in place of the Maid; and having
had the Company of her Son with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſcovering who ſhe was, at Nine
Months end was brought to Bed of a
Daughter; which ſhe put out till
ſhe came to ſuch an Age, and then
ſent for her home. The Son in the
mean time had been Travelling for
ſeveral Years, but then returning
Home and finding the Young Virgin,
which his Mother ſaid was an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan,
to be very pretty, Marry'd
her; and ſo of his Daughter and his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:32919:74"/>
Siſter made her his Wife. The Young
Couple dy'd before the Mother, who
then diſcover'd the Secret, and would
needs be Interr'd in the ſame Tomb.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>NOrmandy</hi> is a very fair large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>France,</hi> with the Title of
a Dukedom, bounded Eaſtward by the
Iſland of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Picardy;</hi> by the
Ocean to the North; by <hi>Bretagne</hi> to
the Weſt, and <hi>Beauſſe</hi> and <hi>le Maine</hi> to
the South. The length of it is Seventy
two Leagues <hi>(de la Croix</hi> ſays 73. from
<hi>Aumale</hi> to the Coaſt of <hi>Courantin)</hi> and
Thirty in breadth (37. ſays <hi>de la Croix</hi>
from <hi>Alenſon</hi> to the City of <hi>Eu).</hi> The
Name of it is abſolutely <hi>German;</hi> for
<hi>Noort-Man,</hi> ſignifies a Man of the North:
ſo that the Name it bears was given it
by the People of the North, that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirated
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:32919:80"/>
upon the Seas, and afterwards
ſettl'd themſelves in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and
ravag'd the Country to the very Walls
of <hi>Paris. William</hi> the Norman laid Claim
to <hi>England,</hi> and Invading it under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Title, his Succeſſors Kings of
<hi>England,</hi> became Maſters of <hi>Normandy.</hi>
But <hi>Philip the Auguſt</hi> united it to the
Crown of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh
expell'd the Engliſh.</p>
                     <p>This Province being the moſt Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
part of the Kingdom is alſo the
Goldeſt. It is divided into Upper and
Lower. It abounds in all ſorts of Fruit,
eſpecially Pears and Apples, of which
they make Cider, and which ſerves 'em
inſtead of Wine; for Wine they have
none but what they fetch from the
Neighbouring Provinces. As for Corn,
it produces more then ſuffices the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.
The Dyers alſo have their
Madder and Woad from thence. The
Humour of the Common People does
'em no great Credit: They are look'd
upon to have more defects then Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p>The Normans are accus'd to be very
cholerick, litigious upon every Trifle,
and not to be too great Slaves to their
words, when their Intereſt is concern'd.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:32919:81"/>
So then, when you deal with a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the firſt Queſtion is, whether he
will inſiſt upon the Privileges of the
Country; that is to ſay, whether he
will go from his word, when the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
is concluded. And therefore when
a Man has fail'd of his word, 'tis a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
thing to ſay, <hi>He is a Norman.</hi> But
the Gentry and Perſons well educated,
who have a ſhare of Honour, are to be
excepted out of this Number. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
they have as great an Antipathy
againſt the <hi>Bretons,</hi> as the <hi>Bretons</hi> have
againſt them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rouen</hi> is the Principal City of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
dignify'd with an Archbiſhop's
See, and the Seat of a Parliament, a
Chamber of Accompts, an Audit of the
Treaſurers of <hi>France,</hi> a Chamber of
Money and a Preſidial Court. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
had that Name given it firſt of
all by <hi>Francis</hi> I. in 1515. whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was call'd the Court of Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
founded by <hi>Philip the Fair</hi> in 1286.
This City is ſeated upon the Banks of
the River <hi>Seine,</hi> on the one ſide, on the
other in a Valley environ'd with Hills
thick ſpread with Wood. From the
Eaſt come little Rivers, which run
through the Town, keep the Streets
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:32919:81"/>
clean, and after they have turn'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Mills, fall into the <hi>Seine.</hi> But the
nearneſs of it to the Sea, is that which
makes it a Town of great Trade when
Commerce is open. Among thoſe things
which it has moſt remarkable, we are
to admire the Bridge of Boats over the
<hi>Seine,</hi> Two hundred and ſeventy Paces
in length. For though it be all Pav'd,
and appear as firm as a Bridge of Stone;
yet it riſes and ſinks according to the
Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea. This
Bridge was made to ſupply the want of
another Stone Bridge of 15 Arches that
was ruin'd, and was accompted one of
the Faireſt Bridges in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Caſtle is fortified with Eleven
great Towers, which all Veſſels out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or inward bound, are engag'd to
ſalute with Three Guns at a time. The
Fortifications are Regular and of good
defence.</p>
                     <p>The Cathedral is conſecrated to the
Holy Virgin; wherein are to be ſeen
ſeveral <hi>Mauſoleum's</hi> of the Dukes of
<hi>Normandy,</hi> with a Treaſury in the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry;
which was much more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
before the <hi>Huguenots</hi> plunder's it
during the Civil Wars of the laſt Age.
There are three Towers that ſerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:32919:82"/>
of a Steeple; one of which is ſo
high, that you muſt aſcend Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty Steps, before you
come at the great Bell, which is
call'd <hi>George d' Amboiſe,</hi> by reaſon it
was made by the Order of the Cardinal
<hi>d' Amboiſe.</hi> Over the Portal of this
Cathedral is to be ſeen a Triumphal
Arch, where <hi>Henry</hi> IV. is repreſented
chaſing the Lions and the Wolves out
of his Sheep-Fold; the League en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chain'd
and gnawing her Chains; and
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> beholding all theſe
Trophies with a Penſive and Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
look.</p>
                     <p>There are very fair Structures at
<hi>Rouen,</hi> as well Sacred as Prophane, which
are marks of her Antiquity, and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
always go to ſee the Place where
the Engliſh burnt the Maid of <hi>Orleance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Normandy</hi> is bleſt with ſeveral other
good Ports; as that of St. <hi>Valeri,</hi> which
is a very Commodious Haven. But
<hi>Diepe</hi> is much the Stronger. This City
is ſeated at the Foot of the Mountains
from whence the River of <hi>Arques</hi> takes
its riſe; which ſeparates the Suburbs
from the City. The Caſtle of <hi>Pollet</hi>
Commands the Haven, and a Cittadel
defends the other ſide of the Town.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:32919:82"/>
The Streets are large, adorn'd with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Churches and Market-Places. The
Haven brings it a good Trade, and the
Seamen have gain'd a Reputation in the
World; for that the Beſt Sea-Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and the moſt Exact Quadrants, are
there ſaid to be made. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
alſo were the firſt that wrought
in Ivory and Tortoiſe-Shell. They are
alſo Excellent and very quick at the
Riming Exerciſes, call'd <hi>Jeux Floraux,</hi>
where the beſt doer is rewarded with
an Eglantine, the Second with a Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold
in Silver; which Sports are uſual
in this Town at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival

                     <p>
                        <hi>Havre de Grace</hi> is alſo a conſiderable
Sea Town, ſituated at the Mouth of
the River <hi>Seine,</hi> and is lookt upon to be
one of the Havens in <hi>France,</hi> upon
St. <hi>George</hi>'s <hi>Channel. Francis</hi> I. began
to fortifie it; but the <hi>Huguenots</hi> having
ſeiz'd it, deliver'd it up to the Engliſh
in 1562. from whom <hi>Charles</hi> IX. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
it; <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. added a Cittadel
to it, flank'd with four Baſtions: But
<hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. compleated the Work, and
has made it impregnable by regular
Fortifications. In times of Peace with
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> it drives a great
Trade.</p>

                        <hi>Evreux</hi> is a very ancient City, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
with a Biſhop's See, a Bailliage and
a Preſidial Court, and adorn'd with a
good number of Churches and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Houſes; among which, the Abbies
of St. <hi>Thurin,</hi> and St. <hi>Saviour</hi> are very
remarkable. Several Princes of the
Blood, and other great Lords, have
been Counts of <hi>Evreux;</hi> and it is ſaid,
that <hi>Walter</hi> and <hi>Robert d' Evreux</hi> Earls of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> came originally from

                        <hi>Caen,</hi> ſeated upon the River <hi>Orne,</hi> is
not ſo famous for the Antiquity of it,
as for the Privileges and Variety of
Tribunals that it enjoys. For it is dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd
with a Preſidial Court, a Bailli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
an Election, a Generality, an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of the Finances, and a Univerſity
for the Civil and Canon Law there
founded in 1411. by <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. King of
<hi>England.</hi> It has had the ſame Fate with
other Cities of <hi>Normandy,</hi> as having
ſuffer'd very much during the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
that ſhook the French Monarchy
in the 16th Age. However the Town-Houſe
built upon St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Bridge is a
noble Structure adorn'd with four large
Towers. The People boaſt of their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
to their Prince, for which reaſon

                     <p>
                        <hi>Mount St. Michael,</hi> is a Town built
at the Foot of a Mountain, on the top
of which ſtands a Church and an Abby
conſecrated to St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel.
For the Story goes, that in
the Year 708. St. <hi>Michael</hi> appear'd to
<hi>Aubert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Avranches,</hi> and told
him, 'Twas the Will of God that a
Church ſhould be built upon the Hill,
and dedicated to him in particular.
Upon the ſame Mount ſtands alſo a
very fair Caſtle. The flowing in of
the Sea makes a perfect Iſland of it, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
for near a League together all
the Land between the Mount and the
firm Land; which the Ebb ſoon after
leaves dry agen. Nevertheleſs, they
who Travel thither, muſt be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
in obſerving the Time of the
Motion of the Water; for if they
ſhould be ſurpriz'd in that ſandy Plain,
they would run the riſque of being
Drown'd; which many times falls out.
This place is famous for the reſort of
Pilgrims to St. <hi>Michael;</hi> and for the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:32919:84"/>
Sand of which they make Salt, by
ſtraining the Sea-water through it.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Maine</hi> is a Province dignify'd with

and <hi>La Beauſſe</hi> to the Eaſt; <hi>Bretagne</hi>
to the Weſt; and by <hi>Tourain</hi> and <hi>Anjou</hi>
to the South. This Province is fruitful
in Wine, Corn, Fruit and Cattle; and
has ſome Iron Mines. The ſame defects
are attributed to the <hi>Manceaux,</hi> as to
the Normans: and as to their exactneſs
in keeping their words, it is become a
Proverb, <hi>That a</hi> Manceau <hi>is worth a</hi>

                     </p>

is <hi>Mans,</hi> ſeated upon the Banks of the
River <hi>Sarte,</hi> dignify'd with a Preſidial
Court and a Biſhop's See. This City
is very Ancient, and is thought to
have been one of the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Cities of the <hi>Gauls</hi> in the time of
<hi>Charlemagne.</hi> It is ſaid to have been

King of the <hi>Gauls;</hi> but being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd

in 1633, which renders it the

READER.</head>
                  <p>'TIS very true that ſeveral have ſet
forth Deſcriptions of <hi>Italy;</hi> but
'tis no wonder that all Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
ſhould be Ambitious of making their
Court to a Country that was once the Miſtreſs
of the World. The Author is alſo very
brief, I muſt confeſs; but many timas ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct
Manuals are better Companions for
a Gentleman, then large Volumes: They
will go by Water with him, and ride in
his Coach, where weighty Folio's would be
too cumberſomo and unweildy. Beſides, the
Author himſelf aſſures ye, that though he
has not been ſo tedious as others, yet that
you ſhall meet in the ſucceeding few Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
not only with Novelties, which are
pleaſing to all Men, but with an infinite
number of moſt curious Remarks, which
never yet before were committed to the
<pb facs="tcp:32919:95"/>
Preſs; and which were the Obſervations of
a Great and Learned Cardinal in ſome
particulars, and as to others of an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Perſon, who by means of his Publick
Employments, and his long Reſidence in
the Courts of ſeveral Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> had
gain'd a peculiar and perfect knowledge of
the Country: a great Argument of the
Truth of what is offer'd to your View;
that there is much in a little, and all clean
from Fabulous Report: Now then, after
theſe Encouragements to heighten your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
I think it not convenient to add any
more, for fear of putting a long Epiſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a little Book.</p>

it is not known from whence
it derives its Name. Some deduce it
from Oxen or Bulls, which in the ancient obſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete
Greek were called <hi>Itali;</hi> and for the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which, <hi>Italy</hi> was then in high repute
Others will have it ſo called from one <hi>Italus,</hi> one
of the firſt Kings of the Country. It formerly
bore the Names of <hi>Saturnia, Auſonia, Oenopia,</hi>
and <hi>Heſperia,</hi> which it receiv'd from ſeveral Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

at ſeveral times.</p>
                     <p>This part of <hi>Europe</hi> is ſeated in the middle of
the Temperate Zone, between the 28th Degree
and a half and the 42d and a half of Longitude,
and between the 37th Degree and a half and
48th and a half of Latitude.</p>
                     <p>It is bounded to the North by a ridge of
Mountains called the <hi>Alpes,</hi> which ſeparate it
from <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Switzerland;</hi> to the Weſt, by
the <hi>Alpes</hi> alſo and the River <hi>Var,</hi> which divides
it from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy;</hi> to the Eaſt, by the
<hi>Mediterranean Sea,</hi> otherwiſe call'd the <hi>Adriatic
Sea,</hi> or the Golph of <hi>Venice;</hi> and to the South,
by the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> or <hi>Tuſcan Sea.</hi> Where it is long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
to take it from the Frontiers of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to the
fartheſt extremity of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> it
extends it ſelf about 280 <hi>French</hi> Leagues, or 450
<hi>Italian</hi> Miles. But the breadth of it is not all
alike, ſometimes 30, in other places 40, 60, 80,
and 100 <hi>French</hi> Leagues, reſembling a Boot, that
ſeems to kick at <hi>Sicily,</hi> to force it into <hi>Africa.</hi>

                     <p>Moſt Geographers divide <hi>Italy</hi> into four parts;
the firſt comprehends the ancient <hi>Lombardy,</hi>
wherein are contain'd, the States or Dominions
of the Dukes of <hi>Savoy, Mantua, Parma, Modena,
Milanois,</hi> the Republic of <hi>Venice, Genoa,</hi> and ſome
other Petty Principalities. The ſecond includes
the Eccleſiaſtical State, and <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> The third,
the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> And the fourth, the
Iſlands of <hi>Sardigna, Sicily, Corſica, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Air is very wholſome and very temperate
over all <hi>Italy,</hi> except in the Eccleſiaſtical State,
where certain malignant Fevers are very rife, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32919:96"/>
were much more frequent before the uſe of Ice
in Summer to cool their Drink.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Italy</hi> produces in great plenty whatever is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the ſupport of Human Life; as Corn,
Oyl, Oranges, Citrons, Pomegranates, with all
ſorts of Fruits and Flowers. There is to be
found both Sugar and Cotton in the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples;</hi> beſides great ſtore of Silkworms, very
good Horſes and Bufalo's. The Mountains af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
Mines of Sulphur, and ſeveral Quarries of
Alablaſter, and all ſorts of Marble.</p>
                     <p>The principal Rivers that water it, are the <hi>Po,</hi>
the <hi>Adige, Adda, Arno,</hi> and <hi>Tiber,</hi> which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
not a little to the Fertility of it, from whence
it is call'd, <hi>The Garden of Europe.</hi> The higheſt
Mountains are the <hi>Alpes,</hi> the <hi>Apennine,</hi> which
runs quite through the whole length of <hi>Italy,</hi>
Mount <hi>Maſſo,</hi> Mount <hi>Barboro, Veſuvius,</hi> and Mount
<hi>Gibello.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis ſaid, the <hi>Italians</hi> are very wicked, or very
honeſt and virtuous. The People are generally
polite, obliging, quick of apprehenſion, ingenious,
crafty, eloquent, politic, and want not worth,
when they have once rid themſelves of a certain
Reſervedneſs, which frequently begets 'em the
Epithete of Knaves. Theſe good Qualities are
accompanied with ſome bad ones, to which they
are a little too much enclined: For they are
jealous, quick of their promiſes, ſlow to perform;
but above all, revengeful; inſomuch that many
times Revenge deſcends from Family to Family.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> Language is a kind of adulterated
<hi>Latin,</hi> which the <hi>Goths, Huns, Vandals, Lombards,</hi>
and other People inhabiting <hi>Italy,</hi> have much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32919:97"/>
Nor do they ſpeak it equally polite in
all parts of the Kingdom. It is more refined in
<hi>Tuſcany</hi> then any where elſe: but the <hi>Tuſcans</hi> do
not pronounce it ſo well as the <hi>Romans;</hi> which is
the reaſon of the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, <hi>Lingua Tuſcana
in Bucca Romana.</hi> And it is obſerved, that the
<hi>Italians</hi> ſpeak in the throat, the <hi>Venetians</hi> in the
roof of the mouth, the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> between the
teeth, and the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> between the Lips.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Apoſtolic Religion, is the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
allowed over all the States of <hi>Italy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
for the preſervation of it, there are ſeveral
Tribunals of the Inquiſition erected; not but that
there are great numbers of <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi>
ſettl'd upon the Sea-Coaſts, drawn thither
by the conveniency of Trade: And thô the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
know that they are departed from the
Church, yet 'tis their intereſt to take no cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of it. The <hi>Jews</hi> enjoy much more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and have their Synagogues even in <hi>Rome</hi> it
ſelf, upon the Payment of an Annual Tribute.
There are alſo <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> in ſome Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
who perform their Church Worſhip accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the cuſtoms of their Country.</p>
                     <p>Hiſtory informs us, that after the Foundation
of <hi>Rome, Italy</hi> was govern'd by Kings for the
ſpace of 245 Years, and that <hi>Tarquin</hi> the Proud
was the laſt of her Kings. That afterwards the
<hi>Romans</hi> erected themſelves into a Commonwealth,
which, under the conduct of Conſuls and Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
acquir'd Immortal Honour, as well for their
Policy, as for an infinite number of Victories
which they obtain'd over their Enemies. That
Commonwealth laſted till the 706th Year of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32919:97"/>
                        <hi>Rome,</hi> at what time <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was proclaim'd
Emperor, and extended the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in all
the three parts of the World which were then
known; for <hi>America</hi> was not diſcover'd in thoſe
days. After this Empire had mounted to the
higheſt period of its Grandeur, it declin'd in ſuch
a manner, that it has left us a memorable Example
of the inſtability and fleeting condition of all
Earthly Grandeur. This formidable Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fallen to decay, was diſmember'd in the Reign
of <hi>Honorius,</hi> who dy'd in the year of Chriſt 423,
and 4176th after the Foundation of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Italy</hi> after this fell under the Dominion of the
Emperors of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who ſent thither their
Viceroys or Governors under the Title of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi>
who kept their Court at <hi>Ravenna.</hi> But
that Government, which began in the year of
Chriſt 568, laſted not above 184 years, at what
time thoſe Emperors were expell'd by the Kings
of <hi>Lombardy.</hi> Afterwards, the Emperors of the
Weſt conquer'd <hi>Italy;</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy</hi>
was quite extinguiſh'd in 774, by <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi>
who made great Preſents to the Holy See:
that Monarch, and the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
being the only Princes who rais'd the
Temporal Power of the Pope to that degree
wherein we now behold it.</p>
                     <p>This part of <hi>Europe</hi> is at this day divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

                     <p>There are reckon'd to be in <hi>Italy</hi> 68 Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;

                     </p>
                     <p>The Principal Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> are <hi>Rome,</hi> which
is the Metropolis of the whole Country, term'd
the Holy; next to that, <hi>Naples</hi> the Noble, <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
the Fair, <hi>Genoa</hi> the Proud, <hi>Milan</hi> the Great,
<hi>Ravenna</hi> the Ancient, <hi>Venice</hi> the Rich, <hi>Padua</hi> the

                     <p>It remains that I ſhould ſpeak of ſome Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
that are general in <hi>Italy.</hi> In regard the
Coaſts of <hi>Italy</hi> upon the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea are
much infeſted by the Pyrates of <hi>Barbary,</hi> who
often Land there, and carry away the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
in the Country with the beſt of their Goods,
there are little Forts built all along the Coaſts,
about a mile diſtance one from another; more
eſpecially upon the <hi>Riviera di Genoa,</hi> and upon
the Coaſts of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> where ſix men
keep Garriſon with two Pieces of Cannon to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Deſcents. Theſe Guards every night kindle
one or two Fires upon the neighbouring Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
When there is but one, it is call'd a <hi>Fire
of Aſſurance,</hi> as being a ſign that no Turkiſh Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine
has appear'd all that day. But if they
kindle two ſome Paces off one from another, 'tis
to give notice to the Inhabitants to ſtand upon
their Guards, and that they have ſeen ſome Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32919:99"/>
ſounding where to get aſhore. Thoſe Fires
they call <hi>Fires of Miſtruſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> never tell the Clock as other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Europe</hi> do. They begin to tell One at
the cloſe of the Day; ſo that the Hours of

12th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> which we reckon to be Noon
in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> count it 17 a clock,
and 24 when the Sun diſappears. They keep a
man at their principal Clocks, who, when the
Clock has ſtrook, with a Hammer ſtrikes as many
times upon the ſame Bell as the Clock ſtrook;
that if any one were miſtaken in telling the firſt
time, he may not fail to tell right the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>'Tis alſo a uſual thing to be robb'd upon the

Towns; but moſt of all in the Territories of
the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Nor is there any truſting

ſhare the Booty with the Thieves, who for the

Pilgrims or Hermits.</p>
                     <p>Neither Wives nor Maids ſtir out of Doors
unleſs it be to Church, or at leaſt very ſeldom;
and when they do, they are attended by ſome
Spy which their jealous Parents or Husbands
ſend along with 'em to watch 'em. That Sex
never appears either in Shops or Markets; for
the Men drive all the Trade. Marriages are
uſually celebrated by Proxies; and many times
the Man and the Woman never ſee one another
till they come before the Prieſt to be married.

                     <head>CHAP. II. Of the States of the Duke of Savoy.</head>
                     <p>THE Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> deſcend from the Houſe
of <hi>Saxony,</hi> one of the moſt ancient and moſt
illuſtrious Families of <hi>Germany.</hi> 'Tis above a
thouſand years ſince that they have been in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Poſſeſſion of <hi>Piemont</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> and no
leſs then five Emperors and four Kings have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from it. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> bears a
Crown faſten'd over his Arms, ever ſince <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lote
de Luſignan</hi> Queen of <hi>Jeruſalem, Cyprus</hi> and
<hi>Armenia,</hi> being driven out of her Kingdom by
her Baſtard Brother, and flying for Refuge to
<hi>Rome</hi> under the Pontificate of <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. where
ſhe died in 1489, bequeath'd all her Pretenſions
to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> in the preſence of the Pope and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Cardinals, to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> her Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew.
Nevertheleſs, he is not addreſs'd to by
the Title of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> but only of <hi>His Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
and <hi>Perpetual Vicar</hi> of the Holy Empire in
<hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> upon a ſtreſs of neceſſity,
may be able to bring into the Field about 30000
Foot, and 5000 Horſe. His fixed Revenue in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32919:100"/>
time of Peace amounts to Six millions fourſcore
and eighteen thouſand Livres of <hi>Piemont.</hi> But
that Livre not being worth above five <hi>French</hi>
Sols, that Sum amounts to no more then to Four
millions five hundred forty three thouſand ſix
hundred Livres of our money.</p>
                     <p>Althô the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> coins Piſtols, Duca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons,
Pieces of Six Sols, and other ſmall Money,
however the Pieces of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> go cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in his Country. The <hi>French</hi> Crowns go
there for-ſeventy two Sols, and the other Pieces
proportionably. But nothing is ſo much talk'd
if in <hi>Piemont</hi> as Florins; which is a chimerical
ſort of money like our Livres of <hi>France,</hi> the
Florin not being worth above twelve Sols, and
the Ducatoon goes in <hi>Piemont</hi> for 84 Sols.</p>
                     <p>As for the manners of the <hi>Savoyards</hi> and <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montois,</hi>
the Nobility are endow'd with all the
Qualities requir'd in Perſons of their Rank.
The People are laborious, and naturally very
affable, good Husbands, ſober, and fit to undergo
any ſort of Hardſhip; but they have no great
inclination to War.</p>
                     <p>The Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> have always appear'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
zealous for the Catholic Religion, which has
often induc'd 'em to make uſe of their Power to
conſtrain their Subjects in the Vallies of <hi>Vaudois</hi>
to return to the Boſom of the Church, from
whence they departed in the laſt Age. The
Duke now reigning is the only perſon that
brought his deſign to paſs, by forcing the moſt
obſtinate in their Religion to leave their Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and to retire into <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
But two years after, in 1689. he recall'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32919:100"/>
'em to ſerve in his War againſt <hi>France,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
'em the free Exerciſe of their Religion.</p>
                     <p>The Government of <hi>Savoy</hi> is purely Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical;
and the Salic Law takes place there as
well as in <hi>France,</hi> for the Daughters never inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the Sovereignty. For want of Male Iſſue,
the Succeſſion appertains to the next of kin to
the Duke, of the Maſculine Line.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Savoy</hi> was erected into a Dukedom by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> in favour of <hi>Amadeus,</hi> the 8th
Count of <hi>Savoy.</hi> Thô the Country be altogether
Mountainous, yet it abounds in very fertile Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys.
The principal Cities in it are <hi>Chamberi,
Nice.</hi> and <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> which are now reduc'd
under the Dominion of <hi>France,</hi> together with all
the reſt of the Province, which is bounded to
the North by the River <hi>Rhine</hi> and the Lake of
<hi>Geneva;</hi> to the Eaſt, by <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Piemont;</hi>
to the South, by the <hi>Dauphinate;</hi> and to the Weſt,
by the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which ſeparates it from <hi>La Breſs</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Piemont</hi> is another Province of the States of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> ſo called from the ſituation of it at the
foot of the <hi>Alpes.</hi> The eldeſt Sons of the Princes
of <hi>Piemont</hi> bear the Title of <hi>Dukes of Piemont.</hi>
This Province is much more fertile then <hi>Savoy;</hi>
being bounded to the Eaſt by <hi>Milanois</hi> and <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat;</hi>
to the South, by the Republic of <hi>Genoa,</hi>
and the County of <hi>Nice;</hi> by <hi>Savoy</hi> and the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinate</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Turin</hi> is not only the Capital City of <hi>Piemont,</hi>
but of all the Duke's Territories, where he alſo
keops his Court. It is ſeated in a fertile Plain,
between the Rivers <hi>Po,</hi> and <hi>Doire.</hi> It is ſecur'd
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32919:101"/>
by a Citadel with five good Baſtions, furniſh'd
with all things neceſſary for the defence of it.
Nevertheleſs the <hi>French</hi> took it, with an Army
far inferior to that of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it. During the Siege, the Spaniards threw
in Powder, Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the aſſiſtance of a
Mortar, invented by a <hi>Fleming,</hi> which for that
reaſon was call'd, <hi>The Courier Cannon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Turin</hi> is adorn'd with an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhopric
and a Univerſity, wherein all Sciences
are profeſs'd, and it boaſts it ſelf to be the firſt
City of <hi>Italy</hi> where Printing was made uſe of.
The chiefeſt Curioſity in <hi>Turin</hi> moſt worthy the
Obſervation of a Traveller is the Citadel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there is a Well to be admir'd for the largeneſs
of it, and the conveniency of watering a great
number of Horſes without any trouble; for
they aſcend one way, and deſcend another.</p>
                     <p>The Ducal Palace is magnificent for the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
of it, as well for the Winter as for the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
Among the Rarities which are ſhewn to
Strangers, there is a Chariot of Maſſie Gold,
having ſix Horſes of the ſame Metal ſpang'd to
it, and enchas'd all over with precious Stones.
There is alſo a little Caſtle of Gold, with Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
and Fortifications of the ſame Metal. There
is beſides an Engin, that carries her Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
from her Chamber to her Baths, with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Pulley, by the favour of a Counterpoiſe, and
that with all the ſafety and eaſe imaginable.</p>
                     <p>The Cathedral Church of <hi>Turin</hi> is very ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
wherein is kept the ſacred Sudary, in which
the Face and part of the Body of our Saviour
are imprinted. They aſſure ye, that is the ſame
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32919:101"/>
wherein the Saviour of the World was ſhrouded
before he was laid in the Sepulchre of <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea,</hi>
and that it was brought into <hi>Savoy</hi> by the
Daughter of <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
who marry'd <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Savoy.</hi> But that which
raiſes a greater Conteſt is this, that they ſhew ye
ſuch another Sudary at <hi>Beſanton,</hi> the Capital of
<hi>Franche Conte.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They whoſe Curioſity leads 'em to ſee the
Tomb of <hi>Clement Marot,</hi> the famous Poet and
<hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> to <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, will find it
at <hi>Turin.</hi> For that having been baniſh'd for his
irregular Life from the Court of <hi>France,</hi> he went
to <hi>Geneva,</hi> from whence he was alſo expell'd for
his looſe Living, and retiring to <hi>Turin,</hi> died in
1544, in the 60th year of his Age. Althô he
underſtood neither <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> nor <hi>Latin,</hi>
nevertheleſs he Tranſlated one part of <hi>David</hi>'s
Pſalms into <hi>French</hi> Verſe, which are ſung by the
Proteſtants at this day, both in <hi>Holland, Germany,</hi>
and <hi>Switzerland.</hi> And notwithſtanding that the
more Learned among them agree, that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
little exactneſs, and that there are many
Verſions much better, both for the Senſe and the
Poetry, yet <hi>Marot</hi>'s are ſtill preferr'd before all
others, perhaps becauſe he was cenſur'd by the
Sorbon in the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt. <hi>Marot</hi>
was born at <hi>Cahors</hi> in <hi>Querci,</hi> and after his
death the following EPITAPH was made

of his Power, and the diſorders of <hi>France,</hi>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:32919:104"/>
the Emperor was ſo far from ſtanding to his
word, that he gave the Inveſtiture to <hi>Philip</hi> the
Second, his own Son; and ever ſince the Kings
of <hi>Spain</hi> have poſſeſs'd that Duchy.</p>
                     <p>It is obſerv'd, that the City of <hi>Milan</hi> has been
beſieg'd 40 times, taken 22; that it has 22 Gates,
including thoſe belonging to the Suburbs; 230
Churches, 96 Pariſhes, and that it is 10 miles in
circuit. It has a Senate, conſiſting of a Preſident
and twelve Senators, of which three muſt be
natural <hi>Spaniards.</hi> There is in it ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Handicraft Tradeſmen, that 'tis common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid, That <hi>Milan</hi> ought to be ruin'd to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
<hi>Italy.</hi> This City is defended by a Caſtle
fortifi'd with ſix Baſtions lin'd with Brick, and
environ'd with Moats of running Waters. There
are three different Incloſures able to make
great Reſiſtance; for which reaſon it is look'd
upon to be one of the beſt Fortreſſes of <hi>Europe.</hi>
It is about a mile in compaſs, containing whole
Streets, wherein all manner of Artificers keep
their ſhops. It alſo includes large Palaces, where
the Officers lodge; and ſeveral Piazza's, in one of
which 6000 men may be drawn up in Battel-array.
There are in it likewiſe four Wells or
Fountains, which are never empty; one Mill,
above 200 Pieces of Cannon mounted upon the
Baſtions, not counting in thoſe which are in the
Arſenal, which is furniſh'd with all manner of
Arms. In one Hall of the Caſtle is to be ſeen
the Cannon that kill'd Marſhal <hi>Crequi</hi> when he
beſieg'd <hi>Breme,</hi> which is laid upon the Ground,
to the end it may never be made uſe of again.</p>

The Cathedral Church, which is call'd the
<hi>Domo,</hi> is the largeſt and moſt ſuperb in all <hi>Italy,</hi>
except St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s in <hi>Rome;</hi> being lin'd with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
within and without, ſuſtain'd with 60 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns
of white Marble, which three men can
hardly fathom, the leaſt of which coſt 1000
Crowns; thoſe of <hi>Adam</hi> and St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>
are the beſt eſteem'd: The whole Church is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
250 Paces long. In St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Church is
to be ſeen a Brazen Serpent, which they would
make you believe to be the ſame that <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted
up in the Deſert; and that the Emperor <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
brought it to <hi>Milan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Strangers go to ſee the Great Hoſpital at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>
conſiderable for the largeneſs and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of it, the conveniency of the Building, and
the good order of the Government. It is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
with a Revenue for the maintenance of
above 4000 Perſons. The Chambers of the Sick
are built in form of a Croſs, with an Altar open
on four ſides in the middle, where the ſick Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
go to ſay Maſs at their going to bed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this Hoſpital, there is another upon the
Moat of the City, wherein there are as many
Chambers as there are Days in the Year.</p>
                     <p>There are to be ſeen at <hi>Milan</hi> the Ruins of
Triumphal Arches, Baths, and other <hi>Roman</hi> Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
and the Church of St. <hi>Lanrence,</hi> built af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Model of the <hi>Roman Pantheon,</hi> was a
Temple dedicated to <hi>Hercules.</hi> In former times
the Emperors were crown'd at <hi>Milan</hi> with an
Iron Crown, and at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
with a Crown of Straw.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:32919:105"/>
The other Cities belonging to this Duchy are
<hi>Coma, Cremona, Tortona, Lodi, Novara, Valencia,
Pavia, &amp;c.</hi> which are all conſiderable in ſome
reſpect or other; but my purpoſe is to ſpeak
of <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Pavia</hi> only, which are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pavia,</hi> regularle fortified, is ſeated in a Plain
upon the River <hi>Tecino.</hi> In the Cathedral is to be
ſeen a ſmall Maſt of a Ship, which the People
believe to be <hi>Rowland</hi>'s Lance, who was Nephew
to <hi>Charlemain.</hi> St, <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s is remarkable for the
Tomb where that Saint lies Enterr'd. In the
Grand Piazza ſtands a Statue of the Emperor
<hi>Conſtantine,</hi> though ſome will rather have it to be
the Statue of the Emperor <hi>Antoninus.</hi> It ſtood
formerly at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> from whence it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
to <hi>Pavia.</hi> And Hiſtory obſerves upon
this Subject, that <hi>Laurec</hi> the <hi>French</hi> General ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken that City by ſtorm in 1527, a Soldier
of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> who enter'd firſt, deſir'd of his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
that Statue for his Reward, to the end he
might ſend it back to <hi>Ravenna.</hi> But the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
being more afflicted with that loſs, then the
loſs of their Eſtates which the Soldiers were juſt
going to plunder from 'em, or the Lives of their
Country-men, made ſuch lamentable Outcries,
that they mov'd the Victor to let 'em have their
Statue for a Crown of Gold, which he engag'd
'em to give the Soldier. The City of <hi>Pavia</hi> is
adorn'd with a Univerſity, founded by <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi>
who, in 734, took the City, and <hi>Didier,</hi>
the laſt King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> Priſoner. In
1525, <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt having laid Siege to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
and ſent a part of his Army to <hi>Naples, Charles</hi>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:32919:106"/>
the Fifth taking advantage of that Diverſion,
gave him Battel, which prov'd ſo fatal to <hi>France,</hi>
that the King was taken Priſoner, and carry'd
into <hi>Spain.</hi> 'Tis obſerv'd, that this happen'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
St. <hi>Matthias</hi>'s day, a day always fortunate to
that Emperor. For he was born upon that day,
and receiv'd the Imperial Crown upon that
day.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Republic of Genoa.</head>
                     <p>THE State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> is a Fief of the Empire
which poſſeſſes that part of the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
Coaſt, which we call <hi>La Riviera di Genoa,</hi>
and which was heretofore the Country of the
ancient <hi>Ligurians.</hi> This Republic carries the
Name of <hi>The Capital City,</hi> which ſome will have
to derive the Name of it from <hi>Janus.</hi> At this day
it is divided into the Weſtern and the Eaſtern
<hi>Riviera;</hi> being bounded by the River <hi>Magro</hi> to
the Eaſt, by the Principality of <hi>Monaco</hi> to the
Weſt, the Mountains of <hi>Piemont</hi> and <hi>Milanois</hi> to
the North, and the <hi>Liguſtic</hi> Sea to the South.</p>
                     <p>The Maritime Force of this Commonwealth
conſiſts in Armed Gallies, and two Men of War
carrying between 60 and 70 Guns apiece, for the
ſecurity of Trade. Upon a caſe of Extremity
they can bring into the Field 30000 Foot. There
are about 69000 Souls in the City of <hi>Genoa,</hi>
80000 in the Eaſtern <hi>Riviera,</hi> and about 113000
in the Weſtern <hi>Riviera.</hi> The Revenues of this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32919:106"/>
Republic amount to 1200000 Crowns, but in
regard the moſt part of it is engag'd for the
Debts of the State, there remains not above
150000 Livres, as I have learnt from the moſt
exact Memoirs drawn up by a Perſon, who by
reaſon of his Employment was perfectly well
acquainted with the Finances of the Republic.</p>
                     <p>The Money ſtamp'd with the Arms of <hi>Spain</hi>
goes currant in the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> when it is
Weight. Nevertheleſs, the Republic coins <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolets,
Genoeſes, Piaſters, Reals,</hi> and ſome other
ſmall Money. The <hi>Spaniſh Piſtole</hi> is worth 17
Livres 16 Sols, which is as much as 3 <hi>Piaſters;</hi>
one <hi>Genoeſe</hi> goes for 3 <hi>Piaſters</hi> and a half. The
<hi>Piaſter</hi> of <hi>Perou,</hi> which weighs a <hi>French</hi> Crown,
is worth 4 Livres 16 Sols: So that a <hi>French</hi> Livre
amounts to 32 Sols of <hi>Genoa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Genoeſes</hi> are very expert in Sea-Affairs,
and have contributed very much toward all the
Enterprizes that have been undertaken for the
Conqueſt of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> In former times they
won from the Infidels the Kingdoms of <hi>Corfu,
Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus;</hi> as alſo the Iſlands of <hi>Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi>
and <hi>Chio;</hi> and have been Maſters of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Coffa</hi> and <hi>Pera.</hi> 'Tis true, that at preſent
they are deſpoil'd of all theſe Countries except
<hi>Corſe,</hi> from whence they have no other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
but that of a Royal Crown affixed over
the Arms of the Republic, and the Title of <hi>Moſt
Serene.</hi> The <hi>Genoeſes</hi> are proud and inconſtant;
of which, the ſundry ſorts of Government which
they have admitted within theſe few years are an
uncontroulable Proof. At preſent they keep
much to the humour of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> even to an
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32919:107"/>
Affection of their Habit. Nor are they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd
by the reſt of the People of <hi>Italy,</hi> among
whom theſe Characters of the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> are very
common. <hi>Gente ſenza Fide, Mare ſenza Peſce,
Monte ſenza Legno, &amp; Donna ſenza Veregogna.
A people without Faith, a Sea without Fiſh, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
without Wood, and Women without Modeſty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Genoeſes</hi> differ from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in this,
that they are much addicted to Trade and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
The Gentlemen drive a Trade in all
manner of Stuffs, which they ſell by Wholeſale;
for they are not permitted to ſell by Retail, nor
to keep Shops. 'Tis a cuſtom in <hi>Genoa,</hi> That
the Parties never ſign the Acts which are paſs'd
before the Public Notary, who by this means
are the Maſters of the Eſtates and Tranquility
of Families. Nor do the Witneſſes ſign their
Depoſitions, neither are they brought Face to
Face with the Parties accus'd. The Nobility
are not to have either directly or indirectly any
private Communication with any Foreign Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
                     <p>When a Stranger arrives at <hi>Genoa,</hi> he is oblig'd
to give in his Name to the Commiſſioners ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
from whom they have leave to remain
four days in the City, without which they would
not be admitted into any Inn. And it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
that if a Man be not very careful to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
this Permiſſion about him, and to renew it in
caſe he intends to ſtay any longer, he is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be ſeiz'd by the <hi>Sbirri,</hi> and condemn'd to
a Forfeiture of 5 Piſtoles.</p>
                     <p>When they proceed to the Election of Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
ſeveral perſons put Money into that which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:32919:107"/>
is call'd the <hi>Seminary,</hi> as into a <hi>Lottery:</hi> And they
who have the good fortune to divine who will
be the five Senators, whoſe Names are firſt
drawn, among a hundred and twenty, out of a
ſmall Box by a little Boy, ſuch is the multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Money at that ſort of Play, that a
Man who has ventur'd 10 Piſtoles, may win be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
7 and 800. Which thô it rarely falls out,
yet the Accident is not without Example.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Genoeſes</hi> wear Fardingales, which is the
reaſon that they frequently embarraſs one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when they meet in the Streets, which are
very narrow. One day, a Lady made uſe of
her Fardingale to get her Son out of Priſon: He
was about 18 years of Age, and was condemn'd
to die. His Mother having leave to viſit him in
order to the taking of her laſt Leave of him,
put him under her Petticoat, which was born
up by a circle of Steel in ſtead of Whalebone,
and two Women leading her as ſhe went along,
according to the cuſtom of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhe got home,
and was deliver'd without the help of a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife,
and the ſame day ſent away her Child as
far as <hi>Marſeilles</hi> to Nurſe. The moſt part of
the Houſes in <hi>Genoa</hi> are built with Terraſſes at
the top, where the Women go to dry their Hair
after they have waſh'd 'em, to make 'em look
yellow.</p>
                     <p>There is no State in <hi>Europe</hi> that has ſubmitted
to ſo many ſorts of Government, as that of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa.</hi>
Not to make an exact Enumeration of 'em,
I ſhall only acquaint ye, That they were firſt
ſubjected to the <hi>Romans,</hi> afterwards to the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi>
and then to the Emperors. 'Tis obſerv'd,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32919:108"/>
that from the year 1454, to 1528, <hi>Genoa</hi> has
been under twelve ſorts of Government. She
has been rul'd by Conſuls, Podeſta's, Captains,
Governors, Lieutenants, Rectors of the People,
Abbots of the People, Reformers, Dukes both
Noble and Popular, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Kings of <hi>France</hi> have been in poſſeſſion
of <hi>Genoa</hi> at ſeveral different times. In 1396,
this City was ſurrender'd to <hi>Charles</hi> VI. and in
1409, the Inhabitants maſſacred the <hi>French,</hi> and
put themſelves under the Marquiſs of <hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi>
Four years after they choſe Dukes. In
1421, they ſubmitted to the Duke of <hi>Milan.</hi>
But in 1436, being weary of that Government,
they made choice of Dukes again, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
'em till 1458, at what time they gave
themſelves into the Hands of <hi>Charles</hi> VII. King
of <hi>France.</hi> In 1461, the <hi>French</hi> were expell'd
to make way for the Popular Dukes, of whom
there were five ſorts in three years. After
which the City ſurrender'd it ſelf to <hi>Francis Forza</hi>
Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> who was expell'd in 1478, after
which they had Dukes till 1488<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then the
Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> took poſſeſſion of it again.</p>
                     <p>Hiſtory informs us, that the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> having
ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. King of <hi>France,</hi>
with Offers to ſurrender themſelves into his
hands; that Monarch, who foreſaw how little
reaſon they had to rely upon the Faith of a
People ſo inconſtant and ſubject to rebel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
'em for Anſwer, <hi>That if they gave their
City to him, he would give it to the Devil.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it were in 1499, <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. took <hi>Genoa</hi>
by Aſſault, and had reſolv'd to ruin it by Fire
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32919:108"/>
and Sword. But the Inhabitants having laid
about four thouſand ſmall Children in the Grand
Piazza that cry'd out for Mercy, The
King touch'd with compaſſion, pardon'd the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in favour of the innocent Children. But
the People growing never the better for it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
in 1506; the <hi>French</hi> retook it in 1507,
and were expell'd again in 1512. The next
year they got poſſeſſion of it once more, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
Maſters of it till 1522, at what time the
City was taken and pillag'd by the Army of
<hi>Charles</hi> V. <hi>Francis</hi> I. reconquer'd it in 1527;
but the next year <hi>Andrew Doria,</hi> a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> who
commanded the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, revolted, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
his King and his own Honour, made uſe
of the Forces of the <hi>French</hi> Crown to deliver
<hi>Genoa</hi> from the Dominion of <hi>France;</hi> and ſince
that time it has been govern'd by a Senate, of
which the chief, who is call'd the <hi>Duke,</hi> is chang'd
every two years.</p>
                     <p>This new Government is Ariſtocratical: The
Duke is aſſiſted with eight Senator-Governors,
and four Procurators; two of which, in their
turns, lodge with him in the Ducal Palace four
months in the year: And this is that which is
call'd the Senate. But the Baſis and Foundation
of the Republic reſides in the Grand Council,
compos'd out of 400 Gentlemen choſen out of
the ancient and new Nobility. This Council
deliberates joyntly with the Duke and the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of whatever concerns Peace or War. There
are alſo two ſorts of Noble Families, which are
diſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nguiſh'd by Antiquity and new Creation;
the number of the firſt is no more then 28, the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32919:109"/>
others are in all 437; and the Duke and the
Senators are choſen alternatively out of theſe
two ſorts of Nobility.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Philip</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and his Succeſſors,
out of a Proſpect purely politic, have inſenſibly
faſten'd the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> to their Intereſts, by bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
vaſt Sums of Money. <hi>Philip</hi> II. bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
two Millions of this Republic, which was
never repay'd: Quite the contrary this Sum has
been ſo multiply'd, as well by new Loans, as by
the Intereſts added to the Principal, that it has
occaſion'd a common Saying, <hi>That the King of</hi>
Spain <hi>holds the</hi> Genoeſes <hi>faſter chain'd to his Yoak,
then if he were in poſſeſſion of the City;</hi> In regard
theſe Republicans muſt be either Slaves to his
Catholic Majeſty, or loſe their Debt.</p>
                     <p>The Duke muſt be at leaſt 50 years of Age
before he can be Elected; and after his two
years Regency, he cannot obtain the ſame Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
till after the expiration of 12 years.
He can admit no Viſits, give no Audiences, open
no Letters that are directed to him, but in the
preſence of the Senators that are lodg'd with
him in his Palace. His Robe of Ceremony is
of Red Velvet or Damask, made after the old
faſhion, ruffled below, with a pointed Cap of
the ſame Stuff with the Robe. When the term
of his Regency is expir'd, which falls out to be
upon the 13th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at 14 a Clock and half
an hour after, he repairs to the Aſſembly of the
Colledges, where the Secretary of the Aſſembly
returns him Thanks in theſe terms: <hi>Voſtra Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita
ha fornito il ſuo tempo, voſtra Eccellenza ſene
vadi a caſa. Your Serenity has compleated your Time,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32919:109"/>
you may return home again.</hi> Which he does at
the ſame time, and being come to his own door,
he returns Thanks to the Senators and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that attended him; which done, he puts off
his Red Robe, and puts on his Senators Gown,
which he wears all the reſt of his Life.</p>
                     <p>Three Days after, they proceed to the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a new Duke, the Dean of the Senators
performing the Function. Preſently the Grand
Council is call'd together, which names Fifteen
Perſons proper for that Dignity: out of theſe
Fifteen the Little Council chuſes Six, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
communicated back to the Grand Council,
they chuſe One, who, nevertheleſs is not Crown'd
till Three Months after, thô ſome have been
Crown'd ſooner; and among others, <hi>Franceſco
Maria Sercaro,</hi> who was Elected, and Crown'd
the ſame day. The Ceremony is perform'd by
the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Genoa</hi> in the Cathedral
Church. Moreover, the Duke and the Senators
are oblig'd to take the Communion twice a year,
at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> and <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Leſſer Council is compos'd of the Duke,
the Senators, the Colledges, and 200 Gentlemen,
none under Seven and twenty years of Age.
This Council is Summon'd together by the ſound
of a Bell; and as every Gentleman enters into
the Chamber, an Uſher in a long Red Robe
preſents him with a little wooden Ball Silver'd
over, which he throws into a Baſon over againſt
the Duke. When all the Noblemen are enter'd,
the Door is ſhut, and the Chancellor counts the
Balls, that he may know the number of thoſe
that compoſe the Aſſembly; and after the Duke
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32919:110"/>
has made known the occaſion of their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
the Suffrages are gather'd after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
A Sub-Chancellor diſtributes to every one
a white Woollen or Linen Ball; and another Sub-Chancellor
gives about a Black Ball; and a Third
preſents 'em with an Urn, which they call a <hi>Pix,</hi>
where are Two Pipes the One for the <hi>Negative,</hi>
the Other for the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> which cloſe together
at the top in ſuch a manner, that the hand of him
that throws in the Ball, covering all the entrance,
it cannot be diſcern'd into which Pipe he puts in
the Black or the White. It is alſo to be obſerv'd,
that the Decrees of this Council muſt be render'd
Authentick by a Hunderd thirty four Voices at
leaſt, which are Two Thirds of the Two hundred.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Council is compos'd of the Duke,
the Senate, and all the Colledges, the leſſer
Council, and all the Nobility of the City. It is
ſummon'd together after the ſame manner as the
Leſſer Council, and the Duke alſo Declares
the occaſion of their coming. It is then chiefly
call'd together when any Law is to be aboliſh'd,
or any new ones to be made; or when <hi>Plebean</hi>
is to be admitted into the Nobility; or for the
laying new Taxes or Impoſitions. In ſhort, in
this Aſſembly it is that all the Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the State reſides. But theſe Matters
are all prepar'd in the Leſſer Council, before
they are propos'd in the Grand ones.</p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Genoa,</hi> adorn'd with an Arch-Biſhoprick,
is the Capital City of the State; Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd
the <hi>Superb,</hi> as well by reaſon of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
of the Inhabitants, as the Magnificence of
the Buildings; being ſeated by the Sea ſide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32919:110"/>
the Aſcent of a Hill, in the Form of an Amphi-Theater.
It is ſurrounded with good Walls
on that ſide next the Land, and well fortify'd in
all parts where it lies liable to be attackt. It
is about Six <hi>Italian</hi> Miles in Circuit, but the
Streets are very narrow and dark, by reaſon of
the height of the Houſes. Four Gates belong
to it, a great number of Magnificent Palaces,
and a good Harbor, tho' the entrance into it
be ſomewhat difficult, by reaſon of ſeveral
Rocks that lye round about it under water. It
is defended by a Mole which the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> built
ſince they revolted from <hi>France.</hi> At the end of
the Mole ſtands a <hi>Phanal,</hi> fot the direction of
Ships that Sail along the Coaſt in the night time;
and by the ſituation of the Lanthorn, they in
the City underſtand what Courſe the Veſſels
ſteer, which they perceive. This <hi>Phanal</hi> is
built in that part where <hi>Lewis</hi> XII K. of <hi>France</hi>
built a Fort to bridle the City.</p>
                     <p>There is to be ſeen in <hi>Genoa</hi> an Aquaeduct,
which carries the Water from one to the other
end of the City, and which ſupplies an infinite
number of Fountains; ſome of which furniſh the
Veſſels before they put to Sea, with freſh Water.
If they who Sail from <hi>Genoa</hi> to <hi>Legorne</hi> ſhould
happen to want Water, they will meet with a
Spring of freſh Water in the middle of the Golph
<hi>de l'Eſprece,</hi> that bubbles up through the Salt
Water, to the ſurface of the Sea, and ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
its ſweetneſs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Domo</hi> (for ſo are all the Cathedrals
call'd in <hi>Italy)</hi> is conſecrated to <hi>St. Laurence.</hi>
It is all lin'd without ſide with Black and White
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:32919:111"/>
Marble, having Three Doors in the Front, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd
with fair Columns of Marble. The Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
within-ſide alſo, is exactly correſpondent to
the out-ſide Imbelliſhments. But they who are
deſirous to ſee the Reliques, are oblig'd under a
forfeiture, to leave their Weapons at the Door.
An Iron Gate with Four Locks opens into the
Treaſury, of which, the Senators keep the
Keys. Among other things, they ſhew ye a
Diſh all of one Emrauld, which they would make
ye believe was preſented to <hi>Solomon</hi> by the
Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> made uſe of it
at his laſt Supper with his Diſciples; adding
withal, that when <hi>Antioch</hi> was taken, the <hi>Genoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
made choice of it for their ſhare of the Booty.
Nevertheleſs, ſome Authors ſay, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> Eat
the Paſchal Lamb in a Silver Diſh, as <hi>Richard
Laſſels</hi> the Famous <hi>Engliſh</hi> Traveller has obſerv'd.
Moreover, they will have the Aſhes of <hi>John</hi> the
<hi>Baptiſt</hi> to be preſerv'd in this Cathedral.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo other very fair Churches in
<hi>Genoa,</hi> of which I forbear to ſay any thing, for
fear of Prolixity; I ſhall alſo ſay nothing of the
Palaces, of which there are almoſt as many as
there are Houſes. Which Magnificence has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
this Remark, that the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> are the
Richeſt Private Perſons in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the pooreſt
State, and that the People took as much care of
their Private Eſtates, as the <hi>Venetians</hi> of their
Republick. But of all the Palaces, Prince
<hi>Doria</hi>'s is, without all contradiction, the moſt
Superb. For among other Rooms, there is in it
a long Gallery pav'd with Black and White
Marble, Sixſcore Paces long, and Six and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:32919:111"/>
Broad, from whence you may behold all the
Veſſels and Ships that enter the Port of <hi>Genoa.</hi>
The Apartments are ſo richly furniſh'd, that a
Governor of <hi>Milan,</hi> not being able to believe
that they could all belong to <hi>Doria,</hi> told the
Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was to take Shipping at
<hi>Genoa,</hi> that She ſhould Lodge in one of the moſt
Noble Palaces of the World, but that the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
Furniture, was borrow'd out of all the
moſt wealthy Houſes in the City.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Doria</hi> being told of this, before the Queens
arrival, caus'd to be Engrav'd upon the Gate of
his Palace, <hi>By the Grace of God and the King, the
Whole belongs to the Maſter of the Houſe.</hi> In his
Garden is to be ſeen a large Statue of a Giant,
under which is to be read the Epitaph of a Dog,
that while he liv'd, had Five hundred Crowns
a year allow'd him for his Maintenance.</p>
                     <p>There are few States of <hi>Europe</hi> where the
Civil Policy is better eſtabliſh'd then at <hi>Genoa.</hi>
There are certain Magiſtrates who are call'd the
Magiſtrates <hi>of Abundance,</hi> whoſe Care it is to ſee
that the City be provided with Corn, Meal, Wine
and Oil for a whole Year (how Dear ſoever it
be) beſides what comes daily to the Market,
and to regulate and ſet the price of Proviſion,
according to the Fertility or Scarcity of the
Year. And to prevent miſ-management, there
are in all the Quarters of the City, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
near the Courts of Judicature, certain
Holes in the Wall, into which all People have
the liberty to throw in Accuſations againſt
thoſe whom they ſuſpect to have miſ-manag'd
themſelves in their Imployments or Commiſſions;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:32919:112"/>
and ſometimes without any other Conviction it
happens to be the misfortune of an innocent
Perſon to be puniſh'd.</p>
                     <p>I muſt not conclude this Chapter, without
ſpeaking a word of that which gave the occaſion
to the Bombing of <hi>Genoa</hi> in 1684. by the <hi>French</hi>
Fleet.</p>
                     <p>The King having make ſeveral complaints to
this Republick, by Mr. <hi>S. Olon,</hi> his Envoy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
of the proceeding of this City, in
oppoſition to the Intereſts of that Crown, and
the injuries done his Subjects, that Miniſter
could obtain no reaſonable ſatisfaction. In the
Second place, his Majeſty demanded of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
free paſſage by Land through their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
for his Salt to <hi>Cazal,</hi> and that he might
erect a Magazine at <hi>Savona,</hi> of which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
of <hi>Genoa</hi> had one Key, to ſecure 'em
from any ſuſpition that it was vended in the
City of <hi>Savona;</hi> which the Republick refuſed;
and not ſo contented, they made a private
Treaty with <hi>Spain</hi> againſt <hi>France,</hi> by which the
Republick oblig'd themſelves to maintain Four
thouſand Men in the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> which
were to be rais'd in the name of the Count <hi>de
Melgar,</hi> and at the charges of the Republick;
As alſo to add Six more Gallies to the Six al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
prepar'd, to joyn with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet.
The moſt Chriſtian King therefore, inform'd
of their Deſign, commanded his Miniſter to
know their Reaſon, and offer'd at the ſame time
his Mediation, or his Forces if they had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:32919:112"/>
But the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> were ſo far from accepting
the King's Propoſals, that they return'd haughty
and ambiguous Anſwers, which enforc'd the King
to ſend a Fleet thither, to the end, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of it might ſcare 'em into their Duty.
To that purpoſe M. <hi>de Signeley,</hi> Miniſter and
Secretary of State, who was aboard the Fleet,
being arriv'd in the Port of <hi>Genoa,</hi> ſent for ſome
of the Senators, to whom he made known the
Cauſes of Reſentment which the Republick had
given the King, and that he was come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Satisfaction: that in the mean time they
might prevent the miſchief that threaten'd 'em,
if they unrigg'd the four new Gallies that were
already fitted for Sea, and ſent to <hi>Paris</hi> four Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators
to excuſe their Miſcarriages to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.
But they refuſed to accept of this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
and were ſo bold as to let fly firſt of all
upon the King's Gallies, which had not as yet
committed any Act of Hoſtility; which drew
upon 'em a ſhower of Bombs for ſome days,
that ruin'd a good part of their Palaces.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo ſome reaſon to believe, that the
King would not have ſtopp'd there, had not the
<hi>Genoeſes</hi> beſought Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. to intercede
with his Majeſty in their behalf, offering to
give his Majeſty ſuch ſatisfaction as he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
The King therefore, conſented to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
which was Mediated by <hi>Ranuccio,</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Fano,</hi> his Holineſs's Nuncio, with M.

                     <p>They arriv'd the 10th of <hi>April</hi> at <hi>Lions,</hi> and
the 18th at <hi>Paris;</hi> where the Duke ſpent about five
and twenty days in preparing his Equipage, and
the 4th of <hi>May</hi> had his Audience of the King
at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> to which he was conducted by
<hi>M. Bonnueil</hi> Introductor of Embaſſadors. Some
days before, he had caus'd the Nails that faſten'd
the Cloath of State of his Coach to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
as being a diſtinction that belongs to none
but Royal Perſons, and Sovereign Princes. The
King was ſeated upon a Throne rais'd ten or
twelve ſteps at the end of the Great Gallery.
The King had on each ſide of him, the <hi>Dauphin,</hi>
Monſieur the King's Brother, the Duke of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Main,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louze,</hi>

uncover'd.</p>
                     <p>The Duke made an elegant Harangue which
I ſhall inſert at the end of the Chapter. Which
done, the Senators alſo made their Compliments,
and it was obſerv'd that the Duke was uncover'd
all the while the Senators ſpoke. The Audience
being over, they were Treated at Dinner by the
King's Order with all the Profuſion and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
imaginable; and after Dinner reſuming
their Ceremonial Habits, which they put off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Anjou, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur,
Madame,</hi> and all the Princes and Princeſſes
of the Royal Family. And it was obſervable
that the Senators did not cover till they came to
the Duke of <hi>Chartres</hi>'s Apartment. They return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Evening to <hi>Paris,</hi> but the 18th and 23d
they went back to <hi>Verſailles</hi> in the Habit of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
to view the Apartments, the Water-works,
the place where the great Horſes are

The 26th the Duke and three Senators, <hi>Salvago</hi>

Veneration for this great Crown, which being

                     <p>THE Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> is a Vaſſal to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
See; to which he pays a Tribute of Ten
Thouſand Crowns for his Dutchies of <hi>Parma</hi> and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:32919:116"/>
                        <hi>Piacenza.</hi> This State has undergone ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
ſince the Decay of the Empire, till the
Church being in peaceable Poſſeſſion of it, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
Farneze</hi> being advanc'd to the Pontificate,
under the name of <hi>Paul</hi> III. erected <hi>Parma</hi> into
a Dukedom, and gave it his Son <hi>Peter Farneze,</hi>
in the year 1545. But the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
the Poſſeſſion of it with him, till the death
of the ſaid Duke, who died Two years after.
However, <hi>Octavio Farneze</hi> his Son, being pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
protected by the King of <hi>France,</hi> ſecur'd
that State to his Succeſſors, by the Marriage of
<hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> natural Daughter of the
ſame Emperor.</p>
                     <p>The Country adjoyning is very Ferril in Corn,
Wine, Fruit, but more eſpecially in Cheeſe, the
excellency of which is ſufficiently known. 'Tis
ſufficient to ſay that they make ſome of theſe
Cheeſes that weigh a Hundred and fifty pound,
and that they are eſteem'd for ſo great Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
among the <hi>Turks,</hi> that they are uſually ſerv'd
up to the Great <hi>Turk</hi> and his <hi>Viſiers</hi> at their Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets.
There are likewiſe ſeveral Wells of Salt
Water in the adjacent parts, out of which they
draw White Salt; and ſome Iron and Copper
Mines.</p>
                     <p>The Revenue of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> amounts
to Five hundred thouſand <hi>Roman</hi> Crowns a year,
which make Seventeen hundred and fifty Livres of
<hi>France;</hi> and at a pinch of neceſſity, he is able
to bring into the Field Eighteen thouſand Foot
of his own Subjects.</p>

The City of <hi>Parma,</hi> Capital of the Dntchy,
and where the Duke keeps his Court, is divided
into three Parts by the River <hi>Parma,</hi> over which
are built Three Bridges that joyn the whole to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
It is adorn'd with a Biſhoprick, under
the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Bologna,</hi> and a Famous Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
Founded in the year 1599, by <hi>Ranuccio
Farneze.</hi> The Citadel conſiſting of Five Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is one of the ſtrongeſt and beſt fortifi'd in
<hi>Italy.</hi> Foreigners always viſit the Dukes Palace,
which is a moſt Magnificent Structure, wherein
there was no ſpare made of Marble, Jaſper or
Porphyrie. The Gardens belonging to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
and the Cathedral Church, are the Rarities
which next the Palace are worthy Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Piacenza</hi> is the Second City in the Duke of
<hi>Parma</hi>'s Territories; bearing the Title of a
a Dutchy, with a Biſhoprick Suffragan to <hi>Bologna.</hi>
'Tis thought that it deriv'd the name of it from
the Situation, which is in a Plain extreamly Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.
It ſtands not far from the River <hi>Po,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about Five Miles in circuit. Near the City
to the Weſt, they ſhew ye the Place where
<hi>St. Anthony</hi> call'd down Fire from Heaven upon
the Soldiers that derided his Name. Thô what
is more conſiderable, is the Fountain in the
great Piazza of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> caus'd
to be brought to the City; and the Statue of
<hi>Alexander Farneze</hi> the Firſt, a Horſeback, in
Braſs.</p>

                        <hi>MOdenois,</hi> or the State of <hi>Medena,</hi> lies to the
Eaſt of <hi>Parma.</hi> It was erected into a
Dukedom by the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> III. in 1452.
in favour of <hi>Borſo d'Eſte.</hi> The Country abounds
with Plenty of all things. As for the Dutchy
it ſelf, it holds of the Emperor, to whom the
Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> pays a yearly Tribute of 4000
Crowns. The Revenue of it amounts to about
a Million of <hi>Italian</hi> Livres, which make Seven
hundred and fifty thouſand Livres of <hi>France:</hi>
and in a time of Need, the Duke is able to
Arm Five and twenty thouſand Men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Modena</hi> the Capital of the Dutchy, is the uſual
Reſidence of the Duke. It is ſeated between
the Rivers of <hi>Sechia</hi> and <hi>Panaro;</hi> and altho the
Streets are ſomewhat narrow, yet it is a very
pleaſant Habitation. Foreigners go to ſee the
Duke's and the Biſhop's Palaces, the Cathedral
and the Citadel, where there is nothing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
very remarkable. Hiſtory informs us, that
<hi>Modena</hi> was formerly a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, and that
after the death of <hi>Julius Caeſar, Brutus</hi> was there
in vain Beſieg'd by <hi>Marc Antonie,</hi> in the year of
<hi>Rome 710.</hi> That the City was afterwards ruin'd
by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> and rebuilt under the
Reign of the Sons <hi>Charlemain:</hi> and that it was
near <hi>Modena,</hi> that in the year of <hi>Rome 711, Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
and <hi>Panſa</hi> were defeated by <hi>Marc Antonie.</hi>
The Steeple of <hi>Modena</hi> is one of the Higheſt
Towers in <hi>Italy.</hi>

                     <p>THE Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> holds the Fee of his
Territories from the Emperor, by whom
he is inveſted. <hi>Mantua</hi> was formerly no more
then a Marquiſate, till by <hi>Charles</hi> V. erected into
a Dukedom in 1530. The Duke in preſent Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
is of the Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Gonzaga,</hi>
He aſſumes the Titles of Duke of <hi>Mantua, Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat</hi>
and <hi>Guaſtalla,</hi> Perpetual Vicar of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Country is ſeated between the
Territories of the <hi>Church,</hi> the States of <hi>Modena,
Venice</hi> and <hi>Milancis,</hi> in length about Fifty Miles,
and Forty broad. The <hi>Po</hi> that runs through it,
makes it one of the moſt fertile Countries in
<hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially in Corn; ſeeing that one good
Harveſt is ſufficient to ſupply the Inhabitants for
Five Years. 'Tis true, that by reaſon of the Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the <hi>Po,</hi> the Wine's a little Green and
Sowre.</p>
                     <p>His Highneſs may be able to bring into the
Field, an Army of Twelve thouſand Foot, and
Eight hundred Horſe, and his Revenue amounts
to 300000 Crowns a Year, the chiefeſt part of
which is raiſed either by his Mills, or upon the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who give conſiderable Sums for liberty of
Free Trade; but they are oblig'd to wear Yellow
Ribonds in their Hats, to diſtinguiſh 'em from
the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                     </p>

The City of <hi>Mantua</hi> is the Metropolis of the
Dutchy. It is ſeated in a Lake Twenty Miles
in compaſs, that fills the River <hi>Mincius,</hi> ſo that
there is no way to approach it, but over two
Cauſeys, with two Draw-Bridges at the ends.
Upon this Lake, there are a prodigious quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Mills; and it is remarkable that there are
Three in one Houſe that ſerve to Spin, Wind,
Double and Twiſt Silk, which are manag'd by
one ſingle Man.</p>
                     <p>This City is very Ancient: The Poets <hi>Virgil</hi>
and <hi>Faſs</hi> were both born in <hi>Mantua;</hi> nor is it
leſs remarkable for the Manufacture of Tab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,
and other rich Silks. The Streets are broad,
Straight, and very neat. It contains about Four
miles in compaſs, having Eight Gates, Eighteen
Pariſhes, Forty Convents, and one particular
Quarter for the <hi>Jews.</hi> There is the ſame Cuſtom
obſerv'd here as in moſt of the other Cities of <hi>Italy;</hi>
that is, that at your entrance into the City you
are oblig'd to leave your Fire Arms at the Gate,
which are return'd to you again upon your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
at the Gate, which you go forth at.
But you muſt be careful to mark 'em that you
may know 'em again.</p>
                     <p>Travellers take great delight to viſit the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,
the Town-houſe, the Cathedral, the
Roof of which is all over Gold and Azure, but
more eſpecially the Duke's Palace, which without
Queſtion is the faireſt Ornament of the City:
Nor is it without good reaſon, that this Palace
is ſaid to be able to lodge five Kings with all
their Retinue; there being no leſs then five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty Chambers in it richly furniſh'd
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:32919:118"/>
every one (though formerly there were ſeven
hundred. The Apartments deſign'd for the
Lodging of Princes, Embaſſadors, and Cardinals,
are proportionable in Magnificence to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of the Perſon that is to be entertain'd in 'em.
There are Beds embroider'd with Gold and
Pearls, Silk Tapeſtries emboſs'd with Gold. Six
Tables about three foot long, of which the one
is all compos'd of Emraulds ſo well joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that you would ſwear it to be all one ſtone,
as well as the reſt, which are one compos'd of
Turquoiſes, a third of Violet Saphirs, one of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and another of Jaſper. There is alſo to be
ſeen a Noble Organ of Alabaſter; After which I
think it needleſs to give a deſcription of the Gold,
Silver and pretious Stones that gliſter in all the
Cabinets, nor of the Silver, Braſs, and Marble
Statues that adorn the Chambers and the Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
for there is no queſtion but that every
thing elſe is correſpondent to the Magnificence
of the Palace, and the Grandeur of the Prince
who is the Lord of it. Give me leave to ſay this
by the by, that there are Harneſſes for Horſes
all cover'd with Pearls and Diamonds, a great
number of Arms enrich'd in the ſame manner:
Chalices of Gold, Croſſes Baſons and other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of the Chappels belonging to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
of the ſame Houſe, all enrich'd with Pearls,
Rubies, Emraulds and other pretious Stones. To
which I ſhall add, that all this Wealth was much
more conſiderable before the Palace was pillag'd
by the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand the Second</hi>'s Forces,
under the Conduct of <hi>Colalto;</hi> who made himſelf
Maſter of it in 1630. at what time the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:32919:119"/>
of the Soldiers, not being ſatiated with the
Plunder, was ſuch, that they broke and ſpoil'd
an infinite number of Statues, and rare pieces of
Workmanſhip.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VII. Of the State and Republick of Venice.</head>
                     <p>WE call the State of <hi>Venice</hi> the whole Extent
of Territory that the Republick poſſeſſes
in <hi>Italy,</hi> which was part of the lower <hi>Lombardy.
Venice</hi> is likewiſe Miſtreſs of <hi>Iſtria, Dalmatia,</hi>
the <hi>Morea,</hi> and part of the Iſlands of the <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago.</hi>
This Republick is the only Sovereign
State in <hi>Italy,</hi> the reſt being Feudataries either
to the Church or to the Empire. The Air of
<hi>Venice</hi> is not wholſome, as being annoy'd byt he
ſtench of the Canalls, which together with the
little Society that Strangers find there for the
reaſons which I ſhall hereafter mention, is the
occaſion that Travellers care not to reſide long
in the City, when they have once ſeen the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities
that beautifie it.</p>
                     <p>This Republick is addreſt to by the Title of
<hi>moſt Serene,</hi> as being the moſt Potent State of
<hi>Italy.</hi> The Revenue of it amounts to about Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Millions; and the City of <hi>Venice</hi> alone pays
about Two Millions and Five hundred Thouſand
Ducats; nor is it leſs true that ſhe alone contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:32919:119"/>
as much as all the demeans which ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes
upon the firm Land. She is very ſparing,
and lays up vaſtly in time of Peace, of which,
her famous Treaſury of <hi>St. Mark</hi> is an undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Proof.</p>
                     <p>In a time of need, ſhe is able to ſet out to Sea
Two hundred ſail of Ships and Gallies, and to
Arm 400000 of her own Subjects. In times of
Peace ſhe always keeps Forty Gallies in pay, to
clear the <hi>Golph</hi> of the Pyrates of <hi>Barbary.</hi> When
the Republick is at War with the <hi>Turk,</hi> ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
makes uſe of Foreign Forces, which ſhe
hires out of <hi>Germany</hi> and other places; reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her own Subjects to People her Cities and
her Conqueſts; which nevertheleſs does no way
diminiſh her Treaſure, for that the Money which
ſhe lays out, is all ſpent again in her own Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories.</p>
                     <p>Almoſt all the Money currant in <hi>Italy</hi> goes at
<hi>Venice,</hi> proportionably to their weight and Alloy.
Nevertheleſs the Republick Coins Piſtols, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins,
Ducats, Crowns, Pieces of Twenty four Sols,
Twenty Sols, and Gazettes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Sequin is
worth Seventeen Livres or Two Ducats; the
Piſtole Eight and twenty Livres; the Ducatoon
Six Livres Four Sols; the Crown Nine Livres,
Twelve Sols, and the Gazette, Two Sols. The
Ducatoon is not worth above Fifty <hi>French</hi> Sols;
and between Forty Eight and Fifty Sols of <hi>Venice,</hi>
make a Livre of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis not without reaſon that <hi>Venice</hi> is counted
one of the richeſt Cities in the World, in regard
it was never yet taken or plunder'd by her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
which makes it a common Saying, <hi>That
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:32919:120"/>
'tis as impoſſible that Money ſhould be wanting in the
Treaſury of</hi> St. Mark, <hi>as Soldiers in</hi> France.</p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Venice</hi> is the Metropolis of the
whole State: and I have already ſaid that ſhe is
very potent, and I may add, That if ſhe had but
plenty of Freſh Water, ſhe would want nothing.
But that defect proceeds from her being built
upon Seventy two Fenny Iſlands. Moſt Authors
agree, that <hi>Venice</hi> was Founded in the year 421. of
Chriſt; to which others more preciſely add,
That the Building was begun upon the <hi>25th</hi> of
<hi>March;</hi> which day is principally obſerv'd, for
that it was the day when the World was Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and of the Incarnation of Chriſt. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Padua</hi> were they who Founded this
City, at what time <hi>Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Hunns,</hi>
after he had laid <hi>Aquileia</hi> in Aſhes, undertook
to ſubdue and ruine all <hi>Italy.</hi> His Cruelties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd
the <hi>Paduans</hi> and other People that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
between the <hi>Alps</hi> and the <hi>Golph,</hi> now call'd
<hi>The Golph of Venice,</hi> to ſhelter themſelves in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unwholſome Fenns. And in the year 421.
they began to build ſome Houſes in the Iſland of
<hi>Rialto,</hi> which was proclaim'd to be the Place of
Sancturay and Refuge; and ſo in proceſs of time
thoſe Buildings multiply'd in ſuch a manner,
that <hi>Venice</hi> now takes in Seventy two Iſlands,
joyn'd together with 450 Bridges: and becauſe
the Soil would not admit of any ſolid Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they built upon Piles, as they do at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
in <hi>Holland.</hi> The Bridge of <hi>Rialto,</hi> over the
Great <hi>Canal,</hi> is the moſt beautiful in <hi>Venice,</hi> and
indeed in all <hi>Europe.</hi> It has but one Arch, all
of Marble, built upon 6328 Piles, and border'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:32919:120"/>
with two rows of Shops. The ſituation of the
City in this manner, is the reaſon that there is
no uſe of Coaches in <hi>Venice,</hi> ſo that when they
goe from one place to another, they take Water
in Shallops or Boats call'd <hi>Gondola</hi>'s, with which
the <hi>Canals</hi> are cover'd. The <hi>Canals</hi> and the
Bridges are Lin'd with a White ſhining Stone,
and in regard the Women are handſome, and
the Gown-men very ſevere, this has occaſion'd a
Proverb, which admoniſhes <hi>Travellers to have a
care of the Women, the White Stones, and the
Men of the long Robe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At firſt the Government of <hi>Venice</hi> was Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical,
under Conſuls and Tribunes. Every
Iſland had their particular Conſuls, that aſſum'd
to themſelves a Petty Sovereignty. But the
Jealouſies that aroſe among 'em, were the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that in the year 709. the Tribunes of the
Twelve Principal Iſlands, reſolv'd to ſet up a
Republick, and to elect a Chieftain to Command
'em; and firſt of all they caſt their Eyes upon
<hi>Paolo Lucio Anafeſto,</hi> to whom they gave the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Duke or Doge. This Firſt Duke and his
Succeſſors Rul'd with Abſolute Authority till the
year 1172. becauſe that in their Life time they
caus'd their Sons or their Brothers to be choſen
to ſucceed 'em; and went about in that manner
to perpetuate the Ducal Dignity in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
But the Principal Citizens aboliſh'd the
Election which was made till then by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and ſet up an Independent and Sovereign
Council, out of which they elected their Duke.
This Tribunal was compos'd of 240 Citizens,
indifferently choſen out of the Nobility, the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:32919:121"/>
Burgeſſes and Artificers; and at the ſame
time they created Twelve Tribunes,, who were
to oppoſe the Decrees of the Prince, if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to be unjuſt. This Form of Government
laſted till the year 1289. at what time Duke <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Gradenigo</hi> chang'd it into a Real Ariſtocracy,
ſuch as it is at this day; all the Authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
devolv'd into the hands of a certain number
of Families, writ down in a Golden Book, which
is the Regiſter of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility.</p>
                     <p>There are four different Councils in <hi>Venice;</hi>
the firſt which is called the Grand Council, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of 2000 Noblemen; out of which they
chooſe all the Magiſtrates, Podeſta's, Generals
of their Armies, Proveditors, Ambaſſadors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and they make all the Laws which are deem'd
neceſſary for the Welfare of the State. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is call'd the Council of <hi>Pregati,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines
all things that relate to Peace or War,
Alliances or Leagues; and this is that which we
call the Senate of <hi>Venice.</hi> The third is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
call'd the Colledge, compos'd of 26 Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that gives Audience to Ambaſſadors, and
carries their Demands to the Senate. The fourth
is the Council of Ten, which judges all Crimes
againſt the State, and is the moſt redoubted
Council in <hi>Europe.</hi> This Council is renew'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Year. This Council every Month chooſes
three Inquiſitors of State, who are always taken
out of the Ten, to the end that every one may
ſerve in his Turn, and the Authority of this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate
is ſuch, that they have as much Power
over the Duke's Life, as over the Life of the
meaneſt Subject, without acquainting the Senate.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:32919:121"/>
This Council has cavs'd ſeveral Heads of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be plac'd againſt the Walls of the Palace
with gaping Mouths, upon which theſe words
are to be read, <hi>Secret Denunciations,</hi> into which
they who have any accuſation againſt any Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
or other perſon holding Criminal Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence,
throw in little Notes. And upon
theſe Accuſations it is, and ſometimes upon the
leaſt ſuſpicion that they put People to Death,
who are ſometimes guilty of no other Crime
then not to pleaſe their Enemies. For ſuch is
the Policy of <hi>Venice</hi> rather to take away the
Lives of the Innocent, then to let the Guilty go
unpuniſh'd. We muſt not forget that all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
when they betake themſelves to the
Church, are excluded from all their Councils,
and from all Employments in the State to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> from having any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Secrets of the State.</p>
                     <p>As to Spirituals, <hi>Venice</hi> is govern'd by a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,
who by a particular Rubrick, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his Commands and Orders never ſets
any other Titles, than N. <hi>divina miſericordia Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiarum
Patriarcha,</hi> without ever adding, like
the Prelates of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, <hi>Et Sanctae
ſedis Apoſtolicae gratia,</hi> as if he were no Member
of it. He is Primate of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and Metropolitan
of the Archbiſhopricks of <hi>Candy</hi> and <hi>Corfu. Venice</hi>
has alſo another Patriarch within her Territories,
that is to ſay, the Patriarch of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
at <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dena</hi> in <hi>Friuli,</hi> And in regard the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Aquileia</hi> now belongs to the Emperour, he
pretends to have a Right to appoint the Patriarch.
But the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to the end the Patriarchate may
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:32919:122"/>
never become vacant, have empowr'd the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
to nominate a Coadjutor and Succeſſor, ſo
ſoon as he is advanc'd to that Dignity, which
the Senate preſently confirms, if they deem him
worthy of it.</p>
                     <p>The Employment of Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> is for life,
and generally they chooſe to that Dignity an Old
Man, who has been Ambaſſador in the principal
Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and who is perfectly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Forreign Countries. He cannot ſtir out
of the <hi>Laguna</hi> without leave, and can do nothing
without the Advice of his Counſellors which are
allotted him, choſen out of the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Gentlemen of the Republick. When the
Duke gives his Opinion in the Senate, he has but
one Voice; but his ſuffrage goes for two in the
Grand Council. The Duke is clad in a Purple
Robe with hanging Sleeves; and when he parades
upon any publick Ceremony, he walks under a
Canopy of Cloth of Gold, eight Silver Trumpets
marching before him, and a Youth carrying a
Torch of white Wax; a Sword is alſo carried
before him as a mark of his dependency. All
Declarations and Letters of State are written in
his Name, and the Money is alſo ſtamp'd with
his Portraiture, though there is always on the
Reverſe a Lyon and the Image of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> with
the Duke kneeling before him.</p>
                     <p>The Duke is Elected after the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
The Grand Council being aſſembl'd at the
hour prefix'd, the Door is ſhut; and after they
have counted the number of thoſe in the Hall,
they throw into a Baſon an equal number of little
Balls, among which there are thirty guilt; and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:32919:122"/>
when they are well jumbl'd and mix'd, every
Gentleman goes and takes one. Then the Thirty
that have the Golden Balls, aſſemble together in
another Room, where there are ready prepar'd
as many little Balls, of which there are but
Nine guilt. Theſe Nine Gentlemen whoſe chance
it is to light upon the Nine guilt Balls, chooſe
out forty Gentlemen of the Aſſembly, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are reduc'd to Twelve by means of the guilt
Balls; and thoſe Twelve elect Five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which are reduc'd to Nine. Thoſe Nine
chooſe out Forty five, who are reduced at length
to Eleven, who chooſe out One and forty Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and they Elect the Duke. This Tedious
Ballating prevents the Effects of Canvoſſing.
Now when theſe Electors are approv'd by the
Grand Council, they are ſhut up in the Palace of
St, <hi>Mark,</hi> out of which they never ſtir till they
have Elected the Duke. And it is to be obſerv'd,
that though the Election be authentick, it muſt
be corroborated by Five and twenty Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
and while the Electors are thus ſhut up,
they are carefully guarded, and diligently lookt
after, almoſt in the ſame manner as the Cardinals
in the Conclave.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility is diſtinguiſh'd into four
Claſſes: The firſt comprehends the Families de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from the Tribunes, who in the Year
709. were the Electors of the firſt Duke of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
and which have continu'd by a kind of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
to this preſent time. Thoſe Twelve Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Families are the <hi>Contarini,</hi> the <hi>Moroſini, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douari,
Ziopoli, Micheli, Sanudi, Gradenighi, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onni,
Falieri, Dandoli, Polani,</hi> and <hi>Barozzi.</hi>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:32919:123"/>
There are alſo other four Noble Families that
have continu'd in a Lineal Succeſſion ever ſince
the Year 800, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Juſtiniani, Cornari,
Bragadini</hi> and <hi>Bembi.</hi> For which reaſon the
firſt are vulgarly call'd the Twelve Apoſtles,
and the latter the four Evangeliſts. The ſecond
Claſſis of Noblemen, are they that began to be
enregiſter'd in the Golden Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when <hi>Grade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigo</hi>
the Duke ſettled the Ariſtocracy in 1289.
The third comprehends about fourſcore and ten
or a hundred Families, who purchas'd their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
for a Thouſand Ducats apiece. Theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
are never employ'd in the high Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Republick. The fourth Order of
Nobility is that which the Republick confers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Forreign Princes and other Illuſtrious Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages.
Thus <hi>Hen.</hi> III. and <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. of <hi>France</hi>
were admitted into the Body of the Nobility of
<hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> walk the Streets in a
long Black Robe, and a Bonnet of black Tiſſue,
border'd with a Fringe that hangs round about,
and falls down over their Hair; for they are not
ſuffer'd to wear Perriwigs; their Gowns are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
before, and diſcover a rich Caſſock; their
Shooes are all of black <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Leather; and for
their Gate and Aire, they are very Grave and
Majeſtick. But this Nobility of theirs deprives
'em of the freedom of converſing with Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
Nor will their Jealouſie of all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
permit 'em ſo much as to give Strangers a
Viſit, or to pay the leaſt Civility to Ambaſſadors,
their Wives, nor any other perſon belonging to
their Retinue, without expreſs leave from the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32919:123"/>
Senate. Nor dare they ſpeak to a <hi>Venetian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
if he be known to frequent a Forreign
Miniſter's Houſe.</p>
                     <p>Having thus diſcours'd of the Government,
both Politick and Eccleſiaſtick of <hi>Venice,</hi> I ſhall
only ſpeak one word of what is moſt worthy
the Curious Obſervation of Travellers. If they
happen to be there at the Feſtival of the Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they will ſee the Ceremony, which is annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
perform'd upon that Day, of the Duke's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſing
the Sea. At what time the Duke and
the Senators in their Purple Robes, accompanied
by the Patriarch, the Pope's Nuncio, and the
Ambaſſadors go aboard the <hi>Bucentaure,</hi> which is
a ſort of Galley with ſeveral Decks, guilded
down to the Water, and cover'd with Crimſon
Velvet with broad Gold Fringes; and attended
by all the Nobility and the People in four or five
Thouſand Gondola's and other Veſſels, rows for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
within a Mile of the Main Sea. And then
it is that the Duke Eſpouſes the Golf of the
<hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, in Teſtimony that the Republick
is the Miſtreſs of it. The Ceremony of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſal
is perform'd by caſting a Gold Ring into
the Sea, and ſaying theſe words, <hi>We Eſpouſe
Thee our Sea, as a Mark of real and perpetual Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority.</hi>
After which the Patriarch gives his
Benediction, accompanied with the roaring of
the Canon. Thence they go to hear Maſs upon
the <hi>Lido,</hi> and ſo return to the Palace, where the
Duke treats all the Senators and Great Lords.
<hi>Alexander</hi> III. inſtituted this Ceremony as a
Mark of Gratitude to the Republick, who had
ſo ſtrenuouſly upheld him againſt the Proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:32919:124"/>
of the Emperour <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa.</hi> But
it is an Errour to believe upon the Credit of
ſome Hiſtorians, ill inform'd, that the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
of <hi>Venice</hi> held the Soveraignty of the <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick,</hi>
by Donation from that Pope; for beſides
that it was never diſputed with the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
the Holy See never had, nor ever pretended to
any Right over the <hi>Adriatick;</hi> ſo that that ſame
Pontiff could never beſtow upon the Republick
a thing that never was in his power to give.
And there needs no more then to read the Pope's
own words to the Duke <hi>Ziani,</hi> while he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
the Republick's Right, and inſtituted the
Ceremony of Eſpouſing the Sea. <hi>Receive</hi> (ſaid
he) <hi>this Ring, to give it every Year upon the ſame
Day to the Sea, as to your lawful Spouſe, ſo that your
Poſterity may know that the Sea belongs to You by
Right of Arms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Cathedral Church was formerly dedicated
to St. <hi>Theodore;</hi> but after the Body of St. <hi>Mark</hi>
was brought thither from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the City
made choice of that Saint for her Patron, and
the Church is Conſecrated under his Name; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the moſt Beautiful Edifices in the
World; and what is more ſurprizing is, that
ſuch a weighty Bulk ſhould have no other Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
then Piles. The Tower which ſerves for
a Steeple, is one of the higheſt in <hi>Italy.</hi> The
Church is built of nothing elſe but Marble of all
Colours, the fineſt in all <hi>Italy;</hi> and the Floor is
pav'd with Jaſper and Porphyrie wrought in
<hi>Moſaick</hi> work. The chief Altar is ſuſtain'd by four
large Pillars, upon which in Releif you ſee engrav'd
the Hiſtory of the Old and New Teſtament;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:32919:124"/>
and over it ſtands a Globe of Gold and Silver,
enrich'd with Pearles and Diamonds. The Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of the Holy Sacrament is ſupported by four
Columns of Alablaſter, which, as they ſay, had
been Pillars in the Temple of <hi>Solomon.</hi> The
Church divided into five Domes, is cover'd with
Lead, and has four Braſs Gates; over the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
of which ſtand four Horſes of the ſame
Mettal guilt, made formerly on purpoſe for the
Triumphal Arch erected at <hi>Rome</hi> in Honour of
<hi>Nero,</hi> after he had vanquiſh'd the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and
afterwards carry'd to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to adorn
<hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Triumphal Arch, and afterwards
brought away by the <hi>Venetians</hi> when they ſack'd
that great City. This wonderful Structure is
ſupported by thirty ſix Columns of Marble two
foot in Diameter: and the aſcent to the Steeple
which is 246 Foot high, and 40 broad, is ſo made
as to be very eaſie, and without Stairs.</p>
                     <p>The Treaſury of this Church encloſes a vaſt
heap of immenſe Riches. Among other things
Twelve Regal Crowns, and Twelve Corſlets of
Maſſie Gold, enrich'd with Pearls and Diamonds.
Ten Rubies of eight Ounces each. One Saphir
of ten Ounces: A Veſſel all of one ſingle Emrauld:
A Diſh of one ſingle Turquoiſe: A Pail to take
up water, the whole but one Granate: The
Duke's horned Bonnet ſet with large Diamonds
and Oriental Pearls, with an infinite number of
other coſtly Rarities: not to ſpeak of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of the Church, as a great number of
Pixe, Candleſticks, Silver and Chryſtal, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with an infinite number of Relicks, among
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:32919:125"/>
which the chiefeſt are the Body of St. <hi>Mark</hi> and
his Goſpel, written by his own hand.</p>
                     <p>They who have a mind to viſit St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s
Church, may there ſee <hi>Peter Aretimes</hi> Tomb,
who liv'd in the Fifteenth Age, famous for his
Satyrical Writings, which acquir'd him Preſents
and Penſions from ſeveral great Men, and among
others from <hi>Charles</hi> V. and <hi>Francis</hi> I. King of
<hi>France;</hi> whither they fear'd his Satyrs, or lik'd

                     <p>The Palace of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s is admir'd by all
Forreigners. It has two Fronts, lin'd with red
and white Marble, and cover'd with Plates of
Braſs, ſince the Conflagration in 1514. which
melted down the Lead with which it was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid
before. There is nothing but Gold and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure
to be ſeen in all the Apartments, with an
infinite number of very fair Statues, all curious
pieces of Workmanſhip. The Grand Council-Chamber
is 150 Foot long, and 73 broad, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with other Chambers full of Fire Arms;
of which the greateſt part are always charg'd.
Among others are to be ſeen the Arms which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:32919:125"/>
                        <hi>Henry</hi> IV. made uſe of to reduce his Kingdom to
Obedience, and which he preſented to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
One Piece of Canon and the Carriage all
of Maſſie Silver: A Coffer, at the opening of
which four Piſtols diſcharge, and would kill the
Perſon that opens it if they were charg'd: A
large Canon that diſcharges thrice at one time;
and a ſmall Piece that diſcharges ſeven times at
once. In this Armory there are Muskets, Pikes
and Swords to arm a Thouſand Men in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
for the ſecurity of the Senate: And all
things are diſpos'd in ſuch a manner, that by
pulling a Cord at one end, the Arms fall into
the Hands of thoſe that have occaſion for 'em.
The Muskets are always charg'd; and they who
are poſſeſſed of 'em, as they go out of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
will find a large Globe boar'd thorough
with as many holes as there are Muskets, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of which there ſticks a Match ready to
be drawn out lighted; in regard that by means
of an Engin, and the Powder which is ſcatter'd
in thoſe Concavities, they can ſet fire to all thoſe
Matches in a Moment.</p>
                     <p>The Piazza of St. <hi>Mark</hi> is environ'd with beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Houſes, of which the Symmetry is very
gracefully order'd. The Mint is one of the
faireſt, and ſo built, that there is no danger of
Fire, becauſe that all the Gates and Windows
are of Iron, and for that there is no Wood made
uſe of in the whole Structure. In the midſt of
the Piazza, three large Maſts of a Ship are fix'd
upright in the Ground, upon which the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick's
Standards of Gold and Silk are hung out
upon ſolemn days, and at the end toward the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:32919:126"/>
Sea ſide, ſtand two Marble Pillars all of one
piece about ſixty fathom high, and eight in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs;
upon one of which is erected St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s
winged Lyon, and upon the other the Statue of
St. <hi>Theodore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Arſenal</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> is one of the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and one of the beſt ſupply'd with all ſorts
of Arms of any in <hi>Europe.</hi> There they ſhew to
the Curious the Arms of <hi>Bajamonte Theopoli,</hi> who
at the Head of Eight Ragamuffins had reſolv'd
to murder the Senate in the Council Chamber,
and to have ſeiz'd upon the Soveraignty. They
carry'd all their Weapons conceal'd under their
Cloaths: But as they were haſtning to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
a Flower-pot fell out of a Window upon
the Head of their Captain, and beat out his
Brains; which ſo diſmay'd the reſt of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices,
that believing their deſign diſcover'd,
they all diſpers'd, and the Senate by that means
eſcap'd. They alſo ſhew ye the Sword of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg,</hi>
Prince of <hi>Albania,</hi> who won no leſs
then ſeven Battels from the <hi>Turks,</hi> with which he
cleft a Man quite through at one blow. There
is alſo a great number of other Arms and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
very curious, and among the reſt a Coffer,
which they call the <hi>Devils Organs,</hi> becauſe that
if you open it, it diſcharges ſeveral Piſtols, that
ſcattering their Shot about the Room, make a
great havock of all that are in it.</p>
                     <p>After you have ſeen the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers

But in regard I do not undertake to write the
Hiſtory of <hi>Venice,</hi> I forbear to ſpeak of all the
Places which that Republick poſſeſſes in <hi>Italy.</hi> I
ſhall therefore only ſay ſomething of <hi>Padua</hi> which
is one of the Ancienteſt Cities in the <hi>Venetian</hi>
Territories, being about 2300 Paces in Circuit.
'Tis ſaid, that <hi>Antenor</hi> was the Founder of it, and
that it is much more ancient then either <hi>Rome</hi> or
<hi>Venice.</hi> The Church of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Lisbonne</hi>
is famous, becauſe that St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> now call'd
St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi> lies there interr'd: And
they ſay, that the Stone that covers his Tomb,
ſmells of Musk: However certain it is, that 'tis
the moſt beautiful Church in the City. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
where Juſtice is adminiſter'd, is cover'd
with Lead, and there is an Aſcent of four large
Marble Steps up to it. The Great Hall is 256
Foot long, and 86 broad, where are to be ſeen
the Twelve Celeſtial Signs and great number of
other very Beautiful Paintings. Every Night at
a certain hour they make the Great Clock ſtrike
32 times, in memory of ſo many Traytors who
would have deliver'd up the City into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
hands. <hi>Padua</hi> ſtill retains ſeveral Footſteps
of Antiquity, as the Remains of an Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
call'd the <hi>Arenae,</hi> near the <hi>Auſtin</hi> Fryars
Church.</p>
                     <p>And the Ruines of ſuch another are alſo to be
ſeen at <hi>Veronas</hi> another City under the Dominion
of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> but there is much more of the
Structure ſtanding, which is ſaid to have been
erected by order of the Conſul <hi>Flaminius,</hi> 380
Foot in length, and 200 broad. There is alſo a
Circus where above Fourſcore Thouſand People
may ſit upon Seats of Marble.</p>

                        <hi>L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CA</hi> is a ſmall Republican State almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd
within the Territories of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
preſerv'd its Freedom ever ſince the Year
1430, under the Protection of the Emperour.
This Republick is govern'd by a <hi>Gonfaloniere,</hi>
who is Elected every two Months out of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and has for his Aſſiſtants nine Ancients,
who bear the Title of Excellentiſſimo's. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they can determine nothing that is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
in the Grand Conncil, compos'd of 120
Burgeſſes. Though the Extent of the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
belonging to this Republick be very ſmall,
yet they are very well Peopl'd; ſo that they can
eaſily bring 20000 Men into the Field to defend
themſelves, beſides that their Revenue amounts
to above 500000 Livres a Year. Their Arſenals
are always provided with all things neceſſary to
hold out a long Siege. The Gonfaloniere, who
during his Regency lodges in the Palace of
the Signiory, and has a hundred Soldiers for his
Guard, is clad in a Robe of Crimſon Velvet or
Damask, with a Bonnet of the ſame Stuff. Nor
are there but few States wherein the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

The City of <hi>Luca,</hi> the Metropolis of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory
is ſeated upon the River <hi>Serchio,</hi> defended
by eleven Baſtions lin'd with Brick, and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

that ſecure it, Several Silk Stuffs are made
in this City, wherein the Inhabitants drive a
very great Trade, which has acquir'd to the

                     </p>
                     <p>The Churches are very beautiful, eſpecially
the Cathedral Conſecrated to St. <hi>Martin,</hi> where
they ſhew a Picture, upon which they would
make ye believe that the Angels painted our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Face. It is Crown'd with a Crown of
Gold, having over it the two Letters <hi>Alpha</hi> and
<hi>Omega;</hi> that is to ſay, the Beginning and the

<hi>Auſtin</hi>-Fryars Church they ſhew ye a kind of an
Abyſs, which as they ſay, open'd to ſwallow up
a Gameſter that Blaſphem'd the Name of his

                     <p>The Territories of the Republick of St. <hi>Marino</hi>

<hi>Luca,</hi> becauſe they include only the City of

                     <p>The City of <hi>Sancto Marino</hi> is very ſtrong, not
only by reaſon of the ſituation of it, which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the top of a Mountain in the Dutchy of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin,</hi>
but alſo becauſe of the Fortifications, which
are very regular, and certain Caſtles that defend
it. The Name of it was deriv'd from one <hi>Sancto
Marino,</hi> a Stone-Cutter, born in <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> who
coming into <hi>Italy</hi> in the Third Age, and being
addicted to Piety, preach'd the Goſpel to the
<hi>Pagans,</hi> and Converted ſeveral to the Faith. He
Dy'd in a kind of Hermitage where he had his
Oratory upon the top of the Mountain where
now the City of <hi>Sancto Marino</hi> ſtands.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IX. Of TUSCANY.</head>
                     <p>THE State of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> Is purely Monarchical
and Deſpotick. It is compos'd of three
Eſtates, which were formerly as many Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks;
the <hi>Florentin, Piſan</hi> and <hi>Sieneſe,</hi> which
derive their Names from their Capital City,
where the Grand Duke has built good Citadels.
This is one of the moſt conſiderable States of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and wants nothing but the Title of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which a Pope of that Family had a deſign
once to have conferr'd upon it. In the mean time
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:32919:128"/>
according to the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, the Grand Duke
wants nothing but <hi>Luca</hi> and <hi>Sarzana</hi> to be King
of <hi>Tuſcany.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Prince is one of the Richeſt in <hi>Italy:</hi> his
ordinary Revenue amounts to two Millions and
a half of Crowns, and 'tis ſaid that he has above
Five and Twenty Millions of Gold in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,
beſides his Moveables and Jewels which
are of an Ineſtimable value. He is able to bring
into the Field 30000 Foot, and 3000 Horſe;
and as to his ſtrength by Sea, in a caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
he can ſet out Twenty Men of War, a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
Galleys, and ſome Galeaſſes.</p>
                     <p>As to the Money, <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Piſtoles, Piaſters
and Reals of <hi>Peru</hi> go currant all over the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
provided they be weight. The Money
which the Grand Duke Coyns are Piſtoles, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoons,
Julio's and Gratie. The Piſtole of <hi>Spain</hi>
goes for Forty two Livres of the Country; but
the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Piſtole goes but for Forty. A Duca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toon
is worth ſeven Livres. A Julio is worth
eight Gratie, which is a ſmall piece of Money,
part Copper, part Silver. A Livre is worth a
Julio and a half, and every Gratia is worth Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Deneers of <hi>France;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Livre
is not worth above Eleven <hi>French</hi> Sols.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Florence</hi> is the Metropolis of the Dukedom,
with an Archbiſhobprick Erected in the Year
1421. by Pope <hi>Martin</hi> V. Surnam'd <hi>the Fair,</hi>
becauſe that without all contradiction it ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in Beauty and Magnificence all the Cities
round about it; to which the ſituation of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
not a little, being built upon the River
<hi>Arno,</hi> which divides it into two unequal parts,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:32919:129"/>
joyn'd together by Four Stone Bridges; and it is
about Six Miles in circuit, with very neat Streets
and well kept. Some Authors will have <hi>Sylla</hi>'s
Soldiers to be the Founders of <hi>Florence,</hi> to whom
he gave the Land as a Reward of their Services:
That it was at firſt call'd <hi>Fluentia,</hi> by reaſon of
the Confluence of the Rivers <hi>Arno</hi> and the <hi>Main,</hi>
but that the Fertility of the Soil gave it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Name of <hi>Florentia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ordinary Reſidence of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s
Court contributes not a little to the Magnificence
of it. For aſſuredly the Grand Duke's Palace
deſerves to be the Manſion of an Emperour. It
is adorn'd with Statues of Marble and Braſs
much more noble then are to be found in any
other place. The Painting, Sculpture and Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appear to be the Effects of Profuſion. And
therefore not to engage in an exact deſcription of
this Palace, I ſhall only take notice of ſome Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the moſt Magnificent.</p>
                     <p>There is to be ſeen a Candleſtick or Luſter all
of Amber; a Domo of Mother of Pearl, and
Gold Enamell'd with red; a Table where you
ſee the City and Harbour of <hi>Leghorn,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by ſeveral Stones of Jaſper, Marble, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis
Lazuli, Topazes and Emraulds moſt artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
enchas'd; another Table of Calcedon Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell'd
with Flowers, Empal'd with Agates, Lapis
Lazuli, and Emraulds, ſupported with Enamel'd
Pillars: a Cabinet of Jet Inlay'd with ſeveral
Gold Plates, with Seven Doors where as many
Organs play; and withinſide the Paſſion of our
Saviour figur'd in Marble: A Loadſtone that
ſuſtains about Sixty pound weight of Iron, but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:32919:129"/>
it has loſt much of the Vertue of it ſince the laſt
Fire that happen'd in the Palace. A Nail half
Iron half Gold, which was thought to be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Chimical Operation, but ſome years
ſince it was found out that the two Metals were
only ſoder'd together, but ſo imperceptibly, that
it was not poſſible to be diſcern'd: An Agate
Table, a Statue of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. on Horſeback of
Maſſie Gold; an entire Service of Maſſie Gold
Plate; and a prodigious quantity of Silver Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel'd
Plate. In ſhort all the Apartments of the
Palace, and the Equipage of the Grand Duke
are proportionable to this Immenſe Treaſure.</p>
                     <p>Nor are theſe the only Rarities which this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
encloſes, the only Objects worthy a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
Curioſity. The Gallery wherein are the
Portraitures of the Family of the <hi>Medicis,</hi> and of
all the Famous Men of this Age, as well for
Learning as for Arms, delightfully allures a
Travellers Eye for ſome Hours, The Great
Captains are plac'd upon the Right Hand, among
whom is <hi>Hannibal</hi> the Terrour of <hi>Rome; Scipio</hi>
who took <hi>Carthage</hi> and vanquiſh'd <hi>Hannibal:
Pyrrhus</hi> who rejoyc'd <hi>Rome</hi> by declaring War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> the Scourge of the <hi>Turks.
Alexander Farneze,</hi> who never loſt a Battel. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſius,</hi>
who diſcover'd the Streight of <hi>Magellan.
Andrew Doria,</hi> who recover'd <hi>Genoa</hi> from the
<hi>French. Gaſton de Foix,</hi> whoſe Memory is ſtill
Terrible to the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Duke <hi>d' Alva,</hi> who
though Bloody and Cruel perform'd many great
Exploits, and who lamented at his Death not the
Miſchiefs he had committed, but that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fought againſt the <hi>Turks. Cuſtruccio,</hi> of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:32919:130"/>
whom no Body ever ſpoke ill. <hi>Eccellino,</hi> of whom
no body ever ſpoke any thing that was good;
and <hi>Madam de Momorancy,</hi> who was well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to die in a Battel againſt the Religionaries
of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In an Armory adjoyning are to be ſeen ſeveral
curious Arms: A Harquebuſe, the Barrel of
which is Gold, and which carries much farther
then a Barrel of Iron: A Piſtol which is call'd
the <hi>Good Night,</hi> that diſcharges five times with
once pulling the Trigger. Alſo another with
Ten Barrels, that diſcharges as many times at
once.</p>
                     <p>In one of the Cabinets ſtands a Mirrour, into
which if a Man looks, he ſeems to be a Woman;
and if a Woman looks into it, ſhe ſeems to be a
Man. I forgot to tell ye, that among the Grand
Duke's Jewels, there is a Diamond as thick as a
Man's Finger, that weighs a Hundred thirty
eight Carrats, and is lookt upon to be one of
the faireſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> being valued at 150000
Crowns.</p>
                     <p>The Church of St. <hi>Mary</hi> of the <hi>Flowre,</hi> is the
Cathedral of <hi>Florence.</hi> It is lin'd without-ſide
with great ſquare Panes of Marble, White, Red
and Black intermix'd. The Inſide is anſwerable
to the Outſide, and the Steeple is of Marble
though of a prodigious heigth.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Laurence</hi>'s alſo is a very Beautiful Church;
but that which renders it more remarkable, is
the Chappel wherein the Dukes of <hi>Florence</hi> lie
Buried. This Chappel is built all of Marble, lin'd
with Jaſper, Alablaſter, and other rare Stones, ſo
well poliſh'd and wrought, that the Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:32919:130"/>
is more eſteem'd then the Materials. The
Vault is lin'd with Lapis Lazuli of <hi>Perſia,</hi> which
is a Pretious Stone of a Blue Colour interlac'd
with Veins of Gold, and which perfectly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the Colour of the Skie in a clear and ſerene
Seaſon. Round about this Chappel are plac'd
the Statues of all the Dukes of <hi>Florence,</hi> all of
Copper guilded in their Ducal Habits; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Tombs one of the Cities of the State
of <hi>Florence,</hi> which takes up the whole void ſpace.
In a word the Magnificence of that Mauſoleum
is ſo great that 'tis enough to make thoſe who
are wrapt up with the Pride and Vanity of this
World wiſh for Death, if they might be aſſur'd of
ſuch Glorious Monuments after their Deceaſe.</p>
                     <p>Having thus view'd the Magnificence of the
Palace and Mauſoleums of the Great Duke, we
come to the Curioſities of the City; where there
are to be ſeen upon the Bridge that leads to the
Grand Piazza, four Statues of White Marble
repreſenting the four Seaſons; and in the Piazza
ſtands a Braſs Statue upon a Pedeſtal of the ſame
Metal, repreſenting <hi>Como de Medicis,</hi> the firſt
Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> together with his moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Exploits, in Relief. This Piazza lies
before the old Palace, on both ſides of which
are to be ſeen the Statues of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hercules.</hi>
To this Palace belongs a Tower which is a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and Fifty Fathom high, without any other
Foundations then thoſe of the Palace it ſelf,
which gave an occaſion to the ſaying of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi>
that they have one Tower in the Air,
another in the Water, meaning the Pharo of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorn,</hi>
and another in the Earth, which is the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:32919:131"/>
Steeple of <hi>Florence.</hi> Near the River is to be ſeen
a large Column, upon which is plac'd the Statue
of Juſtice in Porphyrie; upon which the Criticks
have made two Burleſque Remarks; the one is
that Juſtice is plac'd ſo high, that the poor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reach it; the other is, that ſhe turns her
Back to thoſe places where Juſtice is uſually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter'd.</p>
                     <p>It would be a great overſight not to viſit the
Houſes of pleaſure belonging to the Grand Duke,
of which the moſt conſiderable are <hi>Poggio Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riale,
Pratolino,</hi> aad <hi>Lampeggio;</hi> where the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
the Alleys, the Labyrinths, Grotto's, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terworks,
and whatever can make any place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful,
are in their higheſt perfection. Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
are often trickt near <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Grotto in the
Garden of <hi>Pratolino.</hi> For before they come at
it, they are led a great way about; ſo that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Seats that are not far off, they are
willing to ſit down and reſt themſelves: But no
ſooner are they ſate down, but the pillars of the
Seat giving way to the weight of their Bodies,
out flies the Water all of a ſndden, and waſhes
'em from Head to Foot.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Siena,</hi> with an Archbiſhoprick and a Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
was formerly much more conſiderable then
now it is, as having once contain'd above ſeventy
five thouſand Inhabitants, whereas now there are
not above Four and twenty Thouſand in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The Streets are broad and all pav'd with
Brick. Formerly the <hi>Sienois,</hi> who had a great
many Children were exempted from all manner
of Impoſitions, in regard they had ſupply'd the
Republick with ſeveral Members; and they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:32919:131"/>
who had no Children bare the Burthen of the
Taxes.</p>
                     <p>The Cathedral is pav'd with ſpotted Marble,
upon which is engrav'd the Sacrifice of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and ſeveral other Hiſtories of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Roof is all of Azure, ſpangl'd with
Stars of Gold: There are alſo to be ſeen the
Marble Statues of ſeveral Popes and Emperors,
together with Twelve Angels of Braſs, every
one holding a Wax Taper in their hands. The
Piazza of <hi>Siena</hi> is round, and the Houſes built
exactly according to the Rules of Symmetry,
ſupported by Arches like thoſe in the Royal
Piazza in <hi>Paris,</hi> where you may walk Winter and
Summer without being annoy'd either by Rain,
or Sunſhine. The middle of the Piazza is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
like a Scallop Shell, and may be fill'd
with Water from a Fountain adjoyning, for the
Lanching of ſeveral Shallops into it, wherewith
to imitate a Naval Engagement. And near to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Gate, upon two high Pillars, ſtands a
Wolf giving ſuck to <hi>Rhemus</hi> and <hi>Romulus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But is <hi>Siena</hi> has loſt her ancient Splendour,
<hi>Piſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> is no leſs unfortunate. For ſhe was once the
moſt potent City of all <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> as having been
Miſtreſs of the Iſlands of <hi>Corſe</hi> and <hi>Sardigna,</hi> as
alſo of the City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> at what time above
50 Gallies might have been ſeen in her Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
all belonging to her; but now ſhe is no
longer remarkable for any thing elſe but her
Archbiſhopprick, her Univerſity, and the Houſe
of the Knights of St. <hi>Stephen;</hi> where ſeveral
who prefer Celibacy before a Marry'd Life, are
maintain'd at the Charges of the Order. They
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:32919:132"/>
wear a Croſs of Red Sattin upon their Habits;
and in St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Church are to be ſeen ſeveral
Flags, Ship-Lanthorns and Colours taken from
the <hi>Turks</hi> by thoſe Knights.</p>
                     <p>The Steeple of the Domo is admir'd for the
height of it, becauſe it ſeems to lean on one ſide,
though in the judgment of skilful Workmen, it
ſtands as upright as it is poſſible. This Church
is ſupported by Seventy ſix Columns of
Marble of all Colours, and has three Gates of
Braſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they ſay belong'd to the Temple
of <hi>Salomon.</hi> The Great Piazza is call'd <hi>Campo
Santo,</hi> by reaſon it was fill'd up with a vaſt
quantity of earth which the Galleys brought
from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in 1224.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Livorno</hi> or <hi>Ligorno.</hi> is a Sea-port Town with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Territories of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> of which the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is accounted one of the ſafeſt and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
on that ſide, Now in regard the City
is but new built, the Streets are large and ſtreight,
and the Houſes very convenient, Here it is that
the Duke's Galleys and Men of War lie. The
Pharos, or Tower of <hi>Livorn</hi> is lookt upon to be
one of the moſt beautiful, and moſt neceſſary in
all <hi>Italy.</hi> One of the moſt Remarkable. Things
in this City is the Marble Statue of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> I.
having under his Feet four Slaves of Braſs, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion
to the four <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Slaves who ſeiz'd one
Night upon a Galley, with a deſign to have made
their Eſcapes into <hi>Barbary,</hi> but were taken in the
Act. Some ſay 'twas the Father and his Three
Sons who came on purpoſe from <hi>Turkey</hi> by the
<hi>Sultan</hi>'s Order, to have Maſſaker'd the Grand
Duke; but that their Deſign being diſcover'd,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:32919:132"/>
they were taken and puniſh'd according to their
Deſerts.</p>

                     <p>THIS State is called the Eccleſiaſtical State,
becauſe the Pope is both the Spiritual and
Temporal Sovereign of it. It is compos'd of
Twelve Provinces; <hi>La Campagna di Roma,</hi>
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Patrimony, La Terra Sabina, Ombria,</hi>

                     <p>The Pope is able to bring into the Field an
Army of 50000 Foot and 10000 Horſe, and
ought to have Twelve Galleys for the ſecurity of
his Coaſts. The Revenues of the Holy See, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to about Two Millions of God. But the
Popes have a bleſſed and eaſie way to augment
it when they pleaſe; and therefore <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV.
had good reaſon to ſay, that he could never
want Money ſo long as he had a Hand and a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:32919:133"/>
Pen. This eaſie way of filling the Apoſtolick
Treaſuries with Money, has been the cauſe ſeveral
Popes not having Children of their own to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich,
as <hi>Paul</hi> III. had, have ſolely apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to raiſe the Fortunes of their Nephews.
<hi>Paul</hi> V. left the Prince of <hi>Salmone,</hi> his Nephew,
a Revenue of a Thouſand Crowns a Day. And
others have done well for Theirs, proportionably
to the Times that they enjoy'd the Papal Chair;
and by this means it was that the Number of
Petty Princes multiply'd ſo greatly in <hi>Italy.</hi>

at 31: Three Giulio's make a Teſton; the Giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio
is worth 5 Baioques, and one Baioque worth
5 Quatrini. One Baioque is worth 8 Deneers
of <hi>France,</hi> the Giulio 3 Sols 4 Deneers; ſo that

the Juriſdiction of the Holy See, yet is it lookt
upon at <hi>Rome,</hi> rather as a Siſter then a Subject;
in regard that by voluntarily ſurrendring her ſelf
to the Church, ſhe has preſerv'd to her ſelf the
freedom of ſending Ambaſſadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> from
whence ſhe has Coadjurors; which is a kind of

ſeems to lean on one ſide, like that of <hi>Piſa;</hi>

                     <p>There are an infinite number of Country Seats
in the parts adjacent to <hi>Bologna,</hi> but that of the
Senator <hi>Volta</hi> ſurpaſſes all the reſt in Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
There is an Inſcription there to be ſeen,
which has puzzl'd the moſt Learned Wits of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:32919:134"/>
Nations, For my part, I cannot aſpire to
that Excellency; and therefore I ſhall only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here the Interpretations of others. This E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmatick
Inſcription is in Latin, and 'tis ſaid to
have been made by a perſon that was neither
Man nor Woman, nor Hermaphrodite; that ſhe
Dy'd neither of Hunger, nor Thirſt, nor by the
Sword, nor by Poyſon, yet by all together;
That ſhe was neither in the Water, nor in the
Air, nor in the Earth, but in all at once; and
that this Inſcription was made by <hi>Lycus Agatho
Priſcus,</hi> who was neither her Husband, nor her
Gallant, nor her Kinſman, but all three at one
time. Many People have thought they could
expound this Riddle; Some ſaying that it was
Rain Water; Another <hi>Materia Prima;</hi> Another
Chymical Mercury; And a Fourth aſcrib'd it to
Love.</p>
                     <p>Since my Remarques have not led me out of
<hi>Bologna,</hi> I cannot leave it without obſerving,
that there is frequently ſeen in the Parts adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the City, a certain Meteor, toward the
<hi>Appennine</hi> Mountain, when the weather is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
and dark, which is a Light almoſt as round
as a Globe, by the Country People, call'd
<hi>Bocca d'Inferno,</hi> the <hi>Mouth of Hell,</hi> becauſe it has
ſo fall'n out, that Traveliers, having loſt their
way in the Night, and following this Light at
a diſtance, have been led into Precipices.</p>

                        <hi>Ancona</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Marca d'Ancona,</hi> is
one of the ſtrongeſt places in the Eccleſiaſtical
State, where the Magazines are always abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
Stor'd with all things neceſſary for the
defence of it. The Harbor was formerly in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:32919:134"/>
great requeſt, inſomuch that it was a Proverb,
<hi>Porto d'Ancona, Torre di Cremona, e Petro di Roma;</hi>
The Port of <hi>Ancona;</hi> The Tower of <hi>Cremona;</hi>
And <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Port was formerly
lin'd with Marble, and the Ships were Moor'd
to Pillars of Marble, ſet up all along the Haven
at a certain diſtance one from the other. But
Time and the Wars have ruin'd the greateſt
part, and the Trade is gone off to other places.
However, it ſtill preſerves a very fair Triumphal
Arch, which the <hi>Romans</hi> erected in Honor of
the Emperor <hi>Trajan.</hi>

                        <hi>Loretto</hi> is another City of <hi>Marca d'Ancona,</hi>
Built upon a Hill, and well Fortify'd. This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
has been Famous for ſome Ages, as being the
Repoſitory of the Chamber where the Holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
conceiv'd the Divine Word. This Chamber
is about Four Fathom long, Two Broad, and as
many in heighth. It is built of a Stone inclining
to a Red colour, reſembling Brick, but much
bigger and harder. There is alſo a little Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
againſt one of the Walls on the Right ſide,
with an old Cupboard, where they ſtill preſerve
ſome Earthen Platters and Diſhes, which being
found there when the Building was remov'd,
make People believe that it was the Plate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> was ſerv'd. Some years
ſince they made a Silver Door to the Cupboard;
and at the end of the Chamber is a Window,
through whch the Angel enter'd when he brought
her the Myſterious Tidings of the Incarnation.
There is alſo the Portraicture of our Saviour,
and of the Happy Virgin, which they would
have the World believe was Drawn by <hi>St.
Luke.</hi>

This Chamber is now inclos'd within a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of the Church of <hi>Loretio,</hi> conſecrated to the
<hi>Holy Virgin;</hi> and by the help of a Candle you
may perceive that this Chamber ſtands upon no
Foundation. There is a World of Riches in
that Church, which has often tempted the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
of <hi>Barbary</hi> to try whither they could be ſo
fortunate as carry it away, but without any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
Among the reſt of the Wealth, for it
would be too tedious to give an Inventory of it
all, there is to be ſeen two Crowns and a Dolphin
of Maſſy Gold, which <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> Queen
of <hi>France,</hi> gave that Church upon the Birth of
<hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. an infinite number of Crowns,
Lamps, Gold and Silver Candleſticks ſet with
precious Stones. In the Treaſury of the
Church are to be ſeen ſeveral ſumptuous Altar-Services;
and among others, one made of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal;
Candleſticks, Crevets, a Baſon and Eure,
and the Foot of a Chalice, all of Amber. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Service of Agate, another of Chryſtal of
the Rock; another of Engrav'd or Carv'd Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
I forbear to mention any more, that I may
have room to ſay ſomething of the miraculous
removal of this Chamber.</p>
                     <p>The Story is Engrav'd upon the Pillars of the
Great Church in Thirteen ſorts of Languages,
for the Information of Pilgrims; by which they
are given to underſtand, That the <hi>Turks</hi> having
begun to invade the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> GOD, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that the Place where his Son receiv'd his
Incarnation, ſhould be polluted by the Infidels,
ordered the Angels to take this poor Domicil,
and carry it the 9th of <hi>May 1291.</hi> from <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi>

or as others ſay, into <hi>Slavonia:</hi> That Three or
Four years after it was remov'd by thoſe Bleſſed
Spirits into the Dioceſs of <hi>Reconati</hi> in <hi>Marca

Lady, whoſe Name was <hi>Loretta;</hi> but that the

remov'd halfe a League from thence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

where this Magnificent and Wealthy Church

In the Province of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria,</hi> near a place call'd
<hi>Terni,</hi> there is a wonderful ſort of Earth, which
in a time of Drowth, turns into Mudd, and in
Rainy weather turns into Duſt. In the ſame
Province is to be ſeen the Lake call'd <hi>Pie di Luco,</hi>
of which, the Water, as they ſay, in a little
time petrifies pieces of Wood that are thrown
into it. The Lake of <hi>Norcia,</hi> of <hi>Norcera</hi> is no
leſs remarkable, in the vulgar Opinion, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the Devil walks there, and that the
Magicians and Witches keep their Rendezvous
upon the Banks of it. Nor is it leſs certain that
the Inhabitants of the neighbouring Villages are
often upon their Guards to interrupt thoſe ſorts
of Meeting. The Sybils Cave is in that Quarter,
the Subterraneal Concavity of which leads, as
they report, into a very far Kingdom, where
the Men and Women ſport all Day, and are
turn'd into Serpents in the Night.</p>
                     <p>Viſiting the parts about <hi>Rome,</hi> you come to

<hi>The Wicked City,</hi> for that the Inhabitants finding
themſelves conſtrain'd to Surrender, reſolv'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all of 'em to Die, and kill one another,
then to be Spectators of their Enemies Victory.
They began with cutting their Children's, their
Siſter's and their Mother's Throats, ſoon after
they did the ſame to their Wives, and then ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Fire to the Four corners of the City, fell a
Maſſakring one another, till not one was left
alive.</p>
                     <p>Before I conclude this Chapter, I muſt inform
the Reader, that near <hi>Tivoli,</hi> an Epiſcopal Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>La Campagna di Roma,</hi> there is a very deep
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:32919:137"/>
Lake, in which there are ſeveral floating Iſlands,
which when the Wind blows, are driven to the
ſides of the Lake, by the motion of the Water.
This Lake is about 500 paces in length, and in
regard the Water is very Sulphury, 'tis thought
that the boiling of the Water forces up the Mudd
to the ſurface of the Lake, which ſticking to the
Reeds and other Herbage, forms thoſe Iſlands,
that in time grow bigger and bigger.</p>

                     <p>This Famous City was Founded in the Year

were the Grand-children by <hi>Rhea Sylvia</hi> their

Two Founders could not agree about the Name,

<hi>Valencia;</hi> but the Diſputes between the Two
Brothers being reconcil'd, or rather determin'd

Men, to be ready upon all occaſions to execute
the Orders of the Civil Government. This Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
is call'd <hi>Bargello,</hi> and his Soldiers <hi>Sbirri.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be ſaid that there is no City in the
World wherein the Civil Government is better
ſettl'd then at <hi>Rome.</hi> All ſorts of Proviſions are
rated in the Markets, in the Shops and in the
Inns, where no body can ſell any thing but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Rate ſet. There are Bills ſet up
in all Inns containing the Price of Bread, Wine
and Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and-for the Information of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and to the end that the Inn-keepers may
not deceive thoſe who are ignorant of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
or who cannot read, the <hi>Sbirri</hi> many
times ſtop Strangers in the Streets, to know of
'em where they Lodge, and what they pay a
Meal, to the end that they who offend againſt
the Orders of the Civil Government may be
ſoundly fin'd; and the better to take the Inn-keepers
napping, many times the <hi>Sbirri</hi> go and
Lodge in the Inns, in the Diſguiſe of Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
eſpecially where they have any ſuſpicion.</p>
                     <p>As to the Eccleſiaſtical Government, it reſides
in the Perſon of the Pope, or the Cardinal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
under the Character of his Vicar General.
When there is any thing to be regulated, the
Pope calls a Congregation, where not only the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:32919:139"/>
Cardinals are preſent, but the Biſhops and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors;
and if any Important Affairs of the Church
are in Agitation, they are propos'd in a Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
which the Pope uſually holds every 15
Days, where all the Cardinals that are in <hi>Rome</hi>
muſt be preſent.</p>
                     <p>None but the Cardinals, whoſe Aſſembly is
call'd the Sacred Colledge, have any Right in
the Election of the New Pope. This Name of
Cardinal was formerly given to all the Curates
of Pariſhes in <hi>Rome.</hi> Nor was it till after the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Council held at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Pontificare of
<hi>Nicholas</hi> II. in 1053. that the Cardinals aſſum'd
to themſelves the only Right of chooſing the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Pontiff. Their number is fix'd to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty,
<hi>viz.</hi> Fifty Prieſt Cardinals, Fourteen
Deacon Cardinals, and Six Biſhop Cardinals,
which are the Biſhops of <hi>Porto, Oſtia, Sabina,
Paleſtrina, Freſcari,</hi> and <hi>Albano.</hi> For theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopprick
Suffragans to the Pope, as their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitain
are always enjoy'd by a Cardinal.</p>
                     <p>At the Council of <hi>Lion</hi> held in 1243. Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>
IV. gave the Red Cap to the Cardinals.
<hi>Paul</hi> II. in 1464. allow'd 'em Red Habits; <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
XIV. gave a Red Bonnet to the Regular Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
who before that time wore only a Hat, and
<hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. allow'd 'em the Title of <hi>Eminency,</hi>
till then addreſt to by no other Title than that of
<hi>Illuſtriſſimo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the Time of the Promotion of Cardinals,
the Pope being then in the Conſiſtory, tells the
Cardinals that are preſent, <hi>You have for your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
N. N. and then he cauſes the Liſt of their
Names and Qualities to be read. Which done
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:32919:140"/>
the Cardinal Patron ſends for thoſe who are at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and carries 'em to the Pope to receive the
Red Bonnet at his Hands I and in the next firſt
Conſiſtory, His Holineſs gives 'em the Hat, and
this Ceremony is call'd the Opening and Shuting
the Mouths of the New Cardinals. As for thoſe
that are abſent, the Pope diſpatches away an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
to carry 'em the Bonnet; but they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to receive the Hat from His
Holineſſes Hands. The Cardinals Habits, are a
Caſſock, a Rochet, a Mantelet, the Mozette,
and the Papal Cope upon Solemn Days. The
Colour of their Habit varies according to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſometimes Light Crimſon, ſometimes
Violet, ſometimes Murrey, or a very dark
Crimſon, The Cardinals are in great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and have great Priviledges: Among
which one of the moſt conſiderable is, that if a
Cardinal chances to paſs through any place
where any Criminal is led to Puniſhment, the
Cardinals preſence gives a full Pardon for his
Crime.</p>
                     <p>The place where the Cardinals meet in order
to the Election of a new Pope when the See is
vacant, is call'd the Conclave. This Conclave
is not fix'd to any place, but is in the power of
the Cardinals to make choice of any place which
they ſhall deem convenient. However in regard
the <hi>Vatican</hi> is the moſt commodious for many
Reaſons, this Aſſembly has been held there for a
long time; ſo that the Deliberation of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
about the Choice of a place for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave
is no more then a bare Formality.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:32919:140"/>
There are ſo many Cells as there are Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
erected in a ſpacious Apartment of the
Palace; which Cells are made of Deal-Boards,
every Cardinals Conclaviſt having his Partition
alſo, who is a Perſon ſhut up with the Cardinal
to wait upon him. When the Cells are ready,
they are drawn by Lot, and every Cardinal fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes
his own, and ſets up his Arms over the
Door. The Cells are finiſh'd in Nine Days, by
which time the Pope's Funeral Obſequies being
over, upon the Tenth, the Cardinals that are at
<hi>Rome,</hi> enter the Conclave; and without ſtaying
for the Arriual of the Abſent Cardinals, labour
Morning and Evening in the Election of the Pope.
When the abſent Cardinals arrive at <hi>Rome,</hi> they
ſpend ſome Days in Viſits, and repoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and then they enter the Conclave alſo.</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as the Pope is Dead, the Publick is
inform'd of it by the ringing of a Bell that hangs
in the Capitol, and which is never towl'd upon
any other occaſion. At the ſame time Courriers
are diſpatch'd to all the Sovereign Princes of
<hi>Europe</hi> that profeſs the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion,</hi>
to inform 'em of the Pope's Death, The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
Chamberlain removes to the Palace, and
takes poſſeſſion of the Fiſhermans Ring, which
was the Deceaſed Pope's Signet, and breaks it
to pieces, becauſe all Diſpatches of Bulls ceaſe
during the Vacancy of the See. Afterwards he
gives out all neceſſary Orders for the Pope's Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
whoſe Body is Embaulm'd and carry'd
into a Chappel of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, and expos'd
upon a Bed of State, for the People to come and
kiſs his Feet through a Grate. The Funeral
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:32919:141"/>
Obſequies laſt Nine Days, and the Ceremony is
perform'd by the Sacred Colledge. During the
Vacancies of the Holy See, the Three Chiefs of
the Orders of the Colledge, <hi>viz.</hi> the Dean of
the Cardinal Biſhops, the firſt Cardinal Prieſt,
and the firſt Cardinal Deacon, have in their
hands the whole Government of the City and
Eccleſiaſtical State, and before they ſhut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
up in the Conclave, they iſſue forth all
neceſſary Orders for the Publick Security as well
in <hi>Rome</hi> as in all the Cities of the State.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not enter into a particular deſcription of
the manner of Electing Popes ſince <hi>Linus</hi>'s time,
who was the firſt that ſucceeded St. <hi>Peter</hi> till this
preſent time, as well for that it would carry me
too far, as for that the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory has
amply ſatisfy'd that piece of Curioſity. 'Tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
in that Hiſtory, that the People and the
Clergy joyntly, and ſometimes the Clergy alone
proceeded to this Election; that at other times
the Princes and Emperors have aſſum'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the power of appointing whom they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be Popes, and reſerv'd the Confirmation
alſo to themſelves: That <hi>Lewis the Debonaire,</hi> and
his Succeſſors <hi>Lotharre</hi> I. and <hi>Lewis</hi> II. reſtor'd
the Liberty of Election to the Church in the
Ninth Age: That it was again taken from her
in the Reign of <hi>Otho</hi> I. and not reſtor'd to her
again till in the Twelfth Age. But now briefly
to the manner of Election in uſe at this day.</p>
                     <p>The Cardinals that compoſe the Conclave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
Morning and Evening to the Chappel, to
make the Scrutiny; to which purpoſe they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
every one of 'em a little Ticket, wherein is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:32919:141"/>
written the Name of the Cardinal for whom
they give their Suffrage for the Pontificate:
This Billet alſo contains the Name of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Elector, which nevertheleſs is inclos'd in a
Cover and ſeal'd up, and inſtead of a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
ſuch a Motto or ſhort ſaying as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
thinks of; as for example, <hi>God is my Help.—The
Holy Ghoſt be my Guide.</hi> Every Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
throws his Billet into a Chalice that ſtands
upon the Altar of the Chappel of the Conclave;
and after all the Tickets are in, two Cardinals are
appointed to open the firſt Fould of the Ticket,
and read aloud the Perſons Nam'd to the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
which are writ down in a Regiſter, yet not
breaking open the Seal that encloſes the Name of
him that gives his Suffrage, unleſs it be found
that two Thirds of the Suffrages are for one and
the ſame Perſon, which is the number requiſite to
render the Election Authentick; but then the
Seals are broke open, and the New Pope has
the ſatisfaction to know who were the Perſons
that contributed to his Election. This Scrutiny
alſo continues till two Thirds of the Voices
meet; and after reading of the Scrutiny, if the
two Thirds of the Suffrages do not agree upon
the ſame Perſon, then they have recourſe to that
which they call <hi>Anough;</hi> that is to ſay, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one is at Liberty to give his Voice for him
who had the moſt by the Scrutiny, with this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
that the Perſon is not permitted to
give his Voice, by the <hi>Anough,</hi> for him to whom
they had given it by the Scrutiny. But if at
length, neither the Scrutiny, nor the <hi>Anough</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the Election, all the Tickets are burnt, to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:32919:142"/>
the end the Names of the Electors may be kept
ſecret. Sometimes the Election is carry'd by
way of <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> as they call it, which is as it
were an open Declaration, ſeveral Cardinals cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out at the ſame time, ſuch a one Pope. But
this is never us'd, but when They who make
that Exclamation are aſſur'd that they ſhall be
upheld by the Suffrages of two Thirds of the
Aſſembly.</p>
                     <p>When any one of the Cardinals is Elected.
Pope, the Maſters of the Ceremonies repairs to
his Cell, to carry him the Tidings of his Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
after which he is conducted to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and Rob'd with the Pontifical Habit: Which
done he receives the Adoration of the Cardinals;
that is to ſay, the Reſpects which they are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd
to pay the Sovereign Pontiff. That done,
they ſeat him in the Pontifical Chair, and ſet him
upon the Altar of the Apoſtles in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the Cardinals perform the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Adoration a ſecond time. From thence
his Holineſs is reconducted to his Apartment,
and ſome Days after they proceed to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of his Coronation, as of a Temporal Prince.
And here are to be obſerv'd the two Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of a Pope; the one is as he is the Soveraign
Pontiff and Head of the Church; the other, as
he is a Temporal Prince, and Sovereign of a
conſiderable State.</p>
                     <p>The Ceremony of the Coronation is perform'd
in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, where there is a Throne
erected, to which the new Pope aſcends, and
being ſeated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Miter is taken off, and the
Crown ſet upon his Head before all the People.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:32919:142"/>
And then begins the Cavalcade from St. <hi>Peters</hi> to
St. <hi>John di Laterano,</hi> at what time all the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
Princes, and Ambaſſadors accompany
him on Horſeback. Being arriv'd at St. <hi>John
di Laterano,</hi> the Archbiſhop of that Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
the Pope with two Keys, the one of Gold,
the other of Silver; and after he has given the
Canons leave to kiſs his Feet, his Holineſs is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
back to his Palace with the ſame Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                     <p>In the Account which I am going to give of
the Curioſities in <hi>Rome</hi> moſt worthy the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Traveller, I ſhall endeavour to omit
nothing conſiderable of what came to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and begin with a Deſcription of the
Churches, which are the faireſt and beſt adorn'd
of any in the World.</p>
                     <p>The Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> is deſervedly lookt
upon to be the moſt beautiful, the largeſt and
the moſt Superb in <hi>Europe.</hi> It is built in the
Form of a Croſs, 840 Geometrical Paces in
length, 725 in breadth, 300 high, and 1465 in
Circuit. The Roof of it is guilt, and it is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Lead and Copper guilt. The whole
Structure is lin'd with Marble within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſide; and it is pav'd with ſquare panes of
Marble: Above one hundred Pillars ſupport the
Roof. of which the ancient Emperors deſpoyl'd
<hi>Aſia:</hi> Among the reſt there are Twelve that
<hi>Veſpatian</hi> brought away from the Temple of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi>
I ſay nothing of the Riches that gliſter
in all the Chappels of the Church, nor of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of Relicks which are there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.
Thoſe for which the People have the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:32919:143"/>
greateſt Veneration are the Vail of St. <hi>Veronica,</hi>
with the Picture of our Saviour's Face; the
Lance that was run into his Body; St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Wooden Pulpit, with the Bodies of ſeveral
Saints. The Portico of this Church is 289 Foot
long, 40 broad, and 133 in height; and it has
five Doors that anſwer to the five Doors of the
Church; of which one is call'd the Holy Door,
as being never open'd but in time of Jubilee.</p>
                     <p>Over the Domo of the Church ſtands a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pola,
or Globe of Copper guilt, which below
ſeems not to be a Foot in Diameter, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it will hold above Twenty Men. After you
have aſcended a great number of Steps, you
come to a Ladder of Eighteen Rounds which
joyns to the Foot that ſuſtains the Globe, ſo that
you muſt get up with great trouble by the help
of a Rope that is faſten'd above, and hangs down
by the ſide of the Ladder. This Globe is about
a Fingers breadth in thickneſs, having no more
than four ſmall Clefts, two Inches broad, and ſix
high to let in the Light, and two Iron Bars run
a-croſs it for People to ſit upon. 'Tis obſervable
that no Body is permitted to go into it in the
heat of Summer, for fear of being ſtifl'd. 'Tis
ſaid that St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church coſt Forty Three
Millions of Gold, and was the Work of Twenty
three Popes.</p>
                     <p>The Church of <hi>St. John, di Laterano,</hi> is very
conſiderable, as well for the Antiquity of it, as
for that it is the Epiſcopal Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and
becauſe there it is, that the Pope takes Poſſeſſion
of his Dignity. There it was alſo where the
Emperors receiv'd a Crown of Gold: It is all
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:32919:143"/>
Pav'd with Marble, and ſupported with Four
rows of Guilded Pillars. Before the Church
ſtands an Obelisk, a Hundred and fifteen Foot
high, erected by <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. This Church was
built by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
in the year 318. and enrich'd with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Crowns of Maſſie Gold and Silver. The
Kings of <hi>France</hi> have a Right to preſent Two
Canons of this Church to his Holineſs, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the Great Benefits this Church has
receiv'd from <hi>His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty;</hi> and
there is a Solemn Service ſaid in it every year
in Memory of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is to be ſeen enchac'd in the Great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
another little Altar, upon which they ſay,
that <hi>St. Peter</hi> and ſome of his Succeſſors ſaid
Maſs, before they could be admitted the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
exerciſe of Divine Worſhip. However, it
were, no body muſt ſay Maſs upon this Altar
but the Pope himſelf, or a Cardinal that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
his Perſon, and he muſt have an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Brief for that too. A Chair of Porphyrie
is alſo ſhown to Foreigners, wherein the Pope
Seats himſelf at the Door of the Church, when
he takes Poſſeſſion of the Papacy. There are a
World of Relicks in this Church, as the <hi>Ark</hi> of
the <hi>Old Teſtament, Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Rod,</hi> the Heads of
<hi>St. Peter, St. Paul,</hi> and <hi>St. Zacharie, &amp;c.</hi> too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to be here repeated.</p>
                     <p>Upon one ſide you aſcend to <hi>St. John de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terano,</hi>
by the <hi>Scala Santa,</hi> or <hi>Holy Ladder,</hi> which
are Twelve Steps of White Marble, the ſame
by which Chriſt aſcended into <hi>Pilates</hi> Palace,
and which <hi>Helena</hi> ſent from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to her Son
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:32919:144"/>
                        <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> then at <hi>Rome.</hi> People creep up
theſe Stairs upon their Knees out of Devotion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>St. Anaſtaſius</hi>'s Church was formerly the
Temple of <hi>Neptune.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Church of <hi>St. Theodore</hi> was formerly the
Temple of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus;</hi> and as it is ſaid,
'tis built in the very ſame place where the Two
Founders of <hi>Rome</hi> were Suckl'd by the Wolfe.
The Hoſpital of <hi>Noſtra Madonna</hi> of Conſolation,
was the Temple of <hi>Veſta,</hi> where the <hi>Veſtal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi>
kept the Sacred Fire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>St. Agnes</hi>'s Church was formerly the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> That of <hi>St. Alexis</hi> upon Mount
<hi>Aventine,</hi> was the Temple of <hi>Hercules.</hi> Upon
<hi>St. Anthony</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi>'s Day, the People bring all
manner of Beaſts to his Church in the <hi>Martian
Valley,</hi> in hopes that Saint will preſerve 'em
from all Sickneſs, and from the devouring Jaws
of the Wolfe. <hi>Sta. Barba</hi>'s in the Quarter of
<hi>Pigna,</hi> was the Temple of <hi>Venus. St. Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mews</hi>
in the Iſland, was the Temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi>
and <hi>Eſcubapius. St. Blaſe</hi>'s in the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi>
was another Temple of <hi>Neptune. St. Coſmo</hi> and
<hi>St. Damian</hi> was another Temple, formerly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus. St. Laurences</hi> by
<hi>Janicola</hi> was the Temple of <hi>Juno-Lucina. St. Lucius</hi>
near the Palace, was the Temple of <hi>Apollo.
St. Maries</hi> upon the <hi>Capitoline Hill</hi> was the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Jupiter Feretrius. St. Nerea</hi>'s was the
Temple of <hi>Iſis. Sta. Sabina</hi> up the <hi>Aventine
Mount</hi> was the Temple of <hi>Diana.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>St. Martin</hi>'s Church in the <hi>Mount,</hi> is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the Vault, which, as they ſay, was the
Place wherein the Chriſtian Religion was Firſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:32919:144"/>
exerciſed, and where <hi>St. Sylveſter</hi> held Two
Councils, during the perſecution of the Church.
The Church of the <hi>Holy Croſs</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which
is one of the Seven Conſecrated to the <hi>Croſs,</hi> was
built by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> out of the ruins of the Temple
of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and becauſe the Infidels had
erected the Statue of <hi>Venus</hi> upon <hi>Mount Calvarie,</hi>
and had given the Name of that Goddeſs to the
<hi>Mount. Sta. Helena</hi> caus'd the Superficies of the
Mountain to be par'd off, and ſent the Earth
to the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> her Son, who put it
into the Chappel of that Church, where it is
kept among the reſt of the Reliques.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>St. Pauls</hi> Church, a Mile without the City,
was alſo founded by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> in Honour of
that Apoſtle, who lies there Enterr'd. It is 477
Foot Long, 258 Broad, and is ſupported by 100
Pillars of White Marble, in Four Rows. The
Church of <hi>St. Maries de la Rotonda,</hi> formerly the
<hi>Pantheon,</hi> is a conſiderable Structure, as well for
that <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who was the Founder of it, ſet
up the Statues of all the Ancient Deities therein,
in that order of Dignity which the Heathens
aſcrib'd to 'em; as for that the Model of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
new Churches has been taken from the round
Form of it. This ſame Structure is a Hundred
and forty Foot high, and as many Broad, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Pillars, having no other ſupport then that of
the Walls; which makes it lookt upon, as one
of the boldeſt pieces of Architecture that is in
<hi>Italy.</hi> There is no Light but what comes in at
the Door, and at an Overture, about Eight Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
in circumference, it the top of the
Church. This Building was formerly cover'd
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:32919:145"/>
with Plates of Silver, afterwards of Copper,
and ſince that with Lead; but now Laſtly, at
this day with Large Stones.</p>
                     <p>There are a great many Hoſpitals in <hi>Rome,</hi>
every Nation having one particularly belonging
to it. But the Hoſpital of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> erected by
<hi>Clement</hi> VIII. actually maintains Five thouſand
Perſons; not to mention ſuch as come by chance.
In the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Church, there is to be ſeen every
year an Election of Twelve Gentlemen and one
Prelate, for the diſtribution of Alms to ſuch as
are aſham'd to make known their Neceſſities;
and to the end they may be the more eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
there are ſeveral Boxes Lock'd up, and
ſet up in Publick Places, having little Grates at
the top, wherein they who are in want, may
put in little Notes containing the Places of their
Abode.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo Houſes for young Girls of Ten
or Twelve years of Age, when their Parents
are not able to provide for 'em, for fear leſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
ſhould tempt 'em to proſtitute themſelves.
There is another Houſe, over the Gate of which
is to be read this Inſcription, <hi>Per le Donne mal
maritate. For the Women ill Married;</hi> Where
they put ſuch Women as are unfortunately Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
or cannot agree with their Husbands:
and where they ſtay till their differences are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd,
and that the one or the other teſtifies a
deſire to live peaceably together.</p>
                     <p>All ſorts of lewd Strumpets that ſignifie a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to Repent and Reform their Lives, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into St. <hi>Mary Magdalains</hi> in <hi>Corſe,</hi> and are
there maintain'd all the reſt of their Lives: Nor
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:32919:145"/>
are they Lock'd up by force, as in the <hi>Spinning-Houſe,</hi>
in <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> but they muſt ſee no Men,
unleſs it be their Confeſſor and their Phyſitian.</p>
                     <p>They who report that <hi>Brothel-houſes</hi> are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſay true; but not when they
add that the Pope approves 'em, and receives a
Tribute from 'em. For there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between approving and conniving. <hi>Judaiſm</hi>
is no more approved in <hi>Italy,</hi> then in <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> thô the <hi>Jews</hi> are ſuffer'd in all theſe
places, and have their Publick Synagogues. And
the Popes are ſo far from laying any Tribute
upon the infamous Traffick of the Daughters of
Joy, that they have been the Founders of ſeveral
Hoſpitals for the maintenance of young Girls,
whoſe Fathers and Mothers are not able to keep
'em, leſt Poverty ſhould tempt them to Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm:
and they are maintain'd in thoſe Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
till they are of an Age to Marry, or enter
into a Religious Houſe; and they that are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to Marry, have a reaſonable Portion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
'em, proportionable to the Match that
offers it ſelf, and every <hi>Annunciation</hi> Day, there
is a conſiderable Sum of Money diſtributed in
the <hi>Dominicans</hi> Church to 300 young Virgins
that are in thoſe Hoſpitals.</p>
                     <p>The Laws in reſpect of common Proſtitutes
are very rigorous: they are forbid to come into
the Aſſemblies of Honeſt Women, or to frequent
the places where they walk to take the Air: they
muſt not go in a Coach in the Day time; nor
ſtirr out of their Houſes in the Night; nor may
they converſe together, to the end they may have
no opportunity to encourage one another to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucherie.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:32919:146"/>
They are forbid upon pain of exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Puniſhment, to admit any company into their
Houſes during <hi>Lent,</hi> nor during the <hi>Advent.</hi>
They are bound to Regiſter their Names in the
Publick Regiſters, kept on purpoſe for the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans;
who by that means are lookt upon as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
for ever. They are not admitted to the
Holy Communion, nor Buried in Holy Ground,
but in the naſty places along by the Walls of the
City. Laſtly, they cannot make a Will, ſo that
if they leave any Eſtate behind 'em, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rarely, 'tis all confiſcated for the Benefit of
the Hoſpitals for young Virgins.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Places which they call <hi>Catacombs,</hi> are
certain Subterraneal Walks, or Caverns. where
the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> performed the Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of their Religion, during the Perſecutions of
the <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperors, and where they privately
alſo held ſome Councils. The <hi>Catacombs,</hi> moſt
known in <hi>Rome,</hi> are thoſe that open into the
Churches <hi>St. Pancras, St. Sebaſtian, St. Agnes,</hi>
and <hi>St. Laurence.</hi> They who have gone through
'em report, That they run almoſt quite under
the City, even under the River <hi>Tiber.</hi> Theſe
Vaults are for the moſt part about Five Foot
High, and Three in Breadth. By the ſides of
which lie the Bodies of ſeveral Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
from whence the Pope cauſes the Holy
Bodies to be taken up, and Preſents 'em to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Ambaſſadors, by ſuch Names as his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
thinks proper to give 'em. There are
ſome Places in theſe <hi>Catacombs,</hi> where People are
forc'd to crawl along upon their Bellies, for
Twenty or Thirty Paces: and ſeveral Perſons
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:32919:146"/>
that have gone thither to viſit the Tombs of the
Ancient <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have laid their own Bones in
the ſame place. For being engag'd too far with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
good Guides, they have loſt themſelves;
either their light failing 'em before they can find
the way out again. or elſe being ſtifl'd with the
ſmoak of the Torches.</p>
                     <p>The Palace of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> where
the Popes uſually reſide in Winter, is ſeated in
the Burrough, the beſt fortify'd place in all the
City. This Palace is of a very vaſt extent, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it côntains above 5000 Rooms and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
It has three rows of Galleries adorn'd
with Pictures, repreſenting the Principal Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Old and New Teſtament. In the
Chambers alſo are an infinite Number of Marble
and Alablaſter Statues; more eſpecially there is
a Stone to be admir'd in the Imperial Chamber,
upon which Nature has form'd the Image of
<hi>Pius</hi> V. more exactly then any Pencil could have
drawn it upon Cloth. This Palace ſo call'd from
the Name of the Hill upon which it is ſeated,
was begun in the Pontificate of <hi>Nicholas</hi> V. and
finiſh'd under <hi>Leo</hi> V. but was embelliſh'd with
Painting and Statues by <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. <hi>Clement</hi> VIII.
<hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. and their Succeſſors, who have made
it a Palace fit for the Reſidence of the Severeign
Pontiffs. In the midſt of the Gallery that leads
to <hi>Belvedere,</hi> ſtands the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, which
is lookt upon to be the faireſt and the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for Number and Curioſity of Books in the
World. There are an infinite Variety of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts
in <hi>Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabick,</hi> &amp;c.
Writings upon Leaves of Wood, and Tablets of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:32919:147"/>
Wax, of which they made uſe before the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Paper. There is a large Manuſcript <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Bible, and another <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible written
upon pieces of Parchment roll'd up, from whence
the <hi>Latin</hi> word <hi>Volumen,</hi> with another Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
written upon the Leaves of a Tree, as
the Cuſtome was in thoſe days, whence the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
word <hi>Folium</hi> for the Leaf of a Book. Laſtly,
There is a <hi>Greek</hi> Bible, which as they aſſure us,
was one of the Seventy Copies of the Seventy
Interpreters who Tranſlated the Old Teſtament
by the Command of <hi>Ptolomy Philadelphus,</hi> being
ſhut up every one apart by themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Before they leave the <hi>Vatican,</hi> Travellers go
to ſee the Garden of <hi>Belvedere,</hi> ſo call'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
from that place you have a proſpect over
the whole City. 'Tis to be obſerv'd that what
we call a Garden of Pleaſure, in <hi>Italy</hi> they call a
Vinyard. This Vinyard of <hi>Belvedcre</hi> is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for an infinite number of Marble. Braſs, and
Alablaſter Statues; among which is the Statue
of the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> reſting upon a Wolf that
gives ſuck to <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Rhemus;</hi> and on the
other ſide <hi>Nilus</hi> with Seventeen Children, every
one about a fathom in height, denoting the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen
various meaſures to which the Waters of
that River encreaſe. There is alſo to be ſeen a
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> expiring after her being bitten by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
twiſted about her Arm; a <hi>Venus Ericina</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
out of a Bath; the Statues of <hi>Bacchus, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Laocoon</hi> and his Children folded
about with two Surpents.</p>

                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:32919:147"/>
The <hi>Piazza</hi> of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> commonly call'd
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Piazza, is one of the faireſt in <hi>Rome,</hi>
adorn'd with a Fountain that ſpouts up the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as big about as a Man's Middle, and as high as
a Half-Pike; and an Obelisk, which is call'd the
Needle by reaſon of the ſhape and height of it.
This is a Stone that was brought from <hi>Egypt,</hi> by
the Command of <hi>Caligula,</hi> at an incredible
charge, and was ſet up in <hi>Nero</hi>'s Circus; but
<hi>Sixtus</hi> V. caus'd it to be remov'd into the <hi>Vatioan</hi>
Piazza. It is 217 Foot high, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Baſis about 12 Foot in circumference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and 8 at the top. It is ſupported by four
Lions of Braſs guilt, that ſtand upon a large Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal
of Marble.</p>
                     <p>The Caſtle of St. <hi>Angelo</hi> is one of the beſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and has been the Sanctuary of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Popes in the Troubles of <hi>Italy. Alexander</hi>
VI. built a private Coridor, or Gallery, which
leads from the Palace of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to the Caſtle,
to the end the Popes might retire in a Time of
neceſſity without being ſeen. Priſoners of State
are committed thither; and the Treaſure of the
Church, the Records and Rolls, the Triple
Crown, with the five Millions which <hi>Sixtus</hi> V.
laid up there, with a prohibition upon pain of
Excommunication to all his Succeſſors, forbiding
'em to touch it, but upon a moſt urgent neceſſity
for the defence of the City, to which end that
Sum was only deſign'd. As to the Name of the
Caſtle, it was ſo call'd, as they ſay, from the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of an Angel that ſtands at the top of the
Frontiſpiece with a Sword in his Hand, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of St. <hi>Gregories</hi> Viſion, in which an Angel
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:32919:148"/>
appear'd to him ſheathing his Sword, to let him
underſtand that the Wrath of God was appeasd
toward the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had been very much
afflicted with War, Peſtilence and Famine.</p>
                     <p>Near the Caſtle is a Bridge over the <hi>Tiber,</hi>
call'd St. <hi>Angelo</hi>'s Bridge, built almoſt in the
ſame place where formerly ſtood the Triumphal
Bridge, by reaſon that all the Triumphs that
were decreed in <hi>Rome,</hi> paſs'd that way. But now
we ſee no more remaining but only the ſad Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of that Pompous Vanity, it being the Will
of God, that that piece of ſolemn Luxury ſhould
be quite extinct, by reaſon the Exceſs of thoſe
Triumphs was grown to that degree of Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy,
that had the uſe of 'em continu'd, Men
would have been made uſe of inſtead of Beaſts
to draw the Victors Chariot. <hi>Camillus</hi>'s was
drawn by four White Horſes; <hi>Pompey</hi>'s by four
Elephants; <hi>Mark-Antony</hi>'s by four Lyons; and
<hi>Nero</hi>'s by four Hermophradites; <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s by
ſix Harts, and <hi>Firmius</hi>'s by ſix Oſtriches.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Capitol</hi> is one of the moſt ancient Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo call'd from the Head of a Man
that was found when the Foundations of it were
laid by the Orders of <hi>Tarquin the Proud.</hi> The
Structure was finiſh'd and cover'd with Braſs
guilt in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Pulvillus. Catulus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
it to <hi>Jupiter Capitolinus;</hi> and it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
with a great number of Statues of Maſſie
Gold and Silver, which repreſented the Ancient
<hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrates and Conſuls, and it had 3000
Braſs Tables when one part of it was conſum'd
by Fire. Nor was that the only Fire which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
this Building, for it was again burnt down
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:32919:148"/>
in <hi>Sylla</hi>'s time: A third time in the Reign of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian;</hi>
and a fourth under <hi>Commodus.</hi> So that
it wants that Wealth and Magnificence which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
render'd it ſo famous. An Aſcent of 128
Steps led up to it, and there are ſtill remarkable
in it for curious pieces of Workmanſhip two Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> upon two Horſes of Marble,
and in the Grand piazza ſtands a Braſs Statue of
<hi>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus</hi> on Horſe-back. The
Palace of the Conſervators, which is alſo a part of
the Capitol, is adorn'd with an infinite number
very curious Statues.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Quirinal Hill are to be ſeen the
Ruines of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Bathing Places. Theſe
ſorts of Buildings were very large and ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in every reſpect; and there are alſo to be
ſeen at <hi>Rome</hi> ſome Ruines of the Emperors <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,
Severus, Nero, Titus, Trajan, Philippus,</hi>
and <hi>Caracalla</hi>'s Baths.</p>
                     <p>They that are very curious are eaſily led to ſee
upon the <hi>Palatin</hi> Hill, the Lake or Gulf of <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
a kind of an Abyſs whence formerly iſſued
forth a Stench that caus'd the Peſtilence in <hi>Rome,</hi>
upon which the Oracle being conſulted, return'd
for Anſwer, that the Contagion ſhould not ceaſe,
till they had thrown into the Gulph whatever
<hi>Rome</hi> had of moſt precious. Preſently the <hi>Roman</hi>
Ladies threw in all their Jewels; but that not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<hi>Curtius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, imagining there
was nothing more pretious than a Brave and a
Valiant Man, and willing to ſignalize his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
and his Zeal for his Country, threw
himſelf headlong Horſe and Man into the Abyſs,
and then the Plague ceas'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:32919:149"/>
In that Quarter which is call'd the Field of
<hi>Mars,</hi> ſtands <hi>Antoninus</hi>'s Pillar, upon which are
repreſented in half Relief the Glorious Actions
of that Emperor againſt the <hi>Armenians,</hi> the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
the <hi>Germans,</hi> &amp;c. Two hunder'd and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Marble Steps lead up to the top of it, the
Light coming in at ſix little Windows. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of no more then Eight and twenty Marble
Stones, which being joyn'd together, make a
Hundred ſeventy five Foot in heighth. Of late
they have plac'd upon the top of it a Statue of
St. <hi>Paul</hi> of guilt Braſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Column in the Piazza of the ſame
Name conſiſts of no more then four Stones that
riſe to 140 Foot in heighth; to the top of which
there is an Aſcent of 185 Steps, enlighten'd by
44 Windows. Formerly they had ſet upon the
top of this Column an Urn with <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Aſhes
in it; but that is ſince taken down, and the
Statue of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in Braſs erected in the room
of it.</p>
                     <p>Nor muſt I bury in ſilence the Statues of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi>
and <hi>Manforio;</hi> for they that talk ſo often of
others, muſt not be themſelves forgotten. It is
call'd the Statue of <hi>Paſquin,</hi> becauſe that all the
Satyrs which are made in <hi>Rome,</hi> call'd <hi>Paſquina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
are always fix'd upon it. Some ſay this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
was erected in Honour of one of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s
Soldiers who had done him many ſignal Services.
Others reject this Opinion, and tell us that the
Word <hi>Paſquin</hi> is deriv'd from a Taylor who made
Cloaths for Perſons of Quality in <hi>Rome;</hi> and in
regard he was a very great Droll, he obſerv'd
their blind ſides, to make Lampoons upon 'em
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:32919:149"/>
in his Shop, which always gain'd him good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
They add that ſometime after his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe
the Paviers digging before his Door found
a Statue, to which they preſently gave the Name
of <hi>Paſquin,</hi> and ſet it up in the next Quarter to
his Houſe. However it were, it was propos'd
to one of the Popes, that it might be thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Tiber,</hi> to take away all Opportunities of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling
and Lampoons that were fix'd upon it.
But the Holy Father made anſwer that he was
afraid it would turn to a Frog that would be
croaking Day and Night: intimating thereby,
that inſtead of ſtopping the Courſe of Satyrs, the
Lampooners would fix 'em upon all the Statues
in the City.</p>
                     <p>Not far from the Capitol ſtands another Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
call'd <hi>Manforio,</hi> where generally are hung
up the Anſwers made to the Lampoons which
are fix'd upon <hi>Paſquin.</hi> Some ſay this Statue
was erected in honour or <hi>Jupiter Panarius;</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that it is a Statue of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> becauſe
that formerly the Emperot <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Brazen
Horſe ſet his Foot upon the Head of it.</p>
                     <p>There is no City in the World wherein there
are more Magnificent Palaces. The Learned
Mr. <hi>Spon,</hi> in his Travels into the Eaſt has given us
a Catalogue of 'em, which has ſav'd me the
trouble. I ſhall only ſay, that the Palace of the
<hi>Farnezi</hi> is one of the moſt ſumptuous. It has
four Fronts with a large Gate belonging to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that leads into the Court, and is ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with Pillars forming Portico's that ſupport
an open Gallery that leads to every Apartment,
In this Court ſtand two Statues of <hi>Hercules</hi> lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:32919:150"/>
upon his Club; one of which was found in
<hi>Caracalla</hi>'s Baths; the other is an Imitation of
That. In the Palace Hall ſtands the Statue of
<hi>Alexander Farneze,</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
under foot two Statues repreſenting Hereſie
and Rebellion, while Fame ſets a Crown upon
his Head. This Piece is ſo much the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd,
becauſe all the four Peices are all of
one ſingle Stone of White Marble. There are
an infinite number of other Lovely Statues and
Pictures in the Apartments belonging to this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace:
More particularly there is to be ſeen a
Marble Statue in a ſmall Back-Court, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Figure of a Bull, all of one Stone, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
one of the Horns ty'd with a Woman's
Hair, while two Men endeavour to throw 'em
into the Sea. 'Tis the Hiſtory of <hi>Amphion</hi> and
<hi>Zethes,</hi> who in revenge of the injury done their
Mother, whom <hi>Lycus</hi> King of <hi>Thebes</hi> had repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated,
upon the Importunity of <hi>Dirce,</hi> ty'd <hi>Dirce</hi>
to the Horns of a Bull, and caſt 'em both Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

                     <p>One of the Curioſities of <hi>Rome,</hi> which Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
always viſit, is to be found in Prince <hi>Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſio</hi>'s
Palace; that is to ſay, the Body of a
Man petrefy'd and laid in a Velvet Box, with
one Leg broken, to convince the Incredulity of
the Curious, who will not believe that the Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton
was cover'd with Stone, becauſe they ſay
it was a Garment made on purpoſe. This juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
what <hi>Ortelius</hi> affirms, That upon certain
Mountains of <hi>Tartary,</hi> there are to be found
Men, Camels, Sheep, <hi>&amp;e.</hi> chang'd into Stones
for above Three Hundred Years paſt: And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reports that there is a Cave near <hi>Berga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi>
where are to be ſeen the Petrify'd Bodys of
ſeveral Men.</p>
                     <p>When I enumerated the Churches of <hi>Rome,</hi> I
forgot to tell ye, that in the Church call'd <hi>La
Bocca di Verita,</hi> there is a piece of Marble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
a Head with the Mouth open; And
the Good Women do ſay, that if a Woman Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
to her Husband's Bed, lays her Hand
upon it, the Mouth will ſhut. The <hi>Roman</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who have Jealous and Credulous Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
frequently juſtifie their Chaſtity by this
means, wherein they run far leſs hazard then
they who formerly were conſtrain'd to walk
bare-foot over red hot Coals, and Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares.</p>
                     <p>This is what I purpos'd to ſay of the Famous
City of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein though I have omitted
many things, yet there is ſufficient to give an

<hi>Italian</hi> Authors have call'd it <hi>Sicily</hi> on this ſide
the <hi>Pharos,</hi> which is the reaſon that the Kings of
<hi>Spain</hi> have aſſum'd the Title of Kings of both
<hi>Sicilies.</hi> Generally this Kingdom is divided into
Twelve Provinces; viz. <hi>La Terra di Lavore,
Principato Giteriore, Principato <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lteriore, Calabria
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lteriore, La Terra d' Otranto, La Terra di Bari,
La Capitanata,</hi> the County of <hi>Moliſſo,</hi> the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt
<hi>Abruzzo,</hi> and the furthermoſt <hi>Abruzzo:</hi>
It is reckon'd to contain 24 Archbiſhopricks, 60
Principalities, 100 Dukedoms, as many Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſates,
66 Earldoms, and above 1000 Baronies.
Which ſhews us, that the Nobility multiplies in
that Kingdom, more then any where elſe; which
is the reaſon that <hi>Naples</hi> is call'd <hi>Naples the Noble.</hi>
The Air is very wholſome, and the Country ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fruitful in Corn, Wine, and all ſorts of Fruits,
This Kingdom has not been free from Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that have turmoyl'd the Repoſe of <hi>Italy</hi> upon
ſeveral Occaſions. It has been in the Poſſeſſion
of the <hi>Romans, Goths, Lombards, Normans, Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,
French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Which latter Uſurp'd
it from the <hi>French</hi> who have an undoubted claim
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:32919:151"/>
to it, as well by the Inveſtiture given by <hi>Clement</hi>
IV. both of that Kingdom, as alſo of <hi>Sicily,</hi> to
<hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi>
Brother of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> in 1265. as for that Queen

<hi>Italy,</hi> under the leading of the Famous <hi>Gonſalvo,</hi>

ſince which time the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have been in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of 'em, and keep a Viceroy there, who is
chang'd every three Years. The Kingdom of
<hi>Naples</hi> holds of the Holy See; and the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> pays every year to the Pope upon St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
Day a Tribute of a White Nag, and a
Purſe of 7000 Ducats. But the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> do
not willingly brook the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoak: And
therefore they have endeavour'd to caſt it off ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Times: But their laſt Inſurrection was in
the years 1646. and 1647. tho they fail'd in the
ſucceſs, becauſe the Deſign was ill laid, and 'for
that the Male-Contents had no body to head em
but a ſorry Fiſherman, vulgarly known by the
Name of <hi>Maſaniello,</hi> who for above 15 Days
Commanded above 200000 Men, who paid him
a blind Obedience.</p>
                     <p>This Kidgdom that ſtretches it ſelf forth in

who underſtood the importance of it,
caus'd it to be fortify'd after an extraordinary
manner; and it has always a Garriſon in it of
500 Natural <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The Caſtle of St. <hi>Elmo</hi>
which cemmands one part of the City, was built
by <hi>Robert</hi> I. the Son of <hi>Charles</hi> II. and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror

theſe Caſtles there are alſo ſome Towres and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Buildings, which are call'd by the Name of

                     <p>The Viceroy's Palace is very ſpacious, richly
Furniſh'd, and incloſes ſeveral Curioſities, among
others, a Plant about Two Fingers in breadth,
and about a Foot and a halfe long, upon which
the Ancients wrote before the uſe of Paper was
invented. A Stone, which being ſcrap'd, yields a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:32919:152"/>
kind of Cotton, of which the <hi>Pagans</hi> made a
certain ſort of Cloth to wrap the Dead Bodies,
which they burnt, by reaſon that this Cloth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
incombuſtible, preſerv'd the Aſhes of the
Corps entire, This ſort of Cloth is in uſe
among ſome People in <hi>India;</hi> the nature of it
being ſuch, thar when 'tis Foul, 'tis but throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it into the Fire, and it becomes as white as
Snow.</p>
                     <p>The Port of <hi>Naples</hi> would be one of the beſt

The Streets are Broad, Long, and as Streight as
a Line, and ſo order'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there runs a Canal
through every Street, as in the Cities of <hi>Holland,</hi>
which receive the Filth and Naſtineſs through
Iron Grates, ſo that the Streets are always clean.
It may be about Six Miles in compaſs, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
the Seven Suburbs; and it has been all
along the Reſidence of Illuſtrious Men, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the mild and temperate Air which it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys;
in the number of which we may reckon
<hi>Virgil, Livie, Horace, Seneca,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Cathedral Church is Dedicated to
<hi>St. Januarius</hi> formerly Biſhop of <hi>Beneventum,</hi>
who is the Fourteenth Patron that the <hi>Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
have made choice of: and they keep the
Blood of this Saint as a Sacred Relique, which
is congeal'd in Veſſels: but if they lay it to the
Saints Head, ſuch is the Story which they tell,
it preſently turns Liquid, and rowls up into
little Bubbles.</p>

As for the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Money, they reckon all
by <hi>Carolino</hi>'s; every <hi>Carolino</hi> being worth about
Ten <hi>Sols</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Piſtol goes for
Three and thirty <hi>Carolino</hi>'s; a <hi>Sequin</hi> for Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Carolino</hi>'s; a <hi>Piaſter</hi> weighs Nine <hi>Carolino</hi>'s;

                     <p>After that Strangers have ſeen the Curioſities
of <hi>Naples,</hi> rhey viſit the Wonders in the parts
adjoyning: for an infinite number of ſurprizing
Things that are to be met with in the Kingdom
of <hi>Naples,</hi> may well be call'd by that Name.</p>
                     <p>The Mountain <hi>Veſuvius</hi> may well deſerve to
be plac'd in the Firſt rank of theſe <hi>Wonders,</hi> as
being ſo frequently all in a Flame. Not to
mention that Inundation of Fire which hap'ned
in <hi>Titus</hi>'s Reign, wherein <hi>Plinie</hi> was a little too
far engag'd, out of Curioſity; nor of ſeveral
others; I ſhall only ſay, that this Mountain,
which is above Seven Leagues from <hi>Naples,</hi>
continually vomits forth Fire, ſometimes more,
ſometimes leſs violently; which has many times
laid waſt the Country, and very much annoy'd
the City of <hi>Naples.</hi> There was formerly upon
this Hill, the Lovelieſt Vineyards in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and a very beautiful Village, containing
above 2500 Inhabitants; but in the year 1631.
this Infernal Chimney, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls it, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
forth ſuch a Deluge of Flames, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with a Torrent of Sulphur, and a Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Stones, that all the poor People were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
burnt of ſtifl'd, and their Town was buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Cinders, that lay more then Ten Foot
thick above the Steeple of the Church. Stones
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:32919:153"/>
are alſo there to be ſeen, of a prodigious
igneſs, and there are People ſtill living,
that beheld a Torrent of Sulphur, <hi>Alome</hi> and
<hi>Salt-Peter</hi> fall from the Top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
Some time before this diſmal Ravage, the
Smoak, that iſſu'd continually forth, increas'd,
and was intermix'd with Flames and Aſhes;
ſoon after, it was accompany'd with a noiſe ſo
dreadful, that you would have thought that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was about to have been ſwallow'd up:
this noiſe was attended with an Earthquake that
ſwell'd up the Sea; and at length the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
burſting, pieces of Rock, all of a light Fire,
flew out, and the Sulphur that ran down, float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Sea no leſs then Three Miles from
the Shore; and 'tis thought that if the Wind
had not prov'd favourable to the City of <hi>Naples,</hi>
it had been buried in the Cinders that flew from
the Mountain. This terrible accident is engrav'd
upon a Marble Stone, that ſtands in the High
way which leads from <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
People out of Curioſity, have gone up to the
top of the Mountain, by a way cut out of the
Aſhes for above Two Miles together, and found
at the top of the Mountain, a wide Abyſs,
about Two Miles in circumference, and as many
deep; wherein there appear'd another, no leſs
wide then the Firſt, from whence iſſu'd out a
thick Smoak that ſmelt of Sulphur.</p>
                     <p>The Mountain <hi>Pauſilipus</hi> is remarkable for the
Subterraneal way cut through the Mountain for
above a Mile together, thô it be all of Free
Stone; This Cavern is call'd The <hi>Grotto</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
and was made to ſhorten the Paſſage from
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:32919:154"/>
                        <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Puzzuolo.</hi> For in regard that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſtretches out into the Sea, like a Promonto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
there is no paſſage left upon the Shore: So
that before that Way was made, the Aſcent and
Deſcent of the Mountain was very painful and
laborious. There are ſome who averr it to be
the Work of <hi>Lucullus;</hi> others aſcribe it to <hi>Cocceius
Nerva:</hi> But however it were, the way is about
a Mile in length, and between Twelve and Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Foot high, and ſo broad that Two Coaches
may goe a Breaſt, There is no Light comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it but by the two Entrances, and by two ſmall
Overtures, which <hi>Alphonſo</hi> VII. King of <hi>Naples</hi>
caus'd to be boar'd through the top of the <hi>Grotto,</hi>
much about the middle of it, where there is a
Lamp continually burning before the Image of
the Virgin; but notwithſtanding the Darkneſs
of the Place, you are never peſter'd, by reaſon
that they who come from <hi>Naples,</hi> always keep
the Right hand, and they who Travel thither
take the Left.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Tomb ſtands in the Garden of <hi>Severino,</hi>
ſhaded with Laurels, almoſt at the entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Grotto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this you muſt ſee the Lake <hi>Avernus,</hi>
which <hi>Virgil</hi> calls <hi>The Lake of Hell,</hi> becauſe the
Birds that fly over it, are poiſon'd with the
ſtench that exhales from the Water. It may be
above Two thouſand Paces long, and half as
broad. The Ancients faign'd that <hi>Charon</hi> ply'd
there with his Boat, in regard the River <hi>Acheron</hi>
forms this Lake, upon the Banks of which are to
be ſeen the Ruines of the Temple of <hi>Apollo.</hi>

Nor is the Lake <hi>d'Agnano</hi> far from it, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronn'd
with Mountains, and thought to be bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs
in the middle. Thô the Water be full

ſuch Beaſts, as entring into ſuch a venemous
<hi>Grotto</hi> adjoyning, call'd <hi>The Dogs</hi> Grotto, are
dragg'd, halfe ſtifl'd with the Sulphurie Steam,
that in an hours time would kill 'em quite.</p>
                     <p>The Lake <hi>Lucrinus,</hi> the moſt abounding in
Fiſh of any in the Kingdom, formerly intermix'd
with <hi>Avernus,</hi> by means of a <hi>Canal:</hi> But in 1538.
or as others ſay, upon <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Night in 1636.
an Earthquake, not only fill'd up the <hi>Canal,</hi> but
ſett a Mountain above Four Miles in compaſs,
between the Two Lakes.</p>
                     <p>The Alome Mountain yields a great Revenue
to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Ancients made an
Infernal Manſion of it, and plac'd <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s Work-houſe
there; becauſe they ſaw nothing but
Flames all Night upon it, and Smoak all Day;
and for that the Sulphurie Vapour infected the
Air for above a League round; The Trench,
from which this Smoak ariſes, being a Thouſand
Foot wide, and Fifteen hundred in length. All
the Land about <hi>Puzzuolo</hi> is nothing but Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Earth, ſo that you ſhall ſee the Smoak riſe
under your Feet through the Clefts in the High
way, occaſion'd by the Drowth of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Not far from the Mountain of Brimſtone, lies
the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurers Lake,</hi> becauſe it never reſtores any
thing that is plung'd into the Water, which is
very black, thick, and bolls all day long. If you
throw Meat into it, it comes out halfe boil'd, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:32919:155"/>
the one halfe of it conſum'd: And if you put
into it Three Eggs in a cloſe Basket, 'tis ſaid,
that be as cautious as you can, you ſhall pull out
but Two, the Lake taking the Third as due for
Tribute.</p>
                     <p>Near <hi>Puzzuolo,</hi> is a <hi>Subterraneal Labyrinth,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which you muſt not enter without lighted
Torches, and a Skein of Thread, which you
muſt be very careful to preſerve from breaking,
unleſs you will run the hazard of loſing your
way. This <hi>Labyrinth</hi> is compos'd of an infinite
number of Rooms, one within another: And
there are likewiſe to be ſeen in the ſame place,
ſome Ruins of the Temples of <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
Nero</hi>'s Stoves, that yield a very great
Heat; Four Chambers furniſh'd with Stone
Beds, and Boulſters of the ſame Materials, would
entice a Man to take his Reſt there, were they
not a little of the hardeſt: <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Baths are in
a large Room, where the Letters are ſcrap'd out
that were written upon the Roof, becauſe that
Sick People were ſo vain as to believe they ſhould
be Cur'd ſo ſoon as they had read 'em. Others
affirm, that thoſe Inſcriptions were only the
Names of ſuch ſick People as thoſe Baths had
Cur'd, but that the Phyſitians caus'd 'em to be
raz'd out, under pretence that they were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Characters.</p>
                     <p>The Baths of <hi>Tirtola</hi> lie not far diſtant; being
a very long Grotto, into which you are no ſooner
enter'd but you begin to ſweat; but when you
are at the end of the Grotto, you feel leſs heat:
And if you feel it too hot, you need no more
then ſtoop to the Ground, and there comes up
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:32919:155"/>
a coolneſs very refreſhing. 'Tis ſaid that at the
farther end of this Grotto there are Baths that
are qualify'd with excellent Vertues; but that
they are but very little frequented, by reaſon
the Acceſs to 'em is ſo frightful.</p>
                     <p>About a 100 Paces from the Lake <hi>Lucrinus,</hi>
you meet with other Baths, ſome cold, others
hot. Theſe are Caverns in the Rock, wherein
they have cut out certain Receptacles to Bath in.
When you enter into the cold Baths, there are
ſeveral Chambers hew'd out of the Rock, where
there are a great number of thoſe Receptacles,
ſome full, others empty. 'Tis ſaid that every
Receptacle had a peculiar vertue to cure ſeveral
Diſtempers; and they know 'em by the Statues
erected near the Receptacles, laying a hand upon
the part affected.</p>
                     <p>When you leave theſe Baths, you aſcend ſome
Steps that are cut out of the Rock which lead to
the hot Baths; and when you have gone forward
about 20 or 30 Paces, there is a deep place full
of Water almoſt boyling hot; on the ſide of
which there is a Grotto.; but the Deſcent into it
is ſo hot, that it fetches out the Sweat by very
great drops, becauſe the Vapours and Exhalations
are ſo violent.</p>
                     <p>Near to <hi>Cumae,</hi> which is lookt upon to be the
Mother of <hi>Naples,</hi> is to be ſeen the Grotto of the
<hi>Cumaean Sybil,</hi> which though a <hi>Pagan,</hi> foretold
the Birth of Chriſt, and the Myſteries of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation.
You enter into it through a long and
wide Walk cut out of the Rock, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
led to the City of <hi>Cumae.</hi> After you have
gone 450 Paces, upon the right hand you meet
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:32919:156"/>
with a very low Door, which leads into a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
14 Foot long, and 8 wide, the Roof of
which is painted with Gold and Azure, and the
Walls inlay'd with Coral, and Mother of Pearl.
On the left hand of that Chamber, is another
Door which leads into a Walk cut out of the Rock
alſo, 4 Foot high, and 40 long. At the end of
it is a Chamber that leads into two other Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
in the one of which is a kind of a ſmall
Lake: Now in regard the Room is very hot,
and for that you cannot tarry long in it without
Sweating, 'tis conjectur'd that it was the Sybil's
Bath. And becauſe that all theſe Apartments
are under ground, and for that no Light comes
into 'em, you muſt take care to be well furniſh'd
with Flambeaus, or Wax-Candles, and to be no
leſs cautious that they do not go out. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all the Rocks in this part of the Kingdom
of <hi>Naples</hi> are full of theſe Grotto's, 'tis thought
that the Ancient Inhabitants liv'd under ground.</p>
                     <p>After you have taken a view of all the Rarities
about <hi>Puzzuolo,</hi> you take Boat and ſlip over to
<hi>Baiae,</hi> which lies not above 4 Miles diſtant, and
where there are alſo ſeveral Remarkable Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
More eſpecially ſome Ruins of <hi>Caligula</hi>'s
famous Bridge, who to fulfil the Propheſie of an
Aſtrologer, that in the time of <hi>Tiberius</hi> foretold
that <hi>Caligula</hi> ſhould be Emperor when he ſhould
ride on Horſeback over the Golph between <hi>Puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuolo</hi>
and <hi>Baiae,</hi> joyn'd to the Bridge which the
<hi>Romans</hi> had then already begun, two rows of
Ships ſtay'd by huge Anchors, over which he laid
a great number of Planks, and ſo rode over both
on Horſeback, and in his Chariot. There are
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:32919:156"/>
ſome who believe that <hi>Caligula</hi> did not only deſign
the fulfilling of that Propheſie, but that he was
at that vaſt expence, to imitate <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and to
terriſie the People of <hi>Europe</hi> that were unſubdu'd
at that time. The Sand all along that Coaſt has
two peculiar Qualities; that although the Water
be cold, the Sand at the bottom of the Sea is ſo
hot that you can ſcarce endure to touch it, and
when it comes out of the Water, it becomes as
hard as Marble.</p>
                     <p>It was at <hi>Baiae</hi> where <hi>Agrippina</hi> was ſtabb'd
by the Command of <hi>Nero</hi> her Son, who was ſo
cruel as to rip open her Body, that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the place where he had lain Nine Months.
This Misfortune was foretold that Princeſs long
before. For having conſulted the Oracle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Deſtiny of the Fruit which ſhe bare
in her Womb; anſwer was return'd her, <hi>Thou
ſhalt bring forth a Son who ſhall be Emperor, but
he ſhall put Thee to Death.</hi> To which ſhe reply'd.
<hi>Let him put me to Death, provided that he Reign.</hi>
Her Tomb is in a Grotto, where there is a Cave
cut out of the Rock, adorn'd with ſome Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
which repreſent the Empreſs ſurrounded
with ſome Birds of Prey.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo a certain Subterraneal Structure
to be ſeen at <hi>Baiae,</hi> which is call'd <hi>Piſcina Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi>
or, <hi>The Wonderful Fiſh-Pond.</hi> It is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with about 45 or 50 Pillars, and lin'd with
Ciment; which makes People believe that it is a
Ciſtern wherein the Ancients preſerv'd Rain-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for their Drink, in regard that all the Water
thereabout taſtes ſtrong of the Minerals.</p>
                     <p>

There is another Subterraneal Structure, call'd
the hundred <hi>Little Chambers,</hi> all built of Brick,

There are an infinite number of Curioſities more
in the parts about <hi>Puzzuolo</hi> and <hi>Baiae:</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <p>In the Province of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> there are a ſort
of Lizards, by which if a Man be bitten, he
cannot be cur'd but by Dancing, and the ſound
of Inſtruments. They add further, that theſe
Animals never bite any but the People of the
Country, and that it was a Puniſhment which
befel 'em, becauſe that being Dancing one Day,
they would not quit their Jollity but for ſo long

                     <p>The Territory of <hi>Otranto</hi> is a kind of Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula,
environ'd with the <hi>Adriatick</hi> and <hi>Ionick</hi>
Seas, and much infeſted with Locuſts, that are
purſu'd and hunted after by a ſort of Birds not

the Metropolis of the Province is conſiderable for
being an Archbiſhoprick, and for the Haven from

In former time <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> had a deſign to have

of the Walls, while the Church was
building, and commanded that Saint not to let
any Woman enter into it but to order 'em to ſtand
without and hear Maſs. They further add, that ſome
Women happening to go in, either out of Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or Devotion, there aroſe ſuch a violent Storm
of Rain, Hail and Thunder, that never ceas'd
till the Women were gone out, and had given
Teſtimonies of their Repentance for their Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;

The Dolphins that appear upon this Coaſt

this Chapter with a report of an accident
that befell a Seaman of <hi>Caieta.</hi> That a Sea-man
having caught one of theſe Fiſh, preſerv'd
it alive in a ſmall Pond, and tam'd him to that

embarking for <hi>Spain,</hi> the Fiſh made his eſcape to

                     <p>SOme Authors have written, that <hi>Sicily</hi> which
is the biggeſt Iſland in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi>
with the Title of a Kingdom, was formerly
joyn'd to <hi>Italy,</hi> and that a ſtorm of Wind occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
the ſeparation; others aſſert, that it was
divided from it by an Earthquake. It was firſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:32919:159"/>
inhabited by Giants, by Liſtrigons and Cyclops;
it was likewiſe call'd <hi>The Iſland of the Sun,</hi> and
<hi>Trinacrea,</hi> by reaſon of the Three Promontories
of <hi>Faro, Paſſaro</hi> and <hi>Boco,</hi> which are ſo plac'd.
that the whole Iſland reſembles a Greek <hi>Delta.</hi>
It is ſeated between 36 and 40 Degree of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude,
and the Latiude extends from the
35 to 88 Degree. The circuit of the Sea-coaſt
takes up a Hundred Fourſcore and Ten Leagues;
where it is longeſt; Sixty Leagues in length,
and Fifty, where it is broadeſt. 'Tis but Seven
Miles from <hi>Cape Faro</hi> to <hi>Seiglio</hi> in the Kingdom,
of <hi>Naples.</hi> Some will have this Iſland to hang
in the Seas, being ſupported only by Three Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
that are under the Three Promontories, and
to juſtifie their Opinion, aſſert, That the River
<hi>Salſo,</hi> that riſes out of a Hole in the middle of
the Iſland, comes from the Sea, by reaſon the
Water is Salt.</p>
                     <p>The Air is very wholeſome, thô ſomewhat of
the hotteſt for Strangers. The Soil is ſo fertile
in Corn, Wine, and all ſorts of Fruits, that
<hi>Sicily</hi> was call'd the Granary of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
Oil, Wax, Sugar, Saffron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are
all the Products of that Iſland, draw a great
Trade to it. Beſides, there are found in this
Iſland, great ſtore of Agates, Emraulds, Jaſper,
Porphyrie, Salt, and ſeveral Mineral Mines:
and all the Sea-coaſts abound in Fiſh.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire fell to decay, <hi>Sicily</hi>

Twenty four: Every Tarin is worth about
Five <hi>Sols</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> When they make any Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

                     <p>One of the Cuſtoms obſerv'd in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and
which appears very ridiculous in <hi>France,</hi> is, that

they be particularly acquainted with ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

whether there be any Chins without Beards.

ſo many Robbers, that 'tis a difficult thing for
a Man to ſtir halfe a League out of the City,

There is nothing expos'd to Sale in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Sicilians</hi> for the moſt part, and they that

Goats-Skin undreſt, their Hair being matted or
plaited flat behind; A Doublet with great Skirts,
neither Band nor Cravatt, their Breeches very
ſtrait, a Cloak of the ſame Stuff which the
Chimney-Sweepers in <hi>Savoy</hi> wear, which they
fling under their Left Arm, with a Sword and
Piſtol by their ſides. Their Shooes are made of the
Rind of Bacon well Curry'd, which laſts a long

                     <p>
                        <hi>Palermo</hi> is the Metropolis of the Kingdom,
an Archiepiſcopal See, and the Reſidence of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:32919:161"/>
Viceroy, whoſe Train is more ſplendid then the
King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s. The Air is temperate, the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the Fountains, and the Magnificence of the
Buildings, contribute not a little to render <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermo</hi>
a pleaſant Habitation; and therefore the
Chiefeſt of the Nobility reſide there. In the
Great <hi>Piazza</hi> that faces the Palace, ſtands the
Statue of <hi>Philip</hi> IV. upon a Pedeſtal, upon
which are repreſented the Victories of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
ſupported by Four Figures repreſenting
the Four Virtues, the whole of White Marble.
In another <hi>Piazza</hi> ſtands a Braſs Statue of
<hi>Charles</hi> V. upon a Pedeſtal of Marble. In the
meeting of the new Street and <hi>Caſſaron</hi> ſtreet,
which are two of the faireſt Streets in <hi>Palermo,</hi>
is to be ſeen the Palace, a noble Fountain; and
Four Statues of the King's of <hi>Spain, Charles</hi> V.
<hi>Philip</hi> II. III. IV. which are the moſt beautiful
Ornaments of the City.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Piazza</hi> right againſt the Palace of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
ſtands a Fountain, which deſervedly is
lookt upon to be the moſt beautiful in <hi>Europe.</hi>
It conſiſts of ſeveral hollow Receptacles, one
above another, ſeparated by Galeries, whither
you aſcend to admire the variety of large Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
that ſpout forth Water after different
manners. The whole is of Marble, with a great
number of Figures of the ſame Stone.</p>
                     <p>After that you have ſeen all that is curious in
<hi>Palermo,</hi> Travellers go to viſit Mount <hi>Peregrin,</hi>
at the top of which, after an aſcent of Three
Miles, you meet with a Cave, almoſt like that
of St. <hi>Beaume</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> which was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement
of <hi>Sta Raſalia,</hi> and 'tis reported that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:32919:161"/>
the Fountain within that Grotto has a peculiar
Quality to Heal ſeveral Diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>Thô the City of <hi>Mont Real</hi> be not above Four
Miles diſtant from <hi>Palermo,</hi> however it is an
Archiepiſcopal See. From thence there is a
Proſpect of Nine Iſlands, call'd by the Name
of <hi>Lipari,</hi> which is the name of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
among 'em. Of which two, <hi>Vulcano</hi> and
<hi>Stromboli,</hi> are not inhabited, becauſe of their
continual vomiting forth Flames and Smoak;
for which reaſon they are call'd the <hi>Burning
Iſlands of Sicily.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However, theſe Iſlands are not to be taken
confuſedly for Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> commonly call'd
Mount <hi>Gibello,</hi> the higheſt Mountain in <hi>Sicily;</hi>
which thô almoſt cover'd with Snow, yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
vomits forth flames of Fire, like a Glaſs-houſe
Furnace; and ſpreads the Aſhes of the
conſum'd Materials with that impetuoſity, that
the Country is frequently much endamaged
thereby: thô if the ſame Aſhes are but mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
ſcatter'd over the Ground, they enferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
the Earth. The City of <hi>Catanea,</hi> lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Mountain, has ſuffer'd many Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations,
occaſion'd by the ſparkles of this Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Gulph. Several Perſons that have been ſo
curious as to climb to the Top of Mount <hi>Gibello,</hi>
have been either loſt in the Snow, or buried in
the Aſhes, and many times the Flames enforce
their way through Chawns and Rifts ne'r known
before, with ſuch an amazing noiſe, as alarms
all the Iſland. Not far from Mount <hi>Gibello</hi> is
the place where ſome will have it, that <hi>Ceres</hi>
firſt began to ſow Wheat; and they will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:32919:162"/>
to ſhew ye the Meadows where <hi>Hercules</hi> fed
his Oxen.</p>
                     <p>The Lake <hi>Naphtica</hi> is noted for this, that
the ſtench of the Water is ſo noiſom, that it
poiſons the adjacent Air, and very much impairs
the Health of the neighbouring Inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>There is another Lake near <hi>Caſtro Giovanni,</hi>
which is ſaid to have no bottom; 'Tis call'd the
Lake of <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> upon a ſuſpition that it was
the place where <hi>Proſerpina</hi> was Raviſh'd, and
carried to the Infernal Regions by her Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Meſſina</hi> is an Archiepiſcopal City, famous for
the Haven that belongs to it, near <hi>Cape Faro,</hi>
which makes it a Town of Great Trade, and
much frequented by Foreigners. In the Grand
<hi>Piazza</hi> ſtands a Braſs Statue of <hi>Philip</hi> IV. upon
a Horſe of the ſame Metal; the whole Adorn'd
with Baſe-Reliefs, repreſenting his moſt famous
Actions. Over the Door of a Tower near the
Metropolitan Church, ſtands a <hi>French</hi> Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.
<hi>Grand-merci a Meſſina,</hi> in remembrance,
as they ſay, that the <hi>French</hi> began with <hi>Meſſina,</hi>
when they made themſelves Maſters of the
Iſland.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral other Whirlpools, or Abyſſes
of Water in the Sea adjoyning to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> among
the reſt, <hi>Charybdis,</hi> Famous among the <hi>Latin</hi>
Poets. This Whirlpool is about Thirty Paces
in Diameter; which compaſs of the Surface is
uſually cover'd with Froth, Bulruſhes, and other
foul excreſcencies of the Sea, which throw
themſelves into it, and are ſwallow'd up by it.
Nevertheleſs, the Mariners of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> Sail over
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:32919:162"/>
in flat bottom'd Barks, where after ſeveral times
being whirl'd and turn'd about, they row them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
back.</p>
                     <p>The Tides of Ebb and Flood are ſo rapid in
the <hi>Channel</hi> that ſeparates <hi>Sicily</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> that
they many times force the Veſſels riding there,
from their Anchors, let 'em be never ſo ſtrong;
which is the loſs of many a Ship.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> or <hi>Syracuſe</hi> was formerly lookt upon
as the largeſt and moſt Magnificent City in the
Univerſe. <hi>Athens</hi> beheld her ſelf abandon'd by
the Greateſt part of her Inhabitants, who betook
themſelves to ſettle at <hi>Syracuſe:</hi> And the moſt
ſumptuous Edifices in <hi>Rome,</hi> derive their chiefeſt
Ornaments from the Spoils of her Structures.
The moſt beautiful Ruin of her Antiquity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
is the Aqueduct, cut out of a Rock,
that carries the Water over the Haven, about
Ten Miles in length. Without the City is to be
ſeen <hi>Arethuſa</hi>'s Fountain that riſes in great
abundance, out of a Rock by the Sea-ſide; and
they report, that this Water comes from the
<hi>Holy Land,</hi> by a conveyance that runs under the
Abyſſes of the Sea. But the greateſt Evidence
that they alleadge for it is this, That a Pilgrim
one day taking up Water, out of the River <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,</hi>
by chance let his Diſh fall into the River,
and loſt it to his incredible Grief; for that he
had hid within it Seven Piſtoles for unforeſeen
occaſions. That embarking to return for <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
he landed in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and going to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Arethuſa</hi> to Drink, he found his Diſh float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Water, which he knew again, not
only by the Seven Piſtoles, but by ſeveral other
marks.</p>

                        <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> the Tyrants Grotto, lies not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> much more conſiderable
than any of thoſe about <hi>Puzzuolo,</hi> For there you
may ſee a whole City cut out of a Rock, with
ſubterraneal Streets, Palaces, Piazza's, and other
admirable Structures. But you muſt have
ſome notable Antiquarie for your guide, that
knows all the Turnings and Windings, and be
well provided with Matches and Torches.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral other Iſlands between <hi>Sicily</hi>
and <hi>Barbary,</hi> as <hi>Maltha, Gozes, Limoſa, Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padouſa,
&amp;c.</hi> but in regard they rather belong
to <hi>Africa</hi> then <hi>Europe,</hi> I ſhall ſay nothing of 'em
here. Nevertheleſs, I cannot forbear obſerving,
that in the laſt there is a Chappel, where you
ſhall meet with all ſorts of Refreſhments for
Sea faring People, and all that is neceſſary for
Navigation, as Biſcuit, Cordage, Anchors, Sails,
Oil, Wood, Fiſh, Stuffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all that Sail
near that Iſland, and have occaſion for any of
thoſe things, goe and fetch 'em from that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
leaving the value in other Commodities,
with which their Veſſel is beſt provided. All
Nations, even the <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves, goe thither
for what they want; and 'tis ſaid, that if they
fail to leave a Compenſation, their Ships can ſtir
no farther, let the Wind be never ſo favourable.
We are aſſur'd, that ſeveral have known this to
be true by many Tryals. However it be, that
Chappel is hewen out of a Rock; and ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from thence, there is a Spring of excellent
freſh Water, which will keep ſweet a long time
at Sea.</p>

As for <hi>Sardigna,</hi> there are not ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
to be made upon that Iſland. All that I
can ſay of it is, that 'tis an Iſland in the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi>
Sea, with the Title of a Kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who Governs it
by a Viceroy. The Air is ſo thick, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſuch perſons were baniſh'd thither, as the
State had a mind to be rid of; that there is a
Breed of Great Dogs there, bigger then the
Dogs in <hi>England;</hi> and ſuch an infinite number
of Rats, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> has enjoyn'd all
the Owners of Houſes, to keep as many Cats
as they have Rooms.</p>
                     <p>The Ancient <hi>Sardignians</hi> had a Law, which
ordain'd, that the Sons ſhould knock out their
Parents Brains, when once they came to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perannuated,
for fear the Infirmity of their
Minds ſhould incline 'em to commit Faults pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to their Families or the Government.</p>

                     <p>THis Iſland is ſeated to the North of <hi>Sardigna</hi>
from whence it is ſeparated by a Channel
that may be Sail'd over in an hour, and lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the 40 and 42 Degree of Latitude, and
between the 31 and 32 of Longitude. The lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
extent of it from South to North, is about
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:32919:164"/>
40 Leagues, 20 Broad, and in Circuit about
Fourſcore and Ten. It is ſaid to have been ſo
call'd from a Woman of <hi>Liguria,</hi> whoſe Name
was <hi>Corſa Bubulca,</hi> who carried thither a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
out of her own Country.</p>
                     <p>The Iſland of <hi>Corſe</hi> has belong'd to the <hi>Genoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
ever ſince the year 1559. at what time
<hi>Henry</hi> II. Granted it to 'em, at the requeſt of
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> after the Battel of St. <hi>Quintin.</hi>
Nevertheleſs, the People are not pleas'd with
their Government; and the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> on the other
ſide, who are afraid of their Revolting, or leſt
ſome Foreign Power ſhould make themſelves
Maſters of it, do as much as in them lies to lay
it waſte; and give out, that the Air is too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome
for People that are not bred there;
Beſides that, the Soil is ſo ungrateful, that it will
hardly return the Seed that is ſown in it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
'tis certain that this is ſpoken, either out of
Malice or Sloth; for that it brings forth Corn,
Wine, and all ſorts of Fruits, more then ſufficient
the Inhabitants; that it produces good Horſes,
and Timber for Shipping; and that there are in
it ſeveral Mines of Copper, Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Baths
and Mineral Fountains; among which, that of
<hi>Povera</hi> in the Province of <hi>Ampugnano,</hi> cures the
Dropſie; Beſides that, they fiſh for Coral upon
the Coaſts.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, this Iſland might be made a place
of great Trade; for that there is no want of
good and convenient Havens; of which, the
chiefeſt are <hi>San Fiorenzo, Ajacho,</hi> and <hi>Porto Vec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio,</hi>
big enough to contain whole Fleets. The
Firſt was formerly Fortifi'd by the <hi>French;</hi> but
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:32919:164"/>
the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> have demoliſh'd the beſt Works,
having left nothing but the Foundations, which
are of Free-ſtone.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Corſes</hi> are good Soldiers, very ſtrong, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſlothful, and no leſs revengeful; ſo that upon
their Death-beds they recommend the revenge of
Injuries done 'em to their Kindred. Thô there
be Five Biſhopricks in the Iſland, yet there is
but one conſiderable City, which is <hi>Baſtia,</hi> the
Metropolis of the Country and Reſidence of the
Governor. There are but Five hundred Men
in the Pay of the Republick for ſecurity of the
whole Iſland; ſo that it might be an eaſie thing
to ſurprize it, eſpecially for thoſe that are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
at Sea then the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> are.</p>
