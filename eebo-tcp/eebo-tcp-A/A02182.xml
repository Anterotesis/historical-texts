         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

answered by M. GREENHAM
a learned man.</head>
            <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is harder to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of worldly
meanes, than it is
in the wante of
them; for they as
it were are vailes
set betwixt God
and vs, they stay our sight in them that it
cannot pearce to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Heathen men were humbled by
their dreames, wee are not humbled by
the worde: they that will not profite by
Gods judgments in other, shal feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
we haue no claime to Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
offered in the Gospell, vntill wee be
humbled by his threatning in the Lawe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If wee go on still in sinne, God will
go on still in judgment: but if our hearts
<pb facs="tcp:21029:3"/>
relent from sinne, God will release his
sentence of punishment.</p>
            <p n="4">4 As the Gospell first began by simple
Fisher-men to bee preached, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
being received in loue, grewe to
the other more learned sorte: so, for not
receiving the worde in loue, but hauing
our eares tickling to newe doctrine, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies
and sects beginning now amongst
vs but in the simpler sort, and ignorant
men of the cuntrie, are like to invade the
best learned. And God purposing to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the coldnes of our age, can aswell
now send an hereticall spirite, not onelie
into the common people, but into 400.
learned Preachers, as he did in times past
send a lying spirit into 400. Prophets.</p>
            <p n="5">5 If we think wee may speak, wee will
speak toe soone: if we may keep silence,
wee will hold our peace toe long, when
we much loue the persons to whome we
speake, wee flack our zeale in rebuking of
sinne: if we be zealous against sinne, we
flack our loue to the person.</p>
            <p n="6">6 As in marriage, though the parties
met in the flesh without any sanctified
<pb facs="tcp:21029:3"/>
means, to assure themselues to be joyned
of the Lord: yet if God afterwarde giue
them grace to liue holilie in their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
he sheweth not only that their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
meeting is pardoned, but that nowe
their meeting is blessed. So, if entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a calling for want of guifts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we haue no assurance at the first of a
warrantable calling: yet if GOD after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
furnish vs with able gifts, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
vs with pure mindes, hee doth not
onely shewe vs that our former sinne is
pardoned, but also that he is well pleased
with this calling wherevnto he hath bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vs.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Sathan vnder the colour of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
bringeth many into an extreame
sadnes, and stricktnes in vsing the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of God: againe, vnder pretence of
Christian libertie, and delivering of men
from extreme griefes, hee allureth them
to an vnmoderate and an vnsanctified
mirth and intemperate vse of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of God: so blinding judgment, hee
after corrupteth affection.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The best art of memorie, is to bee
<pb facs="tcp:21029:4"/>
humbled at Gods threatning, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
at his promises: for sure it is, that
exceeding griefes or exceeding joyes,
leaue great impressions in vs.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The best art of Logick is to reason
<hi>E converso,</hi> out of that saying of PAVL.
<hi>There is no Temptation hath overtaken you,
but it hath overtaken others.</hi> And to say
thus, There hath no temptation overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
others, but the same may overtake
vs: This will teach vs to speak charitablie
and profitably of other mens infirmities.</p>
            <p n="10">10 We may not go to see vngodlines
to breed a greater detestation of it in vs:
for first, in respect of our selues, for presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a thing not warranted, it is the
just judgment of God, that wee should
learne to fall into that sinne whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we were ignorant. Secondly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of our brethren it is vnlawfull: for
if they be strong, we offend them; if they
be weake, we mis-lead them. Thirdly, in
regard of Gods glorie, it is vnlawfull; for
such should be our zeale therevnto, if
not having hereticall spirits, by the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Gods spirit to speak against it, yet
<pb facs="tcp:21029:4"/>
that we should not once see such a thing.</p>
            <p n="11">11 As natural men vse Gods creatures
to stirre vp a naturall comfort, so spiritual
men should vse them to stir vp some spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
comfort, and to stir vp godly joyes
in themselues: for as Sathan seeing men
of a sanguine complexion and sanctified,
laboureth to mix with their spirituall joy
a carnall joy: so seeing some of a malan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick
complexion sanctified, to haue
spirituall sorrowes, hee striveth to bring
vpon them carnall sorrowes.</p>
            <p n="12">12 If you desire to heare the worde
with profit, obserue these things; before
you go to the Church humble your selfe
in praier to God, that hee may prepare
your vnderstanding, affection, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
to receiue; and that the Preacher
may speake to your conscience.</p>
            <p n="13">13 After in hearing with some short
praier, apply the severall thretnings, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and instructions, to your owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state:
when you are come home from
hearing, change all that you remember
into a praier, and desire God that you
may remember it most, when you shuld
<pb facs="tcp:21029:5"/>
practise it, and vse to teach others, and to
conferre of all things remembred: It is a
good thing, to remember a thing dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
and the reason of it.</p>
            <p n="14">14 Let vs not complaine of the want
of Discipline, but be thankful for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
we haue: it is the Lords wil, even
in this want of Discipline to advance his
owne glory, in taking that to himselfe,
which otherwise we would attribute to
Discipline: for besides that, he doth that
by his word and praier, which may bee
done by Discipline: it may be discipline
wold hide many hypocrites which now
are discovered, and cover many christian
true hearts which now are knowne: for
they that are godly nowe are godly of a
conscience, being a discipline to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
but many may seeme godly in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
which doe it of feare and not of
loue.</p>
            <p n="15">15 No trouble shoulde hinder vs in
our calling, vnlesse it be in cace of meare
vngodlines: for if for every troble or for
many troubles a man may forsake his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
he should be out of any calling, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
<pb facs="tcp:21029:5"/>
as every calling hath his lettes
and troubles.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Though all exercises of pure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
purelie vsed, doe strengthen judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and whet vp affection, yet reading
hearing, and conferring, do most streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
judgment, and in part whet on affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
But praying, singing, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
do most chiefly whet vp affection,
but in part strengthen judgment and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
            <p n="17">17 As a loving husband will not take
away his loue from his wife for some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
wants, so long as shee keepeth her
loue wholly and truly vnto him: So the
Lord will not cast off his loving kindnes
to vs for speciall wants, or frailtie in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
commandements, so long as we ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
labour to please him.</p>
            <p n="18">18 One being curteouslie saluted,
and worthelie commended of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
who said, she heard a very good
report of him; he answered her, the like
haue I heard of you; but God make our
after fruites of his spirite more effectuall
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former; or else we shal not answer
<pb facs="tcp:21029:6"/>
the glory of God, and good opinion of
his Saintes conceiued of vs.</p>
            <p n="19">19 The wicked that dare not boldly
professe iniquitie, redeeme times secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to commit it, so though we haue not
the strength to professe Religion publict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
yet let vs redeeme times secretly to
frequent the exercises of Religion.</p>
            <p n="20">20 To a Courtier complaining of the
occasions of evill, he saide: Though you
haue occasions of sinne offered, yet the
cause of sinne is still in your selfe.</p>
            <p n="21">21 Sometimes in a good action, vsing
good meanes with an vpright heart to a
lawfull end, yet our prayers be vnfrute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and our labours want successe: then
let vs remember, that in all these there
were secret imperfections, and that the
Lords deferring is, that wee being better
prepared by humilitie to be thankfull, he
may grant our requests in richer manner
and measure.</p>
            <p n="22">22 Where there is an immoderate
care of outward things, there common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
is little care of inwarde good things;
for if one haue inward good things, they
<pb facs="tcp:21029:6"/>
so content the persons that haue them,
that they labour not much for outwarde
things: if they want them &amp; desire them,
the carefull seeking of them, bringeth a
godlie neglect of outward things.</p>
            <p n="23">23 Ministers shoulde most frequent
those places, where God hath made their
ministerie most frutefull: they shoulde
heerein be like the covetous man, that
where they haue once found the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of gaining of soules, thither they
should be most desirous to resort.</p>
            <p n="24">24 Let their advice be a generall prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of Phisick: First, the parties af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
are to labor to haue peace of their
consciences, and joy of the holy Ghost,
through the assurance of their sinnes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
in Christ; then carefull must they
be to vse the meanes, which may nourish
their inward peace &amp; joy: Thirdly, they
must rejoice and recreate themselues in
wisdome and well doing with the Saints
of God, and holy company; and lastly,
they must refresh themselues with Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin
phisick, and a thankfull vsing of the
creatures of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21029:7"/>
25 When one saide to him after long
conference and praier; Sir, I haue troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
you, oh my brother: Not so, said he,
I never felt it by well doing, and if I may
pleasure you, it is as joyfull to me as ever
it was to you to receiue money; for, for
this cause I liue.</p>
            <p n="26">26 His loue ever grewe to a man, as
he knewe the man to growe in godlines,
&amp; his loue decayed as the graces of God
decayed: first he was greeved, and then
his loue was flacked.</p>
            <p n="27">27 Vnto one that was tempted with
much vnbeliefe, hee gaue this counsell;
When the temptation commeth, either
fall downe in praier, and say, Lord thou
makest mee to possesse the sinnes of my
youth, and this temptation is very equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
howbeit, oh Lord, graunt I may by
wisdome herein, make this temptation
an holy instruction, and suffer me to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
my soule in patience: oh turne this
to thy glory and my salvation: I see and
confesse what hath beene in mee a long
time, by that which now sheweth itselfe
in me, and that thy grace hath altogether
<pb facs="tcp:21029:7"/>
hitherto kept vnder this corruption: yet
Lord I beleeue, Lord yet I will beleeue,
helpe Lord my vnbeleefe, thy name bee
praised, for this seale of thy loue, and
pledge of thy spirit; that in this vnbeliefe
I am grieved as in my beliefe I am wont
to be comforted, and though my former
ould and secrete sinnes, deserue that I
should not onely be given over to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie,
but also that it should be in mee
without griefe &amp; remorse, yet Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
my sinnes newe and ould, forgiue
my vnthankfulnes, Lorde increase my
faith, and grant good Father, when thou
shalt restore to mee this guift of grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
that I may vse it in feare; and shew
it by fruites. Or if this doe not prevaile,
giue your selfe with all humblenes to
reade the worde of God, especially,
his promises, and bee still attending
vpon the meanes, wayting when the
Lord shall inlarge your heart. Or if this
do not help, go to some faithfull brother,
confesse yourselfe to him, acknowledge
your weaknes to him, &amp; be not ashamed
to giue God the glory by shaming your
<pb facs="tcp:21029:8"/>
selfe, and opening your corruption to
him, that so hee may pray for you, whose
praier according to the promise of God,
made to his holy ordinance, herein <hi>Iames
5.</hi> vndoubtedly shall be heard in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
time: Thus having prayed by
yourselfe, and with another, and vsed
the meanes of reading for your recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
though you haue not present reliefe,
yet in meeknes of mind and patience of
your spirite, go to your calling, knowing
that your praiers and the word of God,
being as seede, must haue some time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the sowing of them, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of the increase and fruite of them.
Aboue all: reason not with your temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
dispute not with the Devill, as
though you could prevaile of yourselfe,
and as I would not you shoulde dispute
with your temptation, so I woulde not
you shoulde despise it and make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it; for in both are extremities.
If you take it toe much to heart, or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
howe you should overcome such a
temptation, it will make you dull or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate:
If you account of it toe little, and
<pb facs="tcp:21029:8"/>
maruell howe such things should come
into your head, which was not woont to
be so, it will make you not to striue, and
you shall be swallowed vp before you be
aware: If you account of it toe fearfully,
Sathan will oppresse you before you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
to fight; If you account of it toe
lightlie, the devill needes not to wrestle
with you, you wil overcome yourselfe?
Fight boldly in Christ, tremble at your
owne corruption; but rest and trust in
Christ your salvation: If stil you ar temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and no bodye by you, write your
temptation, and offer it to God by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and promise to him, that you will ask
counsell at his word, at the mouth of his
Minister, when he shall giue you just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion:
If all this help not, comfort your
selfe with this pledge of Election, that
you are joyed when you feele your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,
and you are grieved, lest you shuld
displease God by your vnbeleefe; and
knowe, that as there is a vicissitude of
the meanes of salvation, which you
must vse; so there is also a vicissitude of
temptations, whereof this is one, against
<pb facs="tcp:21029:9"/>
which you must striue.</p>
            <p n="28">28 Vnto one that was tempted with
worldly shame, and thought the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature
of his mind proceeded thereof,
hee saide on this sorte; first knowe, that
Sathan hath no absolute power, but a
power by permission to trye vs, against
which, we must arme our selues by faith,
which will assure vs, that either the Lord
will mitigate our temptation if our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and patience be not great; or else, if he
enlarge the tryall, hee will increase our
strength according to the portion of our
temptation; wee must also pray, that the
Lord giue not out that measure of leaue
to the devill, which we giue out to sinne
to work rebellion in vs against his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie;
but that hee would rather make Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
a Surgeon to shewe vs our sinnes,
than Sergeant to confound vs for them.
It is the pollicie of the adversarie, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
many, that the weaknes of their
bodie, and feeblenes of their braine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
of their temptations, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it commeth of their vnstaid minds,
wandering toe much after the motions
<pb facs="tcp:21029:9"/>
of the devill, in that they not resting on
the word, nor depending on Christ, nor
contenting themselues to be tryed, nor
comforting themselues by meditation,
attend toe much, and conferre with the
devils illusions and temptations, being
more greved for their present sufferings,
than for their sinnes past. The roote of
this wordly shame, is pride and haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of minde, which is a privie evill, and
hardly will be beaten into the heade of
them that are infected with it; but sure it
is, that we would neuer be so grieved for
the losse of a thing, if wee did not toe
much desire it, and toe immoderatlie vse
it, whilst wee had it. <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 42. Which
sinne of haughtines, the Lord seeing in
his children, that they are more humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
with the losse of worldly credit, than
with the sence of their sinnes, and losse
of his glory; hee striketh them with the
wante of that thing which is most preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
vnto them, because they made no
conscience of that honour which is most
precious vnto him: wherefore this is the
best remedie, rather to be greved that we
<pb facs="tcp:21029:10"/>
feele not our sinnes to be pardoned with
God, than that we are knowne to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
amongst men, and that we be readie
to shame our selues that God may haue
the glory; acknowledging, shame, and
confusion, and the whole hell of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to be due vnto vs; and glory, praise
and compassion, to be the Lords: for this
is a speciall mark of the child of God by
temptations rightly humbled, when hee
is ready to shame himselfe for his sinne,
and to glorifie God in his mercie.</p>
            <p n="29">29 Vnto one that thought himselfe
to haue sinned against the holy Ghost,
he said, Sathans temptations followe our
affections: for if wee lightly account of
sinne, hee bleres our eies still with Gods
mercies; if we beginne to make a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of sin, hee loadeth vs with the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, being as ready now to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
the sin, more than it is in it selfe,
as before he would extenuate it to make
it seeme lesse than it was; howbeit, saide
he to the man thus afflicted. I wil say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you as <hi>Samuel</hi> said to the people after
they had confessed themselues to haue
<pb facs="tcp:21029:10"/>
sinned against God with a great sinne.
True it is said <hi>Samuel,</hi> not flattering them
in their iniquities; Ye haue sinned great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie:
notwithstanding, if ye will feare the
Lord, and serue him, and heare his voice,
and not disobey the worde of the Lord,
ye shall followe the Lord your God; but
if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord,
but disobey the Lords mouth, then shall
the hand of the Lord be vppon you. 1.
<hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. So I will not lessen your sin,
but I say you haue sinned with a greate
sinne before the Lord, in that you made
a mock of the worde which you knewe;
yet if you turne to the Lord in feare and
serue him, your sinne is remissable, how<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>soever
Sathan charges your conscience,
in that you haue done evill against your
owne knowledge, and in that you are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide
lest that sinne be in you, and wold
rejoyce in God, if it were not in you: If
you purpose to leaue your former sinns,
and in trueth to turne vnto the Lord; I
dare assure you, that as yet you are free
from that sinne.</p>
            <p n="30">30 When a gentlewoman asked him
<pb facs="tcp:21029:11"/>
if hee were not sometimes merrie: Yes
saith he, wee are often merry, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we are afraide of our mirth.</p>
            <p n="31">31 When we distrust of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
let vs set before vs the example of
his mercie done to others; that wee may
be the more assured to obtaine faith; and
when we begin to presume, let vs set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs the examples of Gods judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
that we may pray for humilitie.</p>
            <p n="32">32 Being desired to giue his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a waightie matter, he answered:
Sir, neither am I able to speak, nor you to
heare; for that wee haue not praied: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I may talk and you answer, as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
men; but wee are not now prepared
to conferre as the children of God.</p>
            <p n="33">33 Wee may thus trie our mourning
for the sinne of others: First this sorrowe
for sinne must be bred for our own sins,
and from our selues proceede to the sins
of others. Secondly, the measure of our
mourning must be agreable and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to the sinnes. Lastly, our griefe
must to be for the person, that we be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
rather to pittie and praye for him,
<pb facs="tcp:21029:11"/>
than to hate or despise him.</p>
            <p n="34">34 Vnto one that with many words
disabled himselfe; hee saide meekly: oh,
why doe you seeke so much your owne
praise; for by this, ye bewraie the privie
corruption of nature, that by toe open a
dispraise, desireth toe privie praise.</p>
            <p n="35">35 It is not good to vse that for a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
which is prescribed for Phisick; for
that will not work in the extraordinarie
neede of the body, which is vsed in the
ordinarie cause of health.</p>
            <p n="36">36 Seeing a godly man having his
sonne in his armes, whome hee loued
tenderlie; he said to him, Sir, there is the
matter of your rejoycing, God make it
the matter of your thanks-giving.</p>
            <p n="37">37 After one had asked his advise for
sitting, or kneeling at the Lords Table; he
said, as for such things, let vs doe asmuch
as wee can for the peace of the Church;
lest wee make the remedie of the evill,
worse than the evill it selfe.</p>
            <p n="38">38 To one that said he was possessed
of a devill; he answered, as hoping that he
was the child of God, and rather delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:21029:12"/>
than afflicted: True it is, that in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as lieth in you, you haue given
your selfe over to the devill: but it is not
in your power, to giue over your selfe to
him; neither is it in his jurisdiction to
possesse you.</p>
            <p n="39">39 Hee rebuked publicklie a publick
offence of a private man in this manner.
My brethren, such a sinne hath passed
from this place, the guiltles neede not to
be offended, the person guiltie is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of it.</p>
            <p n="40">40 Because God worketh the sence
of sinne by degrees in his children, hee
suspected them, who at every sinne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
would shew themselues forthwith
troubled.</p>
            <p n="41">41 Many having escaped out of the
gulfe of superstitions, are toe deep plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in prophanesse.</p>
            <p n="42">42 Being asked howe a man might
reprehend, he answered: First, looke that
you haue a ground out of the worde for
reproving, then look if it stand with your
calling to reproue; afterward consider if
some other man may doe it more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
<pb facs="tcp:21029:12"/>
than you; then look before whome
you reproue, lest yee hinder the credit of
the partie with his friends, and increase
his discredit with his foes: and againe, if
by all occasions of calling, person, tyme,
and place, the Lord hath put you in this
place to rebuke sinne; consider you must
put on you the person of the offender,
that as you spare not his sinne, because of
the zeale of Gods glory, so you presse it
not toe farre, because of compassion to a
brother: then look that with these, your
heart be right in zeal and loue, and so call
for Gods assistance, before you speak his
grace in speaking, and for his blessing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
your speaking, if any thing be left out
that might haue beene profitable: please
not your selfe in it, but be humbled for
it, though some infirmities be in you: yet
shall they not do so much hurt, as Gods
ordinance shall do good.</p>
            <p n="43">43 Because great natural and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
sorrowe and joye, will cause a man to
break his sleep at midnight: he wold trie
himself, whether sorrow for sin, and joy
in salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had caused him to do the like.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21029:13"/>
44 He rejoyced to see his friends, but
hee was humbled in that hee rested so
much in that joye, that he forget to doe
the good to their salvation, or to receiue
good from them to his salvation, which
he thought he should do.</p>
            <p n="45">45 One asking what hee thought of
Fayries: hee answered, he thought they
were spirits; but hee distinguished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them and other spirites, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
men distinguish betweene good
witches and bad witches.</p>
            <p n="46">46 His greatest sorrowe was, when
either he spake of some good thing that
was not on himselfe, and the greatest joy
he had was in the contrarie.</p>
            <p n="47">47 He vsed this tryal in his affections,
as of anger, griefe, joy, or such like in this
manner; if by them he was made lesse fit
to pray, more vnable to do the good hee
should doe, lesse carefull to avoid sinne,
then he thought it carnall and filthie, and
not of God: but when his anger, loue,
grief, and other affections provoked him
more to praye, made him fitter to doe
good, than he thought his affections sent
<pb facs="tcp:21029:13"/>
to him, to be as the blessing of God.</p>
            <p n="48">48 He said, whensoever he suspected
and feared any evill to come vppon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he ever had a desire to be delivered
and deceived of his opinion, and that he
would be glad to beare the shame of his
priuy jealousie, so as the person suspected
might turne to God.</p>
            <p n="49">49 He thought all afflictions, to bee
puttings of him to God fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> slothfulnes.</p>
            <p n="50">50 Vnto one afflicted in minde, hee
gaue this comfort: First, if you haue
knowledge, be thankfull for it, and desire
the Lord to giue you faith: if you haue
faith, which vndoubtedly you may haue
though not rightly discerning your self,
you presently perceiue it not: you must
waite on the Lord for feeling of it; and
though it may be you shall tarrie the
Lords leasure long, yet surely hee will
giue it you in time: in the meane time,
assure your selfe, that the greatest faith is
when there is least feeling; because it is
easie for every one in glorious feelings,
and joyes vnspeakable to beleeue: but
when a man feeling no sensible comfort
<pb facs="tcp:21029:14"/>
in the Lord, can notwithstanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in the Lord, and by faith waite on
him, this mans faith is most great.</p>
            <p n="51">51 To one that asked his advise, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he might avoid the doing of a thing
whereunto he was called, because he felt
corruption in himselfe: he said, In avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
societie, you shal cover but not cure
your infirmities; and though you depart
from men, yet you cannot goe out of
your selfe.</p>
            <p n="52">52 He gaue this advise to one, against
the deadnes of the mind that overtaketh
the godly: First, search the cause, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be for some evil thing done, or for
some good thing not done, so leaving
some meanes of salvation vnvsed; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for some sinne seene, but not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of; or some sinne repented of, but not
soundly, or for vnthankfulnes: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
vse the remedie, please not your selfe
in it, but rouse vppe your selfe as from a
slumber, which willingly you woulde
shake from you: call to minde the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and greatest mercie of God, vse the
meanes. Thirdly, in the meanes offer thy

selfe to God, waiting, humbly, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
for the time of deliverance, neither
esteeming toe much or toe little of thy
afflictions.</p>
            <p n="53">53 He said to one that for want of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
was loath to pray; you must not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to pray vntill you find feeling, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
your selfe vp into the handes of Iesus
Christ; and so humbling your selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

waking: or a man wandering in the dark,

you haue done great good things whilst

that deceiveth and disquieteth many;
they look for that remisse in them, which
they had when Gods spirite wrought in

and beeause there is some intermission of

that because wee haue not even present

<pb facs="tcp:21029:16"/>
we never had them heretofore, or that

because on the earth are some good men,

            <p n="58">58 He said, although hee was subject

with suffering worldly thoghts to seaze
on vs; our minde will be so forestalled,
and praeoccupated with them, that wee
cannot easilie and roundly gather vp our
affections afterwards to Gods worship:
for this is a sure note, that he which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrateth
the first fruites of the daye in

hee is checked, either with his first mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

or hee is controulled by the latter and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening

            <p n="76">76 As wee are carefully to vse the
means of our salvation, so must we whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
referre the blessing of the meanes to
the grace of God: neither as some doe
thinke, that wee can obtaine or continue
<pb facs="tcp:21029:22"/>
the graces of God in vs without vsing of
the meanes: for that is but a dreame of
fantasticall spirits? neither as the manner
of some is, so to trust to the means, as neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting

of such as are not rightly instructed in the

            <p n="77">77 It is a most certaine thing in Gods

            <p n="78">78 It is a profitable note to obserue,
when extraordinary gifts of God be for

then it is of Gods mercie: but if they
slacken our care in the ordinarie meanes,
and puffing vs vp with a spirituall pride,
cause vs to rest in them; then they are for
our farther condemnation: as if God

any thing, if we are driven more to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

            <p n="79">79 As the Lord doeth feede poore

though they desire more food, can haue

and suffereth some to rot in ignorance,
who beeing at the full measure of the

            <p n="80">80 Of all sacrifices, most acceptable is
that of thanks-giving; and therefore, in
many wordes the Saintes of God haue
<pb facs="tcp:21029:23"/>
vowed, and entred into bandes with the
Lord to paye this oblation; both to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the vntowardnes of nature which
is so vnwilling of this, as also to shame
themselues more, if happely they growe
herein negligent; in which repetition of
their vowes and promises, which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
their great desire of their hearts (for,
looke what one delighteth in, hee often
speaketh of it, and in many wordes) they
declare, that as even in things agreable to
nature, wee will helpe our delight by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
speaking and repeating of them; so
much more this help is requisit in things
aboue nature, and among all the partes
of godlines which are aboue nature; and
chiefly in thankes-giving; which is more
contrarie to nature: for we will pray oft
for a thing, but hardlie giue thanks once,
&amp; yet experience proveth in civil things,
that of all arguments to perswade one to
giue vs a guift, none is more eloquent or

            <p n="81">81 The cause why our meditations &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:21029:24"/>
praiers are no stronger in the night, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we joyne not with meditation, the
examination of our heartes vppon our
beddes, which if wee did in some trueth,
it would keepe vs from drowsines, and
want of reverence in our praiers; aswell
as worldly men ar kept waking, by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on worldly matters: heere wee are
taught by <hi>Davids</hi> example, when wee
wante the more solemne and glorious
meanes in dignitie, to make a supply by
often and sinceere vsing of such private
meanes as we can.</p>
            <p n="82">82 It is very hurtfull, that abuses haue
so long time beene declaymed, and the
true vses of things so slenderly vrged:
for though holy dayes haue justly beene
spoken against, yet the reverent vse of
the Sabboth hath beene little defended;
though superstitious fasts haue beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced,
yet true fasting is not imbraced:
though the carnall presence of Christ
hath beene confuted, yet the reall and
true presence of Christ hath not beene
established: though popish discipline
hath beene misliked, yet who so maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb facs="tcp:21029:24"/>
true Discipline, is thought to bee a
Pope in his owne parish: though popish
confession hath rightly beene banished,
yet christian confession is neither known
nor acknowledged.</p>
            <p n="83">83 Though we finde not the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
joye which we should feele, yet let vs
not be toe much cast downe; so that our
conscience tell vs, that wee are ready to
withdrawe somewhat from our outward
pleasures, for want of this inward plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and that we haue not prevented or
smothered out these spirituall joyes, but
are grieved that wee haue them not, and
waite for the time to feele them: for of
al things, we must beware, that we draw
not into their stead carnall joyes, and so
driue as it were exile the working of
Gods spirit in vs by them.</p>
            <p n="84">84 As it argueth great height and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes
to sinne, when men fearing to sin
in the day, redeeme, &amp; steale time to sin
in the night: so it sheweth a great height
and willingnes to godlines, when men
beeing not sufficiently contented to doe
good in the day, stretch their well doing
<pb facs="tcp:21029:25"/>
even to the night also; wherin they shew
themselues to be free from vaine glorie;
that none seeing them, yet they do good
for loue of God, and not for outwarde
things.</p>
            <p n="85">85 As by nature we are long and hard
to be brought to bee grieved; so being
once downe, wee are hard to get vp, and
to rise out of our griefe againe: for two
extremities attend vppon vs, the one to
bee grieved and feared toe little; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to be grieved and feared toe much:
the one makes vs secure, and the other
dead and dull. To meet with these two,
it is good in time of joye to thinke what
judgments haue befallen vs heretofore,
what may befall vs hereafter. In time of
humbling, we are to consider what mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
we haue received, and what mercies
are stored vppe, and tarry for vs againe:
and surelie, no one thing makes griefe
more to waste vs, than the forgetfulnes
of Gods mercies past, and the careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of them that are to come: though
mercies succeede mercies, yet the sea of
Gods mercies is never drawne drie, if

            <p n="86">86 Two things especially may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

            <p n="88">88 Because wee will not obserue one

which is a neere discipline.</p>
            <p n="89">89 There be some which haue peace
neither with God nor with themselues,

            <p n="90">90 As in prosperitie nothing is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
token of Gods favour than to feare
<pb facs="tcp:21029:26"/>
our selues, so in adversitie there is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
pledge of our conscience, when we
wait &amp; attend on the Lord for the time,
the manner and the measure of our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance:
There be foure properties of
this waiting: The first, to waite in our
soules. Many will not outwardly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
and yet inwardly they boyle and
fret: but where is quietnes of heart, there
can be no great disquietnes in the toung
or in the hand. The second, is to waite
on the word; for some will waite, but it
is to obtaine something the sooner, not
to shew their faith and obedience to the
word. The third, is to continue in it; if
we had a definitiue determination, how
many daies, or moneths, or houres wee
shuld waite, the end of our tearme draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neere wold sustaine vs: but it is hard
to leaue all moments and conditions to
the Lord, and to be in a continuall expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation:
but let vs consider howe justlie
God may suspend his answer in helping
vs; either in that our sinnes are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
bewailed, or our faith not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
purified, or his grace not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="tcp:21029:26"/>
wrought in vs. The fourth is by vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
in waiting, to be kept from faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
or fainting in hope: to bee vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in hope for a while is easie, but not
to slake the heat of our affections, and not
to be remisse and dead in the suite of our
desire, though no appearance of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
be seene; this is hard indeed: vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
argueth faith, and deferring of
our desire, doeth not breake our zeale in
waiting; it bewraieth want of faith, when
without al hope we are greedy, and rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
to haue our requests, or else we cast
all away.</p>
            <p n="91">91 Sathan hath two buffetings, when
by example we ar provoked to patience:
First, he smelleth of despaire, and telleth
vs that true it is; so did such men abide
trouble, but they were rare men, of rare
faith, of rare feelings, of rare patience;
God hath not called vs to that measure
of grace; wee are vnworthie, by reason of
our sinnes, to hope for the like faith, or
the like fruites of faith. This other temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
smelleth of pride, when hee will
make vs equal in dignity, with the highest
<pb facs="tcp:21029:27"/>
of Gods Saintes, but vnequall in duetie
with them; then he perswadeth vs, God
is as good to vs, as hee hath beene to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but he keepeth vs from vsing those
meanes whereby they had, and we shuld
haue the goodnesse of God convaied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs: wherefore, as we must not distrust
God, that we shall obtaine the like mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
with other, if we vse the same means;
so wee must not dreame, that wee shall
haue the like fruites with them, except
wee haue also the like faith with them,
though not in quantitie, yet in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
            <p n="92">92 Many dispaire of helpe, because
of their owne vnworthines, as though
there were no hope of Gods mercie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we bring in our guift, and pawne in
our handes to him; but this were to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite
the Lordes mercies, and to bring
in credite our merites; and rather to
binde the Lord to vs, than vs vnto him:
but if our sinnes be great, our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is greater; though our merits be beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerlie,
Gods mercie is a riche mercie:
If our cace bee not desperate, and wee
<pb facs="tcp:21029:27"/>
past hope of recoverie, our redemption
should not bee so plentifull, but when
all seemes to go one way; when Heaven
and Earth, the Sunne, the Moone, and
the Starres goe against vs; then to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
vs, and to make a perfect restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is to drawe something out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
even as in sicknesse, to haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
little daunger, or in greate daunger;
deliverance by present meanes, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
but in extreame perrell, when
Phisick can doe nothing, and nothing
maketh for vs but the Graue, then to
bee rescued from the graue, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
our life from the pitte is Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="93">93 There is nothing so pretious, as
Gods grace; which changeth the face of
Heaven and Earth; and nothing so vile as

            <p n="94">94 There are two working of Gods
Spirite in vs: the one inferiour, which
bringeth but certaine fruites of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
without any speciall fruite of grace:
the other superiour, and more certaine,
<pb facs="tcp:21029:28"/>
when the spirit worketh an infallible san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification:
the first, may totally be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and fully quenched: the other hath
but particular Eclypse, and in measure
may be dimned, as it was in DAVID <hi>Psal.</hi>
51. But this is not finallie quenched. As
God made man so that hee might fall,
though afterwards he had mercie vpon
him: so he regenerateth vs so, that wee
may fall, though afterwards he may raise
vs vp againe, and will. And it is fearefull
ynough, that there may bee such particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
decayes of it in vs, as to feel lesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in the word, lesse feare of sinne, lesse
care of well doing, lesse zeale in praying,
lesse fruites in the meanes; so that all our
actions are turned to bee bitter, which
were sweeter vnto vs than any worldlie
increase to the worldlie man, or honie
can be to them that loue it: these are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
tokens of the sanctifying spirite, to
loue good, because it is good; and to hate
sinne, because it is sinne: the more wee
growe in guifts, the more to hunger, the
more to complaine of our vnworthiness,
the more to be humbled in our selues, the
<pb facs="tcp:21029:28"/>
more meeklie to judge of others: when
we are most quiet with all things, then to
think our selues least quiet, &amp; then most
to feare out selues; so to feele the graces
of God in vs, and yet our sence and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of sinne is not lessened, and to feare
and quake at the first degrees and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of sinne; not lest they fully quench,
but lest they coole the heate of the spirite
in vs.</p>
            <p n="95">95 They whose knowledge is in swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
wordes, and painted eloquence of
humane wisdome, being but a doctrine
of the letter, in their death they are as if
they knewe nothing of Christ crucified:
and whereof comes it, that there is soe
much preaching, and so little learning?
but because men preach and delight to
heare plausible novelties to please the
eare, rather than the simple power of the
worde to pearce the heart; they take the
bone, and refuse the marowe; they are
content with the shell, but want the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell;
and not onely the Lawe killeth, but
even the Gospell also; that is, the letter of
the Gospell, being ministred without the
<pb facs="tcp:21029:29"/>
spirite: Aske the wounded conscience,
what comfort it is, to hear that Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for our sinnes: nay, ask if this gall not
as much as the Lawe it selfe, so long as it
is rather conceived by reason, than recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by faith.</p>
            <p n="96">96 As of all guifts, the guift of Gods
spirite is the dearest, so the losse of it is
most dangerous: for besides that, wee
know how few taste of it, and with what
paine they that haue gotten it keepe it;
and with what hard brunts they that lose
the graces of it recover them againe, wee
may conjecture the greatnes of the losse,
by our experience in other things: they
that haue beene in reputation for their
riches, and are become bankrupts, are
grieved and ashamed; how much more
then should their griefe be, who by the
riches of Gods graces haue beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
to themselues, and honourable
amongst others; and now by the decaye
of those guifts, haue lost both the sweete
peace and joye in themselues, and their
credite with God, and in the conscience
of the godlie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21029:29"/>
97 Wee must bee like Children in
three things chiefly: First in respect, little
babes. Secondly, in regard of innocents.
Thirdly, in respect of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from child-hood. First, babes are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
quiet, except the pappe bee in their
mouth; or else having late beene at it,
they are well fedde: so ought wee still to
desire to lye at the foode of our soules,
and to finde vnquietnes in our soules, if
wee be long from it. Secondly, wained
children, though they are not without
naturall corruption; yet this corruption
doeth rather shewe it selfe by imitation,
than by action: and if they doe any evill,
it is rather violent, than permanent:
Thus should wee be: Not making an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation
of sinne, but are occupated of
sinne; not forecasting patterns of sin, but
bend our minds how we may not sin; we
are violently drawne therevnto by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
rather than voluntarilie commit it
our selues. Thirdly, they that grow out
of child-hood do things beseming man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
rather than childishnes: so though
babish things both in life &amp; doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb facs="tcp:21029:30"/>
vs being babes, yet having passed
our child-hood, the Lord looks for more
manly ripenes both in knowledg &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
of life; thogh our perfect age be not
consummated before the resurrection.</p>
            <p n="98">98 As litle children, whether in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenes
to good, or reformablenes from
sinne, are either woone by afaire worde,
or allured by a trifling benefite, or awed
by a check, or feared by a frowning look,
or stilled by seeing another beaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, or else quieted with the rod:
So if we be children, either the promises
of God must affect vs, or the mercies of
God must allure vs, or his threatnings in
his word must awe vs, or his angry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
must feare vs, or his correcting
of others must humble vs; or else the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
of God vppon ourselues, must
pull vs downe: but as those children are
of most liberall and ingenious natures,
who are rather allured with faire words,
than driven to dutie with the rodde; for
they are most gratious, which are most
broken with the conscience of their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnes;
more provoked by the promises
<pb facs="tcp:21029:30"/>
of God, than by all the curses, thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
and threatnings of the Lawe: but
they that ar affected with neither dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
yet from the affection of children.</p>
            <p n="99">99 As milk moderately yeelded out
of the dugge, is naturall milke and good
nurishment; but being vnnaturallie pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
it is mixt with corrupt matter, and is
vnholesome meat: so a similitude meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
handled, giueth forth some doctrine,
but being hardly strained, it filleth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
not with naturall milk, but with
vnnaturall blood, as many haue abused
similitudes, with reverence and fear be it
spoken (as a ship mans hose) sucking out
poyson in steede of hony.</p>
            <p n="100">100 Though it be the good mercy of
God, both to mourne at <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
threatnings, and to daunce at Christ
Iesus his sweet promising and piping; yet
it is better to offer a voluntarie and free
sacrifice in respect of Gods mercie, as do
the Angels; than a violent and constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
obedience, as do the devils: and this
dare I say, that though the fearefull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of the curse, the wrath and the
<pb facs="tcp:21029:31"/>
judegment of God bee fearefull in the
Lawe, yet the denouncing of our sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from Gods kingdom, of the gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
worme, of the second death, is farre
more fearefull in the Gospell; which, by
howe much it is the more proper seate,
and treasurie of Gods mercies: so when
thunderings and lightnings do proceed
from thence, they are the more fearefull.</p>
            <p n="101">101 To knowe when the vse of the
doctrine is general, and when particular;
which is set downe in singular examples,
(because wee bring our necke out of the
yoke, or else tie the mercies of God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to them) three rules ar to be observed:
First, if we reade of any thing in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
wee are to search whether in some
other places of the Scriptures, the same
thing is not set downe generallie; that
is, whether that which is commended,
or discommended in some proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
be not commaunded or forbidden
to all; if it be, the vse of it is generall, not
particular; but if it bee a particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
joyned to some one, and noe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
found in the worde, that it is to bee
<pb facs="tcp:21029:31"/>
done of another; then it is a thing perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
proper to some, not generall, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to all. The second rule is, that
wheresoever there is a generall equitie of
a thing, there is a generall practise to bee
had; howsoever we see it set downe but
in particular. The third is, wheresoever
by the scope of the place there appeares
a generall drift, either by something go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before or comming after, though the
present place seemeth to bee particular,
yet there is a generall vse of the doctrine
to be gathered out of it.</p>
            <p n="102">102 Some thinke this is a high point
of patience, to exempt themselues from
all griefe: others eat vp their hearts with
griefe, as the flesh of the body is eaten vp
with a corrosiue; and so make themselues
dul stones, rather then feeling members:
the meane is not to be to quiet, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all griefe; or to bee vnquiet toe
much, as being without a GOD. For
the firste is marvelous, that Sathan in
times past being made knowne, onelie
by colours, by a flaming breath, by a
hollowe voice, by hornes and clawes,
<pb facs="tcp:21029:32"/>
and such sensible things, was muche
more feared, than nowe by the clearer
sight of the trueth being described, to be
a spirituall and greater adversarie, felt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee be seene, at hand before wee be
aware of him, and bold to set vppon the
best, even in their best estate; and yet is
lesse feared than before hee was. For the
second, it is marvelous hee should be toe
much feared, seeing hee hath but a deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
power, and therefore a limited pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and therefore a power least to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
If we feare him toe little, hee makes
account of vs without taking any greate
paines: if toe much, hee is the prouder
and bolder to take some paines about vs.</p>
            <p n="103">103 In afflictions we must search the
cause, first by ascending to God, then by
descending into our selues: first, we must
ascend to God, pleading guiltie, craving
mercy, and not stand quarelling with the
mallice of men, or hatred of the devill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs: for as it were no good wisdom
for a man condemned to dye, to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
long suite to the Iaylor, or to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner;
(for they be but vnder officers
<pb facs="tcp:21029:32"/>
and can doe nothing) but he must labour
to the Iudge, who can either repriue or
release him: so it is no good pollicie to
stand about Sathan in our temptations,
who doth all by constraint and restraint
vnder the Lord; but wee must go to the
principall, that is God; in whose handes,
are both the entrance and the issues of
our sufferings. Secondly, we must search
our selues, how farre either reason is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed,
or affections vnrenewed; kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the devil himselfe can never hurt
vs, vntill we haue hurt our selues; and in
what measure our reason is corrupt, or
our affections disordered; and in that
measure are wee weak, either to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of men, or of Sathan; and in what
measure our reason is sound, and our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
sinceere; in that measure wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
invincible.</p>
            <p n="104">104 We must pittie them that are in
griefe of spirit, though they be vnquiet;
it is an easie matter, when one desireth
much to be quiet with God, to be vnqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
with men, who oft hinder our quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
with God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21029:33"/>
105 Some afflicted consciences after some
deliverances, looke no more to bee
delivered: for as God is most liberall, so
we must not weary or make taedious his
bountifull dealing with vs: but the Lord
hath many deliverances in store, which
it is as impossible to waste, as it is, that
the Lord himselfe should be lessened, he
will make an end of his owne worke in
vs, for his owne glorie; which as hee
hath appointed to bee endles in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances,
so the meanes therevnto are
also endlesse; yea when wee seeme as it
were in a whirlepit, and to bee carried in
a violent gulfe of troubles we knowe not
whither, and are constrained oft to diue
and plunge downe, the waters of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
running over our head; yet the Lord
will recover vs and set our feet in steadie
places: if wee be cast downe, so wee can
but scraule vp againe: if we be resisted of
Sathan, so wee canne but kicke against
him; if wee canne but open our lippes,
and accuse his mallice before the Lord,
there is sounde hope of comfort to bee
founde of him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21029:33"/>
106 As it is but a small plesure, so long
as we are in the Garden, to bee delighted
with the smell of hearbs, vnlesse wee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of every kinde some to carrie with
vs; that so wee may haue the benefite of
the garden, though wee be farre from it;
and as it is but a small comfort, to bee
ravished with sweete odours, so long as
we are in the Apothecaries shoppe, and
afterward to want them: so it is but a
flattering joye, nay rather a starting joye,
no longer to be affected with the worde
and exercises of Religion than wee are
in the Church: therefore wee must ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heere and there, somewhat of the
things we heare, that may worke on our
affections, when wee bee farre from the

Since the time that I receiued <hi>M. S.</hi> Letter,
wherein he declared his carefull compassion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
your estate: I haue beene not a little grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
because partly for want of a convenient
messenger, and partly because of my manifolde
distractions with the like occurrances, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
waightie affaires, I haue beene hindred
<pb facs="tcp:21029:34"/>
from writing hitherto vnto you. And albeit
even still I be in the same cace, yet conscience
towards God, &amp; loue and compassion towards
you, forceth me to overcome letts, which hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
I could otherwayes prevaile against. And
albeit I cannot speake as I woulde, yet of that
which I shall write, proceeding from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
groundes; I looke for some blessing of
God through Iesus Christ: If you will not toe
much faint in faith, and yeeld to the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie;
yea if you will but hope so vvell of your
selfe as (in the feare of God I write it) I hope
of you. First, whereas it seemeth you are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
grieved, because you tarryed not still at
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> according to my advice; you
must know, that I advised it not as a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie,
but more convenient as I then suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
but yet as I advised you to obey your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if his pleasure still continued to haue you
home, wherevnto you yeelding, I cannot see
howe you offended, it being your Fathers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you should so doe. And who knoweth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being heere, you might not asmuch haue
beene troubled, there being no priviledge for
persons and places in such cases. And who
knoweth whether it be the Lords pleasure for
<pb facs="tcp:21029:35"/>
the example and instruction, and I hope the
consolation of others in the end. And albeit,
you wish that heere you were neerer the more
and stronger meanes, yet knowe you and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that God can and doeth in such cases,
worke by fewer and weaker meanes, according
to his good pleasure: besides, it is in our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nature to make much of such meanes as we
cannot haue, and not so to esteeme those which
God doth offer vs as wee should doe. I beseech
you therefore in the name of Iesus Christ, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to praise God for those meanes which hee
offereth in mercie vnto you, and to vse them in
faith accordingly; and so God will blesse you by
them: and then by such conference as you may
haue from hence by Letters, wherein if I may
stand you in any stead, rather for the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
you haue of me, than for any great matter
I am able to performe: I shall be ready to offer
my office of loue vnto you, as God shall enable

and hardnes of your heart, which cannot bee

or feare of his Iudgements; nor affected
with loue and delight of the things which bee

great cause you haue of griefe I confesse, but no
cause of dispaire doe I grant; because I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that your perswasion is somwhat false;
partly for want of a sounde iudgement in your

through your owne default. First there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
know you for a certaintie, that this is noe
other temptation, than such as divers of Gods
children haue for a time beene humbled with,
and afterwards haue had good issue thereout:
and if it please God to mooue you to credit me,
I my selfe haue knowne others as deepely this
way plunged as you can be: Remember there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that God is faithfull, and will not suffer
you to bee tempted aboue that which you shall
be able to beare. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. and yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to confirme you heerein, the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
do record, that this way God heeretofore
hath humbled his owne people, in whose person
the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> lamentablie thus complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
63. 15. <hi>O Lord, looke downe from
Heaven, and beholde from the dwelling

verse 6. <hi>We haue beene all as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane

as a Doue.</hi> And Psal. 51. 10. where <hi>David</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:21029:36"/>
cryeth, <hi>Create in mee, O God, a cleane
heart, and renue in me a right spirite: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
to me the joye of my salvation, and
stablish me with thy free spirite.</hi> Doth hee
not declare, that his heart was vncleane, that
his spirit was crooked, that the way of his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was lost, and himselfe subiect to the spirit
of bondage: so that wanting the spirit of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
or adoption, hee could not crye <hi>Abba</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor haue any power against sinne. Thus
you see howe Gods children may be blinded in
mind, and hardned in hart for a time: so that
they feele in themselues the graces of the holie
spirit, to be as it were perished and dead. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to releeue the infirmitie of your iudgment
in this part and point, (because I knowe it may
much distresse you) you must vnderstand there
be two kinds of hardnes of hart: the one which
is not perceiued &amp; felt, the other which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
&amp; felt: and of the former, that there be
two sortes: the first, which is most fearefull,
when any do purposely resist the motions of God
his spirit, &amp; willingly refuse the means of their
salvation: of the which <hi>Zacharie</hi> speaketh, 7.
11. <hi>They refused to harken, and pulled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the shoulder, and stopped their ears
<pb facs="tcp:21029:37"/>
that they shuld not heare; yea they made
their heart as an Adamant stone, lest they
should heare the Lawe, and the wordes
which the Lord of Hosts sent in his spirit
by the ministery of his former Prophets.</hi>
The outragious sinne of these men, the Prophet
<hi>Esay</hi> expresseth in these their owne fearefull
tearmes. 28. 15. <hi>Wee haue made a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with death, and we are at agrement
with hell; though a scourge run over and
passe through, yet it shall not come at vs;
for we haue made falshood our refuge, &amp;
vnder vanitie are we hid.</hi> This was a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
estate indeede: yet for all that, no man can
say, but some of them hauing hardened their
hearts, might be, and were afterwards conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
the other kind of hardnes of heart, which
is not felt nor perceiued, or if perceiued, yet not
felt, (which albeit is lesse fearefull, yet is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
enough) is in such, who although they
wilfully resist not Gods spirit in good meanes,
yet securely, carlesly, &amp; willingly they ly in sin;
and that without any remorse of it, or any tast
of good things. Such was <hi>Davids</hi> state by the
space of a yeare, before <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet
came to reprooue him, and rouse him from his
<pb facs="tcp:21029:37"/>
lulled sleepe: both these kindes I am perswaded
you are free from; other wayes than in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Sathan may sometimes mooue you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
The other kind of hardnes of hart, which
is perceived and felt, is of two sortes: the one in
them who are desirous of meanes, whereby to be
releeved; although they doe finde small or no
grace in themselues for a time: In this kind the
Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> in the want of some of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
complaineth. <hi>Esay</hi> 63. 15. And such was
<hi>Davids</hi> state after <hi>Nathan</hi> had reprooved
him, and Gods spirit began to work with him;
yet cryeth he out as ye heard before, of the losse
of Gods graces: and when hee saith, that God
will accept of no sacrifices, be they neuer so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or pretious, without a contrite heart &amp; bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
spirit: he shewed, that for a time (even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Prophet had reproued him) he wanted
both. This is your cace, and therefore in the
state of salvation: for <hi>David</hi> was in this cace
even after he had confessed his sin (as my trust
is you doe) and after he had receiued absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and pardon from God by the ministerie of
<hi>Nathan,</hi> although he never felt any ioy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
nor true griefe for the other: yet because in
truth of heart he confessed his sinne, as I hope
<pb facs="tcp:21029:38"/>
you do; and was certainly perswaded of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donablenes
of it by Gods mercy, as you must be
if you will haue mercie (although he was farre
of from feeling it, or applying it to his woefull
conscience) his state was good and very well to
be hoped of, and you must know, and be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of Gods Saintes; namely, of <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; such others, that they are ensamples
for vs, if wee will stay our selues vpon the word
of God in the ministery of his servants, and
wait vpon the Lords good time, vntil he come
neerer vnto vs by his spirite; neerer I say, for
he was come already vnto you (or it may be he
never went from you) because to be grieued &amp;
humbled with blindnes of minde and hardnes
of heart, to beleeue certainly the serva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God
which bring vnto vs glad tydings of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the truth of Gods promises in generall;
and to long after comfort, vsing the meanes of
the word, and praier; the Sacrament of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
&amp; the company of Gods children, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to hope vnder hope; yea without any present
feeling: all this is a certaine argument that
Gods spirite is with such, and therefore vvith
you. This estate though it be very grievous, yet
it is never dangerous, much lesse is it fearfull,
<pb facs="tcp:21029:38"/>
vnlesse any be so wilful, that they do perseuere
and continue in desperate refusing of all good
meanes. Vnlesse they persevere I say, for that
through the subtill sleights of the spirituall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarie
&amp; his forcible power, whereby God
suffereth him sometime for a season to winnow
them as wheat: they are so bewitched and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxecated,
that they are carried with violent
force of temptation to waxe weary of it, or to
refuse all kinde of comfort by fittes; yea almost
to haue no desire at all vnto them, yea some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
even to speak evill of them: but all this
is but in temptation, therfore God will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
vnto them for Christes sake. Thus <hi>Iob</hi>
cursed the daye of his birth, and wished to bee
strangled. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> almost repented that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he preached in the name of the Lord: both
scarsely abslaind from blasphemy. <hi>David</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with the spirite of ambition, though duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
admonished, yet wilfully went on in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the people. <hi>Peter</hi> also vaine-gloriouslie
presuming of his owne strength, beeing most
wisely &amp; effectually praemonished of his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
even by our Lord Iesus: yet vvittinglie
rusheth as an horse into the battell, and then
very cowardly yeeldeth and doublie denieth,
<pb facs="tcp:21029:39"/>
yea strengthneth his sinne with a threefolde
corde, and fastneth it with banning and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
and yet all these obtained mercy bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie:
for why, as Sathan had desired to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowe
them, so our Saviour Christ prayed for
them; that their faith, although it was batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
yet it should not be destroyed; although it
were sore oppressed, yet it should not bee extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.
And heere be you fullie perswaded,
that though <hi>Luke</hi> 22. the wordes seeme to
runne as belonging to <hi>Peter</hi> (I haue prayed
for thee, that thy faith should not faile) yet
that hee prayed as well for the rest of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
yea for all the faithfull: for first hee
saith not, <hi>Simon,</hi> Sathan hath desired to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowe
thee, but you: why then saith hee, I haue
prayed for thee? Verely, because he shuld more
grievouslie offend than the rest (althogh their
offence was very great) therefore his and our
most blessed Saviour applied to him the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
but did not appropriate it to him onelye
and restraine it from the rest: and compare
with this place, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 20. and you shall see
that the heauenly veritie affirmeth, that hee
prayed not onely for the Apostles, but for all
those that should beleeue through their worde:
<pb facs="tcp:21029:39"/>
Yea further, our Lorde Iesus Christ was yester
day, and to day, and shall be for ever. And as
the Fore-fathers were baptised into him, and
did eat his fleshe and drink his blood; so vvas
his prayer effectuall, even to them vnder the
Lawe, much more vnto vs vnder grace: and
vvhen you can finde testimonie of your heart,
that when you would do well, yet evil is present
with you, and that you do the evill you woulde
not: then doe not you it, but sinne in you, when
it leadeth you captiue. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Much more
then, when Sathan worketh with all, buffeting
you, assure your selfe that God hath pittie on
you, and that the vertue of his power shall bee
perfect in your weaknes. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. If you
beleeue, according to your faith be it vnto you;
but you will say, you cannot beleeue, that this
vile and crooked hardnes of heart, can bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
and renewed. And this was the second
point, within the former part of my Letter, I
gaue you to vnderstand, what was the cause of
your excessiue distresse. I besech you in the name
of our Lord Iesus Christ, that you will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
lye, nor offer iniury to Gods spirit, nor to
your selfe, who haue receiued it: tell me what is
the reason why you thinke you haue no faith?
<pb facs="tcp:21029:40"/>
verely because you haue no feeling nor noe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fruites thereof as you think: vvell, first
then agree with mee herein (as you must if you
will not disagree with the trueth) that feeling
is but an effect &amp; a fruite of faith: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there may be faith without feeling, as the
cause may bee without the effect, and the tree
without any appearance of fruite, yea of sap for
a season. And as a man sore wounded or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased,
may for a season be depriued almost of al
operations of the naturall life to the outwarde
shewe, and his owne iudgement and feeling: so
may a spirituall man bee sore wounded by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
and be diseased by present sight and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his sinfull corruptions; specially, in that
the life of the spirit ts not in him. Thus <hi>Peters</hi>
holie faile (as you haue hearde) or else the
prayer of our Saviour prevailed not. Thus
when <hi>David</hi> Psalm. 51. 12. declared that his
heart was vncleane, and his spirit crooked and
vnstable: and verse 14. that hee had lost the
ioye of his salvation, and the spirit of liberty or
adoption: yea vers. 13. hee prayeth that God
would not take his holy spirit from him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was not depriued of the spirit of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
Heere seemeth repugnance, but there
<pb facs="tcp:21029:40"/>
is none: he was depriued for a season of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the sanctifying spirit, but not of the holy
Ghost, wherewith he was sanctified: which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as God restored vnto him, so I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that he will vnto you: yea I doubt whether
you are deprived of them; but onely that part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
melancholie, and partly Sathan working
therewith, makes you do iniury to your selfe, &amp;
to the graces of the spirit in you, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you take heede of. But the Messenger
cannot stay, I therefore cannot write as I wold,
either of this, or of the remedies you shuld vse:
which hereafter I will, if God shall enable mee.
And I praye you, let mee vnderstand as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
in the beginning, of your estate in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
somewhat more, &amp; that by this bearer
if you can: because he is of your acquaintance,
and will bring it vnto me faithfullie. Onely I
adde nowe vnto that which I haue written of
hardnesse of heart at large, that you must dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
obserue the word <hi>Create,</hi> which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
vseth, Psal. 51. declaring howe he had no
feeling of his heart. To this ioyne that which
the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh in the persone of
God. 57. 3. <hi>I create the fruite of the lippes
to be peace, as well to him that is far off,
<pb facs="tcp:21029:41"/>
as to him that is neere.</hi> Therefore, in Faith
you may as well pray with the hope to obtaine,
as did <hi>David:</hi> therefore saye vvith him of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and vvith Gods people, <hi>Esay 64. 12. O
Lord, thou art our Father, wee indeede
are clay; but thou art our maker and wee
are the work of thine handes, &amp;c. Know
you, that God can cause Wolues, Lyons,
&amp; Leopards, &amp;c. wallowing with lambs,
calues, and kyne.</hi> Esay 11. 6. And that
vvhich is vnpossible vnto men, is possible vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, euen to cause a cable rope to go through
a needels eye: that is, to change the heart of the
vnbeleeuing, covetous, and vvretched man;
much more yours: yea, knowe you, that all
things are possible to him that beleeueth: Crye
then, <hi>I beleeue, oh Lord help mine vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe:</hi>
and I do promise you in the name of our
Lorde Iesus Christ, that you shall haue your
desire in goodnesse. Thus abruptlye I must
make an end, I commend you vnto God, and
the vvorde of his grace vvhich is able for to
builde you vppe, and to giue you the right of
inheritance amongst them vvhich are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.
And the very God of Peace, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
you throughout, that your vvhole spirit,
<pb facs="tcp:21029:41"/>
soule, and body, may bee kept blamelesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the comming of our Lorde Iesus Christ:
Faithfull is hee vvhich hath called you, and
vvill do it. I pray you pray for me, and I trust
as I haue, so I shall pray for you and
much more.</p>
