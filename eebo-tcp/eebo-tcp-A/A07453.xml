            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Paul ſayth,<note place="margin">Gala. v</note> is that that worketh by loue. Which loue is eſpecially expreſſed in miniſtering to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Saints, and our poore brethren<note place="margin">Rom. xij</note> as the ſame Paule affirmeth. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb facs="tcp:13539:4"/>
doth Dauid, for his part by theſe wordes as much as he can, trauel to bring vs to that purpoſe of faith, to ſhaw our loue to the poore when in theſe wordes he ſaith: Bleſſed is he that conſidereth the poore and the needy.</p>
            <p>As the tree is knowen to be good or bad by<note place="margin">Mat. vij</note> none other waies then by his fruites: ſo the faithfull, not by his wordes, but by his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes is knowen, in beleuing and woorkyng the thinges that belong to faith. Therefore our Sauiour ſaith: Not al that ſay Lord, but they that do the wyl of my Father, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth<note place="margin">Mat. vij</note> amongſt many thinges that this ſhould be one, namely to conſider the poore and the néedy. For us the vnſauery ſalte that looſeth his ſaltnes, is not fyt to ſeaſon, but to be caſt<note place="margin">Mark. ix</note> as reprobate and nought in the hye wayes, to be trode vnder foote: ſo is that faith dead, that hath no exerciſes in the way of loue, to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the poore, as James ſaith: Faith if it haue not her exerciſes in her ſelf, the is dead.<note place="margin">Jacob. ij</note>
            </p>
            <p>I ſpeake not this, as if a man ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he that wanting faith that teacheth to worke cannot be iuſtified, hauing the ſame faith now geuen, that hereafter wold work, as we ſee in children that haue not wrought, yet iuſtified by faith that is lyuely in them, and would haue wrought if they had lyued.
<pb facs="tcp:13539:4"/>
As alſo in the théefe that neuer wrought, be cauſe he wanted that faith by which now he is iuſtified, wherby he would haue wrought if he had lyued. Therefore doth faith onely iuſtifie in them that are preuented, that they cannot worke according to the ſame, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Grace maketh them frée. But to others that haue time, and therin alſo the iuſtifiyng fayth, they haue the frutes of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Neither do I ſpeake thus, as if God nedeth our workes or giftes, who geueth vnto vs firſt, and that with plenty, and caſteth no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the téeth, nor I ſpeake not to the end that we ſhould ſo worke, as to thinke our ſelues iuſtified therin, beyng as our Maiſter ſayth, vnprofitable ſeruantes, when we haue done<note place="margin">Luk. vij</note> all we can do, geuing out nothing, but what we haue receiued, as S. Paul ſaith. But this exerciſe of faith to geue to the poore, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs to ſatiſfie our bounden deutye, not for merite, but in dutie, becauſe the poore are left amongſt vs for this cauſe as Chriſt ſaith: Ye ſhall haue the poore alwayes with you.<note place="margin">John. xij</note> Which poore for vs, as the ritch for them are left, wherof S. Auguſtine faith: <hi>Propter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites</hi>
               <note place="margin">De ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis domi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ni ſer. 26.</note> 
               <hi>ſunt pauperes,</hi> that is, the poore are for the ritch mans ſake, which are to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as poore and needye, euen as Dauid deth

teach vs well.</p>
            <p>But to ariue to my purpoſe, theſe wordes of the Prophet contain two profitable notes The firſt to teach vs to reſpect the poore and needy, as becommeth the faithfull. Secondly to conſider the promiſe that is annexed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And of theſe I wyl ſpeake by Gods grace ſeuerally.</p>
            <p>Firſt, concernyng the reſpect and care of the poore, al be it that Dauid doth note it wel in this Pſalme, yet to the better ſatiſfying of ſo neceſſarye a deutye, that by the mouth of many witneſſes we maye the more ſpéedely be brought to the credite of the ſame, let vs heare the courſe of the ſcriptures, and learne our dutye forth of them.</p>
            <p>How earneſtlye doth God call vpon vs to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the poore by his ſeruant Salomen, as we reade in the Prouerbes wher he ſaith He that deſpyſeth his neyghbour, ſynneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<note place="margin">Pro. xiiij</note> hys Maker, but he that hath pyty on the poore, hee ſhall be bleſſed.

<pb facs="tcp:13539:5"/>
our eares againſt them, and therefore ſayth: He that ſtoppeth his eare at the crye of the<note place="margin">Prou. xij,</note> poore, ſhall cry him ſelfe and not be hearde. Nor he ſuffreth vs not to be careles of their<note place="margin">Luk. vi,</note> ſtate, being at eaſe our ſelues, as that Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton was me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in the Goſpel, but as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid his father willeth the poore to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo he concludeth ſaying: the bread of the<note place="margin">Eccle, 34</note> poore is in the waies of the ritch, he that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth it from them, is a man of bloud.</p>
            <p>Toby being a good inſtrument of God, and in this matter worthye to be beleued in hys counſell, who as he wel conſidered the poore in feeding of the liuing, and burying the dead with his own labour and coſt, ſo he teacheth others the ſame practiſe of duty whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith<note place="margin">Tobi. iiij</note> Be mercyfull after thy power, if thou haue much, geue plenteouſlye, if thou haue lyttle, do thy diligence gladly to geue of that little. For as God needeth not the gift, but requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the dutye: ſo Toby, not for the qualitie of the gift to be wayed, but in the quality of the minde of him that geueth, teacheth vs to geue ſomewhat, be it little or much, euen as S Ambroſe alſo teacheth: <hi>Non ſolum queri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:13539:6"/>
with what mynde, not to be prayſed for the greatnes, in that we geue not ſo much as we receiued, for what geueſt thou that thou haſt not receaued? Nor for the aboundance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">i, Cor, iiij</note> we haue more then néedeth, but for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requiring the ſame, we muſt of neceſſitie geue. And therfore as in ſubſtance God hath bleſſed vs with the moſt, ſo we muſt ſtudy to geue the more, not that God is pleaſed with ſummes, as though therby we ſhould thinke our ſelues iuſtified, but to diſcharge our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhips of that we haue receiued, accordyng to the ſaying of ſ. Paul writing to Timothe, Charge them that ar ritch in this world, that<note place="margin">i, Tim, vi</note> they be ready to gyue, and glad to diſtribute, laying vp in ſtore a good fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation for them ſelues againſt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> time to come, that they may attaine eternall life. Vnto whoſe wordes we may fitly for our comfort and erudition ioyn Sirackes ſaying: Reach forth thy hand vnto the poore, that thy mercy and bleſſing may<note place="margin">Eccle, vij</note> be made perfect.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Prophet Eſay ſpeaking vnto vs in the word of the Lord, amongſt many whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and neceſſary leſſons forgetteth not to put vs in mynde of our duty to the poore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a pleaſant thing to the Lord, and a fruit of our faith, and a token of Chriſtianty.
<pb facs="tcp:13539:6"/>
Therefore firſt he ſaith: When thou ſeeſt<note place="margin">Eſai. lviij</note> a naked man, couer him, and ſee thou deſpiſe not thine own fleſh. And after in the ſame place he ſaith: Breake thy bread vnto the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Geue, and it ſhall bee geuen you, ſaith he, by ſ.

He ſayd: Go ſell all that thou haſt,<note place="margin">Math. xix</note> and geue to the poore, not that it is neceſſary for euery man ſo to do, or that a man cannot be ſaued except he ſo do, but thereby teaching him particularly to lothe the world, ſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by vniuerſally ſheweth vnto all men the care they owe to the poore. And for this cauſe the

Not on the Saboth to ſpend and conſume all that the wéeke hath before gotten, nor by vnlawful games to prophanat the Sabboth, by hunting of tauerne and ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe to diſhonour the Lord of the Sabboth, but as becommeth good Chriſtians to make collection for the poore S.

good and godly lawes appointed for the ſame in this Realme of England? as ceaſments in pariſhes, and Colectors for the ſame, forfaits for abſence from the pariſh church, and Side men for the ſame, and ſuch others ordayned by authoritie for the comfort of the poore. But how looſely this is looked vnto, it appeareth in the treſure of the poore, for euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his neck out of the yoke, and no man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked why ſo: the forfaites is neuer aſked, be abſent who wyl.

            <p>Yea &amp; more then that (ſuch is their reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles eare) the ritch as Amos ſaith, make ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uock of the poore, in bying them for old ſhoes<note place="margin">Amos, ij,</note> Nay they will buy them and ſel them out of doores.

            <p>Surely amongeſt al the exerciſes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie, ther is none more fit for a Chrſtian nor more ſéemelye, then large liberalitye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards al, and pure pitie towardes the poore.

<pb facs="tcp:13539:18"/>
of the poore, but vpon the godly and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous poore, for that is the gift that hath the promiſe of reward annexed vnto it.</p>
            <p>The wordes of Tobias whom I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a maiſter of mercy and pity, may alſo be applied in this matter, to teſtify vnto you the reward that followeth the ſame, as he writeth in theſe woordes ſaying: Thoſe<note place="margin">Tobi. xij.</note> that exerciſe almes and righteouſnes, ſhal be filled with lyfe.

For looke what thou kéepeſt, thou ſhalt looſe, but that the poore hath, thou kéepeſt for thy ſelf. Remember the good cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Cornelius, whoſe memory is regiſtred in the Actes, to whom the Angel appearing in a viſion ſaid thus: Cornelius, thy prayer<note place="margin">Actes .x.</note> and thine almes is come vp before God.

            <p>Beleue therfore and know ye that be ritch, God willeth ye to lay forth nothing for hym
<pb facs="tcp:13539:19"/>
which he will not recompence: and as ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus ſo practiſe to geue to the poore, for ye ſhal haue neuer the leſſe, your baſket neuer the emptier, nor your ſtore the poorer. Looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the widdow of Sarepta, litle was her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion God knoweth, and ſmal was her ſtore when the poore Prophet came to her to aſke her bread.

And what folowed then? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth her barrel was filled with flower, and her pot with oyle.

            <p>To conclude, how many bleſſinges in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſort promiſed (which he can and will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that hath promiſed them) are ſet down for them that are pitiful to the poore, the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do teſtifie, which ſhoulde bee to long to recite.

               <hi>O</hi> Deare <hi>GOD</hi> our heauenly Father, heare our praiers for Chriſtes ſake, &amp; ſay not our ſyns to our charge to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, and to take vengannce on them, but rather in the bloude of Jeſus Chriſt vlot them forth. We haue deſerued thine anger, we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes, but yet in Chriſtes bloud we know thou art wel pleaſed, in whoſe name we cry vnto thée, O ſaue vs from our enemies, that ſeeke vs and our bloud for thy Goſpels ſake. O let not the wicked ſay, where is now their God? but let vs rather ſay, the Lordes right hand hath brought mightye thinges to paſſe,

our God ſhall laugh our enemies to ſcorne. Therefore heare vs deare <hi>GOD,</hi> and for thy mercies ſake ſaue thy worthy ſeruaunt <hi>Elizabeth</hi> our moſt gratious Quéene. Grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t her we praye thée peace and ſafetie from all her enemies, geue her the bleſſings of peace, and a royal courage, whereby through thine aſſiſtance ſhe may confound all her foes, and not to feare what man can do vnto her. Let her be comforted with thy ſwéete mercies, lay not our ſynnes vnto her charge, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not her life to be plaged for our ſynnes and wickednes, but keepe her (O Lord) to be thine own, and bleſſe her wyth long lyfe and happy dayes. Make her an old mother of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, and graunt her a long and proſperous raigne ouer vs in thy godly peace. Remember (O Lord) her gratious Councellers, and behold them with thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly eye. Geue them thy feare, to ſet forth thy will, and graunt them the ſpirit of wyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the counſels of peace. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Paſtors O Lord, direct and make them faythfull in gathering thy harueſt, to breake the bread of lyfe in time conuenient, that thy Church may be builded of lyuely ſtones. And bleſſe thy people O Father of might, open their hartes to receiue the dewe

Caſt downe thyne eye fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy thorne aboue, behold our Realme and country, and preſerue it by thy myght, from ciuill foes, and from forayne myght, from Turke and Pope, and al popiſh power, that all the world may ſee and knowe that thou art our <hi>GOD.</hi> Finally we pray thee, at thy good wyll, in thy appointed time, open the eyes of the blinde, and conuert the hard harted, that they may come to thy truth and be ſaued. Teach them to know thy woord, that once we may be one flocke, in one pure faith, vnto one Chriſt. Confound Sathan &amp; his members, Antichriſt and hys religion, geue thy Goſpell a ioyfull and frée paſſage, geue all thy people the freedome of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and peace in Chriſt: through the ſame Jeſus Chriſt our. Lord.</p>
