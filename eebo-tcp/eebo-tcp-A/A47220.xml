            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>How seasonable and necessary this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction is, in these days, our wofull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience does sufficiently convince us, when we reflect on the gross Ignorance and Irreligion of persons in those places, where Catechizing is negl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The love of God is a grace rather to be felt than defin'd, So that I can doe no more than rudely describe it; It is the general inclination and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the whole man, of all his heart, and soul, and strength, of all his powers and affections, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40542:5"/>
of the utmost strength of them all to God, as his chief, and onely, and perfect, and infinite Good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is this love of God taught in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Catechism having in the entrance of it presented to our choice the happiness of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, does throughout all the remaining parts of it instruct us in the duties of a Christian, by which that happiness is to be attain'd, which are all sum'd up in the love of God, which is here most methodically taught.</p>

               </note>
               <hi>Q.</hi> In what method does the Catechism teach the love of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In a method so excellent and natural, that if by God's help, I can but faithfully observe it, I shall not fail of the love of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Explain this method to me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It teaches me how the love of God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, how practis'd, and how preserved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Shew me more distinctly in what parts of the Catechism each of these particulars is coucht.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If I seriously desire the love God, I must first expell all contrary loves out of my heart, and then consider the motives and causes that excite it, the former is taught in the Vow of Baptism, the latter in the Creed.</p>
            <p>When divine love is once produc'd, my next care is to put it in practice, and that is, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the fruits, or effects of Love, which are all contain'd in the Ten Commandments.</p>
            <p>When the love of God is produc'd in my heart, and is set on work, my last concern is to preserve, and ensure, and quicken it; It is preserv'd by Prayer, the pattern of which is the Lord's Prayer; It is ensured to us by the Sacraments, which are the Pledges of Love; and more particularly it is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Holy Eucharist, which is the feast of Love. So that the plain order of the Catechism teaches me the rise, the progress, and the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine love, which God of his great mercy give me grace to follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> I beseech God to give you the grace you pray for, that you may prosecute this method with your heart, as well as with your words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is the full purpose of my Soul so to doe, and I trust in God I shall doe it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>They did promise and vow three things in my name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, That I should renounce the Devil and all his works; the pomps and vanities of this wicked World, and all the sinfull lusts of the flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, That I should believe all the Articles of the Christian Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thirdly, That I should keep God's holy Will and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and walk in the same all the days of my life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Dost thou not think thou art bound to believe, and to doe as they have promised for thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. <hi>Yes verily; and by God's help so I will, and I heartily thank our Heavenly Father, that he hath call'd me to this state of Salvation, through Iesus Christ our Saviour. And I pray unto God to give me his grace, that I may continue in the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my lives end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> The promises of faith and obedience, which you made in your baptism, will be mention'd in their proper places, when you come to the Creed, and to the Decalogue; that which now lies before you is to shew, how your Abrenunciation is preparatory to the love of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> As all particular graces are but the love of God, varied by different instances and relations, so all particular sins are nothing but concupiscence, or the love of one Creature or other, in competition
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40542:6"/>
with, or opposition to, the love of God; Now all the Creatures on which we set our love, are reducible to these three, the Devil, the World, and the Flesh, and my heart must be emptied of these impure Loves, before it is capable of entertaining the pure love of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> If you are conscious to your self, that you have entertained these impure Loves, and have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated your baptismal Vow, and have in your heart renounc'd God, instead of renouncing his Enemies, what must you doe to recover that favour of God you have lost, and to be deliver'd from the wrath to come?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I must throughly repent of all the breaches of my vow, and I must seriously renew it.</p>

            <p>The outward is compris'd in the three following, which teach us the regulation of God's Worship in reference to our Gestures in the Second, to our Tongues in the Third, to our Time in the Fourth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Which are the duties of the Second Table?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are the six remaining Commands, which do all relate to our Neighbour, of which I shall speak in their due place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What have you farther to observe of the Commandments in general?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 'Tis observable that those which refer to God are put first, to teach us that the love of God is the chief and original Command, and ought chiefly to be studied, and to teach us also, that all the duties of the Second Table must yield to the First, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they stand in any competition <note n="b" place="margin">

And I pray unto God, that he will send us all things that be needful both for our souls and bodies. And that he will be merciful unto us, and forgive us our sins, and that it will please him to save and defend us in all dangers ghostly and bodily, and that he will keep us from all sin and wickedness, and from our ghostly enemy, and from everlasting death.

            <p>THe Catechism truly teaches all Christians, that they are <hi>not able of themselves to do those things</hi> they have vow'd in their Baptism to do, namely, <hi>To walk in the Commandments of God, and to serve him, without his special Grace,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Assistance, and this <hi>they are to learn at all times to call upon</hi> God <hi>for, by diligent Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How good and seasonable this advice is, you will all see, if you consider what helpless and needy Creatures the very best of Men are. Alas! our weakness is very great, our wants are very many, our dependance on God for all things, all our lives long, is entire, and absolute, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and there is no way in the World to gain help and supplies from God, but by Prayer; so that it is as easie, and as possible to preserve a natural Life without daily Bread, as a Christian Life without daily Prayer.</p>
            <p>It was for this reason, that our Saviour himself took a particular care, to teach <hi>his Disciples to pray,</hi> [<hi>Luke</hi> 11.1.] and it is for the same reason, and in imitation of our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Master, that I have joyn'd these directions for Prayer to the Catechism.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, the Zeal I ought to have for your Salvation, can suggest to me nothing more conducing to the good of your Souls, than to exhort and beseech you all, of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sex, to learn how to Pray.</p>
            <p>This is the first general Request I shall make to you, and I am the more earnest in it, because my own sad exper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ience
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40542:46"/>
has taught me, how strangely ignorant common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple usually are of this duty; insomuch, that some never Pray at all, pretending they were never taught, or that their memories are bad, or that they are not Book-learn'd, or that they want mony to buy a Book; and by this means they live, and die rather like Beasts than Men; nay, their condition is much worse than that of Beasts, for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of a Beast doth end at death, but the misery of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man does then begin, and will endure to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>To prevent then as much as lies in me, the damnation of those Souls which God has committed to my care, and to cure that lamentable ignorance and forgetfulness of God, which is the cause of the damnation of so very many, I do not only incessantly pray for you my self, but I beg of you all to pray for your selves, and I beseech you to read the following Instructions; or if you cannot read your selves, to get some honest charitable Neighbors to read them often to you, that you may remember them, and God of his great mercy reward the Charity of such Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors.</p>
            <p>If any of you, either by your own negligence, or by the negligence of your Parents, or for want of Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in your Parish, are wholly ignorant of your duty; though it be a most shameful and dangerous thing, for one who calls himself a Christian, to know nothing of Christ or Christianity, yet if you are willing to learn, and beg pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>don of God for your wilful ignorance hitherto, and will sincerely do your endeavor to get saving Knowledge, and heartily pray to God to assist you, you shall find, that the very <hi>entrance of Gods word giveth light, that it giveth understanding unto the simple.</hi> [Psal. 119.130.]</p>
            <p>I must warn you before-hand, that corrupt Nature will be very busie in hindering the learning of your duty, and thoughts will arise in your mind that the task will be too hard and too tedious for you to undertake; but I faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully promise you, to impose no hard or tedious task on you, but such as you your selves shall confess, to be very
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40542:46"/>
complying with your Infirmities; for our most compassion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Saviour teaches me to say no more to you, then <hi>you can bear.</hi> [<hi>Iohn</hi> 16.11.]</p>
            <p>All I shall exhort you to, is to learn your Catechism, which you may do by degrees: If you learn but a line or two in a day, you will, by Gods blessing, in a very short time learn it all over, and you will rejoice, and thank God, for the sudden and happy progress you have made.</p>
            <p>God forbid you should ever think your selves too old to learn to serve God, and to be saved, both which are taught in the Catechism, and therefore the Catechism is of necessity to be learned: For how can you go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if you never learn'd the way thither? How can you be sav'd, if you do not know your Saviour?</p>
            <p>'Tis a great Error, to think that the Catechism was made for Children only, for all Christians are equally concern'd in those saving Truths which are there taught; and the Doctrine delivered in the Catechism, is as proper for the study and as necessary for the salvation of a great Doctor, as of a weak Christian, or a young Child.</p>
            <p>But you will be the more encouraged to learn your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism, when you see how excellent a help it will be to Prayer, for it will at the same time further your Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and your Devotion both together; and the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers I intend to commend to you, are chiefly the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers in the Catechism, which being daily repeated, will be the better fix'd in your memory, and you cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any advice for Prayer can be more easie and familiar, than that which directs you to turn your very Catechism into Prayers.</p>
            <p>You are by this time I hope satisfied, that the Duty to which I exhort you, is no hard task; and yet I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, by Gods assistance, to make it more easie, by putting you into an easie method to attain it.</p>
            <p>If you are wholly ignorant of your Catochism, let it be your first care to learn such Ejaculations, such short Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as these, and say them often, and heartily.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Such short Prayers as these, you may easily get by heart, and the method in which I advise you to proceed, is, that in which Children are commonly taught, in regard I am now to look on you as a Child: For there are two sorts of Children; there are Children in age, and <hi>Children in understanding,</hi> [1 Cor. 14.20.] and in this latter respect you are Children, and the same method for the most part is proper for you, which is proper for those that are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Age.</p>
            <p>I must therefore feed you <hi>with Milk,</hi> before you can be capable of <hi>strong Meat,</hi> [Heb. 5.13.] and I must look on you as <hi>Lambs</hi> of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lock, which I am to use tenderly, and these following Directions which I give to Parents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the training up their Children in Piety, I do equally design for the training up of you. God of his Infinite Goodness, bless them to you both.</p>
            <p>I exhort all you who are Parents, to instil good things into your Children as soon as ever they begin to speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> let the first words they utter, if it be possible, be these, <hi>Glory be to God:</hi> Accustom them to repeat these words on their knees, as soon as they rise, and when they go to bed, and oft times in the day, and let them not eat or drink, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out saying, <hi>Glory be to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40542:47"/>As their speech grows more plain and easie to them, teach them who Made, and Redeem'd and Sanctified them, and for what end, namely to glorifie and to love God; and withal, teach them some of the shortest Ejaculations you can, such as these;
<q>
                  <l>Lord help me. Lord save me.</l>
                  <l>Lord have mercy upon me.</l>
                  <l>All love, all glory be to God who first lov'd me.</l>
                  <l>Lord keep me in thy love.</l>
               </q>
Within a little time you may teach them the Lords Prayer, and hear them say it every day, morning &amp; evening on their knees, with some one or more of the fore-going Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and by degrees as they grow up, they will learn the Creed, and the whole Catechism.</p>
            <p>Be sure to teach your Children with all the sweetness and gentleness you can, lest if you should be severe, or should over-task them, Religion should seem to them rather a burden than a Blessing.</p>
            <p>As their Knowledge increases, so let their Prayers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease also, and teach them as they go to turn their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism into Prayers, after the manner which I shall shew you, and to confirm and improve their knowledge, bring them duly to the Church to be Catechised by the Parish Priest, that by his familiar and devout Explications of the Catechism, they may learn to understand it, and may be capable of reading the Exposition on it, and other Books of Piety.</p>
            <p>Take conscientious care to season your Children as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you can, with the love of God, which is <hi>the first and great Commandment,</hi> [<hi>Matth.</hi> 22.38.] and with <hi>the fear of God, which is the beginning of Wisdom,</hi> [<hi>Psal.</hi> 111.10.] for the awful love, and the filial fear of God, must always go together.</p>
            <p>The same method you observe in teaching your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the same you may observe in teaching your Servants, according as you see they want teaching, and you your selves will reap the benefit of it, as well as your Servants;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40542:48"/>
for the more devout servants they are of God, the more faithful Servants will they be to you.</p>
            <p>Remember, you must teach both your Children and Servants by your Example, as well as by your Instruction, for they learn best by Example; and if they see you give an example of fraud or lying, of revenge or calumny, of uncleanness or drunkenness, of cursing and swearing, and irreligion; instead of teaching them to obey God, you teach them to provoke him; instead of teaching them to honor God you teach them to blaspheme him; instead of leading them the way to Heaven, you lead them the way to Hell; and you will increase your own damnation, by furthering theirs, which God forbid you should ever do.</p>
            <p>Now that you may the better give a good Example to your Family, I will by Gods help give you a method of dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Devotion, taken for the most part out of the Catechism, which will be suitable to all Christians, be they never so well instructed, and which you may by little and little teach your Children; and which those who have been bred up in ignorance, and are Children in understanding, and are yet willing to be taught, may learn to say also, as the capacities of either do increase; for a Christian must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver stand at a stay, but must be always <hi>growing in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ,</hi> [2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.]</p>

                  <hi>Do not think that this Practice of Prayer will be too hard, or too long for young persons, or for labouring people; for if you cannot say them all, say as much as you can; or if you are at Day Labour, or have not time or convenience to say them, offer up to God two or three hearty Ejaculations in their place: But if you can get time and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, say them all, and I dare assure you, that all the three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Forms of Prayer which I commend to you, will not in all take up a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour; and certainly that Person has very little sense of his Duty, very little concern for his immortal Soul, very little Honour for God, or value for Heaven, who will not spend one quarter of an hour in the

               <p>

                  <hi>To your Family Prayers, you may add, as you see occasion, one of these following.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Almighty and everlasting God, give unto us the increase of Faith, Hope and Charity, and that we may obtain that which thou doest promise, make us to love that which thou doest command, through Iesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lord we beseech thee, Grant thy people grace to withstand the temptations of the World, the Flesh

and the Devil, and with pure hearts and minds to follow thee the only God, through Iesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings, with thy most gracious favor, and further us with thy conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual help, that in all our works begun, continued, and ended in thee, we may glorifie thy holy Name; and finally, by thy mercy obtain everlasting life, through Iesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     </gap>he like short Prayers, may be said alone in the Closet, as well as in the Family, by changing onely the number, and for (we) say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all along (I) and for (us) saying (me.) As for Example, when you read any part of the Holy Scripture, either alone by your selves, or with your Families, both which you should do daily, if you have leisure, but if you have not, see that you do both on the Lord's days, and on Holy days, and before Reading, say this Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Blessed Lord, who hast caused all Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be written for our learning, Grant that we [I] may in such wise hear them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them, that by patience and comfort of thy Holy Word, we [I] may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and ever hold fast, the blessed hope of everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, which thou hast given us in our Saviour Iesus Christ. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <closer>God of his infinite Mercy bless these Instructions to his Glory, and to the furtherance of your Devotions, through Jesus the Beloved. Amen. Amen.</closer>
