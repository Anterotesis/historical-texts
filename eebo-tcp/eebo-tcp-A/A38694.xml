            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <byline>By Sir <hi>Car Scroope</hi> Baronet.</byline>
            <l>LIke Dancers on the Ropes poor Poets fare,</l>
            <l>Most perish young, the rest in danger are;</l>
            <l>This (one wou'd think) shou'd make our Authors wary,</l>
            <l>But Gamester like the Giddy Fools miscarry.</l>
            <l>A lucky hand or two so tempts 'em on,</l>
            <l>They cannot leave off Play till they're undone.</l>
            <l>With modest Fears a Muse does first begin,</l>
            <l>Like a young Wench newly entic'd to Sin:</l>
            <l>But tickl'd once with praise by her good Will,</l>
            <l>The Wanton Fool wou'd never more lie still.</l>
            <l>'Tis an old Mrs. you'll meet here to night,</l>
            <l>Whose charms you once have lookt on with delight.</l>
            <l>But now of late such dirty Drabs have known yee,</l>
            <l>A Muse o'th' better sort's asham'd to own you.</l>
            <l>Nature well drawn and Wit must now give place</l>
            <l>To gawdy Nonsence and to dull Grimace;</l>
            <l>Nor is it strange that you shou'd like so much</l>
            <l>That kind of Wit, for most of yours is such.</l>
            <l>But I'm afraid that while to <hi>France</hi> we go,</l>
            <l>To bring you home Fine Dresses, Dance, and Show;</l>
            <l>The Stage like you will but more Foppish grow.</l>
            <l>Of Foreign Wares why shou'd we fetch the scum,</l>
            <l>When we can be so richly serv'd at home?</l>
            <l>For Heav'n be thankt 'tis not so wise an Age,</l>
            <l>But your own Follies may supply the Stage.</l>
            <l>Tho' often plow'd, there's no great Fear the soil</l>
            <l>Should Barren grow by the too frequent toil;</l>
            <l>While at your Doors are to be daily found,</l>
            <l>Such loads of Dunghil to manure the ground.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:106920:4"/>'Tis by your Follies that we Players thrive,</l>
            <l>As the Physicians by Diseases live.</l>
            <l>And as each year some new distemper Reigns,</l>
            <l>Whose friendly poison helps to increase their gains:</l>
            <l>So among you, there starts up every day,</l>
            <l>Some new unheard of Fool for us to Play.</l>
            <l>Then for your own sakes be not too severe,</l>
            <l>Nor what you all admire at home, Damn here.</l>
            <l>Since each is fond of his own ugly Face,</l>

            <l>MOST Modern Wits, such monstrous Fools have shown,</l>
            <l>They seem'd not of heav'ns making but their own.</l>
            <l>Those Nauseous Harlequins in Farce may pass,</l>
            <l>But there goes more to a substantial Ass!</l>
            <l>Something of man must be expos'd to View,</l>
            <l>That, Gallants, they may more resemble you:</l>
            <l>Sir <hi>Fopling</hi> is a Fool so nicely writ,</l>
            <l>The Ladies wou'd mistake him for a Wit.</l>
            <l>And when he sings, talks lowd, and cocks; wou'd cry,</l>
            <l>I vow methinks he's pretty Company,</l>
            <l>So brisk, so gay, so travail'd, so refin'd!</l>
            <l>As he took pains to grass upon his kind.</l>
            <l>True Fops help Natures work, and go to school,</l>
            <l>To file and finish god-a'mighty's fool.</l>
            <l>Yet none Sir <hi>Fopling</hi> him, or him can call;</l>
            <l>He's Knight o'th' Shire, and represents ye all.</l>
            <l>From each he meets, he culls what e're he can,</l>
            <l>Legion's his name, a people in a Man.</l>
            <l>His bulky folly gathers as it goes,</l>
            <l>And, rolling o're you, like a Snow-ball growes.</l>
            <l>His various modes from various Fathers follow,</l>
            <l>One taught the Toss, and one the new <hi>French</hi> Wallow.</l>
            <l>His Sword-knot, this; his Crevat, this design'd,</l>
            <l>And this, the yard long Snake he twirls behind.</l>
            <l>From one the sacred Perriwig he gain'd,</l>
            <l>Which Wind ne're blew, nor touch of Hat prophan'd.</l>
            <l>Anothers diving Bow he did adore,</l>
            <l>Which with a shog casts all the hair before:</l>
            <l>Till he with full Decorum brings it back,</l>
            <l>And rises with a Water Spaniel shake.</l>
            <l>As for his Songs (the Ladies dear delight)</l>
            <l>Those sure he took from most of you who Write.</l>
            <l>Yet every man is safe from what he fear'd,</l>
            <l>For no one fool is hunted from the herd.</l>
