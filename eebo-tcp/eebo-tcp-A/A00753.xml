            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For they brought-forth fruite and increaſed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance, ſaith the ſeuenth verſe, and were multiplied, and were excéeding mightie, ſo that the land was full of them. Some make the Hebrew word to ſignifie an increaſe like corne, where one graine bringeth forth thirty, ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:686:12"/>
or a 100. Some, as fiſhes, which multiply in greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than any creature. <hi>R.

In the booke of Numbers, you may more particularlie ſée what came of euerie one. For <hi>Reuben,</hi> the eldeſt ſon of Jacob, ſo increaſed, that his branches there are ſaide to be ſixe and forty thouſand and fiue hundered. <hi>Simeon,</hi> his ſecond ſonne, increaſed to nine and fifty thouſand, thrée hundered and fifty; <hi>Gad,</hi> his third ſonne, to fiue and forty thouſand, ſix hundred and fifty, and ſo for the reſt, read their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in that place. Whereof to make ſome good vſe to our ſelues, wée may note and marke firſt, the truth of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the 15. of <hi>Gen.</hi> when he bad him looke vp to the ſtars of heauen, and number them, if hée could, aſſuring him then, that euen ſo would hée make his poſteritie and ofſpring a mightie people, and a great kindred, which wée all ſée héere was fulfilled. So aſſuredlie true are all other of Gods promiſes, and therefore thinke of what you will, your faith and comfort ſhal not faile you. That ſwéete promiſe, that, <hi>at what time ſoeuer a ſinner repenteth truly of his ſinnes, God in mercy will forgiue him,</hi> it ſhall neuer faile. Hée may as ſoone ceaſe to bée God, as ceaſe to be true in any thing which hée hath ſpoken.

An other promiſe he hath made to vs, that, <hi>if we ſeeke the kingdome and the righteouſneſſe thereof, theſe worldly wants of ours ſhall euer be ſupplied,</hi> as ſhall bée fit and good for vs. This alſo will he as aſſuredlie kéepe, as he is God, to the great quietneſſe of our hearts, if wée will beléeue him. In a word, that promiſe of all promiſes, that, <hi>if we beleeue in his Son, we ſhall neuer periſh, but haue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life,</hi> hée will performe. So, both for this life, and that to come, wée haue his word: and, no more than hée failed <hi>Abraham</hi> in multiplying his ſéede, will he faile vs in any promiſe. Only his time wée muſt tarry, and haſty mindes learne humble pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Hée knoweth when is beſt both for him, and vs. Tary
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:686:13"/>
hée may, but come hée will. Neuer vntruth paſſed from him, neuer any that beléeued in him was diſappointed of his hope. Secondly, we may obſerue héere the riſing of houſes and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, <note place="margin">The 2. vſe.</note> whence it is, euen from the Lord, who bleſſeth where he pleaſeth with increaſe of children, &amp; maketh a name ſpread, as likewiſe drieth vp and cutteth off, as he pleaſeth, others. It muſt make vs ceaſe from enuie, where we ſée increaſe, and ſtay raſh iudgment, where we ſée decreaſe. For it is the Lords worke: in whoſe matters wée muſt well beware how wée meddle. A third vſe ariſeth from the time of this increaſe, which <note place="margin">The 3. vſe.</note> was chiefelie and eſpecially after <hi>Ioſephs</hi> death, whereupon <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> giueth this obſeruation. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> is dead &amp; the children of Iſrael increaſe, what is this, my brethren? As long as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued they are not ſaid to increaſe, but after his death. Surely, bretheren, theſe things figured in that <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> were fulfilled in in our <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> For before our <hi>Ioſeph</hi> died, few beléeued in him, but after his death and reſurrection, throughout all the world the Iſraelites increaſed and multiplied, that is, the Chriſtians. So ſaide the Lord himſelfe in the Goſpell, except the corne die, that falleth into the gronnd, it remaineth but it ſelfe alone, but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruite. Now, not in <hi>Iudaea</hi> onely is Chriſt known, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the riſing of the ſun, to the going downe of the ſame, &amp;c. Thus may we profit by their multiplication.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond head in this chapter is the crueltie of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: by meanes whereof a very bitter and heauie affliction <note place="margin">The affliction of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</note> followed this great and glorious multiplication. The vſe to our ſelues may bée this, that euen ſo dooth aduerſity follow proſperitie, and therefore proſperity ſhould euer prepare for aduerſitie. A wiſe man in his good day thinketh of his euill, and dayly beholding the ſunne ouer ſhadowed at times with a darke cloude maketh vſe of it to his good. Sorrow and ioy wil not dwell togither, but by compoſition they were thus agréed, as the Poets feigne, that as ſoone as the one hath had a time, the other ſhall enter and haue his time alſo, the former paſſing away and giuing place. Let no wiſe-man therefore ſay as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid, tuſh, tuſh, this eſtate ſhall neuer decay, for the Lord turned his face, and <hi>Dauid</hi> was ſoone troubled. <hi>Iob</hi> on a day could not thinke on ſuch a change as after happened to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:686:13"/>
him, and yet all to the glorie of God, and his good. No earthly father louing his childe doth forbeare to chaſtice him: much leſſe dooth the father of Spirits leaue his children without fit corvecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince both hée loueth more, and knoweth how better to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect for their good. The path to heauen is beaten out through many tribulations: and vp muſt euery man and woman take their croſſe that will bée his in eternall comfort.</p>
                     <p>Let vs note againe in this place, the cauſes of this their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction &amp; oppreſſion, as the Spirit of wiſedome, for our good, hath héere laide them downe. The firſt is, their very increaſing, and multiplying. For the king ſaide, <hi>Behold, the people of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael are greater and mightier than we: come, let vs worke wiſelie with them, leſt they multiply.</hi> Where wée ſée, that Gods fauour beſtowed in mercy, where hée liketh, is ſtill an eye-ſore to euill men, matter inough for them to grinde and grate their téeth at, and to cauſe them to enter into plots and conſpiracies againſt them. The eye of enuie looketh euer vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: who is aboue, who riſeth, who proſpereth, who is well ſpoken of, well thought of, or any way fauoured by the Lord? and as much grieued is a ſpitefull ſpirit at the good of an other, as at the harme of himſelfe. Which <hi>Diogenes</hi> noted, when hée ſaw a knowne enuious man looke ſadde. No man, ſaith hée, can now tell, whether harme hath happened to this fellow, or good to his neighbour, for both alike vexe him. It was the blot of <hi>Athens,</hi> that renowned Citie, to haue few of any excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue eſcape the rage of enuie in it, but that either they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, or baniſhed, or put to death in the end. Thoſe whom no ſword of hating foe could daunt in the field, enuie vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at home in the Citie, deprauing their ſeruices, blotting their names, and breaking at laſt their guiltleſſe hearts. Which made the Philoſopher preſcribe this remedie againſt enuie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one aſked him how he might auoide it: Euen, neither to do, nor ſay any good thing. Thus did enuie rage againſt their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying héere. And, if Gods actions eſcape not mans malice, ſhall yours? ſhall mine? ſhall any mans? no, no: <hi>praemoniti praemuniti,</hi> forewarned forearmed, the ſtreame ran euer ſo, and God make vs euer patient and ſtrong to go on in our duties.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond cauſe of this affliction is, a ſuſpicious feare which <note place="margin">Cauſeleſſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition.</note> entreth into theſe Egyptians, that, if there ſhould be warre, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:686:14"/>
Iſraelites would ioyne themſelues to the enemie, fight againſt them, and ſo get themſelues out of the land. Such fruite gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vpon ſuch trées, miſdéeming thoughts, cauſeleſſe iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, <note place="margin">ver. 20.</note> vaine feares, and all vniuſt opinions. Why? ſurely becauſe it is the courſe that God hath in his word threatned to wicked perſons, which feare not him as they ought to doe. Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Deu. 28. ve. 28. ver 65. 66. Pſa. 14. ver. 5.</note> of heart, a trembling heart, feare both night and day, &amp;c. reade the ſcriptures, and you ſhall finde much proofe of what I ſay. Suſpect bewrayes our thoughts, betrayes our words, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious eies are meſſengers of woe. Well fares that man, howſoeuer his meate doth taſt, that tables not with foule ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition. Better to die then to be ſuſpitious. Truſt not too ſoone, nor yet too ſoone miſtruſt, for miſtruſt will treaſon in the truſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt raiſe. The heart being once infect with iealouſie, the night is griefe, the day is miſerie. Jealouſie is the torment of the minde, for which no wit or counſell helpe can finde. Suſpition wounds, and iealouſie ſtriketh dead. Cauſeleſſe and vndeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſuſpition ſendeth manie an one too ſwiftlie to their end. Theſe ſayings of wiſe and true experience ſhould much moue euery wiſe perſon. We ſée what we nurſe, when wee nouriſh this vice. And if all this ſhould not moue vs, yet let our owne credite moue vs, which by this meanes is ſhrewdly drawne in queſtion, the knowne verſés ſaying thus:</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Too much ſuſpition of another is</l>
                        <l>A flat condemning of thine owne amiſſe.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>A third cauſe of their affliction was a new King ſhe former being dead, vnder whom they felt no ſuch miſerie. Which may <note place="margin">Change of Prince.</note> iuſtlie occaſion vs to note carefullie what danger often is in change of Gouernours, if the Lord be not mercifull. <hi>Salomon</hi> may haue his wants, but when his ſonne commeth in his place he thundreth, and telleth the people that his little finger ſhall be heauier vpon them, than all his fathers hand. This might we as déepelie haue taſted of, as euer did theſe Iſraelites, if God almightie had not thought vpon mercie in ſtead of iudgement. The great neglect of thoſe gracious daies, which vnder the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed gouernment of Quéene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> our late renowned ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne wee comfortablie enioyed, deſerued puniſhment in a high degrée, we muſt néedes confeſſe, if we will ſay truth: yet in ſteade thereof, our moſt ſwéete God, whoſe goodnes knoweth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:686:14"/>
neither bottome nor meaſure, hath raiſed vp ouer vs ſuch a King againe, as both ſo firmelie is faſtned to the loue of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and ſo enriched with all other princelie vertues either of nature or grace, as not onelie we with bowed knées may euer praiſe the name of God, but all forreigne Nations ſpeake and write of ſo admirable mercie vouchſafed vnto vs; God for his Chriſtes ſake make vs thankfull. That the King knewe not <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> Diuines ſay, it was either for want of reading the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, or becauſe vnthankfullie hee contemned the good that was done in other times, and to other men. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> héere giueth a note, how men may know what King ruleth within <note place="margin">Aug. Serm. 34. de tempore.</note> them, to whoſe words I refer the reader.</p>
                     <p>And let this forgetting of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> that is, of the ſeruice and good that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did to all that land of Egipt, in the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine mentioned in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> be the fourth and laſt cauſe of this affliction. And this indéede, if you marke it, is a mother of great miſchiefe whereſoeuer it is, euen this forgetting of ſuch bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites as we ought, neuer to forget. This maketh the child vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifull to his parents, becauſe hee forgetteth what they haue done for him: which made the olde father <hi>Tobiah</hi> call vpon his ſonne earneſtlie to remember what his mother ſuffered for him when he was in her bodie, what care after when he was brought into the world, to make much of her as long as ſhe liued, &amp; when ſhe ſhould die to burie her by him. The good father doubted not but due remembrance would work gratitude, as he well knew vnkind forgetfulnes would do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrarie. This is the ſinne of ſeruants to their Maiſters, &amp; of Maiſters often to their ſeruants. Of one neighbour towards another, &amp; of all the world almoſt this day. But could ſuch ſeruice, may you thinke, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did to Egipt be euer forgotten? yea, yea, we ſée it héere noted by God himſelfe: and therefore we muſt know it for truth, that ingratitude will make no bones to ſwallow vp any vertue, any merit, any goodnes whatſoeuer. Which cauſeth a ſaying to be moſt true, <hi>Si ingratum dixeris, omnia dixeris:</hi> if thou canſt truly ſay he is vnthankfull, in that one word thou haſt ſaide all the euill of him that may be ſpoken. Honourable therefore was it and thrice honourable in King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. King of this land, ſo to remember the ſeruices of his oppreſſed ſeruant <hi>Hubert</hi> Lord chiefe Juſtice of England, &amp; thereupon to frée him from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:686:15"/>
the malice of his enemies, and to ſaue his life.</p>
                     <p>I ſée no reaſon (ſaith he) why we ſhould deale ſo hardly with <hi>Hubert</hi> (when his enemies vrged his execution, and expected the Kings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement for the ſame,) for firſt, from the time of his youth he ſerued mine Uncle, King <hi>Richard,</hi> &amp; then my father, King <hi>Iohn:</hi> in whoſe ſeruice, as I heard ſay, beyond the ſeas he was driuen to eate his horſe, and in my time he hath ſtoode con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the defence of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Realme againſt forreigne Nations, kept the Caſtle of Douer againſt king <hi>Lewis,</hi> and vanquiſhed the French-men vpon the ſeas, alſo at Bedford and Lincolne he hath done great ſeruice. If hee ſhould be guiltie of anie thing done vntruly againſt me, which is not euidentlie proued, yet by me he ſhall neuer be put to ſuch a villanous death. For I had rather be accounted a king fooliſh and ſimple, than to be iudged a tyrant and ſéeker of blood, eſpeciallie of ſuch, as haue ſerued me and my Aunceſtors in manie perils ſo dangerouſly, weighing more the few euils which yet be not proued, than ſo many good deſerts both to me and the whole Realme, euidently knowne vnto all men. As then remembrance and forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a good are contrarie, ſo you ſée the effects of them are contrarie: the one bringing forth all honourable actions, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppreſſion and crueltie, as in this place. Theſe were the foure cauſes of this great affliction of Gods people, and let vs neuer forget them, nor their vſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the next place let vs note their manner in bringing their purpoſe to paſſe: firſt, they haue a méeting and a conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <note place="margin">How the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vſe to worke.</note> then an exeeution of what they haue deuiſed.

And now our <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, our conſent, ſhall be bleſſed, if it doo not walke in the counſell of the woman and of the ſerpent, that is, of fleſh and the deuill, or if it happen to walk, yet ſtandeth not ſtill, or if it ſtand ſtill, yet ſitteth not downe in the ſame, that is, abideth not and tarieth in it, but remembring the law of the Lord, taketh his delight therein, and in the ſame doth exerciſe himſelfe both day and night. This curſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticle and malicious méeting, albeit wholely it ſauoreth of crueltie and blood, yet, if you marke it, it is couered and ſmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ouer with a vizard and die of wiſedome: for <hi>Come,</hi> faith the King, <hi>let vs wiſely worke.</hi> So ſtill is the Deuill like himſelfe, if you marke it, and euer in his colours.

But the day will come wherein all ſuch colours will be waſhed away: and the cleare ſunne breaking out, and diſpierſing all clouds, ſinne will be diſcerned to be ſinne, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally punniſhed.

downe. Burthens of labours, as appeareth, and burthens of payments, as ſome write. So that by this way their ſtrength ſhould be ſhaken, and their liues made weariſome vnto them, that thereby leſſe encreaſing might be amongſt them, and leſſe feare had of them. Where marke if you doe not ſée the deuiſes of ſome in our daies, wiſe, as they thinke, but héerein wicked, as we know, ſéeking by ſuch practiſes to breake both backs and hearts of thoſe that deſerue better then themſelues, as if they had béene Egiptians borne, and not Chriſtians acquainted with the booke of God. Whom I make no doubt (if they hold on their way) but the Red-ſea will deuoure, as it did theſe, that is, the Juſtice of God will deſtroy them for their ſinne. Till then patience, and a continuall comfortable remembrance that God ſitteth at the ſtearne, which ſurely is enough to any that knoweth how ſwéete he is to all that faſt and faithfully cleaue vnto him.</p>

But would all this ſerue? no, no, euen as héere, ſo then the more they were vexed, the more they multiplied through the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and power of him that gaue them ſtrength to endure the paine, and to ſcorne the malice.

they were bound, they were burned, they were beaten, &amp;c. and yet they multiplied. The bloud of Martyrs is the ſéede of the church, and bringeth forth fruite as ſéede dooth, ſome thirtie, ſome ſixtie, and ſome a hundred fold, as God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.

Therefore ſaith the text, they were <note place="margin">ver. 12.</note> the more grieued againſt the children of Iſrael. And ſo vſuallie falleth out to thoſe that ſéeke their ſecuritie by wicked wayes.

But did the Midwiues obey his commandement?

when they were threatned, and at laſt thruſt into that fierie fornace by great crueltie, ſaying, as you reade there; Our God is able to deliuer vs, if it pleaſe him, but if not, yet know, O King, that wée will not doe this thing béeing wicked idolatry to worſhip the moulten image. The reaſon of the Midwiues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſall is alledged, the feare of God. And ſurelie whereſoeuer this banke is, the waters of vngodlineſſe are held out from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowing, as where the banke is not, they doe.

What then became of the Midwiues? how eſcaped they <note place="margin">How the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiues eſcaped the kings wrath.</note> the Kings wrath, diſobeying his commaundement? Surely the text ſaith, the King ſent for them, and they by an vntruth excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelues, ſaying: The Hebrewe women were ſo ſtrong, that they were deliuered before anie midwife came. Where, in the King, we may learne this good, not to condemne anie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we heare them: for, if ſo wicked a man as this King was, had yet that iuſtice, to ſend for them and to heare their defence, much more ſhould wee that knowe more, doe the like.

Secondlie, in the Midwiues we may ſée the weakenes of our natures, for they ſhould not haue lyed for anie feare: and therefore though a good déede be done, yet it is ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. Wee may not lie, ſaith the ſcripture, to iuſtifie God, much leſſe for anie other cauſe. This weakenes then in theſe good women was like a ſpot in a faire face: and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith of them, <hi>Viues conſeruare natos fuit miſerecordiae, at pro vita ſua mentit as eſſe, opus fuit infirmitatis, quam Deus gratia condonat.

By the phraſe then of ſpéech let vs learne thus much, euer to lift vp our eies to God for any thing that happeneth to vs, albeit man be the meanes which hée vſeth, for euer it is the Lords worke. Such a phraſe was that in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> God made them aprons or coates of ſkins, when themſelues were the workers, and God the author of the deuiſe.

In hope therefore of the ſame, they vſed meanes, hiding him, as they could, and leauing the ſucceſſe to God. Their eies could not ſée any way of ſafetie, much leſſe that way, which after fell out: but their hearts hoped, their ſoules prayed, and vpon him they fixed both heart and ſoule, who is Almightie, All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull, All-ſwéete and kinde: to his diſtreſſed ſeruants then néereſt, when he ſéemeth furtheſt; then ſtrongeſt, when hee ſéemeth weakeſt; then ſwéeteſt, when hee ſeemeth low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; and then vp in wrath to reuenge our wrongs, when the world doth thinke hee hath forgotten vs. Such faith then let vs marke, and pray for, in the euill day: doubt not the Lord, diſtruſt not his helpe, ſhift along in his holy feare with ſuch lawfull meanes, as you poſſiblie can: commend the bleſſing of them to him, and let him euer doe his owne will.</p>

Where, wée muſt take the name of Elder, for a name of Office, (not of yeares) for ſo we know the Scripture ſpeaketh. Not euer the oldeſt men beare Office either in Church or common wealth: but, as God giueth guifts, and appointeth in his prouidence Places vnto them of gouernement and charge; ſo, in regard thereof they are called the Elders, that is, the Rulers and Gouernours, (though in yeares ſomthing young) as <hi>Timothy</hi> and others were.

any change in the Church or Common-wealth, firſt to acquaint the Magiſtrates, Rulers and Gouernors with it, to approue our commiſſion and matter vnto them with all modeſty, humility, loue and care of order and vnitie; and then with their conſents, approbation, and aide, vnto the people and multitude.

with all reuerence, with their deſire: that, neither them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues may be iudged factious, neither others, by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, moued to any diſorder.

and crying vpon men for their good, that they would hearken and conſider, that they would be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God, and ſaue their ſoules?

And therefore to content himſelfe, that he hath giuen warning like a faithfull Watchman, that hee hath loued like a faithfull Paſtor, and endeauoured their good, as a true Miniſter: leauing the Lord, now, to his further plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, euen, to ſtretch out his hand, and to ſmite ſuch <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs</hi> with their <hi>Land,</hi> that is, their poſſeſſions and goods, their friends and aſſociates, as héere hee did: for, till <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> féele it, hee will not thinke of His might.

Their loue returneth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore into their owne boſome, being noted in Gods Booke, for a Witnes againſt them; and that ſwéete comfort ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe to be taken hold of; Wée are a ſwéete ſauour to the Lord in them that periſh. After this, conſider with your ſelfe héere againe in that it is ſaide, <hi>Pharaoh will not let them goe, but by ſtrong hand;</hi> How far more eaſie it is to come into Egypt, than to get out? So it is aſſuredlie a ſmooth way to Hell, by many pleaſant delights; but, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and giue ouer the ſinne once entred into, to forſake that pleaſant way, This is a worke, This is a labour, nay This is a Grace indéede. Any man may leape into a pit at his pleaſure, but hee muſt come out with more difficultie, if euer hee come out. Therefore, in my conceite, the good woman dealt wiſely with the Frier that ſolicited her to ſinne, and told her, hée would ſing and ſay prayers for her, that ſhould cleanſe her from all her offence, and deliuer her preſently out of Purgatorie, (if ſhee ſhould happen to die whileſt hee was aliue) when ſhee appointed a pit to be dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the way where the Fryer ſhould come in the night, and to be couered with ſome graſſe, that it might not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:686:32"/>
into which, as ſoone as euer the Fryer came, he fell, and not able any way to get out againe. Anon, when hée had cooled himſelfe well, the woman came alſo, as though ſhée had come to méete him, to whom the poore Fryer pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully complaineth, that hee was fallen into that pit, there, and could not get out; praying her to vſe ſome meanes for his deliuerance. But ſhee wiſely tolde him, hee ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what hee ſaid vnto her, to wit, that, out of the pit of Purgatorie, hee could ſing her or any that ſhould offend with him: and now, there, was a good place to trie the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his Muſicke and Songs, that ſhée and others might beléeue him the better. If hee would haue his Porteſſe ſent for, ſhée ſaid, ſhée would; but other helpe hee ſhould get none of her: And ſo ſhee left him to ſing himſelfe out, if hee could. So ſleight a matter made thoſe Hypocrites then, of fearefull ſinne, eaſily purged, and eaſilie pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, were it neuer ſo wittingly and wilfully committed. But this Figure of the hardnes to get out of Egypt, when once they were in, may ſhew vs, as I ſay, apparantly the contrarie, and giue vs iuſt and good cauſe to beware of ſinne. The deuill is not ſuch a fooliſh Fowler, to let ſlip eaſely the bird he hath caught.

to the Father, yea, as <hi>the firſt borne,</hi> which, commonly, is loued moſt tenderly, and in greateſt honour.

What a comfort is this, when the Deuill roareth, and Tyrants (his inſtruments) rage, breathing-out blood at their noſtrils, and nothing but death and deſtruction at their mouthes, with furious phraſes and ſpéeches of pride, as though there were none that could ſtop them, or controle them in what they will. Thinke on the difference of GOD and man in this point; that many harmes may be done to our Sons and our firſt borne, which wée ſée not, neither know of, and therefore at the inſtant féele not any touch for it or by it: But God ſéeth euer and euery where all actions, all intendments and purpoſes, all thoughts and ſecret at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts whatſoeuer, and ſtill is aboue man in his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of loue to his ſons &amp; children, as far as God excelleth duſt and earth and ſinne and corruption, as I ſaide. O, what a touch giue theſe raging cruelties, then, againſt his Church vnto him? what a féeling hath hée of them, and how doo they pierce his gratious bowels, wherein he hath wrapped-vp his people as his Sonnes and as his firſt borne? Still thinke of your ſelfe, what heart would be in you, and then try the difference of God and you. But, you will ſay vnto mée, it is comfortable to conſider this tender loue that you note indéede: but why then doth God ſuffer ſuch iniuries and oppreſſions, béeing able to auert them, as man is not, for the moſt part. This is the loue of a Father, that he neither can ſée nor ſuffer to be done to the childe hée loueth any outrage and crueltie, his power

Wherupon, the good man, milde &amp; ſoft of ſpirit, in humane frailety choſe rather to forbeare the ſecond ſon to haue his peace, than to circumciſe alſo him, and pleaſe God. A nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example to teach vs this doctrine; how néedefull it is euen to the great Doctours and Diuines, to the great Maſters and Teachers, and rulers and leaders of others, ſtill and continualy to be vnderpropped and held-vp by Gods powrefull ayde and bleſſed Spirit, in their duties: when as, otherwiſe, euen they, they, I ſay, that ſeeme ſo ſtrong, play <hi>Moſes</hi> part here, and faint in the way, to the offence of God, and danger of themſelues. Nay, if <hi>Moſes</hi> faint, how much more fall they flat downe, that neuer had ſuch meaſure of grace, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had? Pray therefore, and pray continually for increaſe of ſtrength, for courage and fortitude, for conſtancy and power, to repell al the darts, that Sathan ſhall throw at vs: and prepare we to buckle with men and women and Diuels that ſhal aſſay to quench or to coole our zeale in our places, and to bring vs to omit this, and that, and euerie day ſomewhat which God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly requireth, and will not abide to be omitted.

                     <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ouching the firſt, héere wee ſée, that, although <hi>Moſes</hi> was very backward a-while to obey God and goe to this King vpon this errand; yet at laſt hee yéelded: faith ouercame feare, and all conceits ſteeped to the obedience of God. A happie thing! and happie is that man and woman euer, which can likewiſe ſay truly; I haue had my feares and fancies, my errors and mine ignorances, my pride and my preiudice againſt that which was good and right; but they are all gone (I thanke God,) and I much ioy that they are gone, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that I am now ſincerely his whoſe I ought to be, and in this obedience doe not doubt but ſhall end my dayes, by his grace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Wée may againe thinke héere, why God ſhould thus ſend <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to pray deliuerance for his people, when hee was able without ſtretched arme to haue deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them at his pleaſure? And wee may aunſwere our ſelues in this ſort, euen for the reaſons following, and ſuch like. Firſt, that theſe ſundry bickerings with this Tyrant for his Church might notablie ſhewe his loue and affection to his Church, which is euery mans great and ſpeciall comfort. Secondly, that patience might be taught by this Example to all Gods children, if their troubles and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions receaue not an end by and by. Thirdly, hee thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

all excuſe from this obſtinate enemie; (a thing of good vſe, if wee obſerue it.) For euen as héere by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> the Lord dealt wich <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> ſo by his Miniſters ſtill the Lord dealeth with vs: leauing vs as naked with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, if wee continue diſobedient, as euer hee did <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Fourthly, hee thus diſcouered the great dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our vnderſtanding vntill it be lightned, and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable waywardnes of our will, till it be changed by him. Fiftly and laſtly, by this manifeſting of the enemies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, he openeth (to our vnſpeakeable comfort, and ſo of his Church vnto the end) what a victorious hand hee hath to ſaue and deliuer when and whom hee ſhall euer pleaſe, be the rage neuer ſo ſtrong and great. For <hi>Pharaoh</hi> cannot hold out, but whileſt God will, we ſée héere; no more ſhall any Tyrant to the worlds end. Thus you ſée, why God v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this way, by meſſage and entreatie, rather than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by his power and might. Let it profit you, and ſo I leaue it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. You ſée alſo héere againe, how God calleth them <hi>his people,</hi> although oppreſſed and in miſerie vnder a wicked, wayward, and prophane Gouernour. It is a ſwéete com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to thoſe that taſt of like griefe; and ſheweth, as I haue noted before, that affliction ſeperateth not from God: but in the midſt of all woe, hee regardeth, and ſaith, <hi>mine, mine;</hi> although inſtantly hee rebuke not either winde or weather, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> his proude anſwere, ſaying, <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould heare him?</hi> pictureth out the hardnes of an vnregenerate hart, and biddeth all beholders to pray againſt it. O duſt and aſhes, dareſt thou ſay thou knoweſt not him that made thée, and not tremble for thy ignorance? This vnféelingnes was in <hi>Pilate,</hi> when hee ſaid: what is truth? And what is that which ſome amongſt vs vtter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day, what new doctrine is this? <hi>Sed non impunè recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſat Pharaoh quod ſcienter ignorat.</hi> But, to his woe doth <hi>Pharaoh</hi> refuſe what wittingly and willingly he knoweth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:686:40"/>
not. And ſo ſhall all that delight in ignorance. Hence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth waywardnes and wilfulnes, obſtinacie and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, rage and madnes, that men will not heare and know. But in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſée what will followe one day, when by voice and words no good is done. Hée in the Sea, thou in the lake that euer burneth ſhalt periſh and ſinke to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall confuſion.</p>

Then, his reaſon is, his Will; euer the refuge of the Reprobate. <hi>I will not; I will not;</hi> and ſtill in the end, <hi>I will not.</hi> A ſhort reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as dangerous a reſolution as man can make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne ſoule, many times. In the 6. of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> ſée the like anſwere. <hi>Wee will not walke therein.</hi> Againe, in the 44. Chap. <hi>The word that thou haſt ſpoken to vs, in the name of the Lord, wee will not heare it of thee, &amp;c.</hi> And many moe like anſweres there be in the Scriptures; but whoſe bee they? euen ſuch, I ſay, as rebell againſt God and his good motiues made to them by his Miniſters and meanes wiſhing them well. Wherefore the end is Gods wrath vpon them, and fearefull deſtruction. Such anſweres wee heare too often amongſt our ſelues, ſaying; <hi>I am ſetled, &amp;c. and I wil not heare you.</hi> God graunt in any due time wee may learne by other mens harmes, and leaue them. For true and true ſhall wee finde that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Religio ſtulta non prodest, ſed obest.</hi> A foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Religion doth not profit, but hurt: and God is iuſt to all men in his time, I meane, in puniſhing their proude diſobedience. This is confirmed euen in that which follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth in the next verſe in theſe words: <hi>Leſt hee bring vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs the peſtilence or ſword.</hi> Noting, that this is euer the end of the contempt of diuine worſhip, according to the preſcript of God, ſome fearefull plague and iudgement. Surely, this one place would ſuffice to many to awake them, and ſhall no places profit vs? Were this people of Iſrael in danger, and wee in none? haue wee the Lord bound, that wee may doe what wee liſt, and yet be ſafe?

If they goe not out <hi>to ſacrifice to the Lord,</hi> that is, to ſerue and worſhip him in that ſort and manner that then hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, the Lord will bring vpon them the peſtilence or ſword; and if wee ſtiflie and ſtubbornly, proudly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſlie refuſe to goe out but of our doores to the Church by vs to ſerue him as now hée commaundeth, ſhal nothing followe? God touch vs, and moue vs; the knife is vpon our throates, and wee feare not. Whole houſes and Manors are rooted out and ruinated, not only abroade in the Land, but euen in the Country (peraduenture where wee dwell) for this rebellion; and yet wee thinke our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie ſhall abide and nothing happen vpon our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings for them, when hee is deſpiſed that doth but blowe vpon lands and liuings and they are gone. <hi>Cathedram in Coelo habet, qui corda mouet. <hi>His chaire is in Heauen, that moueth harts:</hi>

The Lord hath promiſed to take away the ſtonie hart and to giue a fleſhie in the place, if wee will vrge him with his promiſe by humble, hartie and earneſt prayer. So did <hi>Dauid,</hi> when hee cried; <hi>O, let mee feele, let mee feele,</hi> knowing euen then, that this Gods mercie, if it were <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> ſought, ſhould be graunted.</p>

By which wee may learne and ſée, how wicked men haue no eyes, often, to ſée the true cauſes of a thing, but moſt apt and readie to deuiſe a falſe.

Therefore euidently it appeareth that albeit ſignes and myracles be required of ſome men, to ſatiſfie an itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humour to ſée newes, and vnder a pretenſe, that if they ſawe ſuch thinges, they would beléeue: yet indéede theſe meanes will not reforme them, but euen more and more they become rebellious againſt the truth, as héere was <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Wherefore the Lord doth not yéeld to the fooliſh fancies of men in this behalfe, but anſwereth in the Goſpel to ſuch humours; <hi>This adulterous and crooked generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeeketh a ſigne, but none ſhall be giuen them more, than the ſigne of Ionas the Prophet.</hi> The conſideration whereof ſhould make vs wiſe, and to ceaſe from vaine ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as, <hi>what ſigne ſhewe they? what myracles worke they?</hi> with ſuch like; And to kéepe in the knowne way, <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimonie,</hi> that is, to the written <note place="margin">Eſay. 8. 20.</note> word of God, extant among vs, confeſſed and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by both ſides; and if our doctrine and perſwaſions be according to that, then are they aſſuredly right, then is there light in our doings, and the Sunne of true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhineth vpon vs. For the Word is truth, the Word is olde and oldeſt, a lanthorne, a rule, a guide, a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher not to be excepted againſt euer. This way doth God chooſe, and trie myracles by it, if you remember, in the 13. of <hi>Deut.</hi> not admitting of all the wonders in the world, if <note place="margin">Deut. 13. 1.</note> they leade contrarie to this; neither reiecting this, though there be no daily wonders added to it, ſince (the doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame) the ſignes and wonders alreadie done by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, mentioned in the Scriptures, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſerue. But how doth <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſhift of this great Signe, ſéeing he is not diſpoſed to yéeld to it? ſurely, if you marke it, euen in the very ſame ſort that ſome now a-daies doo, who talking of Religion, and ſéeming as if they were

willing to be reſolued, when they heare a reaſon which they cannot anſwere, in ſtéede of yéelding, ſay; were ſuch and ſuch heere they could anſwere you, &amp;c. So playeth <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> hee thinketh of his wiſe men and learned men, whereof Egypt had ſtore: and though he cannot tell what to ſay himſelfe to ſo manifeſt a Signe, yet hee perſwadeth himſelfe they can: and ſend for them hee will, to ſée what they can ſay, rather than yéeld to the worke of God. They being come, as they were blinde themſelues, mingling with good learning vaine errors of Magicke, incantation, and inuocation of Spirits; ſo, in the iuſt Judgement of God, they became inſtruments of blindnes vnto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to holde him ſtill in diſobedience and hardnes of heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord and his true Meſſengers.

O that wee may haue then wiſe hearts, to obſerue the ſteps and degrées of Gods dealing with vs, profiting by the leſſer, and ſo preuenting the greater, to his good contentment, and our euerlaſting comfort, and ſafety. <hi>Nilus</hi> was a riuer wherein they much gloried, receauing by it great riches, and great defence: wherefore, to ſée this riuer turned into blood ſo fearefullie, might well haue ſmitten their hearts, and made them hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelues to God; but nothing will humble ſome men: neither entred all this into <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart; which hardnes is euer a fearefull ſigne, and to be prayed againſt.

For euen now began ſome declination in the Church, yet not ſuch, but that <hi>Gregorie</hi> deteſted the proude Supremacie, which now is challenged, and tolde the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> (then ambitiouſlie ſéeking for it,) that whoſoeuer ſought to bee called <hi>Vniuerſall Biſhop</hi> was (out of queſtion) the Forerunner of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> But, when <hi>Boniface the Third</hi> came, he little paſſing for <hi>Gregorie</hi> his opinion, obtained of <hi>Phocas,</hi> (that bloodie Traytor, who had killed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour his Maiſter, his Wife, and Children, and ſo got to bee Emperour) that <hi>Rome</hi> might bee <hi>the Head</hi> of all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the Biſhop there, <hi>vniuerſall Biſhop</hi> ouer all.

Then out of this filthie foggie ſmoake aſcending out of the pit, when it was ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, came the ſwarmes of <hi>Locuſts</hi> mentioned, <hi>Monkes, Fryers, &amp;c.</hi> No Papiſt in the world can ſhew where (vnder any <hi>Starre fallen)</hi> there is ſuch a reſemblance as vnder their <hi>Pope</hi> hath béene, and is at this day ſtill: which being the ſecond point I prayed you to marke, now caſt your eyes vpon it, and marke it much.

                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Graſhoppers</hi> doo eate-vp &amp; deſtroy <hi>all greene things,</hi> and fruites <hi>of the earth:</hi> And euen ſo theſe <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian</hi>

                           <hi>Locuſts,</hi> Swarmes of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Fryers, and ſuch like, left not <hi>a greene thing</hi> vndeuoured, that is, not a good ſoyle, and ſeate in any Land, wherein they clapt not downe themſelues, had a houſe built, and poſſeſſed the pleaſure, and profit thereof, till God (in mercy to his Church) <hi>ſent a ſtrong winde, and blew them away.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Graſhoppers</hi> are ſaid, and written of, <hi>to be inſatiable, euer hungry, whileſt they liue; <hi>Locusta enim quaſi tota vena est, &amp; ideo inſatiabilis; quam diu viuit, ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eſurit.</hi>

                        <p>Fiftly, one <hi>Graſhopper,</hi> alone, is very contemptible, and no man feareth him, but (in Swarmes) they are as terrible, on the other ſide, to a whole Land.

                        <p>Sixtly, the <hi>Graſhoppers</hi> leape, and ſing, and play all Sommer long: ſo did theſe rabble plentifully take their pleaſure all the time of their Sommer, liued in idlenes, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other mens labours, ſinging, and ſaying; ſporting, and playing; and who durſt ſay, nay?</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>Locusta est animal paruulum, inter volatile &amp; reptile medium, pestis tanta, vt ab Ethnicis Deorum ira dica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>The Graſhopper,</hi>
                           </hi> ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome, neither proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flying, nor creeping, but (as it were) a middle thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both, ſuch a plague, that the Heathens haue called it, The wrath of God.</hi> So write the Papiſts or <hi>Romiſh Locuſts</hi> of their <hi>Head</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he is neither méerely a man, nor abſolutely, a God; but a middle creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both: and then wee dare add, that hee is ſuch a plague, as truly we may terme, <hi>The wrath of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus might I goe forward in this reſemblance, and

ſhew you how fitly the holy Spirite of God foretold of theſe ſwarmes, vnder the name of <hi>Locuſtes:</hi> but this much ſheweth you the way, and you your ſelfe may think of mo agréements.</p>
                        <p>Now marke you the wordes in the <hi>Reuelation:</hi> and as, by this which I haue ſaide, you haue ſéene, how like the <hi>Popiſh Clergie</hi> is to <hi>Graſhoppers</hi> in ſome conditions; ſo (there) ſhall you ſee, how like they are to the deſcription of <hi>Locuſtes,</hi> (there) made by Saint <hi>Iohn;</hi> that euery way you may be ſure, the Prophecy in the <hi>Apocalips</hi> noted out theſe creatures.</p>
                        <p>Firſt it is ſaid, <hi>vnto them was giuen power, as the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of the earth haue power.</hi> Now we reade, that the <note place="margin">Apoc. 9. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>Scorpion</hi> is a flattering beaſt, and in the middeſt of his flattery with the ſting of his tayle woundeth to death.

Againe, the <hi>Scorpions</hi> ſting (at the firſt) maketh no great payne, but (after it hath crept abroad, and diſperſed his venome in the bodie) it killeth moſt cruelly, and without remedie; ſo the ſtinging perſwaſions of <hi>Romiſh Locuſtes</hi> appeare not (at firſt) ſo dangerous: but (when they haue gotten ſtrength) the partie hardly euer recouereth. The Doctrine of <hi>Free iuſtification in the blood of Chriſt</hi> is hid from Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and condemned as hereſie. All aſſurance of Gods fauour, all peace of conſcience, all ioy in the Holy-Ghoſt, quite deſtroyed. Men are ſent to ſéeke eaſe in the Merite of their owne workes, in Popes Pardons, and Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in running on pilgrimage to this Idoll, and that; in puniſhing their bodies by faſtings, whippings, and ſuch like inuentions; and yet are they not eaſed hereby, but torments of conſcience (as the venome of theſe <hi>Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-like Locuſtes,</hi> which haue ſtinged them ſtill) remaine bitter, and heauie vpon them. Then muſt they build

Abbeies, giue money for Trentals of Maſſes; then ſing, ſing, ring, ring, caſt Pardons into the graue, call for the poore, giue almes, and what not?

                        <p>Secondly, <hi>outward darknes</hi> groweth ſometimes by too-much gazing vpon bright and gliſtering things, as (in experience) we ſinde by white ſnow, white paper, and the like: ſo doth <hi>inward darknes</hi> grow alſo by fixing the minde too-much vpon the gliſtering glory of this World, the pompes and pleaſures that ſhine in it. Proofe héere of that rich Glutton, that rich Barne-builder in the Goſpell, and that Turne-coate <hi>Demas</hi> of whom S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh, who all were blinde, you plainly ſée, with gazing too-much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this tempting World. And how many amongſt vs, men and women, be in this ſort blinde, he knoweth, who ſhall iudge both quicke and dead, and who cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued by any colours.

In the meane time, Religion there is none where this loue is, neither any fellowſhip with the Almightie. For as hote Sommer-weather maketh our inward heate leſſe (by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it to euaporate,) than Winters-colde doth, which kéepeth it in; ſo doth this World fawning vpon vs, and the loue of it liuing in vs, eate out all zeale and pietie, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs colder within than aduerſitie and the want of the world doth.

                        <p>A Third way whereby <hi>outward blindnes</hi> groweth is by long being in darknes, as in priſon or elſe where: for (by experience) it is ſo found often.

For this is a kinde of peſtilent heate within, which as powerfully thruſteth out the inward eye &amp; light of the minde, as euer any outward heate did the eye of the body. And then, the inward eye being out, nothing but darknes is there, &amp; ſo a falling into all dangerous Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that may leade to deſtruction and perdition. Then <hi>vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> is no ſinne; no, not vſurie vpon vſurie; oppreſſion and deceite be no ſinnes, ſtealth and robberie (if it may be any way coloured) is wiſedome, and well; yea, murther and blood bite not.

and the Goates, as thon diddeſt in that darknes betwixt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Egyptians:</hi> therefore, I flie vnto thee in humble acknowledgement of my ſinne, and <hi>for him</hi> that had no ſinne, I begge that (if thy good pleaſure may bee ſo) thou wouldeſt vouchſafe to ſaue mee from this Sword of thine, to let the light of thy mercie and louing countenance ſhine about my dwelling, as thy chéere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full light did about the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> So ſhall my ſoule and heart euer praiſe Thee, and thanke Thee.

Let vs remember the words of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and vſe them as our owne, <hi>Agnoſco iniquitatem, &amp;c. <hi>I knowe mine iniquities, and my Sinne is euer before mee.

                           </hi> Let vs remember that good Saying of the Father, <hi>Non litigando, ſed flendo Deum vincimus, <hi>Wee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome God not by ſtriuing with him, but by weeping before him.</hi>

when the bowing Réede ſtandeth ſtill. Neuer can the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer part of the whéele come vpward, vnleſſe the vpper part goe downward: neither euer can a man in his death be glorified, vnleſſe in his life hee be truly humbled. You remember the <hi>Fable</hi> of the wiſe <hi>Foxe,</hi> who would not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite the ſicke Lion, becauſe he ſaw not any come out, that went in; Let it profit you much to beware of Hell, from whence you knew neuer any returne, that went thither. Now is the time to thinke of theſe thinges, the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Hell is for euer, and the paine there, is without meaſure. Better late than neuer to thinke of it. Our Bookes tell vs <hi>of a light woman,</hi> who ſpending her time in ſinne, deſired her wicked Aſſociate to beſtowe on her a new Gowne, which when hee did ſticke at, ſhee inſtantlie anſwered. Doo I deſperately caſt away both body and ſoule for euer to content thée, and doeſt thou miſerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſo ſmall a requeſt to me? I will looke to my ſelfe héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after better, and auoide thée, and this wicked life; which if ſhe did, it was a happy deniall made vnto her. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is that God hath many wayes to pull ſuch out of the fire, as hee will haue ſaued. The like wee reade <hi>of a Couetous Father,</hi> who raking vp riches very diſorderly, ſuddainly (God purpoſing mercie towards him) called for his eldeſt Sonne and for a Chafing-diſh of coales requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Sonne to put his finger in, and to burne it off. At the firſt he thought his Father had but ieſted, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing in the end his ſetled reſolution, he prayed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed hee might not doo it. To whom then earneſtly his Father anſwered, and ſhal I to make thée a Great man in the world, ſo heape vp riches by all vnlawfull meanes, that Jam ſure eternally to burne both body and ſoule, and thou not endure the loſſe of one finger for mee? I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Courſe in time, and conſider of that, which héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after cannot be redreſſed. Were it true, or were it a ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to a wiſe man it carieth <hi>a Morrall</hi> with it. Swéete is our God if we will returne; and as yet it is day, that wee
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:686:90"/>
may returne. <hi>Were thy ſinnes as red as ſcarlet,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hee, I will make them as white as ſnow. The ſacrifice of God is a troubled Spirit; A broken and contrite heart hee ſhall neuer deſpiſe. <hi>Ioſia</hi> his heart melted,</hi> and hee found it ſo. <hi>Ezechias ſorrowed,</hi> and hee found it ſo. <hi>Peter wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly,</hi> and he found it ſo. Neuer any ſorrowing ſinner, but he found it ſo. God then (in mercie) ſo ſtoope vs by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that his outward Stoopings may euer be far from vs. This example of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> preacheth vnto vs to be wiſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Secondly, conſider theſe words, <hi>When hee letteth</hi>

It is euer ſwéete to the ſeruants of God, to obſerue <hi>this mighty power and out-ſtretched arme</hi> ouer all his Enemies, when once he ſetteth on to doo a thing.

What comfort then in this God euer? what reſt and peace in relying vpon him? what aſſurance of that end, iſſue, victorie, and deliuerance that he (in his wiſedome) ſhall knowe to be beſt for vs, ſéeing he is thus able? <hi>Lord,</hi> make vs patient then, willing to tarie thy leaſure, and euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with thy pleaſure.

                        <p n="2">2. But a Queſtion is mooued, whether it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thus to doo, or no? And, whether wee may imitate them and doo the like? whereunto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers men make diuers Anſweres; and wee may take profit by them all. <hi>Baſill</hi> ſaith, <hi>Haebrei honesta astutia ab Egyptijs mercedem operarum ſuarum receperunt, qua hacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus defraudati fuerunt. <hi>The Hebrewes by an honeſt craft receaued of the Egyptians recompence for their labours, whereof hitherto they had beene defrauded.</hi>
                           </hi> Which Spéech (without reference to the Commaundement of GOD) cannot well ſtand. For the Apoſtles Rule is plaine, <hi>That no man oppreſſe or defraude his brother in</hi>

                           <hi>any matter: for the Lord is an Auenger of all ſuch things. To lend</hi> is a dutie neceſſarie, when wee can doo it, and not arbitrarie, as appeareth by the <hi>Lawe</hi> made for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence</hi> in caſe of hurt done to the thing lent: which would neuer haue béene made, had it béene at our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. It is alſo a part of our loue to our Neighbour, and a breach of the Eight Commaundement, to denie, when I may lend. Wherefore, that which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith of the rich man may bee truly alſo ſaide of one that will not lend, <hi>Diues ille non damnatur quod aliena tulerit, ſed quod egentiſua non tribuerit; &amp; ad petenda minima peruenit, qui hic paruanegauit. <hi>That rich man was not condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee tooke from others what was not his owne, but becauſe he gaue not to others what was his owne; and he was driuen to aske leſſer things, who heere denied little things.</hi>
                           </hi> But it is withall a dutie againe (on the other ſide) truly to reſtore what is borrowed; and kindly to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for any hurt done.

hath another opinion in his <hi>Antiquities,</hi> namely, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did fréely giue theſe thinges to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> partly to be rid of them without any further death, <hi>(for they ſaid, we ſhall die all,)</hi> and partly in a remorſe, for the <note place="margin">Chap. 12 33.</note> paſſed wrongs which they had done vnto them ſo long. The firſt Reaſon may teach vs to prefer our liues before any worldly traſh whatſoeuer; (which yet many among vs will not doo;) but ſparing money in meate, in apparell, in phyſicke, in healthie dwelling, and ſuch like, caſt away the maine Chaunce, which is, their life, and looſe all. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zentius</hi> his crueltie is ſaid to haue béene this, <hi>To tie a quick man to a dead, till the dead ſhould kill the quicke.</hi> And ſurely it is <hi>Sathans</hi> crueltie (at this day) to locke ſome ſo faſt to their dead treaſure, that in the end they periſh by it, and that eternally. S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Spéech is too true, <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus clamat, Ego deficiam; Caroclamat, Ego inficiam; Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolus clamat, Ego decipiam; Christus clamat, Ego reficiam,  <hi>The World crieth, I will faile thee;</hi>

The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reaſon may drawe vs to the like remorſe when euer there ſhall be the like occaſion. For, it was a grace of God in <hi>Dauid,</hi> that his heart ſmote him when hee had ſinned: And in thoſe <hi>Iewes,</hi> that they were pricked: In the <hi>King,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Acts. 2. 37.</note> that he would aſke, <hi>what had beene done for <hi>Mordecai</hi> in recompence of his faithfull ſeruice,</hi> then reade of in that Chronicle. Our iniuries are many, and our fauours few, but thankfull requitals pleaſe God and man. An aged Maiſter and Miſtris (vnder whom you grewe vp to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to liue) ſhould not be forgotten when God maketh you rich, and them poore. Among the vertues of <hi>Dauid</hi> this was not the leaſt, that hee carefully enquired for ſome of <hi>Sauls</hi> houſe, to whom hee might ſhewe kindnes for <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> ſake, &amp;c.

the Commaundement of God, which indéede was all in all in this point. <hi>Hoc Deus iuſſit, qui nouerat quid quem<expan>

                           </hi> To the ſame end ſpeaketh <hi>Nazienzen</hi> alſo. <hi>Rapuerunt ſpolia ab eo, qui dicit, meum est argentum, meum est aurum. <hi>They tooke theſe ſpoiles by the warrant of him, who ſaith, ſiluer is mine, gold is mine. Rupertus</hi>
                           </hi> ſaith, <hi>mercedem quam illi iniusté de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuerunt, hij iustè abstulerunt: <hi>The wages which they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly with-held, theſe Iſraelites iuſtly tooke away.</hi>
                           </hi> But that could not bee without warrant of Gods Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and therefore that muſt neceſſarily be vnderſtoode. Which being ſo, we plainly héere ſée (to our comfort) how carefull God is to haue his Children well recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for either the wrongs which they haue ſuſtained, or the faithfull ſeruice which they haue performed. The <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> when they leaſt thinke of it, ſhall recompence them héere, and that fully. <hi>Iacob</hi> was thus regarded alſo, you knowe, by God for his honeſt ſeruice to <hi>Laban,</hi> when <hi>the ſheepe brought forth young of party colour, till hee was</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Gen. 30. 39 45.</note>

God can doo it, God will doo it, and men ſhould be ſtaide with it both from idlenes, and vntruth in their dealings.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Another ſwéete thing we may alſo ſée by this point; namely, how Croſſes and loſſes (by a gracious God) are turned, in time, to his Childrens ioy and gaine. <hi>Abraham</hi> had no Childe in many yéeres, and to him it was a great griefe; but, in the end hee had one giuen, of whom came the bleſſing of all Nations, and a multitude <hi>like to the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:686:93"/>
Starres of Heauen (for number.)</hi> So was griefe turned into ioy to <hi>Abraham. Iacob</hi> loſt his <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> looking vpon his bloodie Coate brought home by his brethren, and O woe of woes! but <hi>Iacob</hi> had afterwerd his <hi>Ioſeph</hi> againe, with which ioy, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>the Spirit of Iacob re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued.</hi>

                           <hi>Anna</hi> likewiſe was barren, to her great griefe; but in the end ſhee had a <hi>Samuel,</hi> to her vnſpeakable ioy. <hi>Dauid</hi> endured many ſharpe ſhowers, but at laſt hee hath the Crowne, and many comforts. <hi>Mordecai</hi> his feare, and Quéene <hi>Heſters</hi> feare, howe ended they with ioy to themſelues, and the whole Nation? Tarie then Gods time, &amp; liue in his feare: you ſée what a ſwéet Regarder he is, in time, of his childrens woes.</p>

For, as for that vaine <hi>Fable</hi> of helpe after death in <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> it ſerued to rake vp the fat of the earth to thoſe idle bellies, and to ſhift away (with faire words and promiſes) thoſe poore ſoules that ſhaked &amp; quaked after all their works, not finding any ſufficiencie in them to appeaſe Gods wrath; who could neuer returne being once dead, to tell them they lied in ſo teaching the people that <hi>Maſſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Trentalls</hi> could helpe after death. But for vs, we know the Scriptures; that, <hi>as the tree falleth either towards the North, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:686:97"/>
the South, in the place it falleth, there it ſhall bee.

There is no <hi>Third place</hi> there mentioned to be beléeued, and it is the Catholique Faith, which except euery man kéepe holy and vndefiled, without doubt he ſhall periſh euerlaſtingly. Let counterfet Catholiques hold what they liſt, they heare the danger. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> agréeably héereunto ſaith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is onely in this life.

                           </hi> meaning that if wee die well, wee holde it; and if wee die ill, wee looſe it, there being no more helpe after death.

                           </hi> and, when I am dead, the Market is ended with mee. Wherefore, let all our care be to take time while time ſerueth, to liue well and doo well according to the rule preſcribed and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our fancies or any mans inuention, that a good life may haue a good death, in Gods great mercie and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Then, for the place, leaue it to God, as alſo the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and remember well, that from euery Kingdome and Country, from euery Towne and houſe, yea from all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and places whatſoeuer, there is a readie way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. To which agréeth that pretie Conference betwixt the Huſbandman &amp; the Sayler; wherein the Huſbandman aſked, whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saylers father liued, or no? he anſwered, no.

If I ſpeake a Truth, let ſome féele it, and for <hi>His</hi> loue, that ruleth Heauen and Earth, leaue it.

How then doo wee feare in euery aduerſitie before wee ſée the end?

Thirdly, that he might teach vs thus not to abuſe thoſe his creatures, which with ſo excellent vertues and qualities are created for vs, to doo vs good. Fourthly, that we might learne by this meanes, not to contemne <hi>ſecond Cauſes</hi> and meanes, by abuſing (through a vaine preſumption) the holy <hi>Doctrine</hi> of his <hi>prouidence.</hi> For, when God himſelfe is pleaſed to vſe theſe inſtrumentes, who are wee that wee ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect them? and if we doo, what doo we contemne and reiect, but his <hi>Ordinance?</hi> Lewd and wicked therefore are the <hi>Anabaptiſts:</hi> who, as of the ſoule, ſo of the body, caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the meanes of health: and yet ſay, they deſire the health of both.

Yet euer he doth not tie himſelf to theſe things, but ſometimes without them, and euen contrarie to them, hee worketh his <hi>will</hi> alſo: that thereby wee might learne, his vſing of them to be without néede, ſéeing hee can worke without them, if he pleaſe. Secondly, that when hee vſeth them, it is <hi>he</hi> that worketh by them, and not they without <hi>him;</hi> as <hi>he</hi> giueth light in the Sun, <hi>he</hi> féedeth vs in our meate, &amp;c.

A <hi>ſecond cauſe</hi> of <hi>Idolatrie</hi> is often an <hi>ignorant</hi> i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of things not <hi>rightly</hi> vnderſtood, as, becauſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>was commanded to offer vp his ſonne</hi> Iſaack,</hi> and his readineſſe to doo it ſo wel taken; therefore men would follow him <hi>herein</hi> and offer vp their ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with bloudy hands to their <hi>falſe</hi> Gods. A <hi>third cauſe,</hi> fooliſh <hi>doting loue</hi> and affection: Thus was <hi>Salomon</hi> made an <hi>Idolater</hi> for his <hi>loue</hi> to his <hi>Wiues.</hi> And it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he <hi>ſo</hi> loued <hi>Epheſtio,</hi> as he decréed <hi>diuine honor</hi> to be done vnto <hi>him.

And (the rather) I wiſh you to thinke of this point, becauſe we read of ſome in old times, that by reaſon hereof, and by the commandement, and approbation of warres alſo (wherein men, women, and children are often ſlaine with great rigor and force) haue condemned the holy Law of God, his ſacred and Diuine word, as not agréeable to his Nature, who is all good, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with ſlaughter and crueltie, but with louing mercie, and mildneſſe, vnitie, amitie, and peace. Such were the <hi>Cerdonian</hi> and <hi>Marcion</hi> Heretickes, as witneſſe <hi>Turtullian,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Others haue fallen into this fooliſh and falſe conceite, that there were two Gods; one God, the Father of Chriſt, and the Authour of the new Teſtament: the other, ſeuere and ſowre, cruell and bloody, the Authour of the olde Teſtament, wherein ſo many commandements, concerning blood by warres, and by ſacrifices, are giuen.

                           <hi>to be a Male.</hi> The Male is ſtronger, and perfecter than the Female, and therefore fitter to ſhadowe and ſhew the ſtrength, and perfection of Chriſt in vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing ſinne, death, druill, and hell, which the mightieſt Monarche, the earth euer had, could neuer doe. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">3</note> it was required, <hi>that it ſhould be without blemiſh,</hi> that is, <hi>not blind, not lame, nor broken,</hi> and ſo foorth, as you may read, <hi>Leuit. 22. <hi>ver.</hi>
                           </hi> 22. which when the <hi>Iewes</hi> obſerued not, ſée how the Lord complaineth, <hi>Malachie,</hi> 1. 8. If any man thinke theſe bodily imperfections ſmall things to be regarded of God, it is very true: but for an expreſſe commandement of God to ſtubbornely broken by duſt and aſhes that ſhould obey, is no ſmall matter. If we looke at the Apple eaten by our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, it was but an Apple, a matter of ſmall moment; but when the Commandement ſaide, no, and yet they did it, their fault was not ſmall, and ſo the puniſhment ſhewed. Therefore euer in the Commandements of God, we muſt not regard ſo much the thing, as his Will, who (being our maker) may command what he will, and his will being euer iuſt, holy, wiſe, and for our good, if we haue grace, ought to be obeyed preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, carefully, and chearfully. This condition of the burnt Sacrifice figured out the puritie of that Lambe, that indéede had no blemiſh any way, no guile found in his mouth, but ſo cleane as by his cleanneſſe, his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe béeing imputed vnto vs, his Spirit day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worketh our Sanctification, and newneſſe of life from ſinne and vncleaneſſe.

alſo, to ſhew that God neuer liketh of conſtreyned ſeruice, but will haue men doe their duties to him vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, as indéed is fit of the creature to the <hi>Creator</hi> euer. Fiftly, it muſt be preſented <hi>at the doore of the</hi>

                           <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> God tying them to a place appointed by him, and not ſuffering them to ſacrifice where they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted themſelues in euery place. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 13. 14. as in <note place="margin">Leuit. 17. 4. 2. Chron. 28. 29. Ezech. 6. Oſe. 4.</note> the Margin the places are noted. If this thought come in your minde, why God ſhould thus tye them to a place, when as (for the ſhadowing of Chriſt, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the faith of the Godly) it ſeemeth rather, it ſhould haue béene lawfull euery where to ſacrifice, becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where Chriſt is a comfort to all beléeuers, and Faith in al places ſhould receiue her appointed helpes, to make ſtrong and ſtable from deſpaire, or doubt. You againe may remember, that there were two reaſons chiefly of this Commandement. The firſt, is expreſſed in <hi>Leuit. Chap. 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. &amp;c.</hi> Namely, that by this meanes, they might be ſtayed from vſing any vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full maner in their Sacrifices, and from following the faſhions of their adioyning neighbours, the <hi>Heathens,</hi> which happily they might haue done, if in euery place, at their pleaſure, they might haue ſacrificed. The ſecond reaſon was, to ſignifie by this means, that he only was the true Sacrifice for ſin, whom that Mercie ſeat, there in the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> did repreſent, &amp; which in that place, where after the Temple ſhould be built, to wit, in <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> ſhould offer himſelf for our ſinnes. If you aſke whether (by this example) at this day, a certaine place be requiſite? you may remember, that, euen by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and true experience, wiſely our Elders haue both thought of &amp; prouided, that in every Pariſh there ſhould be a publike place, euen a Church or Chappell, whither, (except in caſe of neceſſitie) all people of that Limyt, ſhould come to performe their duties to God, publiquely after one maner, not allowed at their wil, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:686:251"/>
one to haue a ſeuerall place, leſt priuate places ſhould bréede priuate fancies, errors, and hereſies, ſchiſmes, and deuiſions in the Church. Sixtly, vpon <note place="margin">6.</note> the <hi>Burnt Offering,</hi> you read here, <hi>they muſt lay their hand euen vpon the head of it. verſ.</hi> 4. And diuers good things were taught hereby to them that vnderſtood rightly thoſe Ceremonies, then vſed. For firſt, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bringing that Sacrifice did by this means acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that he himſelfe deſerued to dye; but (by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God) he was ſpared, and his deſert laid vpon the beaſt, for which he ought to be thankfull. Secondly, as that beaſt then was to die for him, and to be offered in Sacrifice; ſo did he beléeue Chriſt ſhould come, and die for him. Thirdly, that it is not enough to beléeue that Chriſt ſhould come, and die for ſinne, but <hi>he muſt put his hand vpon Chriſt,</hi> that is, lay vpon him all his iniquities, by the hand of his Faith; apply Chriſt to himſelfe, and beléeue that hée muſt die then, and wée now, that he hath dyed for his ſinnes, my ſinnes, your ſinnes, &amp;c, Being the onely propitiation for ſinne. The <hi>Iewes</hi> put their hand vpon the workes of the Law, the <hi>Heathens</hi> vpon their deuiſed worſhips, <hi>Hypocrites</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their almes, faſts, prayers, &amp;c, Making theſe things ſatiffactorie to God for them, and ſo wronging the Lord Jeſus, &amp; his All-powerfull blood.

Laſtly, this Ceremonie taught them, of what minde they ſhould be when they offered; namely, of this, that they thought the fauours and mercies of God ſo great and gracious towards them, that if they ſhould euen offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the death for him, and indéede dye as that beaſt muſt, yet no recompence would that be, worthy

To which end alſo it was that not <hi>a bone of him was broken,</hi> as were theirs that dyed with him. That being alſo figured in the <hi>Paſchall Lambe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Laſtly, it is repeated here, <hi>for a ſweete fauour vnto the Lord,</hi> and not in vaine, but to the great comfort of all ſuch poore offerers. For thus are they aſſured, that albeit they were not of abilitie to offer vnto him Oxen, and Shéepe, or ſacrifices of great coſt, yet were they as déere to him, as thoſe that could ſo doe, and their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Turtles, or two Pigeons, yéelded as ſwéete a ſauour. O ſwéete ſtill! for this God is not changed, but the ſame for euer, and therefore ſtill euen two mites of a poore widow graciouſly accepted, ſtill a little ſpice, a little Goats-haire, or what my power is to bring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, is accepted. So that I haue no cauſe to grieue at my pouertie, if my heart be ſound, and therefore looke vnto that, and be chéerefull in this.</p>
                        <p>Thus haue you viewed this Chapter. And now a little (with your ſelfe,) thinke of the maner of Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then, and now. What a darke and dimme light (I ſay again) was that to this vouchſafed vnto vs now? Surely, ſo darke, as the Apoſtle feareth not to call that Night, and ours Day: ſaying, <hi>The night is gone, the day is come.</hi> God, for his <hi>Chriſt</hi> his ſake, make vs thankefull.</p>

                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:686:255"/>
But now that theſe kindes of <hi>burnt Offerings</hi> and Sacrifices are gone, is there no ſort left vnto vs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? yes indéede. Firſt, it is a Sacrifice to God <note place="margin">1 Holocauſtum Deo gratiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium.</note> moſt exceptable, To preach the Goſpell, and it is euen as that ſong which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh of, <hi>pleaſing the Lord better than a yong Bullocke, that hath hornes &amp; hoofes.</hi> Thus <hi>S. Paul</hi> offered vp the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to God for a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, winning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his Miniſtrie vnto the truth. <hi>Rom. 15. verſe</hi> 16. A Sacrifice ſo farre paſſing all others, as man paſſeth all brute beaſts. And the faithfull Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpell dayly doe the like. Secondly, it <note place="margin">2 Praecipuum holocauſti genus.</note> is a Chiefe kinde of <hi>burnt Offering</hi> for Chriſtians, To beléeue in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> by the Goſpell; becauſe he that beléeueth, offereth <hi>Chriſt</hi> dayly to God for his ſinnes, than the which nothing can be more pleaſing to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Father. Thinke of it early, and thinke of it late, when you are vpon your knées, deſiring mercie and pardon, fauour and comfort, both preſently and to death, yet laden and ouer-laden with a great burthen of gréeuous ſinnes, blemiſhes, and imperfections, hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God, and hatefull to your ſelfe, through Grace giuen. What hope haue you to ſpéed and preuaile but by his Sacrifice? you will take <hi>Chriſt</hi> your déere Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in the armes of your Faith, and ſay; holy Father, looke vpon him, not vpon me without him, (For then I dye in iuſtice:) but vpon me in him, and then ſhall I liue in mercie. Thus you offer <hi>Chriſt</hi> dayly, and it is the Chiefeſt Sacrifice ſtill of all beléeuers.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, it is another kinde of burnt Sacrifice left <note place="margin">3</note> vs, To offer-vp our ſelues wholly to God, our ſelues, I ſay, our ſoules, and bodyes, <hi>a liuing, holy, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Sacrifice,</hi> enery member to doe his Will, and not ours. Of which <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh to the <hi>Ro. Chap.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, euery good worke commaunded of God, <note place="margin">4</note> and done of vs in Faith, is a pleaſing Sacrifice (in this ſort) to God. As Almes, <hi>Coloſſ. 4. To doe iuſtly, to

which vſually noteth by the word <hi>(fat)</hi> the beſt things, haue thought, that herein was figured &amp; taught, how men ought to offer to God euer of their beſt, and not, as we now a dayes doe, of our worſt.

Thinke then of this many wayes by your ſelfe, anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amend what is amiſſe. In your Tythes and Duties do you giue the beſt? Do you offer the <hi>fat?</hi> No, no, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience accuſeth you fearefully (I feare) in this behalfe. He that ſweareth &amp; ſwaggereth all his youth, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to offer vnto God his old age, when for debilitie of body he can doe no more harme, doth he offer to GOD <hi>the fat,</hi> or the leane? the beſt, or the worſt?

This bragge at laſt came to the eares of a Prieſt of <hi>Canopus.</hi> This <hi>Canopus</hi> was Maiſter of <hi>Menelaus</hi> ſhippes, and dying in an J<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, at the entrie of <hi>Nilus,</hi> the famous Riuer of <hi>Egypt,</hi> cauſed that Iland to be called after his name, and was there honoured for a God. This Prieſt fearing leſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:686:270"/>
his god <hi>Canopus</hi> (the Image béeing belike of ſome met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall) might come in contempt, and ſo his liuing be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, deuiſed thus with himſelfe. Hée got a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pot full of holes, (like vnto theſe that we water gardens withall) ſtopped vp all the holes with waxe, filled it full of water, painted it very trimme, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it very artificially vpon the toppe of the old Image of his god <hi>Canopus,</hi> brought him foorth to contend with the <hi>Chaldeans god of fire,</hi> which of them ſhould be the greater. The <hi>fire</hi> was ſet about him, and great expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the beholders, which way the victorie would goe. By and by, when the heat of the <hi>fire</hi> had melted the waxe that ſtopped the holes of the pot, the water began to ſtreame out at all the holes, &amp; quite put out the <hi>fire</hi> about it. Then there was a cry by all <hi>Canopus</hi> friends, <hi>Victorie, victorie:</hi> and from that time <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> that Idoll was counted, through this ſubtiltie of the Prieſt, the <hi>strongeſt God</hi> of all others. Thus blinde are men, when God giueth not light, and thus eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed when they are blinde. We may maruell leſſe at this great ſimplicity, if we conſider what is taught and held by theſe, that thinke themſelues wiſe in theſe dayes; Namely, that the water, called <hi>Holy-Water,</hi> ſprinkled in the graue of a dead man, not only purgeth the ſame man from all ſpot of ſinne, but extinguiſheth alſo, in great part, that <hi>fell-fire,</hi> which they call <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie-fire.</hi> Thus you ſée mens follyes both of <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>water.</hi> But paſſe we them ouer, and come to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
