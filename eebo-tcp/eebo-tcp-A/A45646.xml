            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JEREM. ix. 24.</bibl>
               <q>Let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he
understandeth and knoweth me, that I am
the Lord, who exercise loving kindness,
judgment and righteousness in the earth: for
in these things do I delight, saith the Lord.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN these Words, as I have already shewed, there
are these two Things considerable:</p>
            <p>I. A Supposition that God is capable of being
known to us by his Attributes.</p>
            <p>II. An Account of some of those Attributes which
he exerciseth in the Earth, and in which he
delights.</p>
            <p>On the former of these, I did, in my last Discourse
endeavour to remove the Objections against the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of God in general, and to shew that they are
plainly discoverable by Reason, and agreeable to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Truth. As to the Second,</p>
            <p>The Attributes of God mentioned here by the
Prophet, and which he is said to delight to exercise
in the Earth.</p>
            <p>I think it not necessary to discourse particularly
of them, having in my last Sermon shewn how They,
as well as all other Excellencies and Perfections which
we can discover in the Creatures, must of necessity
be in the Divine Nature in the greatest Perfection;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40529:3"/>
because they are all derived from Him. But that
which I judge will be more proper to be done now,
as being agreeable to my Design of Answering the
Atheistical Objections in their Natural Order, will
be from hence to Remove two Great Barrs to the
true Knowledge of God and of his Attributes, which
Sceptical and Unbelieving Men have here placed in
the Way. For indeed, till this be done, no true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God or of his Perfections can be established
in Mens Minds; nor any Ground fixt whereon to
build a Rational Belief of Natural or Revealed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or any kind of Worship of the Supream and
Almighty Being. And these Two great Objections
of our Adversaries are,</p>
            <p>1. That there is in reality no such thing as Moral
Good and Evil; but that all Actions are in their own
Nature indifferent.</p>
            <p>2. That all things are determined by Absolute Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality:
And that God himself, and all Creatures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
are Necessary Agents, without having any
Power of Choice, or any real Liberty in their Nature
at all.</p>
            <p>These are two of the strongest Holds of Atheism
and Infidelity, which 'tis therefore absolutely necessary
to batter down and demolish: And these do in some
sense communicate with and run into one another;
and indeed the former plainly follows from the l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tter.
But however, they being very frequently made use
of distinctly by the Opposers of Religion, and the
<hi>former</hi> being maintained by some Persons whom I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find do hold the <hi>latter;</hi> I shall endeavour to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
them severally. Beginning with that which I
have first proposed; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40529:3"/>
That there is in reality no such things as Moral
Good and Evil, but that all Actions are in their own
Nature purely Indifferent.</p>
            <p>And this Position our Adversaries are very express
in maintaining, as will sufficiently appear by their
own Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Virtues that Men extoll so highly,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Blount</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Anima Mund.</hi> in Or. of Reason, <hi>p.</hi> 117.</note>, <hi>are not of equal weight and value in the Balance of
Nature; but that it may fare with them, as with Coin
made of Copper or Leather: which tho' it may go at a
high Rate in one Country by Proclamation; yet will it
not do so in another, for want of Intrinsick Value.</hi> 'Tis
plain enough what he means by this; but how this
Assertion will agree with his allowing some things to
be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Oracles of Reason, <hi>p.</hi> 89.</note>, Good and Just in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as he doth in his Account of the Deists Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
let the Admirers of <hi>those Contradictory Oracles
of Reason,</hi> consider. But, indeed, 'tis no new or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
thing with these kind of Men to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
Propositions subservient to their Purposes:
as they often do in this very Case. For when you
upbraid them with a Disbelief of Revelation, they
will say, that 'tis enough for any Man to live up to
the Principles of Natural Religion, and <hi>to adhere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably
to all things,;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for those are things
that are Obligatory on all Mankind, and not like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
Truths, mere Political and Topical Institutions.
Whereas at another time, if you tell them of some
gross Immoralities that they are Guilty of, and which
are plainly contrary to Reason, and to the clearest
Light of Nature; Then they will answer you, That
<hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> are only <hi>Thetical things;</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their very Essence from Human Laws or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40529:4"/>
only, but that by Nature nothing is either
Good or Bad; and that all Actions are alike and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different;
so hard is it, as an Excellent Person ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
<note n="a" place="margin">A. Bish. <hi>Tillots.</hi> Serm. Vol. 4. p. 315.</note>, <hi>to contradict Truth and Nature, without
contradicting ones self.</hi> But to go on,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spinoza</hi> takes care to deliver himself very plainly,
as to this Matter. <hi>Bonum &amp; Malum nihil Positivum in
Rebus sc. in se consideratis indicant</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Op Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum, <hi>p.</hi> 164.</note>. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Place, he tells us, <hi>Postquam homines sibi persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serunt,
omnia quae fiunt, propter ipsos fieri, id in una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quà<expan>
                     <am>

                     <ex>que</ex>

&amp; illa omnia praestantissima aestimare, à qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus

Notiones, quibus Rerum naturas explicarunt,</hi> sc. Bonum
&amp; Malum, <hi>Ordinem &amp; Confusionem, &amp;c.</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ibid <hi>p.</hi> 37. Vid. etiam, <hi>p.</hi> 171, 185, 360, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>. And the
same thing also he asserts in many other places.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> also expresly maintains, That <hi>there is
nothing simply nor absolutely Good or Evil, nor any
common Rule about them to be taken from the Objects
themselves, but only from the Person; who calleth that
Good which he likes or desires, and that Evil which
he hates,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="d" place="margin">Leviath. <hi>p.</hi> 24.</note> 
               <hi>Nothing,</hi> saith he, <hi>is in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Just or Vnjust, because naturally there is no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
but every one hath a Right to every thing</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 63, 64.</note>;
And therefore he defines <hi>Justice to be only keeping
of a Covenant</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">P. 73.</note>. And in another place he tells us,
<hi>That Good and Evil are only Names that signifie our
Appetites and Aversions; which in different Tempers,
Customs and Doctrines of Men are different</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 79.</note>. The
same thing he asserteth also in many other places of
his Writings<note n="h" place="margin">Vid. Hum. Nature, <hi>p.</hi> 38. Element. de Cive <hi>c. 1. §. 2.</hi>
               </note>. And this Doctrine the Translator
of <hi>Philostratus</hi> is so fond of, that, tho' he be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
very desirous of being thought an Original,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40529:4"/>
yet he Transcribes this entirely from Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Blount</hi>'s Life of <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> p. 151.</note>;
as indeed Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> according to his usual way, had
before, in a great measure done from <hi>Sextus Empiricus;</hi>
who in very many places declares that it was the
Opinion of the Scepticks, <hi>that there was nothing Good
or Evil in it self</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>—<hi>Pyrrh. Hypot.</hi> p. 46. And again, p. 147. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>. And he endeavours to prove
this Point, by the very same Arguments which the
Modern Assertors of this Opinion, do make use of<note n="c" place="margin">Vid. Sext. Emp. Adv. Math. <hi>p.</hi> 450, 451, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 462, 463, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>And tho' Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> boast much of his Notions
about these things to be new, and originally his own;
yet 'tis plain, that it was the Old Atheistick Doctrine
long before <hi>Plato</hi>'s Time. For he tells us, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>De
Rep.</hi> p. 358. That there were a sort of Men who
maintained, That by Nature Men have a boundless
Liberty to act as they please, and that in such a
state, to do that to another which is now called an
<hi>Injury,</hi> or a piece of Injustice, would be <hi>Good;</hi> tho'
to receive it from another would be <hi>Evil:</hi> And that
Men did live a good while at this rate, but in Time
finding the Inconveniencies of it, they did agree upon
Laws, in order to live peaceably and quietly with
one another. And then that which was enacted by
these Laws, was called Just, and Lawful. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>This is the Principle we see of those Atheistical
Men: which tho' some of them do now and then
take Care to conceal, or to express a little cautiously,
yet they understand one another well enough: and
so indeed may any one do them, that thinks it worth
his while to consider seriously of, and to search into
the Bottom of the Matter. And this is truly one of
the Great Depths of Atheism and Infidelity: 'Tis a
Principle that when once thoroughly understood and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40529:5"/>
imbibed, confirms a Man in the Disbelief of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Religious Obligation. For he that hath once
swallowed down this abominable Tenet, will, as some
of the lately mentioned Writers discover themselves
to do, believe nothing of the Deity, but that he is
<hi>Almighty and Arbitrary Power,</hi> or a <hi>Blind fatal and
Necessary Agent:</hi> Either a Being that makes his Will
his Law, and who is not guided in his Actions or
Dispensations, by the Dictates of Reason nor by any
Rules of Justice and Goodness: or else one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

as he doth, but is impelled in every thing by
absolute Necessity. So that there being (as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to these Principles there cannot be) no Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the Deity, there can be none any where:
But all Actions, antecedent to Human Laws, will be
Indifferent. And the Obligation that Men are under
to Human Laws being only, as <hi>Hobbs</hi> saith, from
Fear of Punishment; no doubt a Man of this wicked
Perswasion will stick at the Perpetration of no Villany
nor Immorality, that will any way advantage himself,
and which he can commit secretly and securely; but
will pursue his own Private Benefit and Interest (the
only Good he understands, and thinks himself obliged
to mind) by all possible Means and Endeavours.</p>
            <p>This therefore being the Case before us, it will very
much concern us to Return a fair Answer to, and fully
to Refute this Dangerous Objection against all Religion,
and indeed against the Good and Welfare of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
and all Civil Societies: and which I wish
we had not so much reason to believe, is fixt in the
Minds of too many amongst us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:40529:5"/>
And in order to do this the more clearly and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
it will be necessary first truly to state the
Point, and to dis-engage it from some Difficulties and
Perplexities which our Adversaries have designedly
clouded it withall. Say they whatever is the Object of
any Man's Desires that he calls Good; as also what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is in any respect Beneficial and Advantageous
to him. And on the other hand, that which is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and prejudicial to him, and is the Object of his
Hatred and Aversion, that he calls Evil, and so doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it is to him. Now, say they further, Since that
which may be <hi>Good</hi> to one Man, or <hi>desired</hi> by him
<hi>now,</hi> may be <hi>Evil</hi> to another, or may be the very
same Person, be hated and shunned at <hi>another Time;</hi>
it plainly follows, that the Nature of <hi>Good and Evil,</hi>
is perfectly precarious, and will be as various and
changeable as the different Humours and Inclinations
of Mankind can make it. And thus Mens Actions
will be denominated accordingly. Every one account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that a <hi>Good one</hi> which he likes, which promotes
his Interest, and is conducible to his Advantage: And
calling that an <hi>Evil one,</hi> which he disapproves of, and
which is contrary to his Interest and Inclination.</p>
            <p>To all which, I say, that these Men run their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
a great way too far, and conclude much more
from it than the Nature of the thing will bear. For
allowing as a first Principle <hi>that all Men desire Good,</hi>
and that they cannot do otherwise; Allowing also
that Apparent or seeming Good hath the same Effect
as real Good, while it is the Object of any particular
Man's Desires: Nay, allowing also this <hi>Apparent Good</hi>
to be a very precarious Thing, and to depend very
much on the different Humours, Tempers and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40529:6"/>
of Mankind; which is the whole Basis on
which these Writers found their Argument. I say,
Granting all this, it doth not come up to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
between us, nor form any Real Objection
against the natural difference between Good and Evil,
and the Eternal Obligation of Morality; for the Point
in dispute is not whether such an Essential and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Difference as this now spoken of, be discernible
in <hi>all</hi> the Actions of Mankind; for 'tis readily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
that there are a great many <hi>Indifferent,</hi> and
which are neither <hi>good</hi> nor <hi>bad</hi> in their own Natures,
but may be <hi>either,</hi> as Circumstances determine. This,
I say, is not the Case; but whether there be not <hi>some</hi>
such Actions, as do plainly discover themselves to the
Unprejudiced Judgment of any Rational Man, to be
<hi>Good and Evil</hi> in their own Natures, antecedent to
the Obligation of any Human Laws. Or in other
Words, whether there be not some Actions which do
carry along with them such a clear and unalterable
Reasonableness and Excellency, as that they do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
themselves to be Good and Lovely to any Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced
Mind, and consequently Mankind must
be under an Universal and Eternal Obligation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them, and to avoid and shun their Contraries.
As also, whether we have not all the reason in the
World to believe that those Actions, which the Mind
of Man can thus discover to be Morally and Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
Good, are agreeable to the Will of God, and
directed by it: And to conclude, that the Deity
also acts and proceeds in all Respects according to
the same Universal and Eternal Dictates of Reason,
and is Just and Good, Equitable and Righteous in all
his Dealings with his Creatures; and <hi>that he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40529:6"/>
these things in the Earth.</hi> This I take to be the
true state of the Case; and this is what we Assert, and
our Adversaries Deny; and what I shall now endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to prove.</p>
            <p>In order to which, it must be allowed in the</p>
            <p>1. Place, That Man is a thinking Being, and hath
the Power of Reasoning and Inference. It must be
allowed also, that we are capable of Knowing this,
and do most evidently discover such a Power in our
selves. And since all Intelligent Creatures do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
desire to be happy, we must do so too, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
endeavour to obtain that Kind of Happiness
which is agreeable to our Natures and Faculties; <hi>i. e.</hi>
a Happiness that shall relate to our <hi>whole Natures,</hi>
and not to the Body only: Now the Happiness of
any Being consisting in the free and vigorous Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of its Powers and Faculties, or in the Perfection
of its Nature; and the Nature of Man being Reason,
the Happiness of Mankind must consist chiefly in the
free and vigorous Exercise of his Reasoning Faculty;
or being in such a Condition as that we can do all
things that are agreeable to, and avoid all such things
as are disagreeable to it. Now all this supposed and
granted, as I think none of it can be denied, it will
plainly follow, that all such Actions as do Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
approve themselves to the Reason of Mankind,
and such as when duly examined and considered, do
constantly and uniformly tend towards, and promote
the Happiness of Man, considered as to his whole
Nature, and chiefly as to that part of him in which
his Nature doth more properly consist, which is his
Rational and Understanding Faculty: Such Actions,
I say, must necessarily be said to be in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40529:7"/>
               <hi>Good;</hi> and their Contraries must be denominated
<hi>Evil,</hi> after the same manner; for whatsoever is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
<hi>Approved,</hi> is universally <hi>Good:</hi> to call a
thing <hi>Good</hi> being nothing else but to declare its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducibility
to that end it was designed for. Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our Adversary's Assertion, Men call that
<hi>Good</hi> which promotes their own Advantage and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and so no doubt it ought to be esteemed;
all that they mistake in, being, that they don't
understand wherein their true Happiness consists. And
therefore if a Thing doth in its own Nature approve
it self to the impartial Reason of Mankind, and can
on due Examination manifestly appear to conduce to
the Interest, Advantage and Happiness of Human
Nature; such a thing must be all Rational and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men be pronounced <hi>naturally and morally Good;</hi>
and its Reverse, <hi>Evil</hi> in the same manner. And that
this is the case is Reference to that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Moral Good and Evil,</hi> will appear plain
and evident when we shew,</p>
            <p>2. That there are some Things and Actions which
the Free and Unprejudiced Reason of all Mankind,
cannot but acknowledge to be <hi>Comely, Lovely,</hi> and
<hi>Good</hi> in their own Natures as soon as ever it considers
them, and makes any Judgment about them. And
this is what is apparent to the Observation of all
Men to have been <hi>ipso facto</hi> done; and the Truth of
it cannot be denied: For have not all Nations in the
World agreed in paying some kind of Worship and
Veneration to the Deity? Was there ever any Place
where, or Time when, <hi>Obedience to Parents, Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
for Benefits received, Acts of Justice, Mercy, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Good Nature,</hi> were not accounted reasonable,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40529:7"/>
good and decent things? I know some Persons have
boldly told the World that 'tis quite otherwise, and
that there are some whole Nations so Savage and
Barbarous as to have no Notion of any Deity, who
have no manner of Religious Worship at all, and
who have no Notion or Idea of <hi>Moral Good and Evil:</hi>
But when we consider that these Accounts come ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
only from a few Navigators, who probably
did not stay long enough at those Places to acquaint
themselves with the Language of the Natives, and
who consequently could not have much Knowledge
of their Notions, Opinions, and Customs; it will
be too hardy a Conclusion to inferr positively that
Men pay no Worship to, nor have any Idea of a
God, only because they did not see them at their
Devotions. And moreover, when we have had later
and more accurate Accounts of some of those Places,
which do plainly disprove the former Assertions, we
have good reason, I think, to suspend our assent to
them. And then as to their Notions of Good and
Evil, it will not follow that they account Stealth and
Murder as good and comely things as Justice and
Mercy, only because these Relators had some of those
Acts committed on them. For commonly they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
shew them the way, by wickedly Robbing,
Imprisoning and Murdering them; and therefore why
the Poor <hi>Indians</hi> may not return some such Actions
upon their Enemies and Invaders, without being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be quite Ignorant of the Difference between
Good and Evil, I confess, I do not see. And by
what too often appears from their own Relations and
Books of Travels, the <hi>Indians</hi> have not more reason
to be thought Savage and Barbarous, than those that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40529:8"/>
give us such an Account of them; for by their Actions
they discover as poor Notions of Morality, as 'tis
possible for any Men to have.</p>
            <p>But after all, suppose the Fact true, as I do really
believe it is not, That there is any Nation of Men so
Stupid as to be quite devoid of any Notion of a God,
or of the Difference between Good and Evil: All that
can be concluded from hence is, that some Men may
for want of Commerce with other Parts of the World,
and for want of Thinking, and cultivating and
exercising their Rational Faculties, degenerate into
meer brute Beasts; and indeed, as such the Relators
describe them; according to whose Account of them,
many Species of the Brute Creation discover more
Understanding, and Act, if I may so speak, more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally;
but it cannot be fairly argued from hence,
that they <hi>never have had</hi> any Notion or Belief of these
things; or that their Reasons will not assent to the
Truth of them <hi>hereafter,</hi> when their unhappy Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
may be removed, and they may become civilized
by Commerce. Much less sure will this Prove, that
there is no Notion of a Deity, nor of Moral Good
and Evil in all the other Parts of the World, and
amongst Men that can think, and do exercise their
Reason and Understanding. Will not a General Rule
stand its Ground tho' there be a few Exceptions against
it? Will Men take their Measures to judge of Human
Nature only from the Monstrosities of it, from the
worst and most stupid Parts of Mankind? Men may
as well argue that all Mankind are devoid of Arms or
Hands, or are Universally Defective in any other Part
of the Body, because some few are daily born so, or
rather have them cut off. We see there are often
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40529:8"/>
Natural Defects in Mens Minds as well as their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and that some are born Fools and Idiots, as well
as others Blind and Lame; and a great many we see
make themselves so by their own Fault; But sure no
one will conclude from hence, that all Mankind are
Fools and Idiots, unless he be a degree worse than
one himself. And yet Men may even as justly make
any of these absurd Inferences, as to say, there is in
the Minds of Men no Power to distinguish a Natural
Difference between Good and Evil, only because there
are some Stupid and Barbarous People, among whom
no such thing can be discovered. For my part, I do
most heartily believe, that 'tis impossible for a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and Thinking Mind, acting as such, to be insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the Difference between Moral Good and Evil:
I cannot Imagine that such a Person can think it a
thing indifferent in its own Nature, whether he should
Venerate, Love and Worship the God that made him,
and from whom he derives all the Good he can possibly
enjoy; or whether he should Slight, Despise, Blaspheme
or Affront him. It seems utterly impossible to me,
that any thinking and considerate Man, should judge
it an indifferent thing in its own Nature, whether
he should honour and reverence his Father, or abuse
him and cut his Throat: or that he can esteem it to
be as good and decent a thing to be Ungrateful or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
as it is to acknowledge and to return a Kindness,
to render every one their Due, and to behave our
selves towards others, as we would have them do
towards us.</p>
            <p>I do not think that the Instances produced by a
late Ingenious Writer, of some wild People's exposing
their Sick and Aged Parents to die by the Severities
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40529:9"/>
of Wind and Weather, nor of others who eat their
own Children, are of force to prove that there is
really and naturally no difference between Good and
Evil, any more than I will believe that he cited those
Passages with a design to make the World think so;
for I think, allowing the truth of all these Relations,
no such Inference can be thence deduced. A Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Principle, of the Truth and Power of which a
Man may be demonstratively assured, may yet be
over-born in some Respects by other Opinions which
Ignorance and Superstition may have set up in a Man's
Mind. This Gentleman saith, <hi>p.</hi> 25. <hi>Of Human Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
That <hi>a Doctrine having no better Original
than the Superstition of a Nurse, or the Authority of an
Old Woman, may be length of time grow up to the dignity
of a Principle in Religion or Morality.</hi> Now should a
precarious and wicked Opinion over-rule a Man in
one or two particular Cases, and carry him against the
Rules of Morality, will it follow from thence that a
Man doth believe those Rules of no Natural Force, and
that it is an Indifferent thing whether he observe them
or not? Ought I to conclude, that because I have
read of a King that Sacrificed his Son to <hi>Moloch,</hi> that
therefore he believed it as good and reasonable a thing
to burn his Children alive, as to preserve, take care of
them, and give them a good Education? Certainly,
'twould be a fairer and more reasonable Inference, to
conclude that his Reason and Natural Affection was
over-power'd by his Idolatrous and Superstitious Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and that the reason why he did such a Wicked
and unnatural Action was because he expected some
very great Benefit for it from the Idol, or that he
would Inflict some very great Judgment upon him,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40529:9"/>
if he did not do it. And so in the Cases above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
one may well enough believe that
those Barbarous and Inhumane Wretches that Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their Parents and Eat their Children; did not
nor could not believe it was as good and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
so to do, as it would be to preserve them;
but only that they were under the Power of
some Wicked Superstition, or Abominable Custom
that had unhappily crept in among them; which
they thought it a greater Evil to break (if they
thought at all) than they did to Act against their
Judgment, Natural Reason, and Affection. For
<hi>this way</hi> (as he observes) <hi>'tis easie to imagine how
Men, may come to worship the Idols of their own
Minds, grow fond of Notions they have been long
acquainted with there, and stamp the</hi> Characters
<hi>of Divinity upon Absurdities and Errors,</hi> &amp;c. p. 26.
So that I cannot see any Consequence at all,
in asserting the Non-existence of Moral Good
and Evil, from a few Barbarous and Ignorant
Wretches doing some Actions that bear hard on
the Rules of Morality: For notwithstanding that
they may be lost in a great measure in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
yet these things, and many others that might
be instanced in, do certainly carry such Self-evidence
along with them; that a free and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
Mind must needs perceive which way to
determine, as soon as ever they can be proposed
to it, and considered of by it. For any one in
the World that doth but understand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Terms in any of the lately mentioned
Moral Propositions, will be demonstratively assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the Truth of them: And he will see as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40529:10"/>
clearly <hi>that God is to be worshipped,</hi> that <hi>Parents
are to be honoured,</hi> and in a word, that <hi>we ought
to do to others as we would be done unto,</hi> as he
assents to the Truth of such Axioms as these:
That <hi>a Thing cannot be and not be, at the same
Time;</hi> That <hi>Nothing hath no Properties;</hi> And that
<hi>the whole is greater than any one, and equal to all
its Parts taken together:</hi> For the Reason why all
Mankind allow these as <hi>first Principles,</hi> is because
their Truth is so very Apparent and Evident,
that they approve themselves to our Reason at
first sight. And so, I think, do all these Great
Principles in Morality; they certainly affect im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
and considerate Minds, with as full a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
as any of the former can possibly do.
And would no more have been denied or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
than the others are, had they not been
<hi>Rules of Practice,</hi> and did they not require some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be <hi>done,</hi> as well as to be <hi>believed.</hi>
For he that rightly understands what is meant
by the words <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Worship;</hi> will see the
Necessary connexion between those Terms, or
the Truth of this Proposition, <hi>God is to be
worshipped,</hi> as evidently as he that knows what
a <hi>Whole</hi> and a <hi>Part</hi> is, will see that the <hi>Whole must
be greater than a Part.</hi> And no Proposition in
Geometry can be more demonstratively clear, than
these Moral ones are, to Men that are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Blind and wickedly Prejudiced against such
Practical Truths. For as one hath well observed (<note n="a" place="margin">Essay of Human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. <hi>p.</hi> 274, 275</note>),
<hi>Morality may be reckoned among those Sciences that
are capable of Demonstration.</hi> And that <hi>these Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Truths have a stronger connexion one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40529:10"/>
and a more necessary Consequence from our Idea's,
and come nearer to a perfect Demonstration than
is commonly imagined;</hi> insomuch, that as he saith
in another place, <hi>They are capable of real Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
as well as Mathematicks</hi> (<note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 284.</note>). Now if the case
be so, as most certainly it is; it will plainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that Those things that do thus demonstratively
approve themselves to the unprejudiced Reason of all
Mankind, must be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>lovely</hi> in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or Morally so, antecedent to the Obligation of
Human Laws, Customs or Fashions of particular
Countries.</p>
            <p>And in this plain Distinction between Good and
Evil, which our Reason, when duly used, Impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
us thus at first sight to make, is founded that
which we call Conscience: which is a kind of an
Internal Sensation of <hi>Moral Good and Evil.</hi> And
<hi>this Candle of the Lord, set up by himself in mens
Minds, and which 'tis impossible for the Breath or
Power of man wholly to extinguish</hi> (<note n="a" place="margin">Essay of Hum. Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. <hi>p.</hi> 276.</note>); is as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to a Rational Mind, as the Sense of Pain
and Pleasure is to the Body; for as that is given
us by the Author of our Natures to preserve us
from bodily Evils, and to capacitate us to enjoy
such a Kind of Happiness; so Conscience is our
Guard against the Invasions of Moral or Spiritual
Evils; and will, if rightly followed, give us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
so much Peace, Joy, and Satisfaction of
Soul, as cannot possibly be had any other way.
But again;</p>
            <p>2. It is most plain also, That there are some things
which do Universally and Naturally tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Happiness and Welfare of Mankind, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40529:11"/>
others that do equally contribute to its Misery:
And consequently on this Account we must esteem
the former to be really and naturally <hi>Good</hi> things,
and the latter, <hi>Evil.</hi> Now one would think, that
one need not spend Time to prove that the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Moral Virtue, doth Uniformly and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
promote the Happiness of Mankind, and that
Vice and Immorality do as naturally and necessarily
tend to its Misery. For doth not any one plainly
perceive, that there is no Virtue, or Part of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but what hath some particular Good and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to Human Nature, connected with it, as all Vice
and Wickedness hath the contrary? Doth not a
sincere Veneration for that Supream and Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Being, from whom all our Powers and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are derived, and a consciousness to our selves
that we are obedient to his Will, and consequently
under his Protection; doth not this, I say, bring
constant Peace, Comfort and Satisfaction along with
it? and prove our greatest Support under any
Troubles and Afflictions? And on the other hand,
hath not generally speaking he that is guilty of
Impiety, Profaneness and Irreligion, dismal Doubts
and dire Suspicions in his Mind of impending
Punishments, and Misery? Is not such a Mans
whole course of Action, a continual state of War
in his own Breast, and a constant Contradiction
of his Reason and his Conscience? What hath
such a Person to support him, or to give him
any comfort on a Sick or a Death-Bed, when the
hurry and amusements of sensual Pleasure are over:
and when all the treacherous Enjoyments of this
World begin to fail him, and discover themselves
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40529:11"/>
to be counterfeit and fictitious? But again, is it
not plain to every one, that Truth, Justice and
Benevolence, do Naturally and Essentially conduce
to the well being and Happiness of Mankind, to
the mutual support of Society and Commerce, and
to the Ease, Peace and Quiet of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Communities? and doth it not as clearly
appear on the contrary that breach of Trusts and
Compacts, lying and falsifying of Mens Words,
Injustice, Oppression, and Cruelty, do inevitably
render that Place or Society miserable where they
abound? What an unexpressible wretchedness would
Mankind be in, if <hi>Hobbs</hi> his <hi>State of Nature</hi> were
in Being amongst us? <hi>i. e.</hi> a State wherein no
Man would have any Notion of Moral Virtue, but
where every one should think himself to have a
<hi>right to all things,</hi> and consequently be still endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to obtain them; and making it his daily
business to vex, rob, ruin and destroy all who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
his Will, and they also be doing continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the same things against Him, and against one
another. A Man must be stupidly and wilfully
blind before he can assert such <hi>a State</hi> as this, to
be as happy and advantageous to Mankind, as where
all Moral Virtues are observed and exercised: And
therefore Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> himself is forced to allow that
rational Agents would have recourse to the Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of Laws for the due Government and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Society. But how these Laws should ever
come into Peoples Heads, that are supposed to
have no manner of Notion of any distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil, Just</hi> or <hi>Unjust;</hi> and when
there is in reality no such thing, is what I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40529:12"/>
possibly conceive. On the contrary, I think
that the Constant and Universal Support, that
these Moral Virtues have always had from Human
Laws, is a most demonstrative Argument that
Men have always thought them Substantially and
Morally Good and Excellent in themselves; and
that they do Naturally and Eternally conduce to
the good of all Societies. Indeed, some things
may be, and often are Enacted or Prohibited by
Human Laws, that have no real nor Intrinsick
Goodness, nor Natural Evil in them; but are only
<hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> according to some particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
and Exigencies of Affairs. And thus
God himself was pleased to appoint the <hi>Jews</hi> many
Rites and Observances that had not any real or
Intrinsick goodness in them, but only were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the present Circumstances and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Nation. But then these are every
where in Holy Writ, Post-poned to Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<note n="a" place="margin">Mich. 6. 8. Deut. 10. 12. 1 Sam. 15. 22. Psal. 50. 8.</note>, declared by God himself to be of much
lesser Value; and whenever there was a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
between them, <hi>these</hi> were to give place to
<hi>those;</hi> which were properly speaking good in their
own Natures, and of Universal and Eternal Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
whereas the others were only good <hi>pro
hic &amp; nunc.</hi> Therefore they are said by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<hi>to be not Good,</hi> i. e. in themselves or in their
own Natures; but only by Institution. But this
is not the Case as to such Actions as we have
been mentioning, which are called Morally <hi>Good</hi>
or <hi>Evil;</hi> for these have been constantly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
distinguished by Humane Laws, and have
never been confounded or changed. For can any
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40529:12"/>
Man produce a Law that ever obtained univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
against paying Adoration and Worship to the
Deity? against Mens honouring their Parents, or
against their being Just, Good, Merciful, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in their Dealings with one another? <hi>Against
such things,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>there is no Law.</hi>
Nor is it possible for our Adversaries to shew us,
that the contrary Immoralities were ever univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
thought good and lawful; or allowed and
established by any General Authority whatsoever;
and should the Reverses to Moral Virtue be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
as Laws, and every one commanded to be
Unjust, Oppressive, and Cruel, as now he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
the contrary, any one may imagine what
would be the dismal Consequences of it.</p>
            <p>3. But again, Another Argument for the Natural
distinction between Good and Evil, may be drawn
from the Consideration of our Passions and Affections:
For these are so framed and contrived by our Wise
Creator, as to guide and direct us to Good, and
to guard and preserve us from Evil by a kind of
Natural Instinct, which we find in our selves fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
previous to all Reasoning and Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Thus, we perceive a strange Horrour, and
very ungrateful Sensations seize upon us immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
on the sight of a Scene of Misery, or a
Spectacle of Cruelty; and as soon as ever our Ears
are entertained with the doleful Relation of such
Actions; so also an Instance of great Injustice or
very base Ingratitude, raises a just Indignation in
us against the offending Person; and we cannot
avoid being uneasily moved and affected in such
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40529:13"/>
Cases. While on the contrary, a very pleasing
Satisfaction of Soul arises in us, when we see,
or hear of an Instance of great Kindness, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
Generosity, and Compassion. Now this Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing
of our Natural Affections with our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and their approving and disapproving the
very same things that it doth, is a very convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Argument that there is an Essential difference
between Actions as to their being <hi>Good or Evil,</hi>
and that we have a plain Knowledge of such a
distinction. For no doubt God implanted these
Passions and Affections in our Natures, and gave
them this <hi>Turn</hi> which we plainly perceive they
have, in order to prepare the way for our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
more thoroughly assuring us of the Natural
Goodness and Excellence of Moral Virtue, when
it comes to be Ripe, and sufficient for that End;
and in the mean time, to keep Children and
Young Persons, in whom we perceive these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Efforts to be very strong, by a kind of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
or Natural Instinct from doing such things
as their Reason, freely exercised, will afterwards
condemn them for.</p>
            <p>And now upon the whole, there being thus
plainly proved an Essential and Natural Difference
between Moral Good and Evil; and that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of all Mankind freely and impartially exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
doth agree in this Point, that Morality con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
to the Happiness, and Immorality to the
Misery of Human Nature: We may very justly
conclude from hence, that all other Rational A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
must judge of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> after the same
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40529:13"/>
manner, and plainly distinguish <hi>one</hi> from the
<hi>other.</hi> And they also must Know and Understand
that their Perfection and Happiness (though they
may differ in some Circumstances from us) doth
consist in Acting according to the Eternal Rules
of Right Reason and Moral Virtue. For if the
Case be not so, several Rational Natures all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the same Deity, may come to make
contradictory Judgments, even when they Act
according to the Great and Common Rule of their
Nature. But the Principle of Right Reason, at
this Rate, would be the most precarious thing
imaginable, and Men could never possibly be
assured that they were in the Right in any Point,
or knew any thing at all. Assuredly therefore
this Great Rule of Right Reason that God hath
given his Creatures to govern and direct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by, is no such uncertain thing, is in
no respect Contradictory to it self; but must be
Uniformly and Constantly the same in all Beings,
that are endowed with it, when it is rightly and
perfectly followed.</p>
            <p>And from hence also we cannot but conclude,
that the same Eternal, Constant and Uniform Law
of Right Reason and Morality that God hath
given as an Universal Guide to all Rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
must also be in Him in the greatest and most
exquisite Perfection. And that, not only because
all Perfections and Excellencies in the Creatures
must necessarily be in that First Being from
whom they are derived, as I have already proved;
But also, that if it were not so, God must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40529:14"/>
to have given us a Rule of Action that is
contrary to his own Nature, or at least vastly
different from it. And that he hath contrived our
Powers and Faculties so, as to deceive us in the
most Material and Essential Points, and indeed
hath lest us no possible way of knowing the Truth
of any thing whatsoever.</p>
            <p>For, If when, as I have shewn above, God hath
not only fixed in our Natures, a Desire of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness;
but also disposed them so, that every Power
Faculty and Capacity of them convinces us that
the Exercise of Moral Virtue is the Way, and
indeed, the only Way to make us entirely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
If I say after all this, there be no such
things as Moral Virtue and Goodness, but that
all Things and Actions, both in us and the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are purely and in their own Natures In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different;
'tis plain, <hi>Reason</hi> is the most ridiculous
thing in the World, a Guide that serves to no
manner of Purpose but to bewilder us in the
Infinite Mazes of Errour, and to expose us to
Roam and Float about in the boundless Ocean
of Scepticism, where we can never find our Way
certainly to any Place, nor direct our Course to
the Discovery of any Truth whatsoever. But
this not being to be supposed of the Deity, who
contains in himself all Possible Excellence and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
it must needs be that our Reason will
direct us to conclude the Deity also guided and
directed in all his Proceedings by the Eternal
Rules of Right Reason and Truth: and consequently
that He will and doth always <hi>exercise loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40529:14"/>
Judgment and Righteousness in the Earth;</hi> as
the Prophet here speaks.</p>
            <p>And indeed, the <hi>Hobbian</hi> Notion of a Deity
guided only by Arbitrary Will Omnipotent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any regard to Reason, Goodness, Justice, and
Wisdom, is so far from attributing any Perfection to
God, or as they pretend, being the Liberty and
Sovereignty of the Deity; that it really introduces
the greatest Weakness and Folly, and the most Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Madness that can be! for what else can be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be the Result of Irresistible and Extravagant
Will, pursuing the most fortuitous Caprichio's of
Humour, without any Wisdom, Ends, or Designs to
Regulate its Motions by?</p>
            <p>And of this the Ancient Heathens were so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
that they always connected <hi>Goodness</hi> with
the Idea that they had of an <hi>Omnipotent Mind's</hi>
being Supream Lord over all things in the
Universe; for <hi>Mind</hi> not <hi>guided</hi> and <hi>directed</hi> by
<hi>Goodness</hi> was, according to them, not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>mere Folly and Madness,</hi> and consequently
no true Deity. There is a Remarkable Passage
of <hi>Celsus</hi>'s to this purpose, which though intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
upon another Design, yet very clearly shews
the Idea that the Heathens had of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Wisdom of the Deity. <hi>God,</hi> saith he,
<hi>can't do evil things, nor will any thing contrary to
Nature (or Reason)—for God is not the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
or Governour of Irregular or Inordinate Desires;
nor of erroneous Disorder and Confusion, but of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
truly Just and Righteous.</hi>—<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>

               <hi>Orig. contr. Cels.</hi> lib. 5. p. 240. <hi>Cantabr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Excellently to the same Purpose, is that Saying
of</hi> Plotinus, <hi>The</hi> Deity doth always act according to
his Nature or Essence, and that Nature or Essence
discovereth Goodness and Justice in all its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
for indeed, if these things should not be there
(<hi>i. e.</hi> in God) where can they else be found? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>p.</hi> 265. Ficin.</p>
            <p>And 'tis plain that the Heathens had a true
Notion, that the Deity must be a Good, Just and
Righteous Being; because several of the old A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists,
as <hi>Protagoras,</hi> &amp;c. argued against the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of a Deity, from the Worlds being <hi>so ill
Made and Ordered as it is,</hi> and from there being
so much Evil and Misery among Mankind, as they
pretended to find in the World; but now there
had been no manner of force in this Argument,
and it had been ridiculous to bring it, if, both
the Atheistical Proposers of it, and their Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
had not had a clear Notion that Goodness,
Justice and Righteousness are naturally included in
the Idea of a God. Accordingly <hi>Vaninus</hi> tells us,
That <hi>Protagoras</hi> used to say, <hi>Si Deus non est unde
igitur Bona? si autem est, unde Mala,</hi> Amph. Aetern.
Provid. <hi>p.</hi> 90. And the same thing <hi>Tully</hi> tells us
also <hi>(Lib. De Nat. Deorum)</hi> that <hi>Diagoras</hi> used to
object against a Deity. All which sufficiently proves
that they were all Agreed that there was some
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40529:15"/>
common Standard of Good and Evil; and that
the Notion of a Deity had always these Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of Goodness and Justice connected with it.</p>
            <p>And if this be so, as undoubtedly it is, we
shall gain one more good Argument for this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and Eternal Distinction between Good and
Evil, and a yet much Nobler Foundation for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.
For we cannot but think, that a God who
hath Perfect Goodness, Justice and Mercy, Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to his Nature, and who hath Created several
Orders of Being in the World, to make them
Happy, and in order to display his own Glory,
by his Just, Kind and Gracious Dealing with them:
we cannot but think, I say, that God will give
to those of his Creatures, whom he hath endowed
with Reason, and a Power of Liberty and Choice,
such a Method of knowing his Will, (the Way
that leads to their own Happiness) as that they
shall never be Mistaken about it, but by their
own gross Fault and Neglect. And also that he
will make the difference between Good and Evil,
and between Virtue and Vice so plain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous,
that no one can miss of the Knowledge
of his Duty, but by a wilful Violation of those
Powers and Faculties God hath graciously implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his Nature. And all this we see God hath
Actually done: and indeed much more; having
over and above connected very great Rewards with
the Practice of Virtue and Morality. And hath
either naturally planted in the Minds of Men a
Notion of some future State, or else hath given our
Nature such a Power, as that we may attain to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40529:16"/>
such a Notion: for we find a very plain Belief
and Expectation of such a State, among many of
the Ancient and Modern Heathens.</p>
            <p>And over and above all this, he hath also given
us a clear Revelation of his Will in the Holy
Scripture, <hi>that sure Word of Prophecy and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
whereby we may, if we will, gain a yet
plainer Knowledge of our Duty, be more perfectly
Instructed in the Method of Eternal Salvation, and
find also much higher Encouragements, and much
greater Helps and Assistances than we had before
in the State of Nature. And all this is vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
us to enforce the more effectually the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Moral Virtue, and to enable us more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
to perform those Things, which the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Reason of Mankind approves as Good, Lovely
and Advantageous to Human Nature.</p>
