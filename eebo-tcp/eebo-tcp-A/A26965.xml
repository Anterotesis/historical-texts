            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And as my fleſh is no more in love with poverty and ſcorn than yours, nor was I more uncapable of ſuch a lot as yours; ſo I here teſtifie that no man is more inexcuſable than I, that have dwelt ſo long in pain, ſo neer the grave, if I have been ſo <hi>mad</hi> as to ſilence my ſelf, and choſe a Gaol among malefactors (where I have lain) and bitter accuſations and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, for any thing of this world that I could hope for, or for any thing leſs than my ſalvation. And either I am an utter ſtranger to my ſelf, or elſe I was willing to know the Truth: and Liberty and Wealth is liker to be a byas, than that which the Law decreeth againſt us. But if I be ſo unhappy as to be uncapable of underſtanding the lawfulneſs of all that is made neceſſary to the Miniſtry, you ſhould better think of it before you beg the ruine of all that are as ignorant as I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Had you told <hi>us</hi> how to come to <hi>your meaſure of knowledge,</hi> we would thank you: When I askt Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi> ſuch a queſtion, he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me to read <hi>Bilſon</hi> and <hi>Hooker,</hi> where I found more than I approved for reſiſting or reſtraining Kings: and had long before read them and <hi>Saravia,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Downam, Spalaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
<pb facs="tcp:62986:4"/>
Petavius, Sancta Clara,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and abundance more for Prelacy, &amp;c. He is not worthy the name of a man that would not know that truth, which maketh both for his temporal and eternal welfare</p>
            <p>Under theſe accuſations my conſcience urged me to acquaint the accuſing Clergy with our Caſe, believing it be uncharitable to impute <hi>all their falſe report to Malignity, or Diaboliſm,</hi> but that it was <hi>STRANGENESS to our Caſe,</hi> while wrath and croſs intereſt kept them from hearing us: But my pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent friends perſwaded me ſilently to leave all to God, aſſuring me it would but more exaſperate, till <hi>they called us themſelves to ſpeak.</hi> Twice we were ſince invited to a Tryal for Concord, and both times <hi>came to an Agreement</hi> with the moderate and eminent Perſons that we treated with: But it was buried in privacy; and ſtill we are called on, to give the reaſons of our Diſſent.</p>
            <p>Having long forborn for fear of offending them that require it, at laſt I have here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured, not ſo far as to <hi>urge the Caſe,</hi> but only to <hi>ſtate it,</hi> and tell you barely what it is that I dare not do: If I find that you can bear this, if I have leave from God and man, I ſhall venture on more, and give you my reaſons: This unarmed Account is eaſily trampled on. I doubt not but it will meet
<pb facs="tcp:62986:5"/>
with ſuch uſage as I have had already: But I muſt ſay, that if ſuch as the <hi>Counterminer</hi> will ſay that to <hi>fear ſuch ſin as I have here named,</hi> by one that is not willing to be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is <hi>Treaſon, Rebellion, Schiſm, Faction, Pride, Obſtinacy;</hi> this will not paſs with me for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Argument, on which I may venture my ſalvation. <hi>Jul Scaliger exercit.</hi> tells us, that in <hi>France</hi> our <hi>Bicott,</hi> the Learned Schoolman, was envied by another for his Auditors in Philoſophy, and his crafty adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary told the King, that <hi>Bicott</hi> was a Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was againſt Monarchy: There needed no more, and <hi>Bicott</hi> was caſt down.</p>
            <p>As for them that think that to name the late Wars is a Confutation of Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, as if they knew not that they were raiſed on both ſides by Conformiſts <hi>(Heylin</hi> in <hi>Lauds</hi> Life will tell them who.) I now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeat, <hi>[Silence all that had a hand in thoſe Wars</hi> (except the Conformiſts) <hi>and no more, and I and thouſands will give you thanks:]</hi> I plead not for my ſelf: The years are paſt in which I might have better ſerved the Church, had I been thought tolerable. I am almoſt uncapable now of your kindneſs, or of any great hurt that you can do me. A tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of reproaching ſcornful words may eaſe ſome mens minds, and ſerve ſome mens ends,
<pb facs="tcp:62986:5"/>
but will not ſatisfie my conſcience, nor heal the Land. I write not this as accuſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, or the Law-makers, but as anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their loud and long accuſations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. If telling <hi>what I fear,</hi> ſeem a telling <hi>what others are guilty of,</hi> it is a conſequent which I cannot avoid; but to avoid it and ſuch like, have ſeventeen years been herein ſilent. So far am I from deſiring the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of the Church, that I had not written this, but to prevent it. Though I with Saint <hi>Martin</hi> renounce communion with <hi>Ithacius</hi> and <hi>Idacius,</hi> I go not ſo far as he in ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the Synods of Biſhops; nor will I ſeparate from any Chriſtians, further than they ſeparate from Chriſt, or expel me: Church-Order I love; Church Tyranny and Schiſm I love not: I am for <hi>more Biſhops,</hi> and not for fewer: If <hi>Pariſh-Oratories,</hi> or Chapels <hi>were made Pariſh-Churches, at leaſt in each Corporation antiently called</hi>

And as the truly wiſe and honeſt <hi>Judge Hale</hi> hath ſaid to me, <hi>It muſt be a new Act of Uniformity that muſt heal us, if ever we be healed.</hi> I am of the mind of old Mr. <hi>Dod, who, for the peoples ſake, thanked God that there were ſo many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Conformiſts, and for Truth and Conſcience ſake, thanked God that there were ſo many Nonconformiſts.</hi> I love and honour the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend, ſolid, worthy Preachers which I hear in moſt Churches in <hi>London,</hi> where I come; and I endeavour to have all others honour them: And though I am by the Canon <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicate, they ſhall put me out from them before I will depart. But for the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and their <hi>Conſciences</hi> ſake, I beg of the Clergy, that before they any more render odious thoſe whom they never heard, and urge Rulers to execute the <hi>Laws</hi> againſt them, that is, to confine, impriſon, excommunicate, ſilence and undo them, they would be ſure <hi>what manner of ſpirit they are of;</hi> and that this is <hi>acceptable to God,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Land,</hi> or to <hi>themſelves,</hi> and that which the <hi>Churches Experience</hi> commendeth.

But in <hi>Church-hiſtory</hi> I have had a ſadder ſight, even the carkaſſes of thouſands, ſtreams of blood, and turnults in the chief Cities and Churches of the world, the Crowns of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours &amp; Kings, the loſs of the Eaſtern Empire, the generation of the Papacie, the reproach of Chriſtianity, and that by <hi>Clergie-Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Contention,</hi> ſtriving who ſhould <hi>be Greateſt</hi> and <hi>ſeem wiſeſt.</hi> Some ſay, <hi>If we take in a few moderate men like you, what the better are we?

And how fully hath <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 15. and our Common intereſt and notorious experience confuted them! I

have long wondered what powerful cauſe it is, that with ſuch men and ſo many, could ſo long prevail againſt ſuch evidence and light. If <hi>you will not hear, thoſe will whom God will uſe to the healing of his Churches: and bleſſed are the Peacemakers</hi> for (though you call them otherwiſe) they <hi>ſhall be called the Children of God.</hi> I have prefixed the words of ſome as our admonition; and I have written with this a fuller Treatiſe of the <hi>only true terms of the Concord of all</hi> Chriſtian Churches, and of the falſe terms which they never will unite in, but are the cauſes of Schiſm.

               <hi>The Reaſons of this writing, and the ſenſe of the word</hi> [CHURCH.]</head>
            <p>IT was the ſaying of acute and holy <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> (though we call him not with <hi>Fromondus Omniſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>um)</hi> [that <hi>no man ought to be patient under an accuſation of Hereſie.]</hi> He meaneth by <hi>Patience,</hi> a <hi>ſilent neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of his own Juſt Vindication:</hi> Not that we muſt be like Hectoring <hi>Duellers,</hi> that would kill or hurt others in revenge, or in a ſinful way of Vindication: But by ſilence, thoſe that ſlander men may be encouraged in their ſin to their own deſtruction, and thoſe that value the ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered perſons may be tempted to think too well of Hereſie for their ſakes: And the honour of God, and his Truth, and our own good names, ſo far as they are ſerviceable, are none of them to be diſregarded. We have with grieved ſouls beheld the Land of our Nativity
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62986:9"/>
diſtracted by Diviſions; and much, if not moſt <hi>about Religion,</hi> (we wiſh it were not <hi>againſt Religion,</hi> by ſome that indeed <hi>have no true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:)</hi> Teachers againſt Teachers, in Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Sermons, Books, rendring each other deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and unlovely, and ſome calling out aloud to Rulers to draw the Sword againſt their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; ſo learnedly and induſtriouſly pleading the Cauſe againſt each other with the Laity, high and low, as if the deſtroying of their Love, and kindling Wrath and Hatred, were the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical neceſſary work; and without this zeal, and skill, and diligence hard to be accompliſhed. No wonder then if we have people againſt people, families divided, and all confounded; and this grievous <hi>Schiſm</hi> carryed on, by crying out againſt each other as Schiſmaticks, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placably <hi>cauſing</hi> it while we loudly inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. The caſe is lamentable, that diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould be thus expreſſed and promoted; and when God hath warned us by the miſchiefs of an odious Civil War, and hath tryed us again with peace with all Nations about us, when moſt of them are involved in grievous Wars, that yet we will not give peace to one another, but live as if Peace were the Plague which we moſt deſire to eſcape.</p>
            <p>Yet as it is the good providence of God, that the Names of <hi>Wiſdom, Godlineſs, Truth, Juſtice, Mercy, Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> are all ſtill honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able even among thoſe that hate and oppoſe them; and the <hi>names</hi> of <hi>Folly, Ungodlineſs, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Unjuſtice, Unmercifulneſs, Diſhoneſty</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> are all diſhonourable where the <hi>things</hi> themſelves are followed and prevail; ſo <hi>Love,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62986:9"/>
Peace</hi> and <hi>Concord,</hi> are names that are by moſt commended; when if moſt were for the <hi>things</hi> indeed, we were in a hopeful way of recovery: And <hi>Malice, Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Diſcord,</hi> are cryed down by thoſe, whom no intreaty will prevail with to forbear them, or to accept any remedy againſt them.</p>
            <p>Yet we are thus far prepared for peace, that if we be not falſe Hypocrites, if we did <hi>but know</hi> which is the true way of <hi>Love, Peace</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> we would follow it: And if we <hi>knew</hi> what is Schiſm indeed, we would avoid it. And its pity that men that think themſelves wiſe ſhould yet <hi>not know</hi> the way of Love and Peace: Eſpecially that the Learned Preachers of the Goſpel of Love and Peace, ſhould ſtill be the incendiaries, and ſtir up the Laity that would be more peaceable, againſt each other. And that after ſo many Volumes of Hiſtory have theſe thirteen hundred years at leaſt, aſperſt the Clergy with the reproach of being the contentious troublers of the world. And yet muſt we deſpair of a cure of ſo odious a diſeaſe?</p>
            <p>The thing that <hi>Books, Sermons,</hi> and <hi>Diſcourſes, cry</hi> out againſt thoſe called <hi>Non Conformiſts</hi> for, is <hi>Humorous, Obſtinate Schiſm,</hi> and <hi>Diſobedience, in Preaching, when forbidders,</hi> and <hi>keeping up Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies not allowed,</hi> and <hi>gathering Churches out of Churches, &amp; ſeparating from the Pariſh-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Church of England.</hi> If we can find out the Schiſmatick, we hope he will be condemned by us all. But that the Cauſe may be heard at leaſt in ſome part, before it is judged, we that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh this, here give an account of our <hi>own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and thoſe that <hi>we are beſt acquainted with,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62986:10"/>
how far we hold it lawful or unlawful to <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches,</hi> or to <hi>ſeparate from Churches,</hi> or to <hi>differ</hi> from what is eſtabliſhed by Authority: But the Application to our particular Caſe, and our Arguments thereabout, we muſt not here preſume to publiſh.</p>
            <p>They that accuſe others as Schiſmaticks, and Separatiſts, for deſerting Churches, or gathering Churches out of Churches, and will not tell us what they mean by the word <hi>Church,</hi> nor give us leave to tell them what we mean, but judge in confuſion, and deſpiſe explication, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary diſtinction, are men that we can neither be edified by, nor edifie, in this way.</p>

Church-Forms as ſubordinate, left to the prudence of this Univerſal Governour as Supreme; as Inferiour Officers in Kingdoms are made by the King.</p>

We find that it is a work ſtill neceſſary to be done: 2. And others as well as Apoſtles did it in thoſe times; as <hi>Silas, Luke, Apollo, Timothy, Titus,</hi> &amp;c. and ſince, all ſuch as have planted the Goſpel among Infidels. 3. Becauſe Chriſt promiſed to be with them that did this work to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 21. But whether ſuch men be of a different <hi>office</hi> or <hi>order</hi> from the <hi>junior</hi> Paſtors; whether any true <hi>Presbyter</hi> that hath ability, opportunity and invitation, may not do the ſame work with Infidels; and by his ſucceſs, and ſeniority may not ſo <hi>ordain</hi> Paſtors over the Churches which he gathered; and have an anſwerable right to reverence and regard from thoſe that he ſo planteth, and ordaineth; are controverſies which we preſume not now to decide.</p>
            <p>And we cannot prove that this maketh a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <hi>form</hi> of a Church, no not in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time and caſe: For we cannot prove that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62986:13"/>
they diſtributed the Countrys into <hi>Provinces</hi> or <hi>Dioceſes</hi> peculiar to each Apoſtle; and had any Churches which they ſuppoſed to be peculiarly under this or that Apoſtles Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo as that any of the reſt might not with Apoſtolical power have come, reſided, preacht and governed in the ſame: No Scripture tells us of ſuch limits &amp; Provinces. Nay, the Scripture tells us, that many of them were as Apoſtles at once in the ſame places: As at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> oft. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had Apoſtolical power at <hi>Epheſus: Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> (as is commonly held) at <hi>Rome:</hi> And its probable that as Chriſt ſent forth his diſciples by two and two, ſo the Apoſtles went in company, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did: ſo that ſuch <hi>appropriate ſettlement</hi> of <hi>Provincial</hi> or <hi>Dioceſan Churches,</hi> we cannot ſee proved; though ſuch a <hi>Generall Miniſtry</hi> is eaſily proved; and we doubt not but by conſent they <hi>might</hi> have diſtributed their Provinces, had they ſeen cauſe, and that actually they did ſo diſtribute their <hi>labours</hi> as their work and ends required: But if they had become proper Provincial Biſhops over ſeveral Diſtricts or Provinces, it ſeemeth ſtrange to us that no hiſtory telleth us which <hi>were</hi> the <hi>twelve</hi> or <hi>thirteen Provinces,</hi> and how limited; and that they continued not <hi>longer;</hi> and that inſtead of <hi>three Patriarchs</hi> firſt, and four after, and five next, we had not <hi>twelve</hi> or <hi>thirteen Apoſtles</hi> or <hi>Patriarchs ſeated</hi> over all the world, with their known diviſions; And that men ſeek not now to reduce the Churches to this <hi>Primitive State,</hi> rather than to the ſaid <hi>Imperial Conſtitution;</hi> and rather to ſubject us all to the <hi>Apoſtolical Seats,</hi> than to <hi>five Patriarchs</hi> in the dominions of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Prince,</hi> and now moſtly ſubject to an Infidel. Yea it is ſtrange to us that the firſt Seat <hi>(Rome)</hi> ſhould derive its pretended power from two Apoſtles (as if our Church might have two Biſhops) and the ſecond <hi>(Alexandria)</hi> from Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> who was <hi>no Apoſtle,</hi> and the third <hi>(Antioch)</hi> from the <hi>ſame Apoſtle</hi> that <hi>Rome</hi> did, (as if <hi>one Biſhop</hi> might have <hi>two ſuch</hi> Dioceſes,) and the fourth <hi>(Ieruſalem)</hi> from St. <hi>James,</hi> commonly ſaid to be <hi>no Apoſtle;</hi> and the laſt (which became the ſecond or the firſt) from <hi>no Apoſtle,</hi> nor make any ſuch <hi>pretence;</hi> if thirteen Apoſtolick Provinces were then known.</p>
            <p>But we eaſily acknowledge, that as Apoſtles having planted many Churches ſtaid a while in each, when they had ſetled it, and ſome time viſited it again; ſo they are by ſome hiſtorians called the <hi>firſt Biſhops</hi> of thoſe Churches, being indeed the <hi>tranſient Governours</hi> of them: In which ſenſe <hi>one Church</hi> might at once have <hi>two or many Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>one Biſhop</hi> many <hi>Churches,</hi> and he be Biſhop of one Church this week, who was Biſhop of another where he came the next.</p>

That no Biſhop had more than one worſhiping aſſembly at once: For all Chriſtians aſſembled for worſhip on the Lords dayes, and their worſhip ſtill included ſomewhat which none but a Miniſter of Chriſt might do, and when there was no other Miniſter in being but Biſhops, and a Biſhop can be but in one place at once, a Biſhop could have but one aſſembly.

            <p n="5">V. We ſuppoſe it certain that Chriſtian Kings have <hi>no leſſer</hi> power than the Kings of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> except 1.

            <p n="6">VI. And 1.

            <p n="7">VII. 2. Yea <hi>great</hi> and <hi>ſpecial Mandates</hi> were oft ſent from God by <hi>Prophets,</hi> againſt which the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had no power.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. 3. The <hi>Executive</hi> or <hi>Judicial</hi> Power was <hi>divided:</hi> part was in the Kings and Magiſtrates; and part was in the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> which the King could not uſurp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (as appeareth in <hi>Uzziahs</hi> offering Incenſe,) nor yet forbid the Prieſts to uſe it, according to God's Law; nor change or abrogate their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.

            <p n="9">IX. 4. God himſelf ſettled the <hi>High Prieſthood</hi> on the <hi>line of Aaron,</hi> and <hi>all the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>

            <p n="11">XI. 6. There are more particular Laws made by God for the duty of the Prieſts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing their office and work, than for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular caſe, as many hundred Texts will tell us: And none of theſe Laws might be altered, or ſuſpended by the Kings of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Nor thoſe by which God ſtated ſome of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Power in the Congregation, <hi>Num.</hi> 35. 12. to 26.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. 7. <hi>Solomon</hi>'s putting out <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and putting in <hi>Zadok,</hi> is not contrary to any of this: For (ſuppoſing the words 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2, 35. to be not only a hiſtory of the bare matter of fact, but a juſtification of it <hi>de jure.)</hi> 1. It poſeth learned men to reſolve how <hi>Zadok</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> are oft ſaid to be both High Prieſts before, and <hi>Zadok</hi> ſtill put before <hi>Abiathar.</hi> 2.

And what <hi>Solomon</hi> did was that the <hi>word of the Lord might be fulfilled.</hi> How the poſſeſſion came into the hands of the line of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> Expoſitors cannot find: It is like it was by occaſion of the confuſions of their oft Captivity and Anarchy in the interſpace of the Judges. 3. Even the Prieſts were the King's ſubjects, and might be puniſhed for their crimes, ſo it were according to God's Laws.

XIII. 8. The Prieſthood then depended not on the inſtitution or will of the King or People: He might not put out a lawful Prieſt, that had not forfeited his Life or Office: He might not have put any one in his place that had not right from God, or that was unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: He might not have forbid the Prieſts the work appointed them by God: But yet if <hi>he had injurio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="14">XIV. And the quality of <hi>Moſes Law</hi> and its <hi>Works,</hi> as different from the Laws of Chriſt, and the Works thereof, muſt be conſidered, that we may diſcern the difference of the Caſes.

               </gap>fidelity, cured by the Preaching of the Truth, which therefore requireth that the Preachers for number and qualification be anſwerable to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62986:19"/>
their work: eſpecially ſeeing they are things ſo myſterious and ſupernaturally revealed, which men are to believe: And the works of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law lay very much in ceremony and outward actions, which a man of mean qualifications might eaſily do: But the great work of the Goſpel is to <hi>bring Life and Immortality to light,</hi> and to Preach Chriſt, by whom came <hi>Grace and Truth,</hi> and more notably than the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> did, to call men to Mortification, Self-denial, Croſs-bearing, contempt of the World, by Faith and Hope and Love of a better World, and to bring them to a heavenly mind and life: And mens ſalvation is laid on this. If it were but to offer Sacrifices, and do over the task of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ceremonies, a Maſs-Prieſts qualifications might ſerve the turn: And if it were but to put men to death that will not be <hi>Jews,</hi> and take their Covenant, and that draw any from their Religion, neither ſo <hi>many</hi> nor ſo <hi>excellent</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were neceſſary: But we are under a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Covenant, even a Law of Love which is more eminently become the firſt and laſt, the great and new Commandment, and the regent Principle in Souls and Churches; and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and quality of the Preachers of it muſt be anſwerable.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. As <hi>Moſes</hi> was God's miniſterial Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and was faithful in all his truſt; ſo Chriſt is the <hi>great Prophet like unto him,</hi> as typified by him, whom God hath raiſed up to his Church, whom they that <hi>hear not,</hi> ſhall be cut off by God, and from that Church as he hath appointed: The <hi>Legiſlation Univerſal</hi> is now the <hi>work of Chriſt</hi> by himſelf,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62986:20"/>
and by the Holy Ghoſt, which he promiſed and gave for that uſe to his Apoſtles, that they might infallibly underſtand his will, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what he had commanded them to teach the world.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Paſtors</hi> may not now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſuſpend any of theſe <hi>Laws of Chriſt,</hi> any more than the Jewiſh Kings or Prieſts might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſuſpend the Laws of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">XVII. Chriſt hath inſtituted a Miniſtry to be for ever ſtabliſhed in the world, to Preach his Goſpel, to convert volunteers unto Faith and Holineſs, and to gather by Baptiſm all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters into his Covenant and Church, and to teach them all that he hath commanded them. And this none have power to overthrow.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. He hath ſtated on the Paſtors of ſuch Churches, the Power afore deſcribed, of Teaching Aſſemblies and particular perſons, of leading them in publick Worſhip, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of judging by the power of the Keys, whom to receive into their communion by Baptiſm, and profeſſion of Faith, and whom to admoniſh, and for obſtinate impenitence to reject: And this Inſtitution none may alter.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. He hath inſtituted ordinary Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and ſtated particular Churches, as is aforeſaid, for theſe holy exerciſes, and forbad all Chriſtians to forſake them; and he and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles have appointed and ſeparated the Lord's day hereunto. None therefore may abrogate or ſuſpend theſe Laws.

            <p n="20">XX. Chriſts Laws empower and oblige the Biſhops or <hi>ſenior</hi> Paſtors to Ordain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for this Miniſterial ſervice of the Church, and ſo to propagate their order to the end of the world: By which Ordination, 1.

But the <hi>Power</hi> with which they miniſterially inveſt him (delivering him poſſeſſion as Chriſt appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>reſulteth directly</hi> from the <hi>Law or Donation of Chriſt;</hi> As the power of a <hi>Mayor</hi> from the <hi>Charter</hi> of the King, and not from the <hi>Electors</hi> or <hi>Inveſters.</hi> None therefore have power given them by Chriſt, to <hi>hinder</hi> ſuch <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Propagation</hi> of ſuch a Miniſtry, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. So exceeding great are the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and priviledges of being <hi>members of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>his Church univerſal</hi> and <hi>particular,</hi> that no <hi>unwilling</hi> perſon is immediately capable of it: Nor is it poſſible <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> for any (adult) perſon that <hi>conſenteth not</hi> to be a Chriſtian, or a Member of any particular Church. He cannot be a <hi>juſt Communicant againſt his will;</hi> nor <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> God with the Church; nor take a man for <hi>his Paſtor,</hi> or <hi>uſe him</hi> as a Paſtor, <hi>againſt his will:</hi> And God hath laid mens <hi>ſalvation</hi> or <hi>damnation</hi> on the choice or refuſal of their wills. Therefore no man can be the <hi>Biſhop or Paſtor</hi> of a Church, either <hi>de jure,</hi> or truly <hi>de facto,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church or Peoples will, or without

their conſent. And as the <hi>Nature</hi> of the thing proveth this, ſo doth the ſacred Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. &amp; 2. 37, 38. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.</p>
            <p>And ſo doth the judgment and practice of Chriſt's Church, for many hundred years; which is ſo fully proved by <hi>Blondell, de jure plebis,</hi> and confeſſed by the Papiſts themſelves, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in all antiquity, that we need not add the proof. Therefore no power may change this <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and <hi>of Chriſt;</hi> nor can they by any Law, Mandate, Choice, Ordination, Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Impoſition, or other act, make any man a <hi>real Paſtor</hi> to that People that <hi>conſent not</hi> to the relation.

            <p n="25">XXV. We doubt not at all but that Kings are the Governours of Biſhops, and Churches, by coercive power, as truly as of Phyſicians, or other Profeſſions: And though they have no Authority to abrogate or ſuſpend the Laws of Chriſt, yet they have a Power of Legiſlation, under Chriſt, as Corporations for By-laws have under them: which power is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about thoſe things which God hath left to their determination; and not either <hi>above Chriſt, againſt Chriſt,</hi> or in <hi>coordination with Chriſt,</hi> but only in ſuch <hi>ſubordination</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> and to his <hi>Laws.</hi>

            <p n="11">XI. 9. To <hi>draw others</hi> to ſuch ſeparation by ſuch falſe accuſations or opinions, is worſe than to do it ſilently ones ſelf; and the <hi>more</hi> the <hi>worſe.</hi>

The ſame we ſay of ſuch Paſtors as reject from Baptiſm and the Church, the Infants of true Chriſtians on the aforeſaid account: As alſo of thoſe that reject them from Baptiſm, becauſe the Parents will not offer them to it, unleſs they <hi>may themſelves be the Covenanters in their own Childrens names,</hi> and the <hi>Expreſs dedicaters</hi> of <hi>them to God,</hi> and becauſe they either <hi>cannot get credible Godfathers,</hi> or <hi>will not</hi> put others to <hi>promiſe</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian Education</hi> of <hi>their children,</hi> who they have no reaſon to believe do at all intend it, or will ever do it, we can excuſe no ſuch rejection of Chriſtian Infants from Chriſts Church, from Schiſm.</p>

If ſome Chriſtians be of opinion that Chriſts example bindeth them to receive the Lords Supper in a Table geſture, or that the tradition of the Univerſal Church and the Canon 20th of the Nicene Councill is obligatory to them, which forbad men to <hi>adore Kneeling</hi> on any Lords day in the year, or on any week day between <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſuntide</hi> (which no other General Council revoked, but continued till meer uſage by degrees wore it out, ſaith Dr.

Or if the ſaid perſons ſhould think that to receive Kneeling were ſuch a ſcandalous appearance of the Papiſts Bread-worſhip, as the bowing before an Image forbidden by the 2d.

            <p n="27">XXVII. 25. It may be Schiſmatical to caſt men out of the Church for that which yet may be Schiſmatical in the perſon ſo ejected: If he depart from the Church though Schiſmatically only in ſome accident, circumſtance, or ſome one act or thing of no neceſſity to communion or ſalvation; we think he may not be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, <hi>e. g.</hi> for not paying Fees at the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours Court, or ſuch like. For as God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth not from ſinners firſt, or further than they depart from him; ſo we humbly conceive the Church ſhould imitate him; remembring how Chriſt that came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them, rebuked the Sons of Thunder that would have had him deſtroy thoſe that refuſed to receive him, telling them, <hi>That they knew not what manner of ſpirit they were of.</hi>

On the other ſide, it may be Schiſm to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from a Church that hath ſome Schiſmatical Principles, Practices, and Perſons, if thoſe be not ſuch or ſo great as to neceſſitate our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from them: For alas, it is too few Churches that are ſo happy as to have nothing, and do nothing which is Schiſmatical.</p>

            <p n="1">1. In general, when the Laws, Practices, or Perſons of the Church which they ſeparate from, give them <hi>no ſufficient cauſe</hi> of a departure.</p>

            <p n="5">5. When they are gathered by the pride of the Miniſters, that would thereby unduly ſet up themſelves, and draw away Diſciples after them; or by their covetouſneſs, ſeeking not the good of

            <p n="8">8. When it is done out of a proud overvaluing of mens own opinions, or ſome odd ſingularity, whereby men cannot bear thoſe that are not of their mind, or whereby they would fain be be more conſpicuous as more Orthodox and wiſe than others.</p>

Otherwiſe one <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor might have undone all the Churches and Souls in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in a great degree; by impoſing on them inſufficient, heretical, or malignant Paſtors: Where it muſt be noted, 1. That God doth ordinarily work on ſouls according to the quality of the means: To ſay that <hi>He can do otherwiſe,</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, while we ſee that he <hi>doth not,</hi> nor hath <hi>promiſed it.</hi> We ſee that Heathens and Infidels are not converted without Preachers; We ſee that Heretical Preachers make Hereticks, and Schiſmatical ones make Schiſmaticks, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ones leave the people ignorant: In ſeveral Countries the people are Greeks, Papiſts, Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, &amp;c. as they are taught. We ſee that one clear, convincing, experienced, ſerious Preacher, turneth more ſouls among us from ignorance, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, fleſhly luſt, and worldly wicked hearts and lives, than abundance of raw young Readers or Preachers, that ignorantly ſay over a dry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſpeech in a School-boys mode and tone.

Even as we ſee by experience that a few skilful, prudent, experienced Phyſicians cure more than abundance of young beginners, who too oft kill more than they cure. We ſee that the <hi>Abaſſian, Armenian, Greek,</hi> and moſt Popiſh Countries are lamentably ignorant (and uſually propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably vicious) for want of a learned, pious, skilful, and laborious Miniſtery, Hiſtory tells us, that the Kingdom of <hi>Nubia</hi> forſook Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for want of competent Teachers: The indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Jeſuits and Friars in <hi>China, Japan, Congo,</hi> and other Countries, telleth us how much they laid on the diligent uſe of means. <hi>Joſ. Acoſta</hi> tells us how much the <hi>West-Indies</hi> ſuffer in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by the ignorance and wickedneſs of the Prieſts. How barbarous and ſad a ſtate the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> is in for want of able, faithful Paſtors, while the Emperours put down Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and confine them to Liturgies and Homilies, as is affirmed commonly without contradiction. How miſerable a ſtate the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; yea, the Papacy was in, in the ninth and tenth Ages, even <hi>Baronius, Genebrard,</hi> and the greateſt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers of the Pope lament; and this for want of able, faithful Paſtors and Teachers among them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. No man hath his power to deſtruction, but to edification. The <hi>bonum Publicum</hi> is the end of Government: Therefore it is not Schiſm in Subjects, not to caſt their ſouls on notorious pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of damnation, in obedience to any mortal man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Every man, (eſpecially experienced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62986:37"/>
have more ſenſe and knowledge of what is profitable and congruous to them, than ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by have, how learned ſoever: As ignorance maketh a <hi>few, ſhort, plain, oft repeated words,</hi> in a <hi>familiar</hi> ſtyle, more profitable to low-bred perſons, than an accurate learned Diſcourſe would be; ſo mens ſeveral tempers and vices maketh that matter and manner of Preaching profitable to them, which to others ſeemeth otherwiſe: And as a nice Lady muſt not tie her family of labouring perſons, to the matter and meaſure of her diet, nor revile them as gluttons or fools if they like it not; no more muſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men confine plain people to wordy Orations, (whether Learned or Pedantick) and ſay, This is beſt for them: Much leſs muſt they ſilence cauſleſly ſuch Teachers as truly profit them, or tie them to Homilies or Liturgies only, and ſay, <hi>Here is as much as is neceſſary to ſalvation:</hi> Nor is it any Schiſm in the people, if they refuſe to be ſo confined by them, and denied ſuch helps to their ſalvation as God hath ſent them, and made their due.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62986:37"/>
moſt honoured Ages of the Church, that it is no Schiſm in the forementioned Caſes, to cleave to the faithful Paſtors that were duly ordained and conſented to, and to refuſe ſubjection to ſuch as lawful Princes have impoſed in their ſteads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That even in the Jewiſh State the Kings had not the Election of all the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites (much leſs the Prophets) is before proved; though they had the Government of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's Laws.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Apoſtles ſent by Chriſt performed their Office againſt the will of the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rulers, is not denied.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And becauſe ſome think that this was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per only to Apoſtles or men ſent immediately by Chriſt, we add, that it is not denied that this was the caſe of others in that Age: As <hi>Timothy,</hi> (who is charged before God and Angels to Preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2.) <hi>Titus, Apollo, Silas,</hi> and ſuch others; and of all the ſetled Elders of the Churches, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And it is not denied that this was the caſe of all the ordinary Paſtors for the firſt three hundred years, under the unbelieving Emperors. And as is aforeſaid, even theſe were Governours of the Chriſtian Paſtors and Churches (who are commanded <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. to obey them.) and they wanted not Governing power, though in part they wanted <hi>aptitude to uſe it well;</hi> ſo that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were to obey even Heathen Governours in lawful things.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And it is undeniable that this was the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and caſe of the Fathers and People of the Church under the Chriſtian Emper ours that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62986:38"/>
were <hi>Arrians,</hi> or favoured the <hi>Arrians:</hi> And as is aforeſaid, the <hi>Arrians</hi> would have ſubſcribed to all the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, (that Chriſt is <hi>Light of Light, God of God, very God of very God, begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not made,</hi> till they came to that one word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And when <hi>Eleuſius</hi> repenting of his ſin in a forced ſubſcribing to the <hi>Ariminum</hi> faith would have had them have choſen another Biſhop, they would have or acknowledg no other but him; being the undoubted Chuſers of their own Biſhop <hi>Ib. c.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Antioch</hi> ſell into two parties of the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> beſides the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and choſe two Biſhops <hi>Paulinus</hi> and <hi>Meletirs;</hi> Though it was

then contrary to the Canons that one City ſhould have two Biſhops, none queſtioned the peoples right to chuſe, nor denied either of them to be <hi>true Biſhops:</hi> And though the Emperour forbore <hi>Paulinus</hi> for his rare parts and virtues, and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only <hi>Meletius,</hi> the people would not obey his Orders, but ſtill aſſembled as before.</p>
            <p>We are not ignorant what tumults popular Elections of Biſhops have oft cauſed: But two things all acquainted with antiquity know which much ſerve to counterballance this objection: 1. That where Emperours and Synods of Biſhops have made themſelves the Electors, the tumults or confuſions, or at leaſt the conſequent evills were not leſs but greater: 2. And when they did thus aſſume the Election (which was for the moſt part but in a few great ſeats and not of ordinary Biſhops) ſtill they ſuppoſe a neceſſity of the peoples conſent.

The people may not touch his Perſon, by violence, nor deprive him of his benefice or temple, nor yet degrade him: As they that change their Phyſician or Lawyer do no ſuch thing, but ſimply chooſe one that they can truſt. No man will win more by my ſalvation than I ſhall, nor would ſuffer more than I by it if I were damned: Who is more than I concerned what becometh of my ſoul? Am I not to have more care of it than of my eſtate or health of body? Who can eaſily believe thoſe men that ſend us to goales and ruin us for truſting our ſoules with ſuch Guides as to the beſt of our underſtandings we think meeteſt, or at leaſt for avoiding ſuch as we cannot ſo farr truſt, and then tell us that they do it becauſe they love our ſouls better than we love our ſelves, and therefore will not truſt them to our choice. 2. what confuſion doth it cauſe that every man now chooſeth his owne Tutor in philoſophy, his own maſter, his own Lawyer and phyſician, and every woman at age her own husband.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Doth not the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as is ſaid) allow every man his choice, when no man is forbidden to forſake any Biſhop or Paſtor and chooſe another by removing his habitation when he pleaſes? So that all this is but about Pariſh bounds, which is confeſſed to be of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane alterable conſtitution.

and ſome Anabaptiſts are for hearing ſuch Pariſh-Teachers as their Rulers ſhall appoint, ſo they may but commit the Paſtoral care of their ſouls to ſuch as they can better truſt, and have Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſpecial Church Communion free.</p>
            <p n="5">5. what great confuſion doth it breed in <hi>London</hi> that the French and Dutch Churches thus differ from the reſt, and have their proper modes and Government?

Let not envy and animoſity ſeign greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion than there is, and the matter will appear much otherwiſe than it is repreſented, even that the diſcords and confuſions were incomparably leſs (on that occaſion) than they were under the Biſhops in the better times of the Churches, even from <hi>An.</hi> 400 to 600, of which more in due place.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They that will condemn all that hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, ſhall condemn all things in this world: But the Greateſt muſt be noted and avoided firſt. Shall the people have any judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſcerning or not? If yea, the bounds of it muſt be ſhewed, and not the thing denyed as if it muſt bring in all confuſion. If Uſurpers claim the Crown, the Subjects muſt judge which is their true King, and muſt defend his right. Will you ſay, If the people be Judges, they may ſet up Uſurpers, and put down the King? They are but diſcerners of that which is before their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They have no right to erre, nor to alter the Law or right: But if it be otherwiſe, they are to be ruled as brutes: And ſo muſt not judge ſo much as whom they muſt obey. Is there any

Chriſtian that dare ſay, that Biſhops or Princes are in all things to be obeyed, leſt the people be made Judges? And ſo that under Heathen, Mahometan, Papiſt, Heretical Rulers, they muſt be all of their Religion, as to the external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing and practiſing part? None dare for ſhame ſay ſo, ſave an Infidel. Is not this a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion or michief than that which is now diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt: Therefore the bounds muſt be ſet on both ſides, which are not difficult to diſcern: As the people have property in their limbs, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and liberties, and acquiſitions antecedently to humane Government, which is to order theſe, and not to deſtroy them; ſo have all men grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter intereſt in the ſafety of their own ſouls, which no man can take from them; no nor is it in their juſt power to put it into the hands of others from themſelves. If Hereticks, blind guides, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And when Church-communion is due to none but voluntary accepters, men ſhould not be uſed ſo as to take it ſtill againſt their wills, and to be as it were <hi>crammed</hi> and drencht with ſacred My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, &amp; driven to take them againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences and wills from ſuch as they think they cannot communicate with, without being guilty of their ſin: When ſome Councils have owned Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s decree, that no man ought to hear the Maſs from a fornicating Prieſt; much

leſs from men that are far more liable to excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>To this I may add, that as in divers caſes the Canons and Decrees forbad hearing ſome Prieſts, and allowed ſeveral Churches in the ſame ground, ſo they ſeem to give that Paſtor a right to the Conduct of the People, who was the chief Converter of them from Infidelity or Hereſie: And hence was the Popes Controverſie with the <hi>Greeks</hi> about the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> and his claim to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and many others, becauſe he ſaid his Miſſionaries converted them.

            <p>But I find the Roman and Tyrannical ſpirit much inſiſting uppon this, that the Chriſtian Religion was but in the ſhell or Embryo in the Apoſtles dayes; and under Chriſtian Emperours is grown up to the maturity of Papacie, riches, pomp, and grandeur, and that great power which the Chriſtian Emperours gave the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs and prelates of their times. But this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis muſt be better proved before we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it: We confeſs that for extent and number the Church was there in its minority: But if it was ſo as to infallibility of doctrine &amp; perfection of Laws, and exemplary lives, then the Pope is better than Chriſt and his Apoſtles and their contemptible Decretals and firebrand Councills are better than the ſacred ſcriptures, and their degenerate Clergie and people better than the ancient holy peaceable Chriſtians, &amp; their blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhedders better than the Martyrs, and the Croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers better than the Croſs-bearers; which

And as the people had ever a chuſing or a free conſenting Voice, ſo they oft received Biſhops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who were ordained by ſuch as were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts, Nonconformiſts, and baniſhed both by Emperours and Synods; as in many more inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might be proved: As alſo that they adhered to the Paſtors ſo choſen, notwithſtanding their ejections by the Imperial Power; yea and by ſuch Councils as they thought to be unjuſt; as the ſad diviſions by the diſplacings, reſtorings, and changes of Biſhops by the Councils of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> 1. <hi>Epheſus,</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and by the Emperours in thoſe times, do fully prove, the people following ſome one, and ſome another; though fear oft prevailed for conformity with the greater part. (And no wonder when ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Biſhops at the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> profeſſed that <hi>for fear</hi> they had judged againſt <hi>Flavianus</hi> for <hi>Eutichus</hi> againſt their conſciences, and even old <hi>Oſius,</hi> and many more at <hi>Ariminum</hi> did the like; and when the powers changed, cryed, <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes peccavimus;</hi> and when under <hi>Theodoſius</hi> 2d. ſo many went one way, who under <hi>Martian</hi> went another way, even in point of Hereſie.</p>

3. That certain experience putteth us paſt doubt, that ignorance, ſenſuality, worldlineſs, profaneneſs are far more common, and a holy heavenly mind and life, and all ſerious Chriſtianity and obedience, far, very far more rare, in thoſe Kingdoms and Pariſhes which have no plain, convincing, ſerious, lively and exemplary Preachers, than in thoſe that have, although they be baptized, and have the Creed, Lords prayer and Decalogue in their Liturgie. And yet here are all things of abſolute objective neceſſity to ſalvation. What a caſe the Moſcovites are in, that have only Liturgies and Homilies read, we mentioned before: And how ſad the caſe is among the Greeks, Armenians, Abaſſins, and moſt Papiſts, for want of better Preachers. Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> could ſay of the Iriſh, that more periſhed by not knowing what we are on both ſides agreed in, than by their Popiſh Errours; And what a caſe the Scottiſh Highlanders, too many of the Welſh, and moſt Pariſhes in <hi>England</hi> were in, as to ſerious piety, which had hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but Readers, or Preachers that did leſs than read a Homilie, experience conſtraineth us to know: as alſo what difference there is yet to be ſeen as to ſerious faith and godlineſs, between the fruits of a clear, ſerious, holy, diligent Preacher, and of raw youths that ſay over a pedantik lifeleſs ſpeech, and out of the pulpit little differ in ſpeech or life, from Carnal Worldlings or formal Hypocrites. Though we know that all that profeſs to be ſeriouſly Religious, are not ſo, yet none are ſo that do not profeſs it as they have opportunity.</p>
            <p>As we are not able to deny this experience
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62986:52"/>
of the different fruits of different Teaching (when all have the Creed;) Nor dare deny the neceſſity of ſerious faith, repentance and holineſs to ſalvation (leſt we renounce the Goſpel,) nor yet that no men (much leſs moſt men or many thouſands) may as an act of obedience to man, refuſe thoſe helps which God provideth them, and without which few Comparatively are truely converted from a Carnal life and ſaved; ſo therefore we dare not think or ſay, that humane Lawes or orders are arguments of ſufficient weight to move them hereunto.</p>
            <p n="53">LIII. Obj. 3. <hi>But the hurt of the peoples chuſing Teachers and Aſſemblies without or againſt the Rulers will, is greater than the hurt that cometh by the want of better Teachers.</hi>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The peoples choice doth hurt by accident, in thoſe Countries, where the Rulers put down neceſſary helps, and where the people are Erroneous, Heretical, and Unruly, and ſo where the people would chooſe unſufferable men, ſuppoſing ſtill that no Church is conſtituted without mutual conſent of the Paſtor and the flock and that the Rulers alter not or violate not Chriſts Laws by which he hath appointed the ordering of Aſſemblies; Therefore it is the Rulers Office to hinder the people from doing miſchief, without hindering them from their duty and from doing well; To Govern them in their work, and not to forbid it.</p>

It is not then eaſie to think of a greatet hurt, than to forbid men ſuch means, without which experience aſſureth us that few comparatively are thus inlightened and renewed to God, and with which more Comparatively are renewed. To ſay that God <hi>can</hi> bleſs to us an ignorant heartleſs, Carnal Teacher, is no anſwer, while experience cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth us that Comparatively he doth not do it. If the people would chuſe ſuch Paſtors, <hi>Rulers</hi> muſt do their beſt to change their minds, and to provide <hi>better</hi> for them. But thats not the caſe that we are now ſpeaking to. If people would run into Sects and Hereſies, Rulers may <hi>puniſh</hi> and <hi>reſtrain falſe Teachers</hi> that dangerouſly corrupt the Chriſtian doctrine and ſeduce the peoples ſouls; But they may not therefore ſilence the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, And adhereing to ſuch Miniſters, doth not any hurt of it ſelf: Nor any way tend to the furthering of ſo much hurt, as the contrary would do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For who knoweth where to bound his obedience to ſuch ſilencers as aforeſaid, If a thouſand or two thouſand faithful Miniſters, muſt ceaſe Preaching when ſo forbidden, why not 3000, why not 4000? If half a Kingdom; can you ſatisfie the conſciences of the other half that they muſt not do ſo too, and ſo all Chriſtian
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62986:53"/>
Kingdoms conform to Moſcovie when the Prince commandeth it. And if 1000 or 2000 or 3000 Pariſhes muſt chooſe the apparent hazard of their ſouls and refuſe ſuch helps as experience certifieth us they greatly need, in obedience to man, why muſt not the reſt of the Pariſhes do ſo alſo? May I give away the needfull helps to my ſalvation, becauſe others have them, as if their ſalvation might ſatisfie me inſtead of my own?</p>
            <p n="4">4. We acknowledge it a very great Mercy of God, to have a Chriſtian Prince, and that every Kingdom ſhould be Chriſtian, and that Princes muſt do what they can to accompliſh it; And that they are the Governours of Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But yet the old ſaying is true (owned even by the Papiſts, <hi>vid. Pet. De Marc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet conſtraining the <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>Heretical</hi> to <hi>hear ſound Teachers,</hi> we are far from oppoſing. But when Paul hath ſaid <hi>[Not a Novice,]</hi> If Rulers will ſilence better Teachers, and ſet up <hi>Novices,</hi> that are unskilful in that great and ſacred work, and never felt that work of <hi>faith,

            <p n="5">5. Yea if men of ſuch doctrine could once make Princes and people believe, that the people ought to receive only ſuch Paſtors as Princes chooſe for them, it may do more harm than all our ſects do: For ſects cannot caſt out religion at once; Nay uſually they periſh themſelves by their own diviſions and ſhame before they can ruine the Church. But Princes might change Religion as oft as the Moon changeth. And if good Princes were but the tenth part as rare, as they thought that ſaid <hi>[In uno annulo]</hi> &amp;c. what then would become of Religion in the World?</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62986:58"/>
thus argue: <hi>[Our Neceſſity requireth Paſtoral overſight, and Chriſt commandeth us to uſe it, when we may have it: But from this publick Miniſter we cannot have it: Therefore we muſt ſeek it where we can.</hi> That moſt men have <hi>need</hi> of Paſtoral overſight, is certain; elſe Chriſt would not have inſtituted it for them: And every man ſhould be conſcious of his own need.</p>
            <p>That Chriſt hath commanded us the uſe of it is certain; 1. In all thoſe Texts which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Paſtors their general and particular duties to the People, to Preach and be inſtant in ſeaſon and out, to reprove, rebuke, exhort, to comfort the feeble minded, to viſit the ſick, to convince the erroneous, to adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to pray and worſhip God publickly with them, &amp;c. 2. In all thoſe Texts that command the People to hear, ſubmit to, obey, and imitate ſuch Guides, and uſe ſuch Ordinances. In ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral caſes the People may poſſibly be deprived of this at home, as from the allowed Miniſter: 1. When publick Paſtors are at ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from them, as that ſuch Paſtors cannot come to them, nor they and their families go ſo far, without ſuch inconvenience and trouble, as will fruſtrate the end of their endeavours: As in <hi>France</hi> where the Proteſtants muſt go twenty miles, or ten, to a Church; which the weak, children and aged cannot do, nor the reſt of the family without ſuch coſt and pains, and loſs of time as will deprive them of the benefit.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But yet the Proteſtants there do not ſet up unlicenſed Churches.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That is not as an act of formal <hi>obedience,</hi> as if they took it to be unlawful becauſe prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62986:58"/>
but in <hi>prudence,</hi> becauſe the perſecution, ſhould they do it, would fruſtrate their attempt: In ſuch caſes the old Chriſtians met in ſecret.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Where Pariſhes are ſo great that the allowed Paſtors <hi>cannot</hi> Preach to <hi>half</hi> or a <hi>fourth</hi> or <hi>tenth</hi> part of the people; and cannot viſit half the ſick, and Baptize, and adminiſter the Lords Supper as is neceſſary; And have not <hi>time,</hi> if the ignorant, and doubting, and troubled perſons ſhould come to them for Counſel, reſolution or comfort, to ſpeak duely to one of twenty of them. In a Pariſh of 50000 or 30000, or 20000 or 15000 or 10000 ſoules, how few is it that one or two Miniſters can perform all the Offices to, publick and private which the Goſpel requireth Paſtors to perform.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where the allowed Paſtors are ſo ſlothful or proud that they will not condeſcend to theſe Offices, of Perſonal help to many thouſands, eſpecially of the poor.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Where they are young raw men, or ignorant of ſuch matters, unable to counſel people as their neceſſities require, in order to their ſalvation; and perhaps to do it tolerably in a publick Sermon.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Where they are ſo prophane and malignant, that if poor people come to them with caſes of conſcience, or for counſel what they muſt do to be ſaved, they will but deride them as ſcrupulous and preciſe, and make them believe that to be ſolicitous about ſalvation, and afraid of ſinning, and ſeriouſly godly, is but to be Hypocrites, melancholy or mad; And perhaps bend their Preaching the ſame way.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When they are Heretical and not to be truſted in point of faith.</p>

7. And when they are ſo Factious and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, as that their Preaching and Conference tendeth to render other good Chriſtians odious, and ſtir up men to hate, perſecute, or ſeparate from them, and ſo to deſtroy true Love and Concord.</p>
            <p>In any of theſe caſes when the people or part of them are deprived of that Paſtoral helps which their neceſſity requireth, and God comm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andeth, they may ſeek it where they can beſt have it.</p>
            <p n="63">LXIII. In all theſe caſes it is an unſatisfactory Anſwer to tell them that <hi>Religion is kept up in the land,</hi> and that <hi>other perſons</hi> or <hi>Pariſhes have what they want,</hi> or that Order and Obedience muſt be preferred to their ſupply, or that God can ſave them without a Paſtor, &amp;c. For ſo <hi>God can ſave</hi> the Heathen world without the Goſpel Preached if he pleaſe: And ſo you might perſwade the Poor to famiſh, rather than againſt Law to beg; becauſe if thouſands of them dye of Famine, yet <hi>other people</hi> are ſupplied, and have plenty: Or you might tell men that they muſt uſe no Phyſician, though <hi>they</hi> dye for it, if they have no tolerable one allowed them by the Magiſtrate, becauſe <hi>others</hi> have Phyſicians though <hi>they</hi> dye for want of them.</p>
            <p>What if the Pariſh Prieſt could Baptize but one of many (or not all:) Muſt the reſt be content to be unbaptized? If not, why muſt they be content without all publick Preaching and Worſhipping of God, and the Lords Supper, and perſonal helps of Paſtors which they need? <hi>Paul</hi> thanketh God that he Baptized none of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſave ſome few, and ſaith, that <hi>God
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62986:59"/>
ſent him not to Baptize, but to Preach the Goſpel.</hi> And can any man prove then, That if the Pariſh Miniſter cannot or will not Baptize his Children he muſt get another to do it, yea a prohibited Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter rather then they ſhould be unbaptized; and yet that if the Pariſh Church cannot receive him, or the Paſtor cannot or will not do the Office of a Paſtor for him, he muſt be without Preaching, Worſhipping God, and Paſtoral overſight?</p>
            <p n="64">LXIV. Yet here we muſt declare 1. That in ſuch neceſſity people muſt <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> firſt ſeek their ſupply in that way that is moſt for peace, and moſt for publick good, and leaſt ſcandalous or dividing, and that is moſt agreable to the Rulers will and honour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That for ſome ſhort ſeaſon in which his ſoul is not apparently hazarded; as alſo in the tolerable loſs, of ſome meaſures of Paſtoral help, a man muſt ſubmit his own perſonal advantage to publick intereſt. and may hope that God will make it up. As alſo when it tendeth to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable greater advantage afterward, by putting by ſome preſent ſtorm: But not ſtatedly, to be without Chriſts inſtituted ordinances and helps; <hi>e. g.</hi> Pariſh Order is deſireable and is the Rulers will: If therefore ſupply can be had in a neighbour Pariſh for them that want it in their own, and by an allowed Miniſter rather than a diſallowed, it ſhould be choſen, unleſs the diſparity be ſo great as to weigh down the contrary inconveniences. And if for a time any be conſtrained to another way, they ſhould do it but as an extroardinary neceſſity for the preſent time, till they can be ſupplied in the allowed Parochial way; and avoid as much as poſſibly

               <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Annotat hath well deſcribed.)

            <p n="2">2.

And he that ſo withdraweth himſelf from the communion of notorious wicked Paſtors whom he hath no power to caſt out, not ſeparating cauſleſly from others or the Church-ſtate, ſeemeth to us to have all the following reaſons to excuſe him from the guilt of Schiſm.</p>
            <p n="1">1 God hath commanded his ſervants to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of falſe or pretended Prophets, and told us how to know them, by the hurtful fruits of thorns and thiſtles: And <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Coloſſians, &amp;c.</hi> earneſtly to beware of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Teachers; and the Churches that had thoſe that taught people to eat things offered to Idols, &amp;c. are threatned: And God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth thoſe that tryed falſe Apoſtles, and found them Lyars: Therefore the people in ſuch caſes as thoſe have a trying judgment, in order to their practice. And <hi>Paul</hi> warneth the <hi>Romans</hi> to mark thoſe that cauſe diviſions and <hi>offences</hi> (or ſcandals) and avoid them as not ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jeſus Chriſt but their bellies; and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named crimes are <hi>ſcandals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. God hath commanded men to know, love, and imitate godly Paſtors, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7, 17. 24. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12, 13. 1 <hi>Tim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="3">3. Though the Apoſtles charge <hi>[with ſuch no not to eat]</hi> enable not private men to exerciſe Governing diſcipline on bad Paſtors, it ſeemeth to us to bind them, when the caſe is notorious, to diſown them.</p>

            <p n="10">10. St. <hi>Martin,</hi> would not come to the ſynods of the Biſhops about him, nor Communicate with them at all, becauſe they were ſome of

them, raſh, bad men, and had inſtigated <hi>Maximus</hi> to ſubdue the <hi>Priſcillian Gnoſticks</hi> by the Sword, and thereby brought Religious people that were ſtrict, into ſuſpicion of <hi>Priſcillianiſm;</hi> but eſpecially he holding that Hereſie was not to be ſo puniſhed: And when to ſave ſome mens lives, he vielded to <hi>Maximus</hi> once to Communicate with the Biſhops, an Angel in his way corrected him, and his working of Miracles was diminiſhed by it, and he forbore their Communion after to the death. Either this hiſtory is true or not: If not, when it is written by his own Diſciple and acquaintance, <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> and one of the moſt Godly and Learned of all the ancient Hiſtorians, and by others; and when <hi>Martin</hi> is Canonized for one of the greateſt Saints upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that the Hiſtory of his Life and Miracles is true, what Church-hiſtory (even that for Biſhops) can we then believe? But if it be true, then one of the holieſt workers of Miracles ſince the Apoſtles, hath aſſured us, that his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from communion with theſe Biſhops (though cruel to Hereticks, ſo groſs) was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by viſion, and by an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and he forbidden their communion for the time to come. We again mention this, as not yet having heard any anſwer to it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Our own Canons forbid the people to communicate with Miniſters for leſſer faults (as private Preaching, Sacraments, Faſts, Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, or out of their own Pariſhes, &amp;c.</p>

becauſe he had perſecuted others by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour: Though his perſecution extended not to the ſilencing of thouſands, or hundreds, or very many that we read of: And as is aforeſaid, he choſe to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by baniſhed men.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Eſpecially if men have no obligation to that inſufficient, heretical, or ungodly Prieſt, but <hi>humane,</hi> becauſe a <hi>Patron</hi> preſented him, or a <hi>Magiſtrate impoſed</hi> him, or becauſe <hi>Pariſh-order</hi> (which is a humane thing of meer convenience) will elſe ſeem violated: When as the avoiding of the <hi>danger</hi> of a <hi>falſe Paſtor,</hi> and the guilt of his ſin, which by owning him may be incurred, and eſcaping the great loſs of a <hi>faithful Paſtor</hi>'s guidance, when we are conſcious that we great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly need it, are things of greater importance, and of Moral and Evangelical Divine obligation: In this caſe we cannot prove it Schiſm to avoid a wicked Prieſt: The Biſhops hold it a duty to avoid a Nonconformiſt that hath not their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe: But ſuch a one as is foredeſcribed, hath not <hi>Chriſt's Licenſe,</hi> and is a Nonconformiſt to his Laws.</p>
            <p>Again, let it be noted 1. That even under the Jewiſh Law, Magiſtrates were not the chuſers of the Prieſts, but God choſe them by ſetling the Prieſthood on one line. 2. That Chriſt hath by his Spirit in the Apoſtles altered the Prieſthood, and the way of their calling and entrance under the Goſpel. 3. That the Church neer a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years was in poſſeſſion of that way, and many hundred of thoſe years the poſſeſſion was univerſal in all the Churches. 4. That the chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Biſhops or Prieſts by Magiſtrates or Lay-Patrons
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62986:64"/>
was none of that way which Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Therefore ſeeing it is not the <hi>chuſing</hi> or <hi>making,</hi> but the <hi>Governing</hi> of Biſhops or Prieſts that is committed to Princes, and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Law</hi> is the firſt by which <hi>they muſt govern,</hi> it ſeemeth to us that they cannot oblige the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to take up with wicked Paſtors, when bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are prohibited, and are to be had.</p>
            <p n="67">LXVII. 21.

The dreadfulneſs of this Maſſacre (ſo far exceeding the French) &amp; the news ſent over that the <hi>Iriſh ſaid that they had the Kings Commiſſion</hi> and the <hi>foregoing jealouſies</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> and the <hi>Parliaments Declarations,</hi> raiſed in multitudes of the people a fear that the Iriſh when they had ended their work there would come over hither and do the like; and that they had partakers in <hi>England</hi> of whom we were in danger, and that there was no way of ſafety but to adhere to the Parliament for their own defence, or elſe it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62986:71"/>
would quickly be too late to complain.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In 1642. the lamentable Civil Warr brake out: At which time as far as ever we could learn by acquaintance with ſome of them and report of others, excepting an inconſiderable number, the Houſes of Lords and Commons conſiſted of thoſe that had ſtill lived in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Epiſcopal Government and were ſuch Conformiſts as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> deſcribeth Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> and the Clergy and Parliaments of his times to have been, Crying out of the danger of a new partie, that ſaid they would ſhake our <hi>Religion, Liberties</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi> And ſuch were they when the War began, Presbytery being then little known among them.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Their fear of being overpowred by the party of whom they ſeemed to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſudden danger, cauſed ſome of them to countenance ſuch Petitionings and clamours of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> Apprentices, and others, as we think diſorders and provocation of the King.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The firſt open beginning was about the Militia: And whether the <hi>Lord Lieutenants</hi> whom the Parliament choſe, were not <hi>almoſt all Epiſcopal Conformiſts,</hi> we intreat the Reader but to peruſe the Catalogue in the ordinance for that Militia, and to ask any that well knew them (as ſome of us did many of them) and he may certainly be ſatisfied.</p>

15. When the Parliament's Armies were worſted and weakened by the King, and they found themſelves in danger of being overcome, they intreated help from the Scots, who taking the advantage of their ſtraits, brought in the Covenant as the Condition of their help; which the Parliament rather accepted than they would loſe them, which at firſt was impoſed on none by force: But (to paſs by all other Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) was judged by many wiſe men, to be an occaſion of diviſion, as making the oppoſition to <hi>Prelacy,</hi> to be the terms of the Kingdoms Unity and Concord, when they might know that the King and a great, if not the greateſt part of the Kingdom, were of the contrary mind, and ſo it was thought to be (as the Papal terms of Unity) a means of unavoidable diviſion: But others thought that becauſe it tied them to no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, but in their Places and Callings, they might take it.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were men that had lived in Conformity, except about eight or nine of them and the Scots: But being ſuch as thought Conformity lawful in caſe of deprivation, but the things impoſed to be a ſnare, which ſhould be removed if it could be lawfully done, they alſo received the Covenant, but were divided about the ſenſe of the word <hi>[Prelacy,]</hi> many profeſſing their Judgment to be for Moderate Epiſcopacy; whereupon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing additions <hi>[Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, Archdeacons]</hi> were added. And upon ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that it diſclaimed not all Epiſcopacy, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> is ſaid to have given the Covenant to the Houſe of Lords. And they complained of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62986:72"/>
Parliament which tied them to meddle with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they offered to them.</p>
               <p n="17">17. This Covenant and Vow was taken by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and by their Garriſons and <hi>Souldiers</hi> that would volunrarily take it, as a teſt whom they would truſt; the reſt being had in ſuſpenſion: And after the wars; by ſuch as were ordained Miniſters, and by the Kings adherents when they made their compoſitions; ſo far was it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward impoſed. But many Miniſters and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men refuſed it, and ſo did <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Souldiers, and in many Counties few did take it.</p>
               <p n="18">18. How far the Parliament was from being Presbyterians, may partly be ſeen in the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions ſent from them by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to the King at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and partly by their defeating all the deſires and endeavours of thoſe that would have Presbytery ſetled through the Land: We know of no places but <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> where it was commonly taken up, and ſome little of it at <hi>Coventry,</hi> and ſome few ſuch places. And that was only as a tolerated or commended thing, without any impoſition that ever we knew of: And accordingly it came to nothing in a ſhort time.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Till their new modelling their Army, the Parliament had given out all Commiſſions to their Souldiers to fight for <hi>[King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.]</hi> But then the King's name was leſt out; which ſeeming to many thouſands an utter change of the Cauſe, from that time many did deſert them: And thereupon the Party called Sectaries flowing in to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and his Army conquering, the power fell into their hands, who impriſoned the King, accuſed and drove away
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62986:72"/>
eleven Members of the Parliament, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward impriſoned and excluded the major part of the remaining Houſe, and with the reſt cut off the King, caſt down the Houſe of Lords, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a while to ſet up a Commonwealth (as they called it) impoſed an <hi>Engagement to that Commonwealth as eſtabliſhed without King and Houſe of Lords;</hi> ordered the ſequeſtration of the Miniſters that refuſed it, and of thoſe that kept not their daies of faſting and thankſgiving, for the Scotiſh wars which then they made. After which they caſt out with ſcorn that rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Commons that had joyned with them; and choſe themſelves ſome men called a Parliament, who attempting to put down all Pariſh-Miniſters, Tythes and Univerſities (the firſt put to the Vote, and carried but by a few againſt them) they were broke up by delivering up their Commiſſion to <hi>Oliver,</hi> who was made Protector, and had the honour deſigned of ſaving the Miniſtry, Tythes and Univerſities from the Sectaries; even from that danger into which he had brought them.</p>
               <p n="20">20. From the time of theſe <hi>New Cauſes and Changes,</hi> eſpecially the deſtroying the King, violating and caſting out the Parliament men, impoſing the engagement &amp;c. the Miniſters called Presbyterian in <hi>England,</hi> ſome few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliers excepted (many of whom ſince Conform) declared themſelves againſt all this, and were lookt upon as enemies; though kindneſs was offered to reconcile them. Some were impriſoned, many caſt out of their places in the Univerſities, ſome ſequeſtred, and Mr. <hi>Love</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> (a Gentleman) beheaded. Mr. <hi>Gee</hi> with the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62986:73"/>
                  <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Miniſters, with ſome of us, wrote againſt theſe proceedings of the then Power: Many Preacht againſt them, ſo that the ſober Religious people of the land grew commonly diſaffected to them: And what the <hi>Scots</hi> did and how they were conquered, we need not here relate.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The Miniſters who were then in poſſeſſion of the Pariſh Churches were of many minds about Church Government. 1. Many were for the old Epiſcopacy and Liturgie 2. Many were for a reformed Epiſcopacy: 3. Many were for Presbytery (that is, Church Government by Presbyteries, Claſſes and National aſſemblies, of Teaching and of Governing unordained Elders Conjunct, as <hi>jure divino)</hi> 4. Some were for that which is called Independency. 5. Some thought that no form of Church Government was <hi>jure divino.</hi> 6 But the moſt of our acquaintance were peaceable, moderate men that thought ſeveral parties had ſomewhat of the right, and that the points of difference were ſo few and ſmall, that they might well live in peace and love, and that none of the parties was ſo right as that in all things they ſhould be followed, and others trod down to ſet them up: And many of theſe were young men that, being at the Schools, had not been engaged in the firſt quarrels, and deſired not to ſide with any dividing parties, and modeſtly profeſſed that they had not maturity enough to ſtudy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any great confidence in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.</p>
               <p n="22">22. This laſt ſort of men beginning in <hi>Worceſt:-ſhire</hi> ſet on foot a work of reconciling
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62986:73"/>
Aſſociation, in which the Epiſcopal, Presbyterians and Independants, agreed to practiſe ſo much of Church Government and Miniſtration as they were all agreed in, with mutual Love and aſſiſting concord, and to forbear one another in the reſt, till God ſhould bring us neerer. (And after they added another Agreement, to Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe every perſon in their Pariſhes old and young, that would come to them, or receive them thereto; and perſonally to inſtruct and exhort them about the practicals of Religion, and preparation for death and the life to come) This example was preſently followed by the Miniſters in <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmorland, Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Dorſetſhire, Eſſex,</hi> and going on in other Counties, till the confuſions 1659 interrupted it, and the return of the Prelacie ended it and many ſuch endeavours.</p>
               <p n="23">23. When <hi>Oliver</hi> was dead, many ſorts of Government were ſet up in one year: Firſt his ſon <hi>Richard</hi> (who having never been in Arms, and being famed to be for the King, many thought he would have been ready, when he could, to reſign the Kingdom to him, and ſpoke him fair on that account, and others becauſe they thought he would quiet the violent, and keep out utter confuſion:) After his ejection the Remnant of the Commons called the Commonwealth was reſtored. After this they were caſt out again, and a Council of State Choſen by the Army; till the Kingdom grew to ſcorn them all, and was weary and aſhamed of the confuſions, and revived their deſigns to reſtore the King.</p>
               <p n="24">24. The firſt open attempt of <hi>united endeavours</hi>

againſt the Army, to reſtore the King, was by the <hi>Cheſhire, Lancaſhire,</hi> and <hi>Northwales</hi> men, under Sr. <hi>Georg Booth</hi> (now Lord <hi>De lamere)</hi> and Sir <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="25">25. But the attempts being renewed, at the ſame time, the diviſion of the Oppoſers (the <hi>Army and the Commonwealth Members)</hi> ſhook them all to pieces, and ruined them, and the new cloſure of the Old Parliamentarians, and the Royaliſts, and the Presbyterians, and other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters with the Epiſcopal, ſtrengthened them, and reſtored the King: The Presbyterian Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Souldiers of General <hi>Monk</hi>'s Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with the reſt, and Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> then Lord Mayor (many <hi>London</hi> Miniſters on their part counſelling him thereto) with the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and others, inviting General <hi>Monk</hi> to joyn with the City herein againſt the Oppoſers; from which very day, the ſcales were turned, and all went on without any conſiderable ſtop, and the old ejected Members of Parliament firſt, and the Council ſetled <hi>protempore</hi> after, prepared for His Majeſties return; and Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> and Mr. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="26">26. In preparation for this, ſome Miniſters now ſilenced, had trcated with ſome Gentlemen firm to the King, and with Biſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> Biſhop
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62986:74"/>
                  <hi>Browrig,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and others, who all encouraged them (though ſome much more, than others) by proſeſſing moderate, healing principles and intentions<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="27">27. Thoſe that ſaw the marvelous ſucceſs of this <hi>reconciliation and concord,</hi> and knew that the <hi>Clergies diſtance</hi> was moſt likely, if any thing, to hinder the happy perfection and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a full deſired peace, did preſently attempt an agreement among them: And upon the motion of ſome of the ſince ſilenced Miniſters, the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Orery</hi> mentioning it to the King, they told us, that it was well pleaſing to His Majeſty: Whereupon His Majeſty vouchſafing them audience, and great encouragement, ſeveral perſons on each ſide were appointed to treat of the neceſſary terms of ſetled Concord and to yield to each other as far as they could, and offer their mutual conceſſions: What was done in this is not now to be mentioned, ſave that part of it was publiſhed by ſome body, which declareth it, and the firſt part being about Church Government and worſhip, iſſued in the publication of His <hi>Majeſties Gracious Declaration about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs,</hi> by which all our breaches ſeemed at
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62986:75"/>
the preſent to be almoſt healed, and the Houſe of Commons gave His MAJESTY Publick thanks.</p>
               <p n="28">28 At this time the Lord Chancellor as a token of His Majeſties Gracious favour and acceptance, offered <hi>Biſhopricks to three</hi> that then treated for Reconciliation, and <hi>Deanries</hi> to <hi>two</hi> or three of them. Of the three firſt, one did the next day ſave one refuſe it, but in a letter to him profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his gratitude, and that he was ſo rejoiced in His Majeſties Gracious Declaration, that if it might but be ſetled by Law, he reſolved to uſe his utmoſt endeavours to perſwade all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity on thoſe terms, and therefore would not diſable himſelf thereto by taking a Biſhoprick, and making men think that it was not for juſt concord, but his own intereſt that he wrote or pleaded: Another of them ſoon accepted: The third and the two or three that had Deanries offered them, only ſuſpended till they ſaw whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther His Majeſties Declaration would live or dye.</p>
               <p n="29">29. what was done in the next attempt upon His Majeſties Commiſſion to <hi>agree on ſuch alterations of the Liturgie as were neceſſary to tender Conſciences, &amp;c.</hi> we are to make no further mention of, then is made by the writings given, in which ſome body ſhortly after (in <hi>part</hi> and with many falſe printings) publiſhed; <hi>An Addition to the Liturgie,</hi> A <hi>Reply to ſome former Papers of the Biſhops,</hi> and an <hi>Earneſt Petition</hi> to them for the <hi>Churches Peace,</hi> which were given in and never anſwered by them (that we know of) ſome one printed. And being in writing required by a Right reverend Biſhop then in the Chair, as from ſuperiours to lay by meer
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62986:75"/>
                  <hi>Inconveniences,</hi> and to give in thoſe points which we took to be <hi>flat ſin,</hi> we gave in <hi>eight particulars</hi> the next day as part; and by that time but one of our arguments about one of them was half handled, and the reſt of the arguments untouched, and the reſt of the Controverted inſtances not medled with, our Commiſſion was expired: And the Biſhops argumentation as Opponents, afterward, on another occaſion printed.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Shortly after the convocation of the Clergie ſetled the Liturgie as now it is ſetled: The Kings Declaration dyed: The Parliament made the <hi>Act of Vniformity,</hi> by which many Miniſters for not conforming to that Law were on <hi>Auguſt.</hi> 24. 1662 ejected and ſilenced, on ſevere penalties. About Eighteen hundred of their names from ſeveral Counties were ſhewed Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> and others; and ſome ſay about 200 were omitted, and that they were in all above 2000.</p>
               <p n="31">31. They that had treated for Reconciliation foreſaw what ſad diviſions were like to follow, if we were not healed and united; and therefore in their Petition made a ſolemn Proteſtation that <hi>nothing but the fear of ſin and Gods diſpleaſure ſhould hinder them from Conformity,</hi> deprecating the woful effects of the diviſion, which could not poſſibly be otherwiſe avoided, than by ſome neceſſary abatements of the Impoſitions: and fore telling much that hath ſince come to paſs, which common underſtanding might eaſily ſee in the Cauſes.</p>
               <p n="32">32. The perſons that were ſilenced were not of one mind and meaſure about all the things impoſed on them. 1. Some of them were
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62986:76"/>
Epiſcopal, and for as much as <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> writeth for, and were againſt the Covenant (and never took it) and the Parliaments War, and were for the Liturgie and Ceremonies and had Conformed had theſe been all that had been impoſed, who yet were caſt out of Fellowſhips and Miniſtry: Yea ſome had ſuffered for the King, and been ruined in their patrimony, ſome impriſoned for him, and ſome had been in arms for him. 2. Beſides theſe, and other Epiſcopal Nonconformiſts, ſome and very many, and we think the greateſt part of any one, were ſuch diſengaged pacificators as we before mentioned about aſſociations: 3. Some were for the Presbyterian Government, and 4. Some for that called Independent, which were compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively but few.</p>
               <p>Alſo ſome were (as heretofore Dr. <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> Dr. <hi>Humpbrey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Paul Bayn,</hi> &amp;c. for <hi>ſome part</hi> of Conformity <hi>(Kneeling</hi> and <hi>Lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ingworth</hi> himſelf, as is reported, till ſome diſpenſation let him in. But the <hi>New Conformity</hi> was ſuch as ſatisfied them all againſt it. Many purpoſed to have yielded to Prelacy, Liturgie and Ceremonies, and gone to the utmoſt that Conſcience would tolerate, rather than lay by their Miniſtry. But when they ſaw the new Act for <hi>Uniformity,</hi> their deliberations were at an end.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Their intereſt, honour or ſomewhat elſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62986:76"/>
led many perſons of thoſe times, when they had made the name of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> odious, to call all the Nonconformiſts that were <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> or neutral, by the name of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> even thoſe that had declared themſelves againſt the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian frame, ſo they were not Independents. And they continue that practice to ſerve their ends to this day.</p>
               <p n="34">34. The elder ſort of the Nonconformiſts were ordained by Dioceſan Biſhops: The younger ſort were ordained by Aſſemblies of the Pariſh Paſtors of Cities and Countries, no other ordination being then allowed by thoſe in Power.</p>
               <p n="35">35. As to the late Civil Wars which ſome moſt lowdly charge on the Nonconformiſts, this is the truth, that the ſeveral parties charge the beginning of that war on one another: One party ſaith that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> begun it in <hi>England:</hi> Another party lay it on the old Church of <hi>England</hi> men that followed Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot,</hi> and ſuch like: Both theſe accuſed Parties laid the beginning on Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> as an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator, and thoſe that followed him: And ſome think that every ſide had too much hand in it, and were to be blamed. The truth is, 1. That more by far of the Nonconformiſts than of the <hi>late ſort</hi> of the Prelatiſts were for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in thoſe times: 2. That ſome that were Sectaries, and ſome that were hot for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament did conform: 3. That ſome few that had been in the King's Army or Cauſe, and that were ſufferers for him, and were againſt the Covenant and the Parliaments War, were Nonconformiſts: 4. That many more of the <hi>old Epiſcopal Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:62986:77"/>
than of the later ſort of them were for the Parliament: 5. That the Archbiſhop of <hi>York (Williams)</hi> who had ſome time been Lord Keeper, was one of the Parliaments Commanders in <hi>North-Wales</hi> (as it is reported without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial.) 6. That moſt Miniſters are dead that were in that War. 7. That the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Aſſembly, as is ſaid, came thither almoſt all Conformiſts. 8. That ſo ſmall is the number of the preſent ſilenced Miniſters who had any hand in thoſe Wars, that if no other were ejected and ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced but they, the caſe would be judged compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively very eaſie, and it would be thankfully accepted, as hath oft been told. For moſt were then youths at School, and in the Univerſities, and many lived in the King's quarters and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, and many other never medled with Wars at all; it being now about thirty four, or five years ſince the War began. 9. That all the Wars that have been ſince their oppoſition to the Parliament and violence done to the perſon of the King, were far from being owned by the common ſort of the now Nonconformiſts, as was ſaid. 10. The Doctrine of <hi>Bilſon, Hooker,</hi> and ſuch like, containing ſuch Principles as Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment men then uſually profeſſed is before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, though not fully recited, and is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known; and that the main body of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, Aſſembly, Army, Commanders, Lord Lieutenants, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>jeſties prudence had by the Act of Oblivion long ſince ended this part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; but we find ſtill <hi>ſome</hi> conformable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62986:77"/>
whom in other reſpects we much eſteem and love, who (as if Truth, Charity, Juſtice and Humanity had been forgotten by them) affirm in print that <hi>All the Nonconformiſts were guilty of the King's Death;</hi> paſſing over what is aforeſaid of the Conformiſts; and others of them crying out to Magiſtrates to execute the Laws on us, by the urged Motive of their late ſequeſtrations and ſufferings: as if they knew not, or would not have others to know, how few Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts in Parliament or Militia there were at the beginning of the War in compariſon of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts; and how much the ſecond, third and following <hi>Cauſes, Parties,</hi> and <hi>Tragedies</hi> in that War, were diſliked by the now Epiſcopal and Presbyterian Nonconformiſts.</p>
               <p n="36">36. The people who now adhere to the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts, who were at age before the Wars (whom we that write this were acquainted with) had very hard thoughts of the Biſhops perſons, and ſome of Epiſcopacy it ſelf, becauſe of the foreſaid ſilencing of Miniſters, and ruining of honeſt men, about <hi>Sunday-</hi>ſports, Reading that Book, and other ſuch things, beſides Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity: But when the Miniſters that guided them, began to ſeem more reconciled to the Epiſcopal Party, and upon the reports and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which they had heard, had put them in hope that the next Biſhops would prove more moderate, peaceable and pious, than the former, and would by experience avoid diviſions and perſecution, the ſaid people began to be enclined to more reverent and favourable thoughts of Epiſcopacy and the Biſhops; and were, upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the late confuſions, in a far fairer
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62986:78"/>
way to union &amp; ſubmiſſion to them than before. But when they ſaw their Teachers taken from them, and ſome ſuch ſet over them againſt their wills, who were better known to them than to the obtruders; and when they heard of about 2000 ſilenced at once, this ſo much alienated them from the Biſhops, that it was never ſince in our power to bring them to ſo much eſteem of them, and reverence to them, as might have been; but multitudes by this were driven further from Conformity than the ſilenced Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="37">37. The 2000 ſilenced were not a quarter of the Miniſters of <hi>England,</hi> who were in poſſeſſion before the return of the Biſhops: ſo that it is evident, that above three fourth parts of the Miniſters that kept in under the Parliament and Protector (notwithſtanding Covenant, Directory and all) did prove Conformiſts.</p>
               <p n="38">38. The <hi>New-altered</hi> Liturgy was not printed and publiſhed till <hi>Auguſt</hi> 24. or near it, when the Miniſters were to be ſilenced that ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, and conſented not: ſo that we muſt needs ſuppoſe that they were but few Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> in compariſon of the reſt, who <hi>ever ſaw and read</hi> (much leſs <hi>long conſidered) that Book before they declared their Aſſent and Conſent to all things in it.</hi> Sure we are, that we that lived in <hi>London,</hi> who had it at the firſt publiſhing, found the time paſt, or ſo ſhort to examine all things in it with due deliberation, that had it been blameleſs, we muſt have been ſilenced, unleſs we had conſented upon an implicit faith.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Since we were ſilenced, His Majeſties De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration for more Liberty in Religion came out 1673. but ſoon died: And ſince then we have

            <p n="1">1. By this Oath and this Declaration the <hi>Government and Truſt</hi> of all the Cities and Corporations of <hi>England</hi> are conſtituted or qualified.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. Thouſands of people lived in the Kings Garriſons, or Quarters, and thouſands were then unborn or Children, who never took this Vow or Covenant, nor ever heard or read it, or know what is in it.</p>

            <p n="4">4.

Its true, that the Miniſter of the Pariſh is bid to Catechiſe them, and to bring or ſend in writing the names of ſuch as he thinks fit for Confirmation. But 1. This is not ordinarily done: but Children in our time have uſed to run toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a biſhop when he came into the Country on that work, without the Miniſters Certificate or Godfathers; and none, that ever we knew of, that came for Confirmation in this manner, was refuſed: And as the Biſhop never ſaw or knew one of the multitude whom he Confirmeth, ſo he taketh not time ſo far to examine them as to give him rational ſatisfaction of their fitneſs: Nor indeed can he poſſibly do it for one of a multitude of ſo large Dioceſſes, when moſt <hi>great Pariſhes</hi> are too big for a preſent Miniſter who is acquainted with them better than a ſtrange Dioceſan can be: How can a man that hath ſo many other employments as Dioceſans have find leiſure, were he never ſo willing, to examine
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62986:85"/>
ſo many hundred thouſands as are in this Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs? or ſo many ſcore thouſands as are in many others? 3. And as the Miniſters rarely certifie according to the Canon, ſo the Biſhop is not tyed to take his conſent, but may thus impoſe confirmed perſons on his Communion, though he know them to be never ſo ignorant or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet. 4 And it is <hi>Children</hi> that are thus to be confirmed, who rarely ever come ſo young to own with any tolerable underſtanding and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, their Baptiſmal Covenant. Few of us by experience can ſay, that we did it of many years after that we had learned the Lords Prayer &amp;c. 5. And no other qualification is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but that he learn the Creed, Lords-Prayer, Decalogue, and Church Catech<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That there is not a'word in the Book which was not intended for ſome <hi>Uſe:</hi> And therefore, to <hi>Aſſent, Approve</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Uſe,</hi> is more than meerly to <hi>Aſſent</hi> to the Truth: The Preface hath its Uſe; and the Calendar its Uſe, and the Rubrick its uſes, and the reſt of the parts their ſeveral Uſes; But did we believe it to be <hi>falſe,</hi> how could we <hi>Approve</hi> it, or of what <hi>Uſe</hi> would it be? 5. To put all out of doubt the Parliament-men long ago told us (none Contradicting it to us) that into another Bill, the houſe of Lords added a <hi>Proviſo</hi> that the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62986:88"/>
Declaration in the Act of <hi>Vniformity</hi> ſhould be underſtood but as obliging men <hi>to the Uſe of it;</hi> and that the Houſe of Commons refuſing, at a Conference about it, they gave in ſuch Reaſons againſt that ſenſe and proviſo to the Lords, upon which they did acquieſce, and caſt it out.</p>
            <p n="3">III. By this General Declaration we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to <hi>Aſſent</hi> to (as true) to <hi>Approve</hi> and to <hi>Uſe</hi> theſe words after the Calender, <q>
                  <hi>[Rules to know when the Moveable Feaſts and Holydaies begin. Eaſter-day (on which the reſt depend) is alwaies the firſt Sunday after the firſt full Moon, which happens next after the one and twentieth day of</hi> March.]</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This Rule is falſe: As 1. Every Almanack will ſhew: 2. The Table following to find out <hi>Eaſter-day</hi> for ever: 3. And the practice of our Church, that keepeth <hi>Eaſter</hi> on another day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To conſent to <hi>Uſe this,</hi> is to conſent to keep <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> contrary to all Chriſtian Churches, and contrary to another Rule in the ſame Book; and to conſent to <hi>uſe both Rules,</hi> is to <hi>conſent to keep two Eaſter-days</hi> in one year; and ſo of <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hereupon ſome Conformiſts ſay, that <hi>[Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to, Approving of, and Conſenting to All things contained and preſcribed.]</hi> ſignifieth but <hi>[as to humane, fallible writings, ſo far as there is no miſtake]</hi> or <hi>[Aſſenting</hi> and <hi>Conſenting</hi> to be <hi>peaceable.]</hi> But others ſay that it is but <hi>[to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that it is true where it is not falſe, and Appr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nonconformiſts would refuſe it in that ſenſe. 3. Whether they will give leave to the Papiſts and all other ſubjects to take the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance in ſuch a kind of ſenſe and expoſition.</p>
            <p>But there is one that hath defended this as true, and tells us that by the <hi>[full moon]</hi> is not meant that which we call the <hi>full moon,</hi> or the ſame that's meant in the other parts of the Book, but by the <hi>full moon</hi> is meant <hi>[the mean Conjunction]</hi> and [the <hi>fourth</hi> of <hi>April</hi> that year 1664.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62986:89"/>
to an <hi>Implicit Faith,</hi> to believe as the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion believeth, even in Calendars, when we know not what they believe themſelves. For my part I muſt confeſs that after all this Dr. <hi>(Pell</hi> they ſay) hath ſaid of another ſenſe of the word <hi>[full Moon]</hi> I know not yet what he meaneth. <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether the Convocation meant that none ſhould Preach Chriſts Goſpel that underſtood not this ſtrange ſenſe of the <hi>[full Moon]</hi> that is <hi>[no full Moon]</hi> and yet would not by one line <hi>expound</hi> it to us, to keep us from being caſt out and ruined? Or whether they meant that all men ſhould be forced and taught to ſubſcribe or declare aſſent to that which they never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood? when I had never yet the advantage of ſpeaking with one Biſhop or conformable Dr. that underſtood the word <hi>[full Moon]</hi> as this Doctor taught them (whether in good earneſt I know not.) And if our Conformity muſt be thus performed, by equivocation implicitly, contrary to the common ſenſe of mankind, we ſhall yet ſuſpend it, till we know how much further we have to go, if it be blindfold that we muſt be led; and refer all to God our final Judge, whoſe judgment we are near.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="5">V. We muſt Aſſent, Approve, and Conſent to all the <hi>miſ-tranſlations in the preſent Liturgy,</hi> as well as to juſtifie the <hi>old Edition:</hi> That before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 28. is in the <hi>preſent Book,</hi> and ſo are the reſt of the omiſſions and differences in the Pſalms before mentioned, which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

The queſtion is not whether theſe faulty Tranſlations were not a <hi>good work,</hi> and a great mercy to the Church, till we had a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62986:90"/>
better? Nor whether they may not be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed where there is no better? Yea or where there is a better, if the Command of Governours, or Concord, make it beſt for that time and place. But it is, Whether all the <hi>faults</hi> of the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> may be <hi>Aſſented, Approved</hi> and <hi>Conſented to?</hi> We commit ſome failings and ſins every day, but we may not <hi>Approve</hi> of them, and profeſs that we <hi>Conſent</hi> ſo to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some Conformiſts here think that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration is to be taken <hi>properly,</hi> without any force or diſtorting, and they ſay that <hi>both Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> are juſtifiable, becauſe one followeth the Hebrew, and the other the Septuagint, and Chriſt and his Apoſtles have juſtified both by uſing them. But others of them hold that this inſtance proveth that by <hi>[All things]</hi> Aſſented and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to, muſt be meant only <hi>[All things</hi> that <hi>are not by humane frailty miſtaken,</hi> or <hi>erroneous]</hi> or els, that by <hi>Aſſenting</hi> and <hi>Approving</hi> muſt be meant no more than <hi>Aſſenting that they may be Uſed:</hi> And ſo they conſent with the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts in the matter, but not in the expoſition of the words. And to the former they ſay, 1. That there are other miſtranſlations, beſides thoſe that follow the ſeptuagint. 2. That Chriſt and the Apoſtles by citing ſome Texts according to the ſeptuagint, do not thereby approve of all the reſt; for they cite others otherwiſe. 3. That by citing them, they juſtifie not alwaies the tranſlation, but only the <hi>ſenſe</hi> ſo far as it is cited for, it being that ſcripture which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then commonly uſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And they ſay that if this objection ſhould hinder mens Aſſenting to the Liturgy, it might
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62986:91"/>
as well hinder their Aſſenting to the Bible in our tranſlations. And indeed we know no Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt who would declare or ſubſcribe that he doth <hi>Aſſent to, Approve and Conſent to all things Contained in the Bible according to any Tranſlation, but only all things Contained in the Bible as it was delivered by the ſacred writers, and in all Tranſlations</hi> ſo far as they truly <hi>ſignifie</hi> or <hi>expreſs that</hi> to us. But if they might but ſay, as one part expounds the Declaration, [We <hi>Aſſent, &amp;c.

            <p n="6">6. The Calendar in the Common Prayer appointeth the publick reading of the Books called <hi>Apocrypha</hi> beginning <hi>September</hi> 28. And ſo Continuing to <hi>November</hi> 24. Every day of the week, except the proper Leſſons interpoſed. Part of the Apocrypha to be read are the Book of <hi>Tobit, Judith, Bell,</hi> and the <hi>Dragon &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Learned Biſhops and Divines of the Church of England have written to prove that theſe Books are not only Aprocryphal but fabulous, and have manifeſt untruths; As that the intralls of a fiſh will drive away all Devils and keep them from returning: When Chriſt ſaith <hi>[This kind goeth not out but by Faſting and Prayer]</hi> And when the Angel ſaith that <hi>He was the ſon</hi> of <hi>Ananias of the tribe of Napthali,]</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe Books are to be read juſt in the place and order as the Sacred Scriptures are; and under the ſame title of the <hi>[Firſt Leſſon]</hi> Only called Apocrypha in the Bibles. But 1. It is not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Prieſt tell the people ſo: 2. If it were, they underſtand not Commonly what
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62986:91"/>
               <hi>[Apocrypha]</hi> ſignifieth: 3. If they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time told it, they forget it; and apply not that name to every Leſſon that they thence hear. 4. It is not denyed that the ſounder Books that are <hi>Apocrypha may be read in the Church</hi> as a Homily may be with due notice of their difference from the Canonical Books: But the queſtion is whether not only <hi>they,</hi> but the Books proved fabulous by many Proteſtants, may be there read, and that inſtead of ſo much of the holy Scripture then omitted, and that without any better notice given to the Common people of the difference. 5. And the chief doubt is, whether this may not only be done, but alſo the Calendar as ſo appointing it, may be Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of and Conſented to by us all.</p>
            <p n="7">7 It hath been before opened, that no Parent is permitted to be Godfather to his own Child; or to ſpeak one word at his baptizing, to enter him into the Covenant of God, or dedicate him to him, nor to promiſe in his name, nor to undertake any part of his Chriſtian education, nor ſo much as to be urged to be preſent. Nor is there a word to intimate that the Godfathers repreſent the Parent, or ſpeak in his name or ſtead, but the contrary is implyed. [Though the Parents are to procure theſe God fathers. 2. It hath alſo been before ſhewed how great a Controverſie it is, whether Infants Right to Gods promiſes and Church ſtate, be not by that Covenant <hi>[I will be thy God</hi> and <hi>the God of thy ſeed;]</hi> implyed in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>[els were your</hi> Children <hi>unclean but now are they holy.]</hi> And ſo whether Infants have any right upon a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers words there, who never took them for,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:62986:92"/>
his own; if on the Parents account they have no right. And whether ſuch Godfathers act be truly the Childs in Gods account; 3. And it was before enquired, In what ſenſe this Godfather doth (not <hi>promiſe only</hi> that the Child <hi>ſhall believe</hi> at age, but) in the Childs name <hi>profeſs</hi> that <hi>he doth at preſent believe:</hi> And whether it be not enough [and much more neceſſary then the Godfathers faith) that he be the Child of a <hi>believing Parent, dedicating him to God.</hi> 4. And it hath been ſhewed that Godfathers promiſe themſelves partly to teach the Child, and partly to provide that he be taught all that a Chriſtian ſhould learn as neceſſary to his ſouls health. 5. And that theſe Godfathers never ordinarily, give the Parents the leaſt reaſon to believe that they have any purpoſe to do any ſuch thing as they undertake: Which is perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the weightieſt buſineſs: And 6. alſo that (as ſuch) they are no adopters or owners of the Child. 7. And alſo how hard it is for any Parents ever to get better, ſeeing <hi>wiſer</hi> and <hi>better</hi> will not undertake it in the foreſaid conformable ſence. 8. The ſence and uſe of Godfathers is partly known by the Practiſe of Princes and great men, (who muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to know beſt, and be moſt righteous and exemplary) who uſually by a <hi>Proxie</hi> are Godfathers to the Children of Foreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Great men, (perhaps Papiſts) whom they never ſaw nor ever are like to ſee their Children. 9. Miniſters muſt Aſſent Approve of and Conſent to, all this excluſion of the Parents, and preſentation, profeſſion, undertaking and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Godfathers, which the Liturgy men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62986:92"/>
10. Conformiſts are not agreed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of the true Office and undertaking of theſe Godfathers, nor of the Parents part, nor by whoſe right it is that one Child rather than others is to be baptized, and whether any at all ſhould be refuſed by whomſoever (that is a Chriſtian) offered thereunto.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Rubrick to which we muſt declare our Aſſent, Approbation and Conſent, hath this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith. <q>
                  <hi>[It is certain by Gods Word, that Children which are baptized, dying before they commit actual ſin are undoubtedly ſaved.]</hi>
               </q> And the Rubrick at Buryal, excepteth all the <hi>unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> from Chriſtian Burial, according to the Office.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Canon 68 and 69, ſuſpendeth any Miniſter who ſhall <hi>refuſe</hi> or <hi>delay</hi> to Chriſten <hi>any Child</hi> without exception which is brought to the Church on Sundays or Holydays to be Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, according to the Form in the Common-Prayer; or if in caſe of danger he be deſired to do it privately. Neither Rubrick nor Canon here except from Baptiſm and certainty of ſalvation, any Children of <hi>Turks, Infidels, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> or thoſe whoſe Parents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Chriſtianity, and conſent not to their Childrens Baptiſm; ſo be it any Godfathers as aforeſaid bring them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Conformiſts agree not of the ſence of this Article of Faith: Some hold that the word <hi>[Children</hi> here meaneth not <hi>[All Children that are Baptized]</hi> but <hi>ſome</hi> ſuch only: But others affirm that this expoſition is falſe, and contrary to the plain importance of the words, for it is an <hi>Indefinite,</hi> ſay they, <hi>in re neceſſaria,</hi> in the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62986:93"/>
ſenſe of the Book. And if the meaning be not <hi>[Children that are Baptized, qua tales]</hi> it hath no intelligible ſenſe, the certainty of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation being Aſſerted as from Scripture, and not any other <hi>reaſon</hi> of it given. But if this be the meaning (as it is) then <hi>a quatenus ad omnes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let conſequentia;</hi> unleſs any exception had been added, which is not.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some ſay that it is implied that Children that <hi>had no right to Baptiſm</hi> are excepted. But others ſay 1. That <hi>ubi lex non diſtinguit non eſt diſtinguendum.</hi> The Church could have excepted if they would. 2. And that <hi>quod fieri non debet factum valet.</hi> 3. Yea that all Children have right to Baptiſm, if any Chriſtians offer them to it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Some confound the Miniſters right to Baptize them, and the Infants right to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; And this right as only <hi>in foro Eccleſiae,</hi> and as <hi>in foro Caeli;</hi> As if all Baptized upon any of theſe rights were undoubtedly ſaved. But others diſtinguiſh theſe, and ſay, 1. That the Miniſter may have right to Baptize one if offered, that yet ought not to have been offered; which will not ſave an uncapable ſubject: 2. That the Children of Hypocrites have right <hi>Coram Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia,</hi> and that their Baptiſm aſcertaineth to them no more than external or common priviledges; 3. And that only the Children of true <hi>believers</hi> have ſuch a right <hi>coram Deo</hi> as certainly ſaveth them. But others ſay that both the laſt ſort are ſaved.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Some of them hold that <hi>All Infants in the world Baptized or not, are ſaved by univerſal redemption, if they dye before actual ſin:</hi> And that the Article therefore affirmeth it of the Baptized.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62986:93"/>
But others ſay, this cannot be the ſence: For 1. To ſay <hi>[All baptized]</hi> and mean <hi>[All unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized]</hi> or any <hi>[not as Baptized]</hi> were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible nor candid. 2. And the Burial Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick excepting the unbaptized from that Chriſtian burial, ſheweth the meaning of the Church in this Article.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Alſo about the <hi>[undoubted certainty]</hi> they differ; ſome think that the ſubſcriber or Declarer doth not by theſe words, profeſs that he himſelf is <hi>[undoubtedly certain]</hi> of the ſalvation of all dying Baptized Infants; but only that the thing is <hi>certainly revealed</hi> to be ſo in Gods Word. But others ſay, that both objective and ſubjective (or perſonal) <hi>certainty</hi> muſt needs be meant: And that it were too hard an imputation to ſay that the Church commandeth <hi>uncertain, doubting</hi> men to profeſs that the thing is <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>undoubted</hi> of; for how can they tell that it is ſo? And if they know it not to be ſo why ſhould they declare it to be ſo? The meaning is not <hi>[I declare that the Convocation ſaith it is certain;]</hi> for that were but the part of a cryer or reader: Nor is it <hi>I declare that it is certain to others, though not to me.]</hi> For no man knoweth anothers certainty; Therefore it muſt mean that <hi>[I am certain</hi> and <hi>paſt doubt by the Word of God]</hi> or <hi>[I ſee aſcertaining evidence in Gods Word putting</hi> it paſt <hi>doubt.]</hi> So that no <hi>uncertain</hi> or <hi>doubting</hi> perſon can truly thus declare or ſubſcribe.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Divers of thoſe Divines who are furtheſt from the Nonconformiſts, hold that by the Scripture alone we cannot prove that Infants are at all to be Baptized; and the <hi>Jns Baptiſmi</hi> muſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62986:94"/>
be proved before the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of the Baptized as ſuch: Others think it hard for that man to be <hi>certain</hi> by the <hi>Word</hi> of God that all Baptized dying Infants are <hi>ſaved,</hi> who is not certain by that word that <hi>any Inſants</hi> ſhould be <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Many of the moſt raſh or ſelf conceited, Ignorant men are readier to profeſs <hi>[undoubted certainty]</hi> than they that are more humble, and know much more than they. And it is not he that <hi>Hith</hi> moſt <hi>certainty</hi> who is now capable of the Miniſtry, but he that <hi>dare profeſs moſt,</hi> whether he have it or not.</p>
            <p n="10">10. They that ſhew leſs Learning, eſpecially leſs knowledge in the Scripture, far than many that dare not profeſs this <hi>undoubted certainty,</hi> are not like to be more <hi>certain</hi> then they in this particular Article of faith.</p>
            <p n="11">11. We take it for Arrogance and Fanaticiſm in the Pope and his Council to pretend Infallible certainty by a <hi>peculiar priviledge,</hi> in thoſe points in which they are unſtudyed and unlearned, as if they knew them by prophetical inſpiration. And when young unſtudyed men have in this point attained to an <hi>[undoubted certainty]</hi> which their wiſer ſeniors cannot attain, it behoveth them to convince us of the truth of their Inſpiration or ſpecial endowments, either by a proportionable excellency above us in other things, or by ſome Miracles or Teſtimonies from Heaven.</p>
            <p n="12">12. There is no one <hi>Word of God</hi> cited in the Rubrick which tells us that <hi>It is certain by the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. Among Chriſtian Divines there are all theſe various opinions about the ſalvation of Infants.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:62986:94"/>
1. Some hold that the Covenant being to the <hi>faithful</hi> and their <hi>ſeed,</hi> and their children being <hi>holy,</hi> all the children of ſincere Chriſtians are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in a ſtate of ſalvation, being by the parents intentionally dedicated to God, before or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſm: And that Baptiſm is but their ſo lemn inveſtiture in that ſtate which was theirs by right before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others think that this right to ſalvation belongeth to the Children of all profeſſed Chriſtians godly and ungodly,</p>
            <p n="3">3 Others think that it belongeth to all Infants in the world.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Others think that it belongeth only to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere believers Children that are Baptized.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Others, that it belongeth to ſound and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Chriſtians baptized Infants.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Others that it belongeth to all Baptized Infants whoſe ſoever.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Others hold that it belongeth alſo to the Children of ſincere Adopters or Proprieters.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Others that it belongeth to ſuch as even bad Chriſtians adopt or own.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Others that they that have ſincere <hi>Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> though not <hi>Proprieters,</hi> are ſaved.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Others that even <hi>unfound</hi> or <hi>hypocritical</hi> Chriſtian Godfathers, may ſuffice to their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Others that the Miniſters or the Churches ſincere (or profeſſed) Faith is hereto ſufficient.</p>
            <p n="12">12. And others think that only the <hi>Elect</hi> are ſaved, of whom ſome are baptized, and ſome unbaptized, but no man knoweth who they are. Out of all theſe Opinions the Convocation hath choſen one, as an Article of Faith of <hi>undoubted Certainty</hi> by the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:62986:95"/>
13. The Nonconformiſts know of no Word of God which <hi>aſcertaineth Salvation</hi> to any known determinate Infants, but the great Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, <hi>[I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed;]</hi> which ſeed God uſeth as if they were parts of the Parents, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. and ſecond Commandment: And ſaith to Believers <hi>[Elſe were your children unclean;</hi> but now, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Many Divines ſay, that <hi>Faith it ſelf hath not evidence;</hi> (though we think that it hath <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of the Truth of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> though the thing revealed be not <hi>viſible or evident</hi> in it ſelf:) And more confeſs that <hi>[undoubted certainty]</hi> is not Eſſential to the ſaving belief of Chriſt, and of a life to come: And that true Faith may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, though weak: And that Chriſt ſilenced not his Diſciples when he reproved the weakneſs of their Faith: And that to doubt of this Article about Infants is not ſo dangerous as to doubt of Chriſt or Heaven.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. All Miniſters muſt <hi>deny Baptiſm</hi> to thoſe Infants that have no ſuch Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers as aforeſaid, though their Parents be true Chriſtians, and offer them to Baptiſm. For this is the only order or form of Baptizing there deſcribed, all other is forbidden, and we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to <hi>uſe no other form in adminiſtration of the Sacraments.</hi> 2. Yet ſome Conformiſts ſay, that the Book bindeth them to <hi>do thus,</hi> but not to omit it, and baptize no otherwiſe. But others of them ſay, 1. That the Rubrick determineth that <hi>[for every child to be baptized, there ſhall be three as Godfathers and Godmothers]</hi> and that the whole Office reſpecteth them as Parties, and ſpeaketh to them, and admitteth no Parent to ſpeak; and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62986:95"/>
that if <hi>Aſſenting to, Approving and Conſenting to this form and Rubrick,</hi> and ſubſcribing a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to <hi>uſe no other form,</hi> ſignifie not that <hi>we will uſe no other,</hi> no words can bind ſuch equivocators. 3. In the ſenſe of the Liturgy, to put Infants from Baptiſm, is to deny them <hi>Chriſtendom, memberſhip of Chriſt, to be children of God, and to be heirs of Heaven:</hi> For the Catechiſm ſaith, that we are <hi>made</hi> ſuch in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which with the Rubrick which denyeth them Chriſtian burial, and that laſt mentioned which affirmeth the <hi>undoubted ſalvation of the baptized,</hi> import a denying ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all that have not ſuch Godfathers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Parents ſponſion: or at leaſt a denying them <hi>[certainty of undoubted ſalvation]</hi> when it was in the power of the Convocation or Prieſt to have given them ſuch certainty. 4. The Conformiſts do not affirm (that we know of) that any word of God doth inſtitute or command the uſe of ſuch Godfathers, or the foredeſcribed excluſion of the Parents, much leſs both: And leaſt of all that it maketh theſe neceſſary to Chriſtendom and Salvation, yea or Church-reception: But it is uſed as a Tradition or Law of men. 5. The Nonconformiſts therefore dare neither Aſſent to, Approve, Conſent to, Covenant, or Practice the reſuſal of the Children of true Chriſtians from Baptiſm, the Church and Salvation, on ſuch a cauſe as this. 6. The Anabaptiſts hence are hardened, and ſay, that if Infants may be denied Baptiſm, till they have ſuch Godfathers as God never inſtituted they have no right to it at all, and they may deny it them till we prove God's inſtitution of Godfathers; eſpecially where their title is laid upon ſuch Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62986:96"/>
7 Some ſay that <hi>It is not the Miniſter that refuſeth them, but the Church which maketh the Law:</hi> But others ſay, that it is both the Lawmakers, and the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> unleſs we could prove that <hi>Baptizing</hi> and judging whom to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize is none of the Miniſters office, no nor the Biſhops; but that the Prieſt is to baptize all, and only ſuch as the Law or Convocation bids him baptize, as a meer executioner, and the Biſhop alſo ſuch as he is appointed by the ſame Law. That elſe the ſame Rule would hold for his Preaching, Praying, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="10">X. The like proofs (which we need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat) will ſhew, that no Miniſter muſt baptize any perſon, Infant or Adult, without the tranſient Image of a Croſs, and that to this we muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and conſent, and ſubſcribe to baptize in no other form.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And the ſame reaſons aforegiven ſhew how great a penalty this is, as excluding them from Chriſtendom and Salvation in the Churches judgment, or from certainty at leaſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some Conformiſts ſay here alſo, that they aſſent only to baptize with the Croſs, but not to baptize no otherwiſe: But others of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this expoſition from the Rubrick, and the aforecited Canonical Subſcription, as that which would leave the Prieſt at liberty to do almoſt what he liſt, when the Church thinks that they have obliged him, and his Subſcription hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his Obedience.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And ſome of them ſay, that it is not the Prieſt that refuſeth them, for he would Baptize them (with the Croſs) if the parent <hi>ſent the Child</hi> or the <hi>Adult perſon came.</hi> But we need not
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62986:96"/>
ſtrive about the word: The <hi>thing</hi> we are agreed of, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Prieſt conſenteth not to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them, who dare not receive it with the uſe of the Croſs: Whether this be to be called a <hi>rejecting them,</hi> or <hi>denying</hi> them Baptiſm, unleſs they will be ſo croſſed, we need not call for extraordinaty accurateneſs to judge.</p>
            <p n="5">5. No Conformiſts do pretend that this uſe of this Image of the Croſs, is of divine inſtitution: But all confeſs that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is of divine inſtitution; and that Chriſt hath Commanded <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. 20. That they that are <hi>diſcipled ſhould be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized;</hi> and that one may be a <hi>diſciple of</hi> Chriſt, without the Image of the Croſs:</p>
            <p n="6">6. Some of the Nonconformiſts hold their uſe of the Croſs it ſelf here unlawful: But others that would venture to uſe it rather than be ſilenced, yet fear the guilt of <hi>denying Baptiſm, Chriſtendom</hi> and <hi>certain ſalvation</hi> (as the Church judgeth) to all that dare not receive it, or preſent their Children to receive it; believing that murdering natural life is a leſs hurt than undoing ſouls.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But <hi>Covenanting by deliberate ſubſcription</hi> and <hi>declaration</hi> to do it, how oft ſoever, they fear more than the actual doing of it rarely; not daring to do their part to damn the Children of all that are againſt Baptizing with the Croſs, nor all the unbaptized adult that are of that opinion.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. And as they fear rejecting ſuch as will not be ſo Croſt, from Baptiſm: ſo they much fear the <hi>Engliſh uſe of the Croſs</hi> themſelves; and that much more than Croſſing our ſelves on ordinary occaſions, or ſetting up Croſſes on our doors or Churches or by the high waies; and yet much
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62986:97"/>
more than they fear ſuch uſing of the Croſs as <hi>Auguſtine de Civ. Dei,</hi> and other ancients men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as an open Indication to Heathens that we are not aſhamed of a Crucified Chriſt: Much leſs are they againſt civil uſes of a Croſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The name <hi>[Sacrament]</hi> ſignifying primarily any <hi>ſolemnization of a Covenant by Oath and Ceremony</hi> (as the <hi>ſacramentum militare</hi> among the Romans) eſpecially a Covenant which engageth one in a new relation, and more largely any <hi>ſacred myſtical Ceremony,</hi> the queſtion here is <hi>whether the Croſs be not made</hi> (not only a <hi>ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a larger ſenſe,</hi> as <hi>ordination</hi> and <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> may be called <hi>ſacraments)</hi> but even a <hi>ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Covenant of grace,</hi> or ſo <hi>very neer it</hi> as to have the greateſt part of that ſacramental nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Church Catechiſm defineth a Divine ſacrament thus, <q>
                  <hi>(An outward and viſible ſign of an inward and ſpiritual grace given to us, ordained by Chriſt himſelf as a means whereby we receive the ſame, and a pledge to aſſure us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That it be <hi>ordained by Chriſt himſelf</hi> is not eſſential to a <hi>ſacrament</hi> in <hi>genere,</hi> but to a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Gods making</hi> in <hi>ſpecie</hi> as diſtinct from one thats made by man; as is evident in the reaſon of the name.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The true nature of this Croſſing is known by the Liturgy, 2. And the Canon. 1. The Liturgy appointeth it to be uſed <hi>at Baptiſm,</hi> not as a <hi>part</hi> of our Baptiſm, but as a <hi>thing added,</hi> immediately after the words [I <hi>Baptize thee &amp;c.]</hi> even in our Covenanting with God: 2. It thus deſcribeth and appointeth it, <q>
                  <hi>[we receive
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62986:97"/>
this Child into</hi> the <hi>Congregation of Chriſts flock, (here the Prieſt ſhall make a Croſs upon</hi> the <hi>forehead) and do ſign him with the ſign of the Croſs, in token that hereafter he ſhall not be aſhamed to confeſs the faith of Chriſt Crucified, and manfully to fight under his banner, againſt ſin, the world and the devil: and to continue Chriſts faithful ſervant and ſouldier unto his lives end, Amen.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Rubrick to which we Aſſent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, referreth us to the 30th Canon, as giving us <q>
                  <hi>the true explication thereof, and the juſt reaſons, &amp;c.</hi> The Canon ſaith <hi>[Chriſtians ſigned their Children therewith when they were Chriſtned, to dedicate them by that badge to his ſervice, whoſe benefits beſtowed on them in Baptiſm the name of the Croſs did repreſent.] The Church of England accounteth it a lawful outward Ceremony, and honourable badge, whereby the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant is dedicated to the ſervice of him that dyed on the Croſs, as by the words uſed in the Common Prayer it may appear.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Liturgy's Preface of Ceremonies ſaith</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>[that they ſerve to a godly diſcipline, and are ſuch as be apt to ſtir up the dull mind of man, to the remembrance of his duty to God by ſome notable and ſpecial ſignification, whereby he might be edifyed.]</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4, We ſuppoſe that here 1. The ſign is the <hi>tranſient Image of the Croſs uſed in Gods ſervice.</hi> 2. The particular ſervice in which it is uſed, is our <hi>Baptiſmal Covenanting with God:</hi> 3. The thing ſignified by the ſign it ſelf is the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and paſſion of Chriſt. 4. The thing ſignified by the <hi>Receiving of it</hi> is, that we do as Covenanters
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62986:98"/>
               <hi>profeſs and oblige our ſelves not to be aſhamed to confeſs the faith of Chriſt Crucified, and manfully to fight under his banner againſt ſin, the world and the Devil, and to continue Chriſts faithful ſervants and ſouldiers to our lives end.</hi> And that by <hi>this</hi> we are dedicated to God; And that we take it as an honourable badge hereof. 5. Note that the <hi>Miniſter</hi> ſpeaketh as <hi>Gods Officer from him,</hi> and doth not repreſent the <hi>Child,</hi> nor ſpeak as <hi>in his name;</hi> that being the part aſſigned to the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers;</hi> And the thing ſignified by him in his uſing this ſign is, that he doth as Chriſts Miniſter <hi>dedicate him by this ſign, to the ſervice of him that dyed on the Croſs, the name whereof repreſents the benefits beſtowed on him in Baptiſm,</hi> (which are all the benefits of that Covenant) and to oblige him to this end, not to be <hi>aſhamed</hi> to <hi>confeſs the faith</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Crucified, and manfully to fight under his banner</hi> (as aforeſaid;) And that this be a <hi>badge</hi> or ſymbol of his Chriſtian profeſſion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The great fear of the Nonconformiſts is, leſt this be a ſecond ſacrament of the Covenant of graee made by man added to Baptiſm, or at leaſt have moſt of the nature and uſes of it; And leſt Chriſt will take it as an invaſion of his prerogative ſo to uſe it, and to make a <hi>new badge or ſymbol</hi> of our Chriſtianity; As the King would take it ill of one that would without him, make a badge or ſymbol for his ſubjects as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or of the order of the Knights of the Garter as ſuch. And the rather, becauſe it is the <hi>uſe of an Image,</hi> (though tranſient) in <hi>Gods Worſhip,</hi> and to ſuch high ends.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. The Rubrick which we muſt Aſſent, Approve and conſent to, <hi>ſaith,</hi> that <hi>[There ſhall
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62986:98"/>
none be admitted to the holy Communion, till ſuch time as he be confirmed, or be ready and deſirous to be confirmed,]</hi> that is, In the manner preſcribed by the Liturgy. This, as it concerneth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the Lay-receiver, is ſpoken of before. But now as it concerneth the Miniſters Aſſent and Conſent. 2. Some that take this for a very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſage, as it enableth them to hold back ſome uncapable perſons, dare not approve it, and conſent to it, as it denieth the Church Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which Chriſt <hi>giveth &amp; commandeth,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of unblemiſhed uprightneſs and piety, if they will not profeſs themſelves <hi>willing to be confirmed by our Biſhops</hi> in the manner before deſcribed; though they are willing to own their Baptiſmal Covenant; and few in moſt places are confirmed.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. The Liturgy ſaith, that <hi>[No man ſhould come to the holy Communion but with a full truſt in God's mercy, and a quiet Conſcience.]</hi> To which we muſt declare <hi>Aſſent, Approbation</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſenſe of theſe words remaineth dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, whether it ſpeak <hi>de neceſſitate praecepti, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l medii:</hi> Some think that the meaning is, that it is the <hi>Duty of all</hi> that come to the Communion, to have a full truſt, and a quiet Conſcience: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think that the meaning is only, that all ſhould <hi>ſeek theſe:</hi> Others think that tht meaning is, that <hi>they ſhould not come without them.</hi> Their reaſons are, 1. From the plain ſignification of the words: <hi>[No man ſhould come but with, &amp;c.]</hi> which muſt differ from <hi>[They that come ought to be ſuch]</hi> 2. Becauſe the <hi>neceſſit as praecepti</hi> may be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>perfect obedience</hi> ſince our uſe of reaſon: It is every mans duty not to ſin at all: And it is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62986:99"/>
every mans duty to believe, and love God, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſincerely, but with a ſtronger Faith and Love; and its every mans duty to ſeek after perfection: And yet no man will ſay that we ſhould not come to the Communion, but with high degrees of grace, or with perfection. 3. And the words are not that they <hi>ſhould ſeek it,</hi> but that they ſhould not come without it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Nonconformiſts confeſs that all men ought to have <hi>a full Truſt,</hi> and <hi>a quiet Conſcience:</hi> But they think that many 1000 good Chriſtians have but <hi>a weak Faith or Truſt,</hi> and an <hi>unquiet Conſcience:</hi> And that the Euchariſt is a <hi>Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Comforting Sacrament,</hi> and that thoſe that have a <hi>weak Truſt,</hi> and <hi>unquiet Conſcience,</hi> ſhould come for ſtrengthening and comfort, and be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to come.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Therefore ſeeing no entreaty will prevail with the Impoſers after ſo many years time to explain theſe, and many other ſuch words, they think that the uſual ſenſe of ſuch words muſt be the meaſure of their expoſition; and therefore they dare not profeſs Aſſent, and Approbation, and Conſent, till they are better explained to them.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. The Liturgy requireth that the Prieſt deliver the <hi>Communion to the people into their hands, All meekly kneeling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The 27th. Canon ſaith, <hi>[No Miniſter ſhall wittingly adminiſter the ſame to any, but to ſuch as kneel under pain of ſuſpenſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Conformiſts differ among themſelves about the ſenſe of the Liturgy herein, <hi>viz.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>[All kneeling]</hi> include a prohibition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it to any that kneel not: ſome ſay <hi>No:</hi> that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62986:99"/>
it only bids them give it to ſuch as kneel, but not to deny it others, though the Canon do. Others ſay, yea that it requireth us to give it to no others. Their reaſons are 1. Becauſe elſe the precept ſignified nothing, if men were after it left at liberty. 2. Becauſe <hi>[All]</hi> plainly exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth others. 3. Becauſe the Canon being the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the ſame Church, expoundeth the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy; and it is abſurd to ſay that their Rubrick leaveth the Miniſter at Liberty to do that ſame thing for which the Canon ſuſpendeth him. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we muſt alſo ſubſcribe <hi>that we will uſe no other form of adminiſtration, but that of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy;</hi> which Reaſons we judge to be cogent.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Nonconformiſts differ among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about kneeling; ſome taking it to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſcandalous on the reaſons before given; and ſome taking it for lawful. But they commonly hold that it is ſinfull, cruelty and Schiſm for them as Miniſters to caſt any true Chriſtians out of Chriſt's Church and Communion of Saints, and to deny them the body and blood of Chriſt, which he hath commanded his Church to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and receive, on ſo ſmall a reaſon as this <hi>not kneeling:</hi> 1. Conſidering the three reaſons which are before mentioned as the cauſe of their doubt. 2. And that the Holy Ghoſt <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. commandeth both Paſtors and People to bear with, and receive each other, notwithſtanding ſuch kind of differences: 3. And that good mens judgments in ſuch caſes are not in their own power: 4. And that to tie Communion to ſuch doubtful Circumſtances will certainly cauſe Schiſm; and ſuch doings have long diſtracted Chriſt's Churches through the world. 5. And
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62986:100"/>
Chriſt hath commanded all his true Diſciples to live in loving concord and communion: But kneelers and not kneelers are his true Diſciples: 6. And men muſt not be caſt out of the Churches Communion even for groſs and heinous ſins, unleſs they add obſtinate impenitency. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they dare not Aſſent, Approve, Conſent to, or Practice, this rejecting of godly Chriſtians for not kneeling in the act of receiving, from thoſe priviledges which Chriſt by his teſtament hath given them.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. By the Liturgy <hi>every Pariſhioner</hi> is to <hi>communicate twice a year,</hi> and by the Canon and ſtatute to be compelled ſo to do: and the Churchwarden to preſent them that do not. And thoſe that do not in a certain time, are to be <hi>EXCOMMUNICATED,</hi> and after laid in Gaol during life, unleſs they conform. To the Liturgies Impoſition we muſt profeſs Aſſent, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Not every Pariſhioner (yea in our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience not one of many) hath a full truſt in <hi>God's Mercy,</hi> and a <hi>quiet Conſcience,</hi> without both which they are not to come.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Many <hi>good Chriſtians</hi> have ſo great a ſenſe of their ſins and unworthineſs, that they <hi>dare</hi> not communicate till they are fitter: And ſome are ſo timerous and melancholy, that hearing the Liturgy threaten men to be given up to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and eat and drink their own damnation, if they eat and drink unworthily, it would drive them by fear into diſtraction ſhould they take it, till they have better thoughts of their title and preparations; ſo that their dilemma is ſad, when they are either to go to <hi>Bedlam,</hi> or to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gaol.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:62986:100"/>
4. To ſay that all theſe doubting and timerous people <hi>ſhould</hi> be otherwiſe minded, and that this is <hi>their errour,</hi> is true, but as impertinent, as it is to tell all men that they ſhould <hi>never ſin</hi> or all ignorant carnall ungodly men that they <hi>ſhould be wiſe and godly:</hi> But to conclude that men ſhould receive the ſacrament, becauſe they <hi>ought to be prepared,</hi> though they <hi>are not prepared,</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like telling the ſick that they ſhould work and eat, as they ought to have done if by intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance they had not diſabled themſelves.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There are many among us who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of Infidelity, Atheiſm, Sadduceiſm and Hereſie, and ſome of many ſecret heinous ſins: ſome of theſe in their hearts deride Chriſtianity and the ſacrament; And the other are afraid of increaſing their damnation: But yet do not make known their ſin: But it is notorious that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſuch there be: And the doubt is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe ſhould be compelled to the ſacrament thrice a year.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Nonconformiſts hold, that to deliver a man, that ſacrament, is to deliver him the body and blood of Chriſt, and therewith a ſealed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, and guift of life eternal; And they think that the terms on which theſe are to be received, are <hi>[wholly devoting our ſelves to Chriſt, denying all, and taking up our Croſs and following him.</hi> And therefore that to ſay <hi>[Receive the ſacrament, or he in a Gaol]</hi> ſeemeth much to alter the terms of the Goſpel, which ſaith <hi>[If thou canſt not ſuffer a Gaol for Chriſt, thou art unworthy of him.</hi> It is he that can forſake all for Chriſt, that is fit for the ſacrament, and not he that would not Communicate without the fear of a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62986:101"/>
priſon or other puniſhment. To give the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to give more than all the riches of the world, which none but volunteers and deſirers are fit for.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The ancient Churches made delinquents long beg for ſuch great priviledges and gifts, knowing that to give them to thoſe that are unwilling, is to ſubvert the Goſpel. But they never ſaid <hi>[Receive them or go to Gaol.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Were it but granted in <hi>England</hi> that the great <hi>gift of Chriſts body and blood, and holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſhould be adminiſtred and received freely, that is, only given by and to voluntary agents and receivers,</hi> it would heal almoſt all the Engliſh differences, between Epiſcopal, Presbyterians and Independents.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Yet the Nonconformiſts are not againſt the encouraging of Communicants by ſpecial favours, nor the prudent compelling of Ignorant men to <hi>hear</hi> the truth, nor the hindering of pernicious hereſies moderately. But the foreſaid compulſion of all Pariſhioners they dare not Approve.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Miniſter according to the Liturgy is himſelf to give the Euchariſt to many, to whom the Nonconformiſts dare not give it: For they muſt give it thrice a year to all the Pariſhioners, except ſuch as are proved (to him that hath no power to examine them or witneſſes) to be in malice towards others, or to be in any ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſin, and that but for that time, till they are accuſed and acquit, or ſtill permitted, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. They muſt give it to many that <hi>conſent not to be any part of their charge,</hi> nor take them for <hi>their Paſtors,</hi> but bid them deny them the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62986:101"/>
if they dare, though they conſent not to the relation. 2. They muſt give it to multitudes of the <hi>groſly ignorant,</hi> who know not the eſſentials of Chriſtianity or the Sacrament, nor will come to them to be taught: When by fame, yea or perſonal knowledge, they know them to be ſuch, yet without proof (nor we think with proof) they cannot refuſe them. 3. It is known that Infidels and deriders of Scripture and mans Immortal ſtate, do ſwarm more among us. And yet they muſt all Communicate till we can bring proof of it againſt particular perſons: When few men that report it will accuſe their neighbours and prove the accuſation for fear of their diſpleaſure: 4. We muſt give it to all the ungodly that are diſmiſt by a Lay-Chancellour after accuſation, 5. We muſt give it to all that are <hi>unwilling</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> it, ſobeit they had rather take it than lie in a Gaol and be undone. 3. On theſe terms the Nonconformiſts dare not Aſſent, Conſent to and Approve the giving of it as is preſcribed. 4. It is confeſſed that compelled Receiving is not commanded by Chriſt, nor was uſed by the Church, for many hundred years, even after Emperours were Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. The Liturgy requireth Miniſters at Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, to uſe theſe words, importing the ſalvation of the perſon: <hi>[Foraſmuch as it hath pleaſed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God of his great mercy, to take to himſelf the ſoul of our dear Brother, here departed]</hi> And <hi>[We give thee hearty thanks for that it hath pleaſed thee to deliver this our Brother out of the miſeries of this ſinful world]</hi> And <hi>[That we may reſt in him as our hope is this our Brother doth.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Conformiſts are not agreed of the ſenſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62986:102"/>
of theſe words: One ſort of them ſay, that all theſe words import not the ſalvation of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: But the reſt have more ingenuity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that elſe the words are not intelligible, and that ſuch equivocation is not tolerable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some of them ſay that theſe paſſages are good, ſuppoſing Diſcipline well exerciſed; which if it be not, it is not the fault of the Liturgy. But others conſider that 1. We know that Diſcipline <hi>is not ſo</hi> exerciſed as they ſuppoſe: 2. And that theſe paſſages are not to be approved and uſed whether Diſcipline be ſo exerciſed or not: The meaning is not <hi>[I approve of this where Diſcipline is well exerciſed.]</hi> 3. It is known that the Biſhops will not have every Prieſt to be Judge.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Canon (which is the work of the ſame Church) thus expoundeth the Churches meaning; Can. 14. <hi>[All Miniſters ſhall obſerve the Orders, Rites and Ceremonies preſcribed in the Book of Common-Prayer, as well in reading the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, and ſaying of Prayers, as in admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments, without either dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing in regard of Preaching, or in any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; or adding any thing in the matter or form thereof.]</hi> (This alſo concerneth moſt of the caſes before inſtanced in, as Expoſitions of the Churches meaning.)</p>
            <p n="5">5. And Can. 68. its ſaid <hi>[No Miniſter ſhall refuſe or delay to bury any Corps that is brought—in ſuch manner and form as is preſcribed in the Book of Common-Prayer:</hi> And if he ſhall refuſe—to bury <hi>ſuch, except the party deceaſed were denounced excommunicated Majori Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione, for ſome grievous and notorious crime, and no man able to teſtifie of his repentance, he ſhall be ſuſpended by the Biſhop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:62986:102"/>
6. The new Edition of the Liturgy increaſeth the exceptions thus <hi>[The Office enſuing is not to be uſed for any that die unbaptized, or excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, or that have laid violent hands on themſelves.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Note 1. That many children of good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by ſurprize die unbaptized: 2. Many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſober perſons are excommunicated for ſome point of Nonconformity: 3. Some upright Chriſtians in phrenſies, melancholies and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions make away themſelves.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Note, That Atheiſts, Infidels, Sadduces, Blaſphemers, Whoremongers, &amp;c. ſwarm now among us, and we rarely hear of any one of theſe multitudes that are excommunicated; ſo that they are not <hi>excepted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. It cannot be denyed, that <hi>exceptio firmat regulam in non exceptis:</hi> ſo that no other muſt be excepted.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It is known that all <hi>England</hi> conſiſts of all the Individuals, and all the people are all <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. We commonly Preach that without Faith and Holineſs none ſhall ſee God; and that Whoremongers, Drunkards, &amp;c. cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Therefore either we conſent to pronounce almoſt all ſuch to be ſaved (at a time when our words take the deepeſt impreſſion,) or elſe more <hi>exceptions</hi> muſt be made.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Some ſay that the <hi>Excommunicable</hi> are included in the <hi>Excommunicated;</hi> But the Canon and the expreſs words of the Liturgy, and the Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abhorrence that the Prieſt ſhall be Judge, do ſo notoriouſly confute this bold aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, that by ſuch ſtretches almoſt any thing may be ſaid or ſworn, and it ſhall not be known by authority, when, or how far any Subject is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by Covenants or Oaths.</p>
            <p n="18">
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:62986:103"/>
XVIII. The Liturgy requireth <hi>[that ſuch ornaments of the Church and of the Miniſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at all times of their Miniſtration, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and in uſe, as were in this Church of England by the authority of Parliament in the 2d. Tear of Ed.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Canon of the ſame Church expoundeth their meaning <hi>cap.</hi> 58. Thus <hi>[every Miniſter ſaying the publick prayers or Miniſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or other rites of the Church, ſhall wear a decent and comely Surplice &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſuppoſe in the 2d. of King <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. The Cope, Alb and other veſtments were in uſe, which ſeem forbidden by the Common-Prayer Book in the 5th. and 6th. of <hi>Ed.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Conformiſts agree not of the ſenſe of this Rubrick, 1. Whether all theſe are hereby reduced or not. 2. Whether it forbid all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to officiate without a Surplice, or only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the uſe of it, without an implyed penalty: But the words, and the forecited Canons ſhew that the Church intended an excluſion of all that will not uſe it: And we muſt ſubſcribe to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in no other form.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Nonconformiſts differ about the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice; ſome taking it to be Lawful, and others to be unlawful: But they Commonly hold that Preaching Chriſts Goſpel is commanded by God, and that Miniſters by their ordination are obliged to do the work of that Office, and that Surplices are not commanded by God; and therefore, if a man miſtakingly ſhould take the uſe of the Surplice to be ſinful, he ſhould not therefore be <hi>ejected and ſilenced:</hi> And therefore they dare not declare Approbation and Conſent to the Rubrick
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62986:103"/>
or ſubſcribed form in the Canon which implyeth this reſtraint.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. The Damnatory ſentences in the Creed called <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s, are to be Aſſented, Approved and Conſented to.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If they referred but to the Doctrine of the Trinity, and not to the particulars of that explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would not be excepted againſt: But ſome R. Reverend Conformiſts do profeſs that thoſe ſentences are <hi>untrue,</hi> and not to be approved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But ſuch think that the Churches mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not to require us to <hi>Aſſent or Approve them as true,</hi> but only to <hi>Conſent</hi> to <hi>uſe</hi> them: And they prove it, becauſe the ſame Church requireth us to <hi>Read</hi> the Books of <hi>Tobit,</hi> &amp;c. which have palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble untruths, and not to believe them to be true.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But that reaſon ſeemeth null and vain; 1. Becauſe the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> is no part of the Book to which we muſt Profeſs Aſſent, Approbation and Conſent, nor to which by the Canon we muſt <hi>ex animo</hi> ſubſcribe, that there <hi>is nothing in it contrary to the Word of God.</hi> But <hi>Athanaſius</hi>'s Creed, with thoſe damnatory ſentences, are part of that Book. Indeed the Liturgy requireth us to read thoſe Apocryphal untruths, but they are no part of the Book: 2. And it being not the ſenſe of the Liturgy, but of a Statute of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we here doubt of, it ſeemeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, if not impertinent, to tell us what is taken for the ſenſe of <hi>the Church;</hi> for the doubt is <hi>What is the ſenſe of the Parliament,</hi> which we can no otherwiſe know but by the <hi>plain words,</hi> till they will otherwiſe declare their meaning.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And indeed if the paſſages in <hi>Tobit,</hi> which ſome Reverend Biſhops call Lies (about the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62986:104"/>
Angel's ſaying that he was the Son of <hi>Ananias,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Napthali,</hi> and the fiſhes driving away all Devils, that they ſhall never return) were <hi>but to be read,</hi> we know not how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of that Law, Calendar or Rubrick, that commandeth ſuch reading of them. But yet that is much leſs than the Aſſent required to <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi>'s Creed; which yet we take (ſave thoſe damnatory ſentences) to be the beſt explication of the Myſtery of the ſacred Trinity, which in ſo ſhort a ſumme is extant in the Church.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. The Liturgy ſaith <hi>[All Prieſts and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons are to ſay daily the Morning and Evening Prayer, either privately or openly, not being let by ſickneſs, or ſome other urgent cauſe. And the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that miniſtreth in every Pariſh-Church or Chapel, being at home, and not being otherwiſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably hindred, ſhall ſay the ſame in the Pariſh-Church or Chapel where he miniſtreth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Conformiſts agree not of the ſenſe of this; ſome think that the ordinary incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſuch a commanded uſe, may paſs as thoſe <hi>hinderances</hi> or <hi>urgent cauſes</hi> mentioned in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: But the more plain and ingenuous dealers hold, that the <hi>urgent cauſes</hi> and <hi>hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances</hi> here mentioned, muſt be ſomewhat <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,</hi> and not any thing which is the uſual caſe of moſt Miniſters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Cathedrals and ſome other Churches have many Prieſts and Deacons of whom one only can daily oſſiciate in publick. And many are Chaplains in ſuch mens houſes as will have other free prayers uſed. And moſt Miniſters have great and neceſſary work to do, which muſt all be left undone, while the Common Prayer is
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62986:104"/>
ſaid over by them twice a day. They have Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to ſtudy, many Books to read, that they may be furniſhed with neceſſary knowledge for their work: They have abundance of ignorant pariſhioners to inſtruct, exhort or comfort; They have the ſick to viſit, the dead to bury, the Sacraments to adminiſter, families to govern, inſtruct and provide for. And many find free prayer from the immediate ſenſe of their caſe and wants, to be ſo profitable to them that they cannot ſpare it: All which and more require the the ſtricteſt improvement of every minute of their time: And if the Liturgy be read over by every Prieſt and Deacon twice a day, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that much of theſe aforeſaid muſt be omitted. And it is a great part of our Chriſtian duty, when two good things come together, to chooſe that which <hi>hic et nunc</hi> is the greater; to chooſe the leſſer then being a ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Therefore the Nonconformiſts dare not Aſſent, Approve and Conſent to the tying of every Prieſt and Deacon ordinarily to read over the Liturgy twice every day. And they are the more averſe to ſuch Approbation, by ſeeing ſo very few Conformiſts, Comparatively, to practice this themſelves; which ſheweth that they take it to be unlawful; ſeeing it is their judgement that our Rulers muſt be obeyed <hi>in all</hi> things which are lawful to be ſo done. And if they that make ſuch declarations of Approbation think it unlawful ordinarily to keep them, we may doubt whether it be lawful ſo to <hi>make</hi> them, as is required of us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If God ask us why we did not teach our families, viſit the ſick, inſtruct ignorant neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62986:105"/>
ſtudy better for to diſcharge our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial work, that we might be men of knowledge, and ſuch like, the doubt is whether it will paſs for a good anſwer to ſay, we had not time, becauſe we muſt twice a day read the Common-Prayer.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. Aſſenting, Approving and Conſenting to <hi>all</hi> things, even to all forms, orders, &amp;c. inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>the order of the Liturgy.</hi> Two Rules of the <hi>order of Prayer</hi> are commonly acknowledged 1. The <hi>nature and order of the matter</hi> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. 2. The <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> us a directory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Nonconformiſts that think that for the main there is nothing but good contained in moſt of the Prayers of the Liturgy; yet think that they are greatly <hi>diſordered</hi> and <hi>defective;</hi> neither formed according to the order of <hi>matter,</hi> nor of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> but like an immethodical Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which is unſuitable to the high ſubjects and honourable work of holy worſhip.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They have oft offered, whenever it will be well taken, to give in a Catalogue of the <hi>diſorders</hi> and <hi>defects</hi> of the Liturgy: Which yet they think it lawful to uſe, in <hi>obedience,</hi> or for <hi>unity,</hi> or when no better may be uſed: But not to <hi>approve</hi> of ſuch <hi>diſorder;</hi> as we do not <hi>approve</hi> of the failings of any of our own duties, though we are daily guilty of them unwillingly.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. The Preface to the Book of Ordination ſaith, that <q>
                  <hi>[It is evident to all men diligently reading holy Scriptures and ancient Authors, that from the Apoſtles time there have been theſe ORDERS in Chriſt's Church, Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, as ſeveral OFFICES;</hi>
               </q> which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62986:105"/>
are repeated oft in the Collects at Ordination: To this all muſt Aſſent and Conſent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some of us are conſcious that we have <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently read the holy Scriptures and ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> and yet three ORDERS and OFFICES are not evident to us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have great reaſon to believe that <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Beza,</hi> and many more Reformers, <hi>Blondell, Salmatius, Robert Parker, Gerſom, Bucer, Calder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Cartwright, John Reynolds, Ames, Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> and multitudes of ſuch Proteſtants, did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently read both Scriptures and Ancients: As alſo Dr. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="23">XXIII. The ordering of Prieſts requireth the Biſhop to ſpeak to the people at the Ordination of Prieſts, calling them <hi>[to come forth in the name of God, and ſhew what crime or impediment they know in the perſons to be ordained, &amp;c.]</hi> In <hi>imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the ancient Churches, when the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation over which they were ſet, had their voice in his election or reception.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The doubt is, whether ſuch a ſolemn invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as in God's name, be not too <hi>vain</hi> to be <hi>Aſſented,</hi> and <hi>Approved,</hi> and <hi>Conſented</hi> to, in a Church, where the people over whom he is ſet, never uſe to be preſent, nor invited to it, nor have any notice of it, or any call to meddle therein; being uſually many miles, and often many ſcore miles diſtant; nor any other people called to that work; and rarely any people
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62986:106"/>
there that have any knowledge of the man and his converſation.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. The Ordaining of Prieſts, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of Biſhops both uſe theſe words as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Office <hi>[Receive the Holy Ghoſt for the Office and work of a Prieſt, of a Biſhop, &amp;c.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not doubted but that the Holy Ghoſt muſt ſet Paſtors over the Flocks; 1. By quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying men for the Office, and making them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of it: Both <hi>Grace, Ability</hi> and <hi>Willingneſs</hi> are of him: 2. By giving the Ordainers a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning skill to know whom to ordain: 3. By giving the flock a diſcerning and a willing mind. We yet know not of any other Collation of the Holy Ghoſt, which Ordination can make. Nor know we that in any of theſe ſenſes theſe words can be well underſtood: For 1. <hi>Grace, Gifts</hi> and <hi>Willingneſs,</hi> are the <hi>diſpoſitio recipient is</hi> preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: we ſee not how it can be lawful to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain him that ſeemeth not before to have them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what elſe are they examined about? Nor know we that God hath given any power to the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers</hi> now, by the laying on of hands, to make an ungodly man godly, or an unlearned or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant man to be learned or wiſe, or a man of ill utterance to have a better tongue, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing man to be willing. The Apoſtles had a miraculous power of giving the Holy Ghoſt for extraordinary works, and for abilities ſuddenly infuſed; and they did it: we never knew of any in our age that did it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſe that they have no promiſe or power ſo to do. 2. And to give a diſcerning skill to the Ordainers; 3. Or to give a diſcerning or willing mind to the people, are neither of them a giving
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62986:107"/>
the Holy Ghoſt to the Prieſt. The doubt is, whether this be not an abuſe of the words which Chriſt himſelf or his Apoſtles uſed, and ſo not to be aſſented to, approved and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet is it not denyed, but that Miniſterial <hi>Authority</hi> is given by the ordainers as Miniſters, Deliverers or Inveſters: But <hi>Authority</hi> is not the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſo called.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nor is it denyed but that as Father, Son, and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> do enter into Covenant with us as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in our baptiſm ſo do they with Miniſters, as ſuch, in their ordination-covenant: But ſuch a Relation to the Holy Ghoſt as the Miniſters future helper in his work, cannot well be ſuppoſed to be all that is meant by the words <hi>[Receive the Holy Ghoſt,]</hi> both Scripture and common uſe, taking them in another ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. This Oath in the Conſecration of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops is to be taken by every Biſhop <hi>[In the name of God Amen. I. N. Choſen Biſhop of the Church and See of N. do profeſs and promiſe all due reverence and obedience to the Arch Biſhop, and to the Metropolitical Church of N. and to their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, ſo help me God through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not pretended that any ſuch Oaths of obedience were inſtituted by Chriſt or his Apoſtles; or were uſed in the Churches for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years, nor till the Papacy was riſing, which was furthered by ſuch Oaths.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They that ſuppoſe Biſhops to be ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles, cannot make them ſubjects to any other Eccleſiaſtical Rulers, without aſſerting that the Apoſtles were Governours over one another; which we find not that they do.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:62986:107"/>
4. It was many hundred years before Arch-Biſhops had any Governing power over Biſhops, or exacted any obedience from them; being not <hi>Epiſcopi Epiſcoporum</hi> (as the Carthage Fathers in <hi>Cyprian</hi> profeſſed.) But were only ſuch as had the firſt ſeats and voices in the Synods.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The queſtion therefore is, whether ſuch Oaths, as neceſſary to a Biſhops conſecration, be to be Approved and conſented to?</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. An Oath of Canonical obedience alſo is put upon all that are made Prieſts and Deacons: And Prieſts at their ordination muſt make this Covenant, that they <hi>[will reverently obey their Ordinary, and other chief Miniſters, unto whom is committed the charge and Government over them.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ordinary is not only the Biſhop, but alſo the Chancellour, Officials, <hi>Surrogates, Comiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, Arch-Deacons,</hi> and all that are Judges' in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. to obey them that are thus <hi>de facto ſet over</hi> us, is no leſs than to obey them in the excerciſe of that power which is given them as ſo ſet over us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The doubt is, whether they that take any of them to be Uſurpers of an Eccleſiaſtical power, which indeed they have not (and can prove it to be ſo) ſhould ſwear or Covenant obedience to them as ſuch. <hi>e. g.</hi> It is commonly confeſſed by the Conformiſts that the true power of the Keys, of <hi>excommunication</hi> and <hi>Abſolution</hi> is appropriated by Chriſt to the Clergy: And yet our Chancellours being lay men, do decretively excerciſe that power. The queſtion is, may we ſwear or Covenant to obey them?</p>
            <p n="5">5. And ſeeing Chriſt never gave one Presbyter
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:62986:108"/>
the Government of others, as Archdeacons, Surrogates, Officials, &amp;c. whether all the reſt may ſwear obedience to them, or Approve of and conſent to the uſe of ſuch Oaths? And divers Councils have condemned it as a dangerous practice for Biſhops to tle ſubject Presbyters to them by Oaths.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. Miniſters that live among the people have greateſt advantage to know the penitent from the impenitent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But it is the foreſaid lay Chancellours, who uſually know nothing of them but by reports, that excommunicate and abſolve them. And the Pariſh-Miniſter muſt (as a cryer readeth a proclamation or ſentence of a Judge) openly read theſe excommunications and abſolutions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe excommunications muſt paſs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canons, againſt all that ſhall affirm that <hi>[there is any thing in the book of Common-Prayer r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pugnant to the Scripture or any of the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The preſent doubt is whether a Miniſter who knoweth ſuch of his Pariſh to be godly, peaceable men, whom the Chancellour decretive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excommunicateth, may both openly read and declare ſuch excommunications and alſo ſwear or Covenant ſo to do, in obedience to the Ordinary. And whether when he knoweth that a wicked
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:62986:108"/>
impenitent man is abſolved, he may pronounce ſuch abſolutions.</p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. The Oath of <hi>Canonical obedience</hi> ſeemeth to mean <hi>obedience</hi> according to the Canons: And he that Covenanteth to <hi>obey his ordinary,</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to mean no leſs than <hi>[According to the Canon Laws by which he is known to govern,]</hi> and as Government thereby is excerciſed:</p>
            <p n="2">2. And if ſo, then there are more things in the Canons and preſent Government, which the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts dare not ſwear or Covenant to obey (beſides thoſe already named,) than we will now ſtand to enumerate.</p>
            <p n="29">XXIX. The Rubrick ſaith that <hi>[the Miniſter who repelleth any from the Sacrament, ſhall be obliged to give an account of the ſame to the Ordinary within</hi> 14 <hi>daies after, at the furtheſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If all that by groſs ignorance, Atheiſm, Infidelity, Sadduciſm, Hereſie, Schiſm, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Whoredom, Stealing, Malice, &amp;c. are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the Communion be preſented to the Ordinary within 14 daies, no charity that is guided by knowledge of the common ſtate of the people, can think, that in <hi>London</hi> Dioceſs there would be fewer than many ſcore thouſands preſented at once. And in other Dioceſſes many ſcore hundreds at leaſt,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some Miniſters dwell a hundred Miles or neer from the Biſhops. And the Biſhops are divers of them ſo much at <hi>London</hi> or abroad, as that it cannot be expected that all theſe muſt be preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Biſhop himſelf, but to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours court, as is uſual.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Chancellours Court is ſo far from moſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:62986:109"/>
Miniſters in the Land, and the proſecuting ſo many when proof is demanded, will be ſo chargeable and take up ſo much time, as that it will undo many poor Miniſters, that have ſcarce enough to maintain their families; and it will take up the time which they ſhould uſe in the neceſſary labours for their flocks.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Chancellour is a lay man to whom they muſt be preſented: And the iſſue will be but a lay mans <hi>excommunicating</hi> them, if obſtinate; or abſolving them: Which is not juſtified by the Biſhops themſelves.</p>
            <p n="6">6. At the ſaid Chancellours court things are managed as at a civil judicature: There is not that endeavour to convince ſinners by Scripture, and to draw them to true Repentance, by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling evidence, intreaties and prayers for them, as ſhould be for the ſaving of a ſoul from ſin: But the charges of the court fees, and the fears of a priſon after excommunication, maketh it an unacceptable and as unlikely means to convert men as the ſtocks.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Therefore for a miniſter to preſent all his Pariſhioners to ſuch courts, whom he is bound to deny the Sacrament to, were but to make him ſeem their greateſt and cruelleſt enemy, and to render him uncapable of ever (probably) profiting them by his Miniſtry any more; and conſequently, greatly to promote their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and make them almoſt hopeleſs as to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. And if by this terrour they tell the Chancellour that they <hi>Repent,</hi> how little ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is that to the Miniſter, that never ſaw, himſelf, any ſigns of their repentance.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The doubt is then, whether the uſe of this
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62986:109"/>
Rubrick may be Approved and Conſented to.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Eſpecially conſidering that all the Pariſh who receive not thrice a year, (of which <hi>Eaſter</hi> muſt be one <hi>for them all)</hi> muſt be preſented to the ſaid ordinary, and alſo all that come not to Church; By which means divers Pariſhes about <hi>London</hi> muſt have ſome 10000, ſome 20000, ſome 30000, ſome 40000, or 50000, that have no room in the Church, all preſented if this Law were executed.</p>
            <p n="30">XXX. We have reaſon to doubt whether the Act of Uniformity it ſelf be not part of the Books which we muſt ſubſcribe Aſſent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to; becauſe it is ſo ſaid in the Book it ſelf: The Contents of the Book are firſt named in general, and then this Act named among the Contents. Either it is part of the Contents, or it is not; if it be not, we muſt not aſſent and conſent to that falſhood (that it is;) If it be, O far be it from us that believe a God, a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a life to come, and the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to Aſſent and Conſent to that Act with all its penalties, ſilencing and ruining ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not. One of us that was oft with the great, wiſe, juſt Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales,</hi> hath heard him lamenting the Schiſms and diſcords of the Clergy, ſeriouſly ſay, that <hi>[There was no right way to heal us, but by a New Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.]</hi> (And hath his late Writings againſt laying Concord or Religion upon mens unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary additions.) And the Reporter taketh not himſelf to be wiſer than him, nor meet to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Conſent to ſuch a Law, conſidering the experience of theſe ſeventeen years, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents on mens divided and exaſperated minds,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62986:110"/>
upon the Congregations, upon Miniſters and Families, and upon the ſtate and ſecurity of the Chriſtian Religion, and the Proteſtant Cauſe, &amp;c. As to them that ſay that the <hi>Act nameth the Book as diſtinct from it ſelf;</hi> we anſwer, 1. So do the Titles of Acts of Parliament name the Act it ſelf as diſtinct from the Title, and yet we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that Title part of the Act. 2. The Book nameth the Act as part of its Contents, as is aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>If we ſhould by miſtake think ſome of theſe paſſages to be unlawful that are not, or to have a worſe ſenſe than indeed they have, let theſe things be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We judge as well as we are able; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſenſe another takes them in, we that ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them cannot take them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We judge of the ſenſe by the plain words; the force and ſtretch is not by us but by thoſe that conform and contradict our ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Law-givers will not otherwiſe expound their own words, after 17 years waiting for it under Compulſive Executions: Certainly if they would have us underſtand their words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to common uſe, they would rather tell us ſo after ſeventeen years time, than ruine us, and forbear ſo eaſie a means to heal the Churches.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some of us ſo highly value the excellent Praelections of Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon de juramento,</hi> and his judgment, againſt taking and expounding Oaths (and conſequently profeſſions and promiſes) in a ſtretched or a doubtful ſenſe, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to refuſe them, when the ſenſe is doubtful, if the Rulers or Impoſers will not expound them
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62986:110"/>
(though they ſhould bid us take them in our own ſenſe;) with much more which he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſaid to ſuch purpoſes, that we thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge that he hath much helpt for to fortifie us againſt the guilt of perjury, and falſhood, and prophaning the holy name of God, and deceiving our Governours by equivocations and falſe expoſitions, and ſcandalouſly tempting others to perjury, lying, or ſuch other ſins.</p>
            <p>We take an underſtanding, ſerious (and if it may be <hi>publick)</hi> owning of the Baptiſmal Covenant in age to be of ſo great moment to the reviting of true Chriſtianity and the honour of Baptiſm and cure of Anabaptiſm, that it greatly grieveth us that we muſt deſpair of its effectual practiſe, when we meet with few that ſeem not to app<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rove it. The words of a very Learned and Great Conformiſt Mr <hi>Elder field</hi> of Baptiſm <hi>pag.</hi> 48. <hi>marg.</hi> We think worthy our recital.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Upon ſcore of like reaſon (ſaith he) whereto, and for ſuch after tryal, may have been taken up in the Chriſtian Church, that examination which did ſift the conſtancy or rather conſiſtency of thoſe that had been taken in young, to their preſumed grounds, that if they wavered they might be known and diſcharged, or if they remained conſtant, they might by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands receive what the Commoner name of that Ceremony did import, of their faith (at leaſt a ſign of) <hi>Confirmation. Vaſquez</hi> hath from <hi>Eraſmus</hi> (in the Preface to his Paraphraſe on the Goſpels) a word of moſt wholſom grave and prudent adviſe, that thoſe who were Baptized young, when they begin to write man, ſhould be examined, <hi>an ratum
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62986:111"/>
habeant id quod in Catechiſmo ipſorum nomine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſum: Quod ſi ratum non habeant, ab Eccliſiae juriſdictione liberos manere;</hi> in 3. <hi>p. Thom. diſp.</hi> 154. <hi>To.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2. If they did then ſtand to what their ſureties promiſed for them. If not they ſhould be diſcarded. Moſt neceſſary! and of unimaginable benefit! Such a ſcrutiny would ſhake off thouſands of rotten hypocrites, and purge the Church of many ſuch Inſide! believers or profeſſours, upon whoſe dirty faces a little holy water was ſprinkled when they knew not what it was; but they no more mind the true ſanctification appertaining than the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Saracens</hi> (who ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt their waſhed filthineſs,) or than thoſe of whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> [It is hapned to them according to the true proverb: The dog to his vomit, and the waſhed ſwine to wallow in the mire.] Such diſcipline of a wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Reaſon is that the world groans for; that men would become Chriſtians. O that the truth of faith, and power of true Chriſtian belief might be ſeen in thoſe that knowingly put the neck in Chriſts yoak.]</q> So far he. See alſo Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi> of Baptiſm. And of our ſelves Mr. <hi>Hanmer</hi> and <hi>Baxter</hi> have written Treatiſes only on this ſubject, to ſhew that ſuch true Confirmation would be the moſt excellent means to heal moſt of our enormities and diviſions.</p>
            <p>And ſhall ſuch Jeſuits as <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> ſuch mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators as <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and Proteſtant Conformiſts, and Nonconformiſts, all thus ſpeak for it, and yet no hope? No wonder if a word or ceremony that we diſagree in, can make our wound ſo ſad as we have ſelf, when that which we in words
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62986:111"/>
agree for, and that not as a thing indifferent, but ſo neceſſary, cannot yet be obtained though we periſh. Dead Images of all good things, is but the laſt and moſt effectual means of deſtroying the life and real good: Dead ſhews and Images of good, are Hypocriſie; ſincerity is reality, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs and life. We take our Baptiſm to be our Chriſtening, or the ſumme of the Chriſtian Religion: And it is but for men to <hi>do that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly at Age,</hi> which they did in Infancy by others authorized (or others for them) which is the Converſion which we daily preach: And it grieveth us to ſee what multitudes, when aged, never ſeriouſly think either what they did or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in their Infancy; and how many hate ſuch a life as they have vowed, and yet think that they ſtand to their Baptiſmal Covenant. And till the Paſtors of the Church make a ſerious work of it, to bring all their Pariſhes to a ſerious underſtanding and conſideration of their Baptiſm, and a ſerious owning it, and renewing of that Covenant, we cannot hope that the people will be ſerious Chriſtians; or that men will not think that ſerious Anabaptiſts are better than Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites that contemn their Baptiſm.</p>

            <head>The Fourth Part of Conformity.</head>
            <p n="4">IV. THE Fourth Part of Conformity is the Subſcription againſt the obligation of the Oath called the Solemn Vow and Covenant. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations are conſtituted by Declaring, that <hi>there is no obligation from it</hi> to any one without exception: But Miniſters muſt only ſubſcribe that <hi>there is no obligation on me, or on any other perſon, from the Oath,—to endeavour any change or alteration of Government in the Church.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is none of the Controverſie <hi>here,</hi> 1. Whether that vow was lawfully impoſed or contrived, 2. Nor whether it were lawfuly taken. 3. Nor whether part of the matter was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. But ſuppoſing all theſe unlawful, 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all alteration of Church Government be unlawful? whether it be not in the power of <hi>the</hi> King and Parliament, to ſet a Biſhop in every Market Town: or to take the uſe of the Keys from Laymen: or to take down Archdeacons, Officials, Commiſſaries. Surrogates, &amp;c? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Reformation be out of the power of the King, or not to be deſired by the people?
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62986:114"/>
2. Whether that which is <hi>Lawful</hi> may not be done by the Law makers, and be endeavoured by ſpeech in Parliament, or by petition by the people; Eſpecially if the King Command it? 3. Whether men be not bound by a <hi>Vow</hi> to that which is Lawful: much more to that Which is antecedently a duty?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Conformiſts are here diſagreed among themſelves; ſome ſay that the <hi>Vow Bindeth not</hi> becauſe it was <hi>unlawfully impoſed:</hi> But other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> better ſay, that this proveth no more, but that the <hi>Impoſers</hi> could not bind <hi>me to take it by any authority of theirs;</hi> And that if I had taken it <hi>in ſecret without impoſition,</hi> I had been bound by it: Els no private Vow ſhould bind. Some ſay that it binds not becauſe it was <hi>ſinfully taken:</hi> But others truly ſay that if Oaths bind not wherever men <hi>take them ſinfully,</hi> no wicked man ſhould ever be bound by Oaths or Vows, becauſe they uſually make them ſinfully by an ill end and intention, wrong motives, or ill principles or manner: Or at leaſt a bad man might chooſe whether ever he will be obliged: But all good caſuiſts agree, that if the <hi>matter</hi> be lawful the <hi>unlawful taking</hi> hinders not the obligation. A man that is Bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tized with ill motives or intentions, is yet obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by his Baptiſmal Vow. Some ſay that it binds not becauſe the <hi>matter it ſelf</hi> is unlawful. But its granted that it bindeth to no unlawful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Others therefore truly ſay that he that Voweth ſix things whereof three are ſinful, is not diſobliged by the conjunction of theſe from the other three that are Lawful: Els a Knave may keep himſelf diſobliged as to all Vows, by putting in ſome unlawful thing. Some ſay that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62986:114"/>
it binds not becauſe we were antecedently bound to all that is good by other bonds, and therefore not by this. But others truly ſay, that this is a moſt intollerable reaſon and would nullifie our Baptiſmal Vow, and all our ſacramental Vows renewed; and all Covenants that ever man can make to God of any duty. For <hi>Gods own Laws firſt bind us</hi> to <hi>every duty:</hi> But for all that our own <hi>Vows,</hi> Covenants and promiſes <hi>ſecondarily</hi> bind us alſo: And a man may have <hi>many obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to one duty;</hi> Yea indeed the Covenanters ordinarily profeſs that they think not that a man ſhould Vow any thing to God but what God firſt hath made his duty. And they are againſt the Papiſts for making Religions and duties to themſelves which God never made: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they profeſs that if ſome things in the Covenant were not their duty before, they would not think that they are bound to it now: And they profeſs that if they had never taken that Vow they had been bound to all that by it they are bound to: And therefore condemning that Vow doth no whit ſecure the Government of the Church <hi>(e. g. Lay Chancellours uſe of the Keys,</hi> or the <hi>deſtruction of diſcipline)</hi> from their Lawful endeavours to alter it. And they profeſs that ſeeing the King hath power to command them Lawful things, if they had Vowed any thing meerly Indifferent it would not have bound them againſt the Kings Commands; Becauſe it is not in ſubjects power, by Vows to withdraw themſelves from their obedience to authority. Some ſay that the Proclamation of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt againſt the Covenant null'd the obligation. But others truly ſay, 1. That it could null no
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62986:115"/>
more than the <hi>Impoſition</hi> to take it, and not the obligation when it's taken, in <hi>neceſſary</hi> things: 2. That this is nothing to all them that took it <hi>afterward,</hi> and that when <hi>Charles</hi> II. had (though injuriouſly) been drawn to declare for it. Some ſay that it binds not becauſe men took it <hi>unwillingly.</hi> But others truly ſay, 1. that this would leave it in the power of a bad man to nullifie all Vows and contracts, by ſaying that he <hi>did them</hi> unwillingly: 2. That man hath <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee will</hi> and cannot be compelled: And a Vow of a thing Lawful to ſave ones life bindeth: Men muſt rather die than lie. 3. This would teach Subjects to ſay that they take all Oaths of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to the King unwillingly and therefore are not bound. 4. Its true that no man that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth another injuriouſly to a promiſe can <hi>claim to himſelf any right</hi> from that which was not free but procured by his own injurious violence or fraud; But <hi>God</hi> wrongeth none, and a <hi>Vow to God</hi> bindeth though procured by ſinful force by men. Some ſay that It was only a League and Covenant with men, and not a Vow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ceaſeth <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is no place for the belief of this objection to any that knoweth a Vow otherwiſe than by the name: Indeed an Oath that is but an appeal to God, that I will faithfully perform my Covenant with a man, obligeth me not when that man hath diſcharged me from any obligation to him. But this in queſtion was primarily a promiſe or <hi>Covenant made to God</hi> (which is a Vow,) and a League and Covenant of men with one another that they will perform it; as is notorious to any man that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62986:115"/>
readeth it with common underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſecond thing queſtioned about that Vow (and the main) is, whether every Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt or may become the judge of <hi>all other mens Conſciences and obligations in three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> even of many thouſands whom they never ſaw nor heard of, and that ſo far as to abſolve or juſtifie them from all obligations by that Vow to endeavour any Church reformation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is here ſuppoſed 1. That though men ought to take an Oath in the ſence of a <hi>Lawful Governour</hi> ſo far as they know it, yet that they are not bound beyond the plain meaning of the words to the ſenſe of Uſurpers: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they know not but the King and Lords, &amp;c. might take the ſame words in another meaning than the obtruders did intend; <hi>e. g,</hi> to <hi>reform according to Gods Word and the example of the beſt reformed Churches</hi> might ſignifie to them an oppoſition to Presbytery.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That if men miſtake the ſence of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, they are bound to <hi>keep</hi> an Oath in the Lawful ſence in which they <hi>took it.</hi> And then how knoweth every Miniſter in what ſenſe every man in the three Kingdoms took it? And how is he able to ſay that no one man of them all is obliged by it to endeavour a lawful and neceſſary reformation?</p>
            <p n="3">3. And as to the former Argument that men <hi>were forced to it,</hi> many of the Old Parliament are yet living, and many others, that then <hi>forced others</hi> to it, and were <hi>not forced</hi> to it themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And if the preſent Parliament-men could (upon what compulſion ſoever) Vow to reform, <hi>e. g.</hi> ſcandalous Miniſters, Swearing, Drunkenneſs,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62986:116"/>
Popery, &amp;c. and then would command all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters on pain of ſilencing to ſubſcribe that no man is bound to perform that Vow, this would not do them any ſervice, but involve each Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriber in the guilt of a multitudes perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

            </head>
            <p n="1">1. THE The Fifth Part of Conformity is the Subſcribing of the ſaid Declaration, and taking the <hi>Oxford</hi> Oath, as it concerneth <hi>Civil</hi> Government, <hi>viz. [It is not lawful on any pretence whatſoever to take Arms againſt the King; and that I do abhor that traiterous poſition of taking Arms by his authority againſt his perſon, or againſt thoſe that are commiſſioned by him.]</hi> in purſuance of that Commiſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here the Queſtion is not of the firſt Clauſe, of <hi>taking Arms againſt the King;</hi> but only of the laſt <hi>[againſt thoſe that are commiſſioned by him]</hi> the Miniſters being moſtly ignorant of Law, and not knowing what is called a <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and what ſeal maketh it ſuch: For as they are ſatisfied that no true Legal Commiſſion of the King may be reſiſted, ſo while the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded words have no limitation or exception, they dare not think that a Lord Chancellour or Keeper hath power at his pleaſure to depoſe the King, by ſealing Commiſſions to any to ſeize on his Forts, Garriſons, Magazines, Treaſure, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies or Guards; nor yet to deſtroy the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62986:116"/>
Cities, Laws and Judgments, and ſeize at pleaſure on all mens eſtates or lives. And they dare not ſwear or ſubſcribe that which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Learned men, Heathens, Papiſts and Proteſtants, Politicians, Lawyers, and Divines are commonly againſt, it being too great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming on their own wits to ſay or ſwear, that almoſt all the world are in the wrong (even men in their own profeſſion) and that yet they are wiſer than all theſe. An Oath therefore being to be taken <hi>underſtandingly,</hi> their not <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> this, cauſeth their refuſal; and it pleaſeth not the Law givers to explain it to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But though this be a very important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we are ſo unwilling to meddle with matters of our Rulers Power, as being leſs pertinent to our function, and the late debates in the Houſe of Lords (as ſome body hath publiſhed them) have ſaid ſo much in this caſe, that we think it beſt to ſay no more of it.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THE Sixth part of Obedience required of us conſequently is, that till we can do all aforeſaid, <hi>We muſt deſert our former flocks, though they deſire us to continue our care of them, and that we give over our preaching the Goſpel of ſalvation to any but our families, or four more; and that no man not ordained by Dioceſans adminiſter the Lords Supper, &amp;c.]</hi>

2. The queſtion is not whether we ſhould give up the Temples and Tythes, and all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Maintenance when ever it is required of us: Though St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> would not obey the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> in giving up one Temple which he could ſpare, to the <hi>Arrians;</hi> yet the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts are of another judgment, and think them all in the Magiſtrates power: But it is the <hi>Office, Relation</hi> and <hi>Work,</hi> that they dare not renounce or ceaſe from, without a better diſcharge.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet they judge, that where truly there is no neceſſity of their labours, or they ſhould do more hurt than good by Preaching, it is their duty, when forbidden, to forbear: But not becauſe any will ſay, we are Judges, and it is ſo, when notoriouſly it is not ſo.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THE Seventh Part of the Obedience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us, is that <hi>we come not within five miles of any City or Corporation which ſendeth Burgeſſes to Parliament, or to any other place what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, where we have ever preached ſince the Act of Oblivion;</hi> except on the Rode or ſummoned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Many Miniſters have their friends, houſes, and all that they have, in thoſe forbidden pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The greateſt places being moſt populous
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62986:117"/>
have moſt need of Preachers, many ſouls being more precious than few, and the publick Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers that have many thouſands, needing more help than they that have but little charges.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Few Miniſters are rich enough to be able to ſell their houſes and goods at loſs (when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps none will take them,) and to take houſes in other Countries.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A great part of the Land is ſeated ſo neer Corporations, that it is hard to find a place that is above five miles off them; And ſome Miniſters have Preached about in ſo many places, that it is hard to find a place within their reach, above five miles from the places which they have preached in: And in ſuch places, it is rare to find empty houſes, and Landlords that will let them on terms which they are capable of: ſo hard to them is this confinement.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They think that men can no more diſoblige them from preaching to many in Cities and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, than to four or five in Villages; ſeeing the Churches of old were planted moſt in Cities, and Chriſt ſaith not, [forſake all the ſouls in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties if they bid you,] but <hi>[When you are perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in one City fly to another.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Though we live not to eat, we muſt eat to live; and when Miniſters that have nothing, are like to beg or famiſh among ſtrangers in poor Villages, and bigger places do more call for help, and will allow them bread, they think it no ſin to eat bread any more than to give bread to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are in want.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The former Laws ſend them when they are in beggery, to be kept by the Pariſhes where they laſt lived; and this Law forbids them to come within five miles of them.</p>

AS there are ſome ſins far greater, and more terrible to conſcience than others, ſo ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating Adjuncts oft make them ſuch: And theſe here ſeem very frightful. We are not now charging any others with ſin, nor proving the unlawfulneſs of what we fear, but expreſſing the Matter of Fact agreed on, which doth affright us.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Both ſides agree, that it is a great aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin to be done by a <hi>Miniſter of Chriſt,</hi> a perſon conſecrated to holy work, to preach truth and holineſs, and ſerve at the Altar: For our Doctrine will be the leſs regarded, and men will be tempted to follow our bad example, who are bound to be to them patterns of purity and obedience to God: And Chriſtian and Proteſtant Religion is moſt injured by <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſins.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is agreed that our <hi>Miniſtorial ſins,</hi> which we do as if they were part of our Office in the publick Aſſemblies, have a ſpecial aggravation differing from mens <hi>ſecret perſonal</hi> crimes.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It is agreed that Lying and Perjury are ſins of ſo heinous a nature, as that they tend to overthrow humane truſt and converſe, and all Societies, and deprive Princes of part of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity due to them for their lives and Crowns: And that in a Preacher of the Goſpel they are intollerable, tending to tempt the hearers to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing that we ſay.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:62986:118"/>
IV. It is agreed that by aſſertion to abſolve thouſands of perſons known or unknown, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them, if they ſhould prove guilty of ſuch a crime, and ſo to draw on our ſelves the guilt of many thouſand perjuries, would be a ſin of as heinous a nature as moſt we can imagine.</p>
            <p n="5">V. It is agreed by Proteſtants, that all Oaths, Covenants and Laws, muſt be underſtood accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the plain and uſual ſenſe of the words, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs our Rulers otherwiſe expound them, and tell us that they mean ſomewhat elſe.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. It is agreed that though Judges muſt determine of the ſence of Laws, ſo far as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the caſes that are brought to them; yet none can make an univerſal obligatory expoſition of a Law, to bind the ſubjects conſcience in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Sovereign and Lawgivers themſelves: Elſe a Judge might become a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator and fruſtrate the Kings Laws by his expoſitions.

It is agreed by all Proteſtants that ſtretching the words of Laws, Oaths and Promiſes to meanings quite differing from the Common uſe of the words, without the direction of the Law-makers to to do, and taking ſuch <hi>Oaths or Covenants</hi> with <hi>eqnivocations and mental reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> on pretence of <hi>Charitable interpretation,</hi> for our own ends and intereſts, is more ſuitable to Atheiſts than ſincere Chriſtians, and would overthrow humane truſt, and the end of Laws and Princes ſafety, as well as other ſorts of perjury.

Do they ſecure any of the ends of Governments? Rulers ſhould abhor ſuch Equivocations and ſtretching Latitudes as theſe.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. It is agreed on both ſides, that if we might go on this ſuppoſition, that our Rulers can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire nothing that is <hi>unjuſt or impious, or againſt the Law or Common good or their own intereſt,</hi> and therefore that no <hi>expoſition is to be put on their

            </p>
            <p n="9">IX. It is commonly agreed that a man may not deliberately tell one lie to ſave his life, or his Miniſterial liberty: And that if any one only of all the things impoſed on us be a ſin, it is the duty of all the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> rather to ſuffer any thing, or to dye than to Commit it. And that if it be one mans duty to be ſilent in ſuch a caſe, it would be the duty of all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the Land, if the things be ſin.</p>
            <p n="10">X. And all are agreed that to ſilence all the Miniſters of the Nation, is a thing that God hath not given any man authority to do, becauſe of the neceſſity of their Miniſtry; and conſequently not to ſilence any neceſſary Miniſtry at all.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. It is agreed that Satan would fain corrupt States and Churches with the moſt heinous ſins, to expoſe them to Gods judgements and the enemies ſcorn: And that common Perjury or Perfidiouſneſs is one of thoſe greateſt ſins: And that as the Belief of the Truth is the beginning of Chriſtianity, ſo Satan is a Lyer and the father of Lies: And he that thinketh that Satan is endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſtigmatiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="12">XII. It is agreed that God hath within theſe fourteen years excerciſed very grievous Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Cities and Corporations, by ſuch a Plague (on <hi>London</hi> and many Corporations) and ſuch fires on <hi>London, Southwark</hi> and many Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations)

and ſuch increaſe of Poverty, (though we have more liberty at Sea and Land for trade, than almoſt any Nation neer us) as that the like hath not been known in our forefathers daies: And that if this ſhould be the Voice of Chriſt, as a reproof of our perfidiouſneſs, and perjuries, ſaying <hi>(except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh,)</hi> it would leave the impenitent without all juſt excuſe.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. It is agreed by us all, that God will not hold him guiltleſs who taketh his name in vain; eſpecially by perjury or falſe Vows or Covenants; And that for <hi>Oaths</hi> (broken) the Land may mourn: And that he is the grand enemy of Church or Kingdomes, who would by ſuch ſin bring them under the judgments of God: And, as <hi>Achan,</hi> bring in an accurſed thing.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. None can deny that it is better to cheriſh <hi>honeſty and conſcience,</hi> eſpecially about <hi>Oaths and Covenants</hi> which ſecure Converſe and the lives of Princes, than to teach men to <hi>ſtretch Conſcience</hi> in ſuch matters; and to make every <hi>ſeared Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> capable of the <hi>holy Miniſtry, preferment and honour;</hi> and a <hi>fear of ſuch ſin,</hi> to be the way to ſilence and ruine.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. we agree that when Jeſuites and other Papiſts have contracted the ſhame of equivocation and perfidiouſneſs, Proteſtants ſhould not partake with them, and take the ſhame on their religion,</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. It is agreed that when the <hi>Scots Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> is ſo greatly decryed, and the <hi>violation</hi> of the <hi>Oaths of Allegiance</hi> and <hi>other Oaths</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> was found neceſſary to the killing of the King, and other late confuſions and iniquities, we ſhould not after ſuch warning

either inſnare men in unneceſſary Oaths &amp; Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, nor harden ſuch men againſt Repentance, by doing any ſuch thing our ſelves, much leſs by commanding it.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII We are agreed that to commit a ſin by paſſion or ſudden ſurprize, is not ſo wicked as to do it on deliberation: Nor is the doing it only ſo bad, as undertaking to juſtifie it, and encourage others to do the like.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. We are agreed that God is jealous about holy things, and that wilful corrupting his Church, worſhip or diſcipline, to the diſgrace of religion and encouragement of wickedneſs is a heinous ſin: Eſpecially to Approve ſuch things.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. We are agreed that to make a deliberate Covenant that I will ſin againſt God, and to ſubſcribe and declare this, is a heinous aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſin: <hi>e. g.</hi> When the high places were kept up in <hi>Judea</hi> if any had Covenanted to keep them up, and <hi>purpoſed</hi> to tranſgreſs, the wilfulneſs had been the greatneſs and dangerous ſignification of ſuch ſinning.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. We are agreed that <hi>Repentance</hi> is Gods condition of forgiveneſs; and that for a man to <hi>reſolve and Covenant to ſin</hi> and to <hi>profeſs it openly</hi> to all the Church, and that <hi>oft times,</hi> and ſo to <hi>renounce Repentance,</hi> is—alas—</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. Moſt ſober Chriſtians are agreed that Chriſtians ſhould be united upon the terms which Chriſt himſelf hath made in the baptiſmal Covenant, and in their obedience to his Laws; and that Papall Uſurpations and impoſing of things unneceſſary as neceſſary to Union, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion or Miniſtration, hath been the great cauſe of Schiſms through the Chriſtian world,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:62986:121"/>
for about 1000 years at leaſt: And that they who will ſtill obey ſuch dividing Impoſers, do continue Schiſms in the world by encouraging the cauſes of them.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. We are on both ſides agreed, that it were heinous hypocriſie, and prophaneneſs, if we ſhould make our ſacred Miniſterial work the pretended reaſon for our ſinning, and ſhould ſwear, declare or ſubſcribe that which we take to be falſe, and do that which we take to be ſin, that we may have leave to preach againſt ſin in others; and ſo offer God a Sacrifice of iniquity, and put a beam into our own eye that we may have leave to Preach againſt the mote that is in our brothers eye.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. We are afraid of making Separatiſts and Anabaptiſts and tempting men to avoid us, as ſcandalous men.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. We are afraid leſt by ſuch wilful ſin, we ſhould by a carnal intereſt, to defend what we have once done, be tempted to impenitence, and to perſecute the juſt.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. We are agreed that they that will run into willful heinous ſin, as they deſerve to be forſaken of God, ſo they cannot expect ſuch a bleſſing on their Miniſtry, as Conſcionable upright men may do.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. It is agreed that the ancient Chriſtian Paſters Preached againſt the will of Princes for 300 years; and after that againſt the will of Chriſtian Princes <hi>(Conſtartius, Valens, Theodoſius Junior, Vaientinian,</hi> &amp;c.) And not only Apoſtles ſaid, that God was to be obeyed rather than men, but ſuch as <hi>Timothy</hi> who was ordained by man, were charged before God and the Lord
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:62986:121"/>
Jeſus Chriſt who will judge the living and dead at his appearing and Kingdom, to preach the Goſpel and be inſtant, in ſeaſon; &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. We are agreed that the Children of Chriſtians, when they grow up, know no more of God, of Heaven, of Chriſt, without <hi>teaching,</hi> than the Children of Heathens do: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the opening and applying the Goſpel is needful in <hi>England</hi> as well as in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. It is ſo far from ſaving unbelievers or ungodly perſons, that they are the Children of Chriſtians, and in the viſible Church. that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth their caſe more miſerable; if not worſe than that of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="29">XXIX. As of old every ſingle Church had uſually many Presbyters and Deasons with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, ſo it is undeniable that many of our Pariſhes have work enough for many Miniſters, and only want of maintenance is pretended for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent paucity (with the want of worthy men.)</p>
            <p n="30">XXX. It is granted us, that to alienate conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated perſons from the holy Miniſtry cauſleſly, is greater Sacriledge than to alienate conſecrated Lands, Goods or Temples, which are but means to the uſe of the ſaid Miniſtry. We are not here accuſing our ſilencers of this heinous Sacriledge: Their Righteous Judge and ours, will quickly paſs the final ſentence: But we dare not, we will not ſacrilegiouſly ſilence and alienate our ſelves, leſt we forſake our Lord, and betray mens ſouls, and be doomed as the ſlothful ſervant that hid his talent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. and bring down more plagues upon the Land: We fear when we read 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 15, 16. the ſigns that wrath was come to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt on the Jews; even their forbidding men to

            <p n="1">I. That the elder ſort of the Nonconformiſts are ordained by Biſhops, and moſt of the reſt by ſuch Paſtors of Churches, of Cities, Corporations and other Pariſhes aſſociate, as the times then allowed; and that in this Ordination (be the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious part right or wrong) they are all by Conſent or Covenant devoted to the ſacred Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and that not for a time, as hirelings, but for life: this is denied by none that we know of.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is known to all Faithful Miniſters and others, who converſe with the common ſort of men, that a great part of the people of <hi>England</hi> are ignorant of the very Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, and a great part dull and worldly neglecters of all ſerious religiouſneſs; and a great part ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ual, drowned in filthy fleſhly ſins: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ignorance, weakneſs, and unwarrantable
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62986:122"/>
opinions and paſſions of many that are more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly religious than the reſt. And that it is a hard work to cure <hi>one</hi> ignorant, erroneous, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſoul: And each one is precious, and not to to be left in ſin as deſperate; conſidering the everlaſting conſequents.</p>
            <p n="3">III. It is certain that moſt great Pariſhes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Cities and great Towns, have more ſouls which call for <hi>Miniſterial help,</hi> than Conformiſts and Nonconformiſts, if they lovingly joyned, are able well to afford neceſſary help to.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Miniſters that dwell in Cities or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, when they were caſt out, did quietly ſurrender Temples and Tythes: But many of their people claimed the continuance of their Relation and Miniſtry; and many profeſſed that they could not truſt their ſouls to the Paſtoral guidance and care of many of thoſe who were placed in the Temples in their ſtead; and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the neglect of their ſouls on ſuch as refuſed.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The Bills of Mortality ſhew us that the 7 Pariſhes within the walls of <hi>London</hi> are not the ſeventh part of the whole, including all the outer Pariſhes: And of the 97 there were very few Churches left unburned; and there are but few that are yet built up; and inſtead of many, there are ſmall Tabernacles, and inſtead of others no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: And the outer Pariſhes are moſtly ſo great, as that the Temples will hold but a ſmall part of the people: It is conjectured by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, that in <hi>Martins</hi> Pariſh are about three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore thouſand ſouls, and in <hi>Stepney</hi> and <hi>Giles</hi>'s <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> each about fifty thouſand, and in <hi>Giles</hi>'s in the Fields between 20000 and 30000, and in <hi>Clements Danes, Margarets Weſtminſter,

Andrews Holborn, Sepulchres,</hi> and the Churches in <hi>Southwark,</hi> at <hi>Aldgate, White-Chappel, Shore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditch,</hi> and divers others, there are in ſome ſix times the number that can hear in the Temples, in ſome more, and in others not much leſs. And in moſt Churches the Preachers voice will not extend to above two thouſand, if more can come in. So that take one with another, and it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that it is not above the ſeventh or eight part of the Inhabitants that can come to hear in the outer Pariſhes: And if the other ſix or ſeven parts ſhould ſeek for room in the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Churches of other Pariſhed within the walls, it cannot be ſuppoſed that above one part of theſe ſix or ſeven would find room: So that all ſet together, there is ſuppoſed to be place but for about the fifth, or fourth part at moſt, of all the people within and without the walls: And <hi>London</hi> is to be denominated rather from three, four or five parts, than from <hi>One</hi> of theſe: And we all agree, that the famouſeſt and happieſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for Religion in the world ſhould not be left to turn Infidels, Pagans, Atheiſts, or to be kept from all publick Worſhip of God. And it muſt be conſidered that the great Pariſhes where one of twenty cannot hear, are far off from the Churches that have room; and that ſuch perſons cannot eaſily know before-hand what Churches have room, and where to ſeek it: And that thoſe that have moſt need, have leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and when they cannot be taught near home, will rather ſtay at home, or in the ſtreets, or Ale houſes, than go far to ſeek room in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys of other Churches. And it's known that by this means Papiſts have got opportunity of ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62986:123"/>
multitudes, and many get them to baptize their children. And whereas it is ſaid that ſome may go one day, and ſome another; it is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1. That if they did go half the families by turns, ſtill the greater part would be ſhut out. 2. It is all, that are bound by God conſtantly to hear and worſhip him. 3. And thoſe that moſt value it will ſtill croud in, and keep out the reſt, and will not bargain away their own duties and benefits for other mens ſakes: Nor can Pariſhes come to agree upon ſuch a bargain.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Experience aſſureth us that men are not uſually brought to knowledge, repentance, faith and holineſs, by the Goſpel <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> or as by a charm; but as an apt morall cauſe; And that the Preaching of judicious, convincing, ſerious, affectionate Miniſters hath incomparably more ſucceſs, than the affected language, or dull reading ſpeeches of injudicious novices or wordly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliſts or hypocrites: God uſually worketh according to the morall aptitude of the means (though not alwaies.)</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It cannot be denyed but that the number of raw cold, dry, yea and ſcand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="8">VIII. He that hath no Preacher but a Reader in his pariſh, is by the Church Laws forbidden to refuſe his Miniſtry, and all ſuch are forbidden frequent going to other pariſhes, communicating in them: what want ſoever they have at home.</p>

IX. The Nonconformiſts that do but affirm any thing in the Liturgy, Ceremonies, Articles, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp;c. to be unlawful, and ſuch as they may not ſubſcribe to, are by the Church Laws excommunicate <hi>ipſo facto:</hi> And all that dare not take the Sacrament kneeling, are to be denyed the Communion of the Church; And all that dare not ſubmit their Children to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by the foredeſcribed undertaking of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and to receive the Croſs as a dedicating badg of Chriſtianity, muſt not have their Children Chriſtened; And all that dare not commit their ſouls to the <hi>Paſtoral Guidance of ignorant readers,</hi> or other men whom they think by their <hi>unskilfulneſs, unſoundneſs, averſneſs to a holy life, ſtrangers to intimate caſes of conſcience,</hi> or notorious <hi>negligence and ſloth, or non-reſidence,</hi> to be unmeet for them to truſt themſelves to, in ſo great a matter, in which their ſalvation is ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and ſo dare not take the Sacrament from ſuch as their Paſtors, all theſe are forbidden Communion with any other Pariſh Churches by the Canon, and all Miniſters forbidden to receive them. And if they dare not ſay that they <hi>are willing to be co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="10">X. In this caſe the Nonconformiſts are not agreed what to do: One part and the far greateſt ſay, 1. We will forbear affirming the unlawfulneſs of any of the foreſaid impoſitions, till we are called to ſpeak out: And becauſe the caſe of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62986:124"/>
theſe times calls us often to it, we will do it as privately and modeſtly as we can: 2. And though we are <hi>excommunicated ipſo facto,</hi> yet we are not <hi>bound</hi> our ſelves to execute their ſentence; but may ſtay in Communion till they prove the fact and do the execution on us themſelves by refuſing us: And this we take to be the moſt peaceable way: But others ſay, That though in ſome caſes for peace this way may be taken, yet ordinarily we are not bound to ſeek and expect Communion with that Church which hath already thus excommunicated us; eſpecially when all the Miniſtry ſubſcribe and declare their Conformity to the Church orders, and ſwear Canonical obedience to the Ordinaries, and are themſelves to be ſuſpended if they give us the Communion: We muſt not, ſay they, ſtrive againſt their Laws, nor ſeek that Miniſters ſhould be perjured, falſe to their promiſes and profeſſions to admit us to Communion againſt their Laws: Nor can any Church that firſt excommunicateth us, call us Schiſmaticks for not communicating with them, unleſs they prove that we give them juſt cauſe to excommunicate us. Here it is ſuppoſed that the Reader underſtandeth that <hi>[to be excommunicated ipſo facto,] is ſine ſententia,</hi> without any need of a Judges ſentence, <hi>to be actually excommunicate upon our fact done,</hi> ſo that the bare proof and notice of the <hi>fact is</hi> enough to warrant the execution (Though a Judge <hi>may</hi> alſo paſs a <hi>ſentence</hi> if he ſee cauſe,) <hi>vid.

There are ſome others that go further, and think it unlawful to have Communion with the Pariſh Churches, becauſe they thus excommunicate us firſt, without more

cauſe, and becauſe they take the Paſtors to be ſcandalous by the foreſaid Oaths, Declarations and ſubſcriptions, and thoſe that have not the peoples conſent, to be no true Paſtors. But theſe are herein diſowned by the moſt; and very few Miniſters are of their mind that we know of, though many of the people much incline to it; eſpecially they that live where the Prieſts are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, ſcandalous, ſlothful, or malignant; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nyes</hi> Manuſcript to that end may tell us their minds) that it is lawful to hear the publick Pariſh Miniſters, becauſe the Magiſtrate may ſet Teachers over the People, and require them to hear them: Though they hold that the People ſhould chooſe their Paſtors, and that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould be adminiſtred and received freely, and not by force. Yea ſuch Anabaptiſts as Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> (as is viſible in his Book) hold that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Pariſh-Church is lawful, in the Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Prayer, and Lords Supper.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. We commonly hold that men unjaſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, are not thereby diſobliged from publick worſhiping of God, and living under Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral overſight and Church diſcipline, nor are bound to endanger their own ſalvation by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting ſuch duties, and loſing ſuch helps and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges; and therefore muſt be of ſuch Churches as they can, if they cannot be of ſuch as they
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62986:125"/>
would, or as are allowed by the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. It is not in the power of our ſelves to eſcape ſuch excommunications: For we are not able to change our own underſtandings, ſo far as to hold every thing before named, to be lawful: Some of us are able to ſay that we have with a willingneſs to ſee the truth, ſtudied the caſe of the old Conformity above forty years, and the caſe of the New-conformity now above ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, and read almoſt all that hath been written for them, which we thought might add to our information, and prayed earneſtly that God would not ſuffer us to erre; and the longer we ſtudy it, the more we are confirmed: In this caſe we ſuffer publick and private obloquy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and not only theſe ſeventeen years the loſs of all Miniſterial Maintenance, but the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of 40 <hi>l.</hi> a Sermon, and impriſonment in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gaols, and the ruine of our eſtates and health: And in reaſon its as eaſie to think that they that hold their opinion on ſuch terms, are like to be as impartial in their ſtudies, as they whoſe way leadeth to preferment, wealth and honour; of which we were capable of a part: We ſay therefore again, that to <hi>Conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="14">XIV. When the 1800 or 2000 Miniſters were ſilenced, the far greateſt part of them forbore all publick Preaching, and only taught ſome few in private at ſuch hours as hindered not the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies, and many of them lived as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:62986:126"/>
XV. To this day it is ſo with many of the Nonconformiſts: Thoſe that live where they find ſmall need of their Preaching, or elſe have no call or opportunity, and cannot remove their dwellings, do hold no Aſſemblies, but as other men content themſelves to be Auditors. Thoſe that live where are godly and peaceable Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in Publick, who yet need help, do lead the people conſtantly to the Pariſh-Churches, and teach them themſelves at other hours, and help them from houſe to houſe: This is ordinary in the Countries, and even in <hi>London,</hi> with many Miniſters that hold no Aſſemblies; yea many that were ejected out of City Pariſh-Churches.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. Thoſe called Independents do keep up ſuch Churches as they had gathered before; when none of our preſent oaths, declarations, ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or practices were impoſed on them; which is not therefore to be taken as new.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. As to the reſt, it was the great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Plague in 1665. which made this change in their Aſſembling and Miniſtration. When the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſters forſook the City, and the rich left the poor to miſery and death, and people lookt every day for their laſt; when they that heard a Sermon one day, were buried the next; when death had awakened the people to Repentance, and a regard of their everlaſting ſtate, divers Nonconformable Miniſters reſolved to ſtay with them; They begg'd money out of the Countries for the poor, and relieved them: They got into the empty Pulpits, and preached to them: And when Preachers and Hearers lookt every day for their laſt, it is eaſie to conceive that there was ſerious Preaching, and ſerious Hearing: By this
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62986:126"/>
many that died were helpt in their preparations; and through God's great mercies, multitudes that ſurvived, repented and became the ſerious ſeekers of a better world. The men that did this were moſtly unmarried, and could eaſilier ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their own lives, than ſuch as had families; and ſome of them that had families, yet truſted God, and moſt did ſcape. We know but of one (pious <hi>Germane</hi> Miniſter that died of the Plague in the City (and one of another Diſeaſe, if not through want) and two that fled from it in the Country.) And when God had bleſt theſe mens faithful labours with the converſion of many ſouls (eſpecially Apprentices and young people,) the experience ſo engaged their mutual affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the Miniſters reſolved that they would live and die in ſuch ſervice as God had ſo bleſſed and preſerved them in; and their hearers reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that they would not forſake their Teachers: And thus the dreadful Plague began that which ſo much now offendeth men, as a dangerous Schiſm.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. And when ſome men out of exceſſive caution, were ready to think that when that Plague was ceaſed (having killed about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand) the Miniſters ſhould lay by that publick work, and retire again into ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, God confuted them by his next dreadful judgement, burning down the City the next year, 1666: So that there were neither Churches to go to, nor Miniſters in the Pariſhes to Preach, nor rich men to maintain them: And could any ſoul that hated not Chriſt and mens ſalvation, have wiſhed the Nonconformiſts then to deſert the miſerable people. When they newly came
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62986:127"/>
from under the terrour of ſuch a dreadful Plague, and when ſucceſs and Gods protection had ſo greatly encouraged them, and when preſently they were deprived of their worldly treaſure, and had not houſes, or goods, or mony, but thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands utterly ruined in the world, and crept into holes and lived in poverty, when it was a wonder that they dyed not by hundreds of famine, and when ſuch a ſight as <hi>London</hi> in its ruines was before mens eyes, (which he that ſaw ſure can never forget,) If then men, becauſe that the Biſhops or Parliament forbad them, ſhould have refuſed to Preach the Goſpel of Chriſt, and to teach men to lay up a treaſure in Heaven, and to comfort ſuch a ruined City, what excuſe would ſuch unfaithfull ſervants have had at the bar of their great Judge?</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. Theſe two great and notorious neceſſities ſucceeding in thoſe two dreadful years 1665 1666. calling the Nonconformable Miniſters out of their retirements, and latitant and ſilent ſtate, reſolved them to ſerve God more diligently and openly than they had done, whatever it coſt them: And many Country Miniſters were awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the like by the examples of thoſe in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> Though yet a great number who are in places of leſs need, or not called out as aforeſaid, ſtill lie much ſilent.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. <hi>WHILE THE DREADFUL FIRE WAS WASTING LONDON and OTHER CORPORATIONS, THE PARLIAMENT and BISHOPS WERE AT OXFORD MAKING AN OATH TO DRIVE ALL NONCONFORMISTS ABOVE FIVE MILES FROM ALL CITIES and CORPORATIONS</hi> that ſend Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62986:127"/>
to Parliament, and all other places where ever they had Preached ſince the act of oblivion. So that, had they obeyed the Laws, <hi>London</hi> had been deſerted in the Plague and in the ruines, and few people ſuffered publickly to worſhip God: At the mention of which the heart of the writer of this trembleth; eſpecially to think how much further the Biſhops went in this then the Synod of <hi>Ithacius</hi> and <hi>Idacius</hi> went, from which <hi>Martin</hi> ſeparated to the death by Gods miraculous inſtruction.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. The Plague, Fire, Poverty, which have ſeized not only on <hi>London,</hi> but on many other Corporations of <hi>England,</hi> more than other places, and more than hath been known in our forefathers daies, make many wiſh that the Corporation-Oath and Declaration might be reviewed and that Gods Judgments as a T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="22">XXII. A little after the Plague and Fire, ſome Nonconformable Miniſters about <hi>London,</hi> met, to conſider whether our actuall forbearance to joyn with the Pariſh Churches in the Sacrament, might not tend to deceive men and make them believe that we were for ſeparation from them, and took their Communion to be unlawful: And upon the Reaſons given in, they agreed that ſuch Communion was lawful and meet, when it would not do more harm than good: But becauſe at that time a ſtorm was coming on men, from the Act againſt Conventicles, and their judgment was againſt ruining thoſe that in this were not of their minds (on the reaſons aforeſaid) and being
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:62986:128"/>
credibly informed that their communicating at ſuch an unſeaſonable time would not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men that force compelled them, but alſo draw them to ruine others that durſt not imitate them, they reſolved to delay for a fitter oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, becauſe God will have mercy and not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and our <hi>Liberty</hi> is not alwaies our <hi>Duty,</hi> nor muſt be uſed to other mens deſtruction. Thus violence croſſeth the Authors ends.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. Shortly after, when ſuch thoughts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and many thought it meet to joyn in the publick Aſſemblies, the <hi>Oxford</hi> Oath and Act of Confinement was put in execution, and drove them all away: For the reaſons aforeſaid had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied them not to deſert the ſouls in all Cities, Corporations and places where they had Preached; and ſo they were fain to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to avoid ſix months impriſonment in the common Gaols (whither ſome of us were ſent;) ſo that if they had come to the Pariſh-Churches, to Common-prayer or Sacraments, they had expoſed themſelves to multitudes of witneſſes, and ſo to certain impriſonment: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in ſome odd corners of the Country where they were ſtrangers (about five miles from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations or acquaintance) where their example would have wrought little on any in the Cities, or that had known them: So that the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act moſt effectually forbad them coming to Church, or holding Communion with any Pariſh-Churches within five miles of any ſuch City, Corporation or Village where they had Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince the Act of Oblivion: This they could not avoid.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. Yet many Miniſters were afraid of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:62986:129"/>
unwarrantable ſeparations, by avoiding the ſeverities of the Law and Biſhops; and many that did retire to Country-Villages five miles diſtant, as confined, did there conſtantly joyn with the Pariſh-Churches in Liturgy and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But this being far from Cities, and not in the ſight of the people that were moſt diſaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Prelates and Liturgy, did little with them; and ſo they were diſabled by the Biſhops or Rulers to do what they deſired againſt other mens extreams.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. Before this, many Miniſters had offered thankfully to accept the Liberty of Preaching in the Pariſh Churches where the Liturgy is uſed, and being preſent at it: And ſome to this day that live in the Country, where they can get ſo much favour, preach in the Pariſh-Churches, and joyn in the Liturgy, and draw others to it, and go from place to place thus to avoid being taken.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. Many, ſeeing how we were thus driven not only from <hi>Preaching,</hi> but ſuch <hi>Pariſh-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> were tempted to hard thoughts of ſuch affairs, as if it came from the Papiſts, who would have equalled, and maſs'd us up with themſelves.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. Shortly after this, the Kings Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſaw cauſe to make an alteration and to give us his gracious indulgence by his Licenſes for places and perſons; Upon this, Miniſters boldly ſet up Chappels under the Pariſh Churches; and in all the time of this their Liberty, when there were witneſſes enough, if they had offended, we remember not that any were ever convict of any word of ſeditious or unſound doctrine, or any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable attempts. But while they had this leave to Preach themſelves, they thought beſt to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62986:129"/>
take it at the ſame convenient hours that the Pariſh Churches meet at: Other times being ſo inconvenient, as that families cannot obſerve them without hurt. And they could not <hi>Preach, and hear in the Pariſh-Churches</hi> at once.</p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. All this while, though they had the Kings authority for their Aſſemblies, ſome Clergy men ceaſed not to accuſe them of Schiſm; ſhewing that it is the want of ſomething elſe rather than the Kings authority on which they ground their accuſation.</p>
            <p n="29">XXIX. Some Nonconformiſts have theſe 17 years forborn to baptize or adminiſter the Lords Supper, or to be Paſtors of any Churches, but only Preached occaſionally where the Pariſhes were ſo great, that one of ten or twenty had no room in the Church; and where ſome of many years had heard no publick worſhip of God: And they have publiſhed to the people that they aſſembled them not to ſeparate from the Pariſh Churches or their worſhip, but for their meer neceſſity, perſwading none to come to hear them, but ſuch as cannot come into the Pariſh Churches to hear: Yet are they accuſed for drawing men from the Church.</p>
            <p n="30">XXX. Theſe Miniſters in theſe places have been proſecuted more ſeverely than the reſt, by impriſonments, fines and guards againſt their meetings; which induced others to Preach in the City where there ſeemed leſs need, becauſe they found quietneſs no where elſe, and becauſe ſome out of the remoter needy Pariſhes might come thither to them.</p>
            <p n="31">XXXI. Though they have loſt all Miniſterial maintenance, and are lyable to pay 20 <hi>l.</hi> the firſt Sermon, and 40 <hi>l.</hi> the reſt, and 20 <hi>l.</hi> for the ground
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:62986:130"/>
for all that they Preach, beſides ſix months impriſonment in the common goals, and poverty diſableth City and Countrey to maintain them; and ſome with Wives and Children have long lived on little beſides brown Rye Bread and Water; and others, that can live of their own, expend all in the charges of the places and adjuncts where they Preach for nothing; and ſome never took any pay, from the firſt theſe 17 years, but patiently ſerve God and waſt their ſtrength under mens obloquy and reproach; yet are there not wanting perſons of the Clergy, who repreſent their greateſt and deareſt ſervices as their greateſt ſins, and accuſe them as enemies of the Churches peace, and the leaders of Schiſm, and in pulpit and print provoke authority to execute the Laws more ſeverely on them; Though the execution hath coſt ſome excellent men their lives already, and they may know that no execution ſhort of death or utter diſable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will make the moſt conſcionable forſake their duty, and ſacrilegiouſly deſert the Office to which they were dedicated and ordained: (As the late caſe of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Miniſters declareth:) And ſuch courſes never ended in the honour of thoſe of the Clergy that procured them: Yea ſome as <hi>going to the bar of God, have undertaken to prove, that it is through pride and covetouſneſs that we conform not.</hi> And becauſe ſome Churches called Independent withdraw not their maintenance from their Paſtors, and ſome few others have maintenance of their own, or friends that will not ſee them want, they would make ſtrangers believe that the common ſort of Nonconformiſts, whoſe families live in ſufferings
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62986:130"/>
and wants, are gainers by their Nonconformity Though themſelves that have the moſt and richeſt on their ſide, would be loth to take up with ſuch maintenance, and often Preach, how ſad a caſe the Church would be in, if Miniſters were left to the peoples charity: While they live in fulneſs thus they envy their poor brethren, who that they may finiſh their courſe, would be glad of leave to labour for nothing, and live on alms, taking Gods favour for their reward.</p>
            <p n="32">XXXII. And to compleat all, ſome bluſh not to accuſe them, as the bringers in of Popery, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring Liberty; as if Preaching the Goſpel did not do more to keep out Popery, than the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of untaught people: As if our earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts eighteen years ago, that we might not be maſs'd up with the Papiſts, nor a door opened to them by our diviſions and ſufferings, were all forgotten: As if the Nonconformiſts were neerer Popery than they that would have the Pope to be <hi>Principium Unitatis</hi> to the Univerſal Church: As if their Printed Morning Lectures againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and many other Writings, did not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhew their diſtance from it: As if the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> deſired the <hi>Liberty,</hi> rather than the <hi>ſilencing</hi> of the Nonconformiſts; or deſired any thing more than that ſo many hundred adverſaries to Popery, and all the Proteſtants of <hi>England</hi> who adhere to them, might be caſt out, and brought as low as themſelves, and put into the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that they might ſtand or fall together. Nay, what if on ſuch neceſſity they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of favour from any Papiſts that would ſave them? If one Party would bring men to ſuch a paſs that they muſt be hanged, impriſoned,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:62986:131"/>
ruined, or worſe, unleſs the favour of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts deliver them; and the other Party had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſaved by Papiſts, than be hanged or ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Proteſtants, which of theſe were more to be ſuſpected of Popery? eſpecially if the ſame men that give us the Alarm that Popery is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, undertook the ſole teaching of thoſe by whom they ſuſpect its entrance, and yet would not abate a needleſs Oath, or covenant or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to keep it out, or ſtrengthen the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants by the Union, for which we have ſo long patiently begg'd and waited.</p>
            <p n="33">XXXIII. The moſt of our acquaintance take it for their duty to do their beſt to keep up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the publick Conformable Miniſtry, that it may further Love and Concord, and the ſucceſs of their labours with the people; and they profeſs to take their own Aſſemblies but as Chapels, and not as <hi>diſtinct,</hi> much leſs as ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Churches: And thoſe of them who do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacraments, and do that which is like the Separatiſts way, yet do it nor on their principles, but <hi>pro tempore,</hi> till God ſhall give them opportunity to ſerve him in the eſtabliſhed way (if ever it may be hoped for:) it being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed or well ordered Pariſh-Churches under the Government and countenance of the Chriſtian Magiſtrates, which are moſt agreeable to their deſires.</p>
            <p n="34">XXXIV. When we go into the Pariſh-Churches, we find thoſe that have able godly Miniſters uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be as full as will conſiſt with the peoples hearing the voice (which in many places will not reach to a great part of the Congregation:) we find ſuch Preachers, whether Conformable, or
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:62986:131"/>
Nonconformable, every where almoſt crouded after; which ſhews that it is not meer faction that moveth the hearers; and that worthy men have no cauſe of diſcouragement: And if none of either ſide be valued much above their worth (for the bare <hi>Office</hi> ſake) we cannot help it; nor would it be helped if there were no Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts: Some of us well remembring the time (1632. till 1640.) when we were troubled or threatned alſo for going out of our own Pariſhes to hear worthy, able men that were very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable.</p>
            <p n="35">XXXV. It is very ordinary with Gentlemen and others that are zealous for the preſent Church State in <hi>London,</hi> to go from their own Pariſhes, though the Canon be againſt it: ſo that it is not, ſure, the breach of the Canon that they ſtick at.</p>
            <p n="36">XXXVI. We ſhall never diſſwade men from making the ſtricteſt Laws to puniſh any Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt that ſhall be proved guilty of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Diſloyalty, Drunkenneſs, Fornication, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and any other immorality; but we know of none of them that was ſilenced, ejected, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed on any ſuch account: Nay, if they Preach againſt their Church Government, Liturgy, or Ceremonies, we muſt expect that they ſhould be reſtrained. Our earneſt deſire is, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate would keep up Peace and Order in the Church, that Popiſh Clergy men may not think that it belongeth to them alone to do it.</p>
            <p n="37">XXXVII. Whereas there is a ſort of ignorant or ill meaning men, that ſtill ſay <hi>[we know not what the Nonconformiſts would have, and why will they not tell us what would ſatisfie them,]</hi> While

we offer to beg on our Knees for leave to do it; we humbly intreat them to weary men awake no more with that canting. 1. As long as the Kings Declaration about Eccleſiaſtical affairs is viſible. 2.

And as long as men know that Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burton</hi> appointed by the Lord Keeper Bridgman to treat with ſome of us of the terms of <hi>Union,</hi> (ſaying it was His Majeſties Pleaſure,) did come to a full agreement with us in <hi>terminis,</hi> which was drawn up into the form of an Act by no worſe a man than that PILLAR OF JUSTICE the excellent Judge <hi>Hale,</hi> and the Parliament preſently Voted that no ſuch Act ſhould be brought in and offered. Dear Brethren, God is the father of Lights and with him is no darkneſs: Men may be mocked, but God is not mocked: If the day that will bring works of darkneſs to light, and finally clear the Innocent, be not the object of certain faith and hope, let our cauſe be bad, and let us as fools be judged ſuch as have forſaken our beſt hopes: But that it is otherwiſe we believe, and therefore appeal to a righteous God from an unrighteous world.</p>

XXXVIII. What harm our Preaching the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of ſalvation can do to the Biſhops or people of the Land (while they may puniſh us for any word that we ſpeak amiſs:) And why we ſhould not rather ſpeak <hi>openly</hi> (where men may bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our errours,) than in ſecret (where men are tempted to too much boldneſs:) And what but a ſpirit of envy, or a carnal intereſt croſs to the intereſt of Chriſt and mens ſalvation, ſhould grudge at ſuch Preaching, while we are reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all that we ſay or do amiſs, we cannot tell.</p>
            <p n="32">XXXIX.

         <div type="additions">
            <head>Additions: more particularly of National Churches.</head>
            <p>§1. THere are ſome worthy perſons who plead more ſpecially for <hi>National Churches</hi> as of Divine Inſtitution, whoſe Doctrine calls us to a ſpecial conſideration of it. But though ſome of us have oft deſired it, we have not hitherto obtained any ſatisfaction what they mean by <hi>A National Church,</hi> or any true defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they agree in: Some of them deride us for doubting and asking the queſtion, and ſome anſwer it to the increaſe of our doubt.</p>
            <p>§2. It muſt be preſuppoſed that we ſpeak not of a meer Community that hath no Paſtors, but ſtrictly of a Society called by ſome Political, by
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:62986:133"/>
others <hi>Organized,</hi> conſtituted of Paſtors and People mutually related; which is the ordinary ſenſe of the word <hi>[Church.]</hi> And we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe what being commonly agreed on, is none of our doubt or queſtion.</p>
            <p>§3. The queſtion is not whether any, or all Nations and Kingdoms ſhould be Chriſtians, and ſo be the Kingdoms of Chriſt: That's paſt doubt. 2. Nor is it whether in ſuch Kingdoms the King be the Head, as to the power of the ſword; that is, a Chriſtian Civil Governour of a Chriſtian People that are his Subjects. We daily pray that the Kingdoms of the world may all be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; and we believe that their Kings are the Governours by the ſword, of all the Clergy, as well as others. 3. Nor is the queſtion whether Kings may call all their Kingdoms into a holy Covenant with God (by lawful means) giving them an example firſt themſelves. 4. Nor do we contend about an Equivocal Name, whether a <hi>Chriſtian Kingdom,</hi> as ſuch, may be called a <hi>National Church.</hi> 5. No nor whether a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Nation,</hi> governed by a Heathen or Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan King, may be called a Chriſtian Church or Kingdom; or a Proteſtant Nation ruled by a Papiſt King, is to be called a Proteſtant Kingdom or Church: for this is but about bare <hi>names.</hi> 6. Nor do we queſtion whether a Chriſtian King may make ſuch accidental diſparity between the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, as we have before deſcribed. 7. Nor yet whether the Paſtors of one Kingdom may aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate and hold Synods for Unity and Counſel, and be named a <hi>National Church,</hi> as they are ſuch Aſſociations, obliged to Concord.</p>
            <p>§4. But our doubts are theſe; 1. Whether it
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62986:134"/>
be in it ſelf ſpecially inſtituted by God, that every Kingdom or Nation of Chriſtians ſhall have <hi>[One ſummam Poteſtatem eſſentialiter Eccleſiaſticam,</hi> or one <hi>Prieſt-Head,</hi> (whether a <hi>ſingle perſon,</hi> or an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> or a <hi>Common Synod)</hi> as a conſtitutive part of the National Church. 2. Whether this <hi>Prieſt-Head</hi> (whether High-Prieſt, or Council,) ſtand in ſubordination to the King, as part of the ſame formal Church, as a General, or a Vicerov, that maketh not a diſtinct Kingdom, (though he may make a diſtinct ſubordinate Society as an Army, City, &amp;c) or is he Head of a coordinate different ſpecies, ſo as that the ſame Kingdom ſhall be two Policies formally, <hi>viz.</hi> a Chriſtian Kingdom or Royal Church, and a Prieſtly Church; each being ſupream in their proper ſpecies, and both made coordinate by Chriſt; and ſo they are formally two Churches National. About the Jews the Controverſie is made by Diſſenters <hi>(e. g. Galaſpie, Coleman, Selden,</hi> &amp;c.) exceeding difficult. 3. Whether the very Jewiſh Church Policy be eſtabliſhed by Chriſt for the Chriſtian Church, or be repealed? 4 Whether the ſaid Eccleſiaſtical Head muſt be <hi>One</hi> as the High Prieſt, or an Ariſtocracy of many, or a Synod of the whole Clergy? or whether it be left indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent which? 5. Or whether God hath ordained ſuch a National Church-form, only by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Command of doing all things in Order and Unity and to Edification? 6. Which is the Prieſtly-Head, or higheſt Governour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is a conſtitutive part, as a King in a Kingdom? 7. Who is it that chooſeth or authorizeth the National Prieſtly Head, that we may know when we have a lawful Chief Paſtor,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62986:134"/>
and when an Uſurper? 8. Whether the King or he, is to be obeyed in Circumſtances, or matters Eccleſiaſtical, if they differ, and make contrary Laws? Without the ſolution of theſe queſtions, the <hi>name</hi> of a <hi>National Church</hi> will not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, nor of any practical importance. Our own thoughts of them are as followeth.</p>
            <p>§ 5. It is certain, that the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law made for the Jews peculiar republick, as ſuch, is abrogate; not only the Ceremonial part, but all: All that was not then made for all the world, is ceaſed; 1. Becauſe the Common-wealth is ceaſed for which it was made: 2. The Holy Ghoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly and frequently determineth it ſo; even of that Law that was written in ſtone, as ſuch, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. 19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 21, <hi>&amp; o.</hi> 3. 24. The natural part, and that which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted poſitively long before for perpetuity, were both of them God's Laws before <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, and as ſuch, obliged other Nations, and ſo do ſtill: The matter written in ſtone (except ſome few mutable particulars, as the ſeventh day Sabbath, &amp;c.) is ſuch as we are ſtill obliged to, 1. By Nature, 2. By Chriſt: But not as it was part of the <hi>Jews peculiar Moſaical Law.</hi> Much leſs doth it bind all the world to its Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</p>
            <p>§ 6. If the Jewiſh Law, either as ſuch, or as ſtabliſhed by Chriſt for his Kingdom, did bind all the world to this day, then it would bind them to their Civil Policy, as much at leaſt as to their Eccleſiaſtical. But few Chriſtians think that it binds them to their Civil Policy. For if it did, then, 1. All Nations that have varied from it to this day, have ſinned: 2. No diverſity of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:62986:135"/>
Governments could be lawful: 3. Then it would perplex men, to be ſure, whether it be the old <hi>Moſaical</hi> form by Judges, or the later Regal form that bindeth: 4. Then ſuch a Civil Council or Sanhedrim as was appointed the Jews, would be a Divine Eſtabliſhment, and not variable at the will of Kings or People. Many other things would follow, which Kings would not eaſily believe.</p>
            <p>§ 7. There may be much more ſaid for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Jews civil Policy than for their Eccleſiaſtical: For there is much more <hi>forbidden</hi> of the latter, than of the former; Though all nations be not bound to their civil policie, they may ſet it up if they pleaſe; They are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited: For Chriſt hath not made new Laws for civil ſtates as ſuch; But he hath made new <hi>Church Laws,</hi> and thereby altered, yea prohibited much of the old.</p>
            <p>§ 8. We know no more reaſon why the Jewiſh form ſhould bind us, than that which was before the Jews: and particularily <hi>Melchezedeks,</hi> who was a <hi>King and Prieſt:</hi> God owned both and commandeth us neither, at leaſt as in conformity to them.</p>
            <p>§ 9. The Holy Ghoſt ſaith expreſly <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 11. 12. That perfection was not by the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prieſthood, and that the <hi>Prieſthood being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, there is made of neceſſity a change of the Law,</hi> which is called, <hi>the Law of a carnal Cammand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, verſe</hi> 16. <hi>and that there is a diſanulling of the Commandement going before for the weakneſs and unprofitableneſs of it; for the Law made nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, v.</hi> 18, 19. the Covenant or Law being not fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a new one doth ſucceed it <hi>v.</hi> 7. 8. 9. 10. The firſt Tabernacle is not ſtanding which had their
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:62986:135"/>
ordinances of divine ſervice and a worldly ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary: <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 1. 8. 11. He taketh away the firſt Law and Prieſthood, that he may eſtabliſh the ſecond, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 8, 9 11. 16. 17, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>§ 10. Whileſt it is agreed on, that the eſſentials of the work or office of the Jewiſh Prieſts is ceaſed, (as <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. and 8, 9, and 10 ſhew,) and their Title by birth, and the appropriation to one Tribe, &amp;c. it followeth that the Jewiſh Prieſthood is ceaſed. But yet we confeſs that Chriſt, if he had pleaſed, <hi>might have ſetled</hi> a High Prieſt and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil like theirs in every nation for his own work. But if the old form bind us not, we are left only to enquire what new one is ſetled by Chriſt, and whether he have done ſo or not.</p>
            <p>§ 11. We juſtly maintain againſt the Anabaptiſts, that Infants relation to the Covenant, and the univerſal Church (as members) was not repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Chriſt, becauſe it was not founded only on the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> which if it had, it were as ſuch repealed</p>
            <p>§ 12. The Holy Ghoſt by the Apoſtles <hi>Acts</hi> 15. hath declared to all the Churches of the Gentiles that they are not bound to keep the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and hath abſolved us from all, ſaving things antecedently, and on other reaſons neceſſary. <hi>verſe.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>§ 13 If the Jews form of Government be ours, then the High-Prieſt muſt have the power of the Sword, or ſit in judgment for life or death, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 12, 13. and other places ſhew: But many Papiſts and Proteſtants are agreed that the clergy have no power of the Sword, or force, unleſs the King make them alſo Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>§ 14. It is a matter of ſo great importance to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:62986:136"/>
the Church to know whom we muſt obey, that it is not to be thought that any way is made neceſſary by Chriſt, which he hath not made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible and certain to be indeed his will: Eſpecially when the Apoſtles ſtrove who ſhould be the chief, and two of them made it their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and when the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and others were ready to ſet up one before another, and ſay I am of <hi>Cephas,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>§ 15. Yea Chriſt on this occaſion expreſly forbad them to ſeek to be one above another, and told them that though Kings exerciſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and have magnifying Titles, with them it ſhould not be ſo, but their preeminence ſhould conſiſt, as that of a ſervant, in humility and ſervice unto others <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. which will not ſtand (as we ſuppoſe) with eſtabliſhing the Jewiſh order.</p>
            <p>§ 16. And <hi>Pauls</hi> reproof of their making a Church head of <hi>Cephas, Paul, or Apollo,</hi> or taking them to be other than <hi>helps</hi> of their faith, (and not Lords of it) and Miniſters by whom they believed, even then when Schiſms made it neceſſary to have known to whom they muſt appeal and adhere, if that had been the way, doth further confirm what we ſay.</p>
            <p>§ 17. The argument that ſome worthy perſons bring, from the Propheſies that Nations ſhould be converted unto Chriſt; and that the Kingdom ſhould be taken from the Jews, and given to a Nation that would bring forth the fruits of it <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 43. and that the Kingdomes of the world are made the Kingdoms of Chriſt, and that <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ſhould be converted and equalled with the Jews, &amp;c. do ineeed ſhew that there ſhould be Chriſtian Kings and Kingdoms;
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:62986:136"/>
which the Apoſtles were ſent to endeavour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. to <hi>convert Nations:</hi> But here is nothing, that we can perceive, to prove that theſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Nations muſt have the Jewiſh Church Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</p>
            <p>§ 18. Nay contrary, the Church is ſaid to be built on the foundation of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. and not of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Policy of Prieſthood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 14. It hath twelve founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>§ 19. It is ſaid, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 11. Many Nations ſhall be joyned to the Lord, and ſhall be my people. So <hi>Zech.</hi> 8. 22. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 20. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 2. &amp; 55. 5. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 3. &amp; 49. 22. But not a word in all this, of the old form of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy or Prieſthood, but Contrarily, that the <hi>Law ſhould come out of Zion, and a new Covenant ſhould be made:</hi> And it is certain that ſo large a hiſtory as we have of Chriſt's performances, is a far clearer light than obſcure Prophecies; and darker texts muſt be explained by the plainer, and not contrarily.</p>
            <p>§ 20. We ſee not how the Synod <hi>Act.</hi> 15. maketh any thing for a National High Prieſt or Sanedrim, or any like Policy: For 1. It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be no act of proper <hi>National Government,</hi> but did bind other Churches as well as thoſe within the Empire. 2. It was an arbitration at the requeſt of doubting perſons; and it was not the Relation of the Arbitrators to one ſeat of National Power (as the Metropolis) that was reſpected, but the <hi>quality of the perſons ſent to,</hi> who would have been equally obeyed had they dwelt in the leaſt Village of another Land. 1. There were the Apoſtles that had the promiſe
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:62986:137"/>
of the Holy Ghoſt: 2. There were <hi>many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whom the people muſt needs more confide in than in one; eſpecially whoſe power was queſtioned by gainſayers. 3. Both Apoſtles, Elders and Brethren there were ſuch as had ſeen, or were neer to Chriſt and his works, and therefore likelieſt to know his mind. 4. They were Jews themſelves, and therefore moſt impartial Judges in the point that Jewiſh Teachers troubled them about, ſo far as that they might well acquieſce when Jews themſelves reſolved them. And when the Apoſtles were diſperſed, we find not any more <hi>Jeruſalem-</hi>Councils Governing the Imperial Churches.</p>
            <p>§ 21. If that Councils Authority were proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>National,</hi> and aroſe from the prerogative of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then 1. All the Apoſtles, when ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would have been ſubject to <hi>James,</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (thought to be no Apoſtle:) 2. Then <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might have after claimed the Supremacy as of Divine right, before <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, Antioch</hi> or <hi>Rome.</hi> But it is certain by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that the whole Church was of another mind, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had not ſo much as the fifth or loweſt Patriarchate, till long after by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother grant. But if the Power was not fixed to the place, but the Itinerant Apoſtles, then it is nothing to prove any Governing Church over others, as being affixed to ſuch a place: Nor ſhall we eaſily find the Apoſtles Itinerant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours in that power.</p>
            <p>§ 22. II. It is certain that Chriſt choſe twelve Apoſtles (beſides <hi>Paul)</hi> who had a preeminence before other Miniſters; and that he joyned with them ſome Prophets and Evangeliſts, appointing them all to gather Churches through the world,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:62986:137"/>
diſcipling and baptizing Nations, and teaching them all things that he commanded (a work to be ſtill done, and to which he promiſed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to the end of the world:) And that theſe having gathered Converts, ſet over them fixed Biſhops (or Paſtors or Elders) to be their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Guides,</hi> in <hi>Teaching, Publick Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> under Chriſt the great Prophet, Prieſt and King of the Church. And that to the Apoſtles firſt, and by them to others, he gave them the Keys (that is, the Judging Power of reception, and rejection, and the Official Power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing God's reception or rejection of them according to his Word.)</p>
            <p>§ 23. There is not the leaſt evidence that theſe Apoſtles did affix a Superiour Power over the other Churches to any particular ſeats, Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal or Metropolitan, much leſs National; or that any of them exerciſed Government over the reſt; or that they themſelves did fix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as Biſhops to any twelve or thirteen Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the world; much leſs to twelve King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
            <p>§ 24. There is no notice in Church hiſtory of any one National Church-power (Prieſt or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod) ſetled, aſſerted or exerciſed under Heaven, of above three hundred years. <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> that were propheſied to be Chriſtian Nations, never were diſtinct Chriſtian Kingdoms, but parts of the Empire; nor had a National Church or Head (being but parts of ſuch a Church:) Nay, when <hi>Rome</hi> got the National Primacy, it had not ſuch a Prieſtly Governing Soveraignty as the Jews High-Prieſt had.</p>
            <p>§ 25. Though there was no Chriſtian King for
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:62986:138"/>
three hundred years (unleſs he of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> or <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> of whom we have little certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but it's like that both were ſubjects to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) yet if a Supream Church-Power had been neceſſary, the Apoſtles would have before erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; which they never did: For even <hi>Rome</hi> pretendeth to be by them made the Ruler of the whole world, and not a meer National Head (which <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> claimed, but not as of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical inſtitution.)</p>
            <p>§ 27. The queſtion whether the Jews, had they believed, ſhould have continued their High-Prieſt and Church Policy, is vain as to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; 1. It being certain to Chriſt that they would be diſſolved by unbelief: And 2. he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſetled another way, and changed theirs: 3. And if their Prieſthood and Law (except as it typified ſpiritual things) had ſtood, yet it would not have bound the Gentile Chriſtians in other Nations.</p>
            <p>§ 28. When Emperours became Chriſtians, they did not ſet up the Jewiſh Policy, nor thought themſelves bound to it; no nor any ſetled Prieſtly Supremacy for National Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For Councils were called but on rare accidents by the Emperours themſelves, and to decide particular caſes about Hereſies: And the Pope had but the firſt voice in ſuch Councils.</p>
            <p>§ 29. But if every Nation muſt have the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Policy, then the whole Empire muſt then have one High Prieſt, and then the Pope hath a fair pretence to his claim of a Divine Inſtitution, as the Church Soveraign of the whole Empire, which, it's like, was then ſeven parts in eight of the whole Chriſtian world at leaſt, (unleſs <hi>Abaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:62986:138"/>
were then generally Chriſtians, as now.) But then his power would change with the Empire, and fall when it falleth.</p>
            <p>§ 30. III. But if the queſtion be only <hi>whether</hi> a National Prieſtly Soveraignty be lawful? or whether God's general Rules (for <hi>Concord, Order, Edification)</hi> do bind the Churches prudentially to erect ſuch a form? To this they ſayas followeth. 1. We will firſt lay hold on certainties, and not prefer uncertainties before them. We are ſure that ſuch a power of Apoſtles and Paſtors as is before mentioned, was eſtabliſhed; and that the <hi>junior</hi> Paſtors were as Sons to the <hi>ſeniors,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by them: Whether the power of Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Governing Miniſters was by Apoſtolical Eſtabliſhment appropriated to men of a ſuperiour degree in the ſacred Miniſtry, ſeemeth to us ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dark. 2. We are paſt doubt that all particular Churches, by Apoſtolical order, had Biſhops; and that a Church was, as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, <hi>Plebs Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copo adunata,</hi> and as <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the Unity of every Church was notified by this, that to <hi>every Church there was one Altar and one Biſhop</hi> (at that time) and as <hi>Cyprian, Ubi Epiſcopus, ibi Eccleſia.</hi> 3. And we are ſatisfied, that every Presbyter is <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Gregis,</hi> whoever claim to be <hi>Epiſcopi Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum</hi> (which the <hi>Carthage</hi> Council in <hi>Cyprian</hi> renounced.) 4. And we are ſatisfied that no Church-ſuperiours have authority to deſtroy the particular Church form, Miniſtry, Doctrine, Worſhip or Diſcipline, which were ſetled by the Holy Ghoſt in the Apoſtles; And that the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and duties of theſe ſingle particular Churches, being plaineſt and ſureſt in Scripture, they muſt be continued whatever Canons or
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:62986:139"/>
Commands of any ſuperiour Prieſts ſhould be againſt them. 5. Nor can they force any man to ſin: 6. Nor have any Prieſts a forcing power, by the ſword or violence, but only the power of the Word and Keys, that is, of taking in, or putting out of the Church, where they have power, and binding men over, on juſt cauſe, to the judgment of God. The power that they have is from Chriſt, and for him, and not againſt him; and for the Churches ediſication, and not deſtruction; and what is pretended contrary to this, is none. They cannot diſpenſe with the Laws of God, but preach and execute them. 7. And theſe things being thus ſecured, though in our doubts we dare not ſwear or ſubſcribe that National, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal, Provincial, or Metropolitical Powers are of God's inſtitution; yet we reſolve to live in all Chriſtian peaceableneſs and ſubmiſſion, when ſuch are over us.</p>
            <p>§ 31. And we muſt profeſs that when we find how anciently and commonly <hi>one</hi> Presbyter in each Church was peculiarly called the Biſhop, without whom there was no (ordinary) ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and againſt whom in matters of his power none was to reſiſt, and alſo how generally the Churches in the Roman Empire conformed themſelves to an imitation of the civil power (as to their limits) in all the official part (being all ſubject to the Emperour, who ſet up no Eccleſiaſtical Peer,) we are not ſo ſingular or void of reverence to thoſe Churches, as not by ſuch notices to be much the more inclined to the aforeſaid ſubmiſſion and peaceableneſs under ſuch a power; nor are we ſo bold or raſh as to reproach it or condemn the Churches and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:62986:139"/>
excellent perſons that have practiſed it.</p>
            <p>§32. Nay we have already ſaid, that ſecuring the ſtate, worſhip, doctrine and true diſcipline of the inferiour particular (Pariſh) Churches, there are ſome of us that much incline to think that Archbiſhops, that is, Biſhops that have ſome overſight of many Churches with their Paſtors, are Lawful ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles in the ordinary part of their work. And ſuch of us have long ago ſaid, that the Epiſcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Waldenſes deſcribed by <hi>Commenius</hi> and <hi>Laſcitius,</hi> is moſt agreable to our judgment of any that we know excerciſed: Therefore that which we humbly offered for our concord in <hi>England</hi> at His Majeſties Reſtauration, was Archbiſhop <hi>Uſhers</hi> form of the Primitive Church Government, not attempting any dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the Power, wealth or honour of the Dioceſanes or Archbiſhops, but only a reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Presbyters to their proper Office<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and ſome tolerable diſcipline to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Pariſh Churches.</p>
            <p>§33. But we muſt ever much difference, ſo much of Church order and Government as God himſelf hath inſtituted, and is purely divine and unchangeable, from thoſe accidentals which men ordain though according to Gods general Rules: For theſe are often various and mutable, and are means to the former, and never to be uſed againſt them. And of theſe accidentals of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſay as they that ſay no ſuch form is fixed by God. Concord, order &amp; decency and edification are alwaies neceſſary, But oft times it may be indifferent whether concord, order and decency be expreſſed by this accidental way or that. And
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:62986:140"/>
that which is moſt congruous for order, decency, edification and concord in one Countrey, Church or time, may be incongruous in another. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the queſtion be but how far the giving one Biſhop or Paſtor power over others, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king diſparity of Cities in conformity to the ſtate, be prudently to be choſen; we only ſay, ſo that Gods eſtabliſhment be not violated, whatever we might think beſt, we preſume not herein to give Laws to the Lawgivers, nor to obtrude our Counſel uncalled, on our ſuperiours, much leſs ſeditiouſly to oppoſe their Lawful inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>§ 34. But to thoſe that think that Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid General Laws (of order, concord, edification) do make ſuch a policy ordinarily <hi>neceſſary</hi> in the Churches, as imitateth the Jews, or the civil form of Government, we humbly offer to their conſideration; 1. If ſo, then it would have been the matter of an Vniverſal Law, (with its due exceptions;) And then Chriſt the only Vniverſal Lawgiver would have made it: For if he have not made all <hi>neceſſary Vniverſal Laws,</hi> his Laws are imperfect; And then there ſhould be ſome other Vniverſal Lawgiver to ſupply that defect: But there is no other upon earth (whether Pope or Council,) 2. It is contrary to the <hi>nature of undetermined circumſtances</hi> to be alwaies the ſame, and ſo to be fit matter of ſuch Vniverſal or fixed Laws: The caſes will vary, and then ſo will the duty; 3. There will be great diverſity of the intereſt, and ingeny of the Judges of the caſe in ſeveral Countries and ages: And therefore though ſome think the ſaid imitation of the civil ſtate alwaies beſt, vet others will not.</p>
            <p>§ 35. But if ſuch a ſettlement were certainly
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:62986:140"/>
beſt, let it be remembred, 1. That the <hi>Jews</hi> had not under the chief High-Prieſt, one in every City or Tribe like Dioceſane Biſhops. 2. That their Synagogues had diſcipline within themſelves; ever where there was but a Village of ten per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, there was a Presbyter that had the power of judging offenders.</p>
            <p>§ 36. What man doth prudently ſet up, man may prudently alter as there is cauſe. <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi> earneſtly wiſheth that there were no difference of Place or ſeats among the Paſtors of the Church. And therefore he neither thought their Government of each other to be of Divine right, nor of prudential neceſſity or uſe: Elſe he would have been againſt it. And the whole Greek Church did, and ſtill doth take the ſeats of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence to be but of mans appointment, or elſe they would never have changed them, and ſet <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſo high as they did: And the Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> expreſly determineth, that <hi>Rome</hi> was by the fathers made the chief ſeat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the ſeat of the Emperour; which was mutable.</p>
            <p>§ 37. The Councils in thoſe daies were about Popes or Patriarchs, and could depoſe them: And yet it is moſt evident to any man conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately reading ſuch hiſtory, that all the Councils, called before Chriſtian Emperours gave them more power and conjoyned their authority, did meet only for acts of <hi>Agreement</hi> and not of <hi>Regiment</hi> over each other: Many ſuch ſynods are mentioned by <hi>Euſebius:</hi> And the Right Reverend Arch-biſhop Uſher declared his judgment ſo in general that <hi>Councils</hi> had but an <hi>agreeing power,</hi> and not a <hi>Regent power</hi> over the particular Biſhops.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:62986:141"/>
Yet theſe two things muſt be ſuppoſed, 1. That the Paſtors in a ſynod are ſtill Rectors of their ſlocks, and their Canons to them may be more authoritative than a ſingle Paſtors words: 2. That Gods Law bindeth us to keep love and concord, and the Agreements of Councils may determine of the matter in alterable points; and ſo even abſent and preſent Biſhops may, <hi>concordiae gratiâ,</hi> be obliged by Gods Law to keep ſuch canons as are made for concord, and ſo they may be the matter of our duty. But ſeeing the Church for 300 years, judged Councils to have no proper Governing power over particular Paſtors; and Biſhops, or Patriarchs ſingly had ever leſs power than Councils, it followeth that then a Churches Government of diſparity and ſupraordinate Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops like the civil, or like the <hi>Jews,</hi> was not then taken to be of divine right, nor then of any right at all.</p>
            <p>§ 38. And as to the doubt <hi>[whether it began after</hi> 300 <hi>years to be a prudential duty or at leaſt moſt deſirable]</hi> when we hear what is ſaid on both ſides we think it not eaſie to judge, either how much in ſuch a caſe Chriſt hath left to humane prudence, nor which way the ſcales of prudence herein will ordinarily turn. On one ſide it is ſaid 1. That it is abſurd that there ſhould be no appeals for injured perſons to a ſuperiour power; 2. And that the diſſenſions of the Church elſe will be remedileſs, and all will be broken into hereſies and ſects; 3. And that Apoſtolical men of a higher rank than meer Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters will elſe have no convenient opportunity to excerciſe their Governing power, if it be not tyed to fixed ſeats.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:62986:141"/>
§ 39. On the other ſide they plead; 1. That it is ſafer for the Church to have Religion in the power of <hi>many Biſhops</hi> or Paſtors, than that <hi>one High Prieſt</hi> or <hi>Patriarch</hi> ſhould have power to corrupt it, or ſilence the faithful preachers, or perſecute the people when ever he proveth a bad man: Yea they ſay it muſt be rare if he be not bad, ſeeing it is certain that the moſt proud and worldly men (which are the worſt) will be the moſt earneſt ſeekers of rich and honourable places; and he that ſeeketh will uſually find. 2. They ſay Chriſt directly forbad this to his Apoſtles <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. That which they ſtrove for was it that he forbad them: But that which they ſtrove for was who ſhould be the chief or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt (and not who ſhould tyrannize) 3. They ſay that all Church hiſtory aſſureth us that there have been more Schiſms and ſcandalous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions about the great ſuperiour Biſhopricks far, than any of the reſt: It is a doleful thing to read the hiſtory of the Churches of <hi>Alexandria, Antioch, Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Rome: Gregory Nazianzen</hi> giveth it as the reaſon, why the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention at <hi>Ceſarea</hi> was ſo lamentable, becauſe it was ſo high an Archbiſhoprick. The whole Chriſtian world hath been ſcandalized, torn and diſtracted by the ſtrife of Biſhops of and for the higheſt ſeats. Their famous General Councils which we juſtly honour for their function and that which they did well, were ſhamefully mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant: even the firſt and moſt honoured Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> was with great difficulty kept in Peace by the perſonal preſence, wiſdom and authority of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> preaching peace to the preachers of peace, burning their libels of mutual accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:62986:142"/>
&amp; ſilencing their contentious wranglings, and conſtreining them to accord. <hi>Nazianzens</hi> deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of the ignorance and inſolence, and naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Clergy, <hi>Orat</hi> 1. and of the ſhameful ſtate of the Biſhops, <hi>Orat.</hi> 32. muſt make the readers heart to grieve, The people he deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth as contentious at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> yet as <hi>endued with the Love of God, though their zeal wanted knowledge, pag,</hi> 528. But (the <hi>Courtiers,</hi> as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true to the <hi>Emperours he knew not, but for the greateſt part perfidious to God: And the Biſhops as fitting on adverſe thrones, and feeding adverſe oppoſite flocks, drawn by them into factions, like the clefts that Earthquakes make, and the peſtilent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes that infect all about, and diſtracting and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding all the world, ſeparating the Eaſt from the Weſt, by the noiſe, of meus et tuus, antiquus et novus; nobilior aut ignobilior; multitudine opulentior aut tenuior; raging like furious horſes in battel, and like madmen caſting duſt into the air, and under their heads fulfilling their own contentions and becoming the determiners of wicked ambition and magnificence, and unrighteouſneſs and abſurd Judges of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: The ſame men</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are to day of the ſame throne</hi> (or ſide) <hi>and judgement, as we are, if ſo our leaders and chief men carry them: To mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row if the wind do but turn, they are for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſeat, and judgement.

            <p>The very controverſie with its conſequence was lamentable when one Council of Biſhops at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had caſt out excellent <hi>Gregory;</hi> another neer caſt out: excellent <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> his free ſpeech and ſtrict life being not endured, and choſe an old uſeleſs man <hi>Arſacius; Atticus,</hi> and <hi>Siſinius</hi> that ſucceeded him being dead, the people did ſo diſlike all the clergy of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> that they would have one like <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> of a Monaſtery by <hi>Antioch; Neſtorius</hi> a man of ſtudy, retirement, a poor garb, a ſtrict life, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring publick contentions, and loving quietneſs, but of a pieviſh zeal againſt diſſenters called hereticks, as enemies to the Churches unity and peace; ſo that he preſently perſecuted many of them even the <hi>Novatians</hi> themſelves, and ſtirred up the Emperour to root them all out, and by Gods juſt judgement received ſuch meaſure as he had meaſured.

and that even worthy men in ſuch temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are frail, when a new Emperour <hi>Martian</hi> was on the other ſide, (the right;) when <hi>Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi> had profeſſed that he was neither for <hi>tranſmutation, diviſion, nor confuſion of Chriſts natures</hi> (and therefore was for <hi>diſtinction;)</hi> when the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Biſhops profeſſed their conſent with the Synod, only craying that they might not be put to Anathematize <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> till they had another Patriarch, but ſo long to delay; when they profeſſed that if they did, they were ſure to be killed when they came home, and falling on the Earth cryed to their brethren <hi>miſeremini miſeremini</hi> ſpare us or kill us here; yet they cry out hereticks, hereticks, away with them, till the civil Judges reſcued them: and how many of theſe had but lately ſubſcribed againſt <hi>Flavianus</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> (&amp; here were in one point for <hi>Leo,</hi> and in another againſt him?) <hi>Leo's</hi> Epiſtle which was for their cauſe againſt <hi>Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi> they cryed up; and condemned <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> for excommunicating the Pope; but the Canon for exalting <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> they maintained againſt <hi>Leo's</hi> will, and contemptuouſly cryed out <hi>Qui aliter ſentiunt Roman ambulent;</hi> he that readeth the <hi>clamours</hi> at this Council, and how the ſame Biſhops that had lately ſubſcribed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of <hi>Flavianus</hi> with <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> were zealous here on the other ſide, and cryed out <hi>omnes peccavimus,</hi> excuſing it by their fear of threatnings and Souldiers, when a poor Chriſtian woman could have ſuffered Martyrdom rather than ſin; And he that readeth how after all this they were ſo ready to Anathematize others, and to contemn the proſtrate <hi>Egyptian</hi> Biſhops, will think

But what now if after ſo many hundred years confuſion it ſhould prove, that all this ſtir was in the dark, and that <hi>Neſtorius Eutyches,</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> were of the ſame mind except in words: Can the tongue of man then ſufficiently expreſs the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops guilt?

this blood, ſeparation and confuſion was between men of one mind, for want of skill in the explication of words, and through worldly deſigns.

Prince did but countenance errour, (as in the daies of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> many great Councils that were for the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and in <hi>Theodoſius Juniors</hi> time, for the <hi>Eutychians</hi> &amp;c.) is too ſad to think on. And is it not far more dangerous for many hundred in a Council to bear down a whole Empire or Kingdom, and raiſe perſecution, and there be no appeal from them, than for a poor Prieſt to put a man from the Sacrament in his own Pariſh Church? How many Councils have been againſt Images in Churches, and how many for them, condemning one anothers acts? What good will appeals do to ſuch, 2. In doctrinal caſes the conſent of many tends to concord: But in caſes of perſonal practice, are they fit judges to appeal to, that dwell many hundred miles off, and know none of the perſons; ſuppoſe a poor man in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is put from the Communion by a Pariſh-Prieſt (yea, perhaps an hundred or many hundred in ſome pariſhes) becauſe he findeth ſome to be utterly ignorant ſome to be drunkards, fornicators, heretical, &amp;c. If theſe appeal but to a Dioceſan which dwelleth 20. miles from ſome, 40, or 60, or 100 miles from others, the remedy is worſe than the diſeaſe: For if the Prieſt muſt travel ſo far, and bring his witneſſes and plead the cauſe with men that never ſaw the party before, (where neighbourhood giveth a ſurer knowledge than any ſuch examination of ſtrangers can do, and a ſtrange Chancelor or Dioceſan knoweth not which witneſſes are moſt credible) and all this while his Paſtoral Charge (perhaps many thouſand ſouls) muſt be neglected, while the Miniſter is proſecuting theſe appealing ſinners; will not the evil of this be greater than the benefit? But how much more if
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:62986:153"/>
every ſinner muſt appeal to a Patriarch many hundred miles off? A ſober mind will be aſhamed to think of the proceſs of ſuch a ſuit. If you ſay that it is not in the caſe of ſuch ſinners as theſe whereof every Pariſh abounds, that you would have appeals, at leaſt not to Patriarchs, ſo far off; I anſwer, 1. Then anſwer your own objection: What remedy ſhall they have if the Biſhop wrong them? 2. What is the caſe than that you ſuppoſe ſuch ſupraordinations of power neceſſary for? If you ſay, <hi>If Miniſters themſelves ſhould be excommunicate,</hi> It is anſwered, That none but Biſhops or other ſuperior powers pretend authoritatively as Rectors to excommunicate Paſtors; Therefore this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them that are againſt all ſuch ſuperiority of Paſtors; Where none ſuch are, none ſuch can excommunicate, or be injurious. And if there muſt be a higher Biſhop to deliver men from the injuries of a lower, who ſhould deliver us from him, who may injure Kingdoms?</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But it is ſuppoſed that Patriarchs are wiſer and better men than Metropolitans, and thoſe than Biſhops, and thoſe than Prieſts: And that a meer Prieſt is not to be truſted with the power of the Keys.</hi>

But to come neerer, what need is there of any ſuch appeal or ſuch a Government, if, 1. A Biſhop with-his Presbyters be over every particular Church (aſſociated for perſonal Communion in holy doctrine, worſhip and Converſation?) 2. And if theſe Churches aſſociate for meer concord and mutual help (and not for Governing Biſhops?) 3. And if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate govern them all as he doth Philoſophers, Phyſicians, &amp;c. For 1. If a Biſhop of a particular Church deny one the Sacrament or excommunicate
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:62986:154"/>
him, he doth it juſtly or unjuſtly: If juſtly, the perſon muſt ſubmit: If unjuſtly, he may be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a neighbour Biſhop who is not bound to reject thoſe whom upon trial he findeth to have been wrongfully excommunicated: All neighbour Churches muſt refuſe thoſe that are by any one excommunicated juſtly; but not all that are wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully caſt out. Some ſay that he that doth excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate doth caſt a man out of the whole Church, and therefore no one elſe may receive him: But unexplained words muſt not ſerve to confound truth, Souls and Congregations. Every Miniſter is a Miniſter in the Univerſal Church (as every Phyſician and Schoolmaſter is in and to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (indefinitely not univerſally) but his <hi>work</hi> and <hi>power</hi> are commenſurate; his <hi>power</hi> being only <hi>to and for his work.</hi> Therefore the Biſhop or Paſtor of one particular Church or Pariſh, is bound to confine his ordinary labour to them, though occaſionally he may help others. And accordingly his power is to uſe the Keys <hi>ordinarily for his own Church only,</hi> as to the <hi>direct effect:</hi> though <hi>extraordinarily</hi> he may uſe it in other Churches when called thereto; and by <hi>conſequence</hi> it may reach further: For few Biſhops will think if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhop come into their Dioceſſes or Pariſhes and excommunicate divers of their flocks, that <hi>they</hi> and <hi>all others</hi> are bound to ſtand to ſuch mens ſentence, and to hold ſuch excommunicate. That which a Paſtor doth in ordinary Excommunicating, is to declare (after proof) that <hi>This perſon is by his ſin and impenitency made uncapable of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church, and therefore to require him to forbear it, and the people to avoid Communion with him; and to pronounce him unpardoned before God,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:62986:155"/>
till he repent.</hi> Now if this be done by one known to be heretical with whom the other Churches have no Communion, thoſe other Churches are not bound to deny that man Communion. Nor yet if he offer himſelf to their Communion, and they examine the matter, and find him wronged. It is concord in good, and not in evil, that we are bound to by the command of God: Therefore if any man be wrongfully put out of this Church, the next may and ſhould receive him: And what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity is there then, of going a thouſand or an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles to a Pope, or Patriarch, or Dioceſan, to right him? And whoever thought that there was need of an Univerſal Phyſician, or Schoolmaſter, or a General Council of ſuch to receive appeals from Patients and Scholars that are wrongfully turned out of the Hoſpital or School?</p>
            <p>The Caviller will here tell you of diſparities in the caſes; but the queſtion is, whether the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities be ſuch as alter the reaſon of the Concluſion. What man of conſcience will be a Phyſician, School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter or Paſtor, that hath not power to judge whom to receive for his Patient, Scholar, or part of his flock, but muſt take all that ſome other man ſhall ſend to him, or command him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and give them what others command him to give? An Apothecary may do ſo, but not a Phyſician. What if a man had no other ſcandal, but to ſay, <hi>I will not take you for my Paſtor, nor take my ſelf obliged to anſwer you, ſpeak with you, give you any account of my ſelf, nor be queſtioned by you on any accuſation,</hi> muſt I be conſtrained to ſuppoſe this man to be one of my flock In deſpite of his own denyal? If the freedom of conſent be not mutual, but I muſt be conſtrained to take thoſe
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:62986:155"/>
for my charge as Chriſtians, that renounce ſuch a relation, or will not own it; a Paſtor is not a free man, nor hath any power of the Church-Keys, but is as an irrational Slave, a Cryer, or Executioner, that muſt but execute another mans commands.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But if there be need of appeals, and our own actions muſt not be free, why will not the Synods of Neighbour-Paſtors met only for <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Concord</hi> (and not to command the Paſtors) ſuffice for ſuch perſons to appeal to? And what if I turn a ſervant out of my houſe, or from his meat, and he may take another Maſter when he will, muſt there be an univerſal Judge of all family caſes, that ſhall force me to keep my ſervant againſt my will? Is it not enough that I know why I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to keep him, who am no way more bound to him than to others, but by my own conſent? What if (as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> left <hi>Saſimis, Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Nazianzum</hi> at laſt) I ſhould give up my whole Charge and Biſhoprick, and ſay, I will be a Paſtor to none of them any more, (upon ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as <hi>Latimer</hi> did:) Is it not better for the people to take another, than to accuſe me at <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as wronging them?</p>
            <p n="3">3. But if all this ſerve not (neither the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Paſtors for one ſingle Pariſh, nor yet the Counſel of all the Neighbour-Paſtors or Biſhops,) what is there more to be done, which the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Princes and Magiſtrates</hi> may not do? All Chriſtians confeſs (almoſt) that no Biſhops or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, as ſuch, have from Chriſt any forcing power over the flocks; that belongeth to the Magiſtrates only; And <hi>they</hi> are to keep peace, and force us to our certain duty. And I would ask the contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, whether if Biſhops, Patriarchs and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:62986:156"/>
had no forcing power, but only to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate by the application of Gods word, and leaving all men to their conſciences, would this ſort of Government ſerve their turn, and keep out Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, or maintain order and unity? They ſay no, themſelves: And next, whether it be not certain, and confeſſed, that the Paſtors have no other power, but the Magiſtrates only?</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But ſhall all men gather Churches, and teach Hereſie, and do what they will?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The power of Popes, Patriarchs or Councils, did not prevent it, when there were all the Hereſies that fill <hi>Epiphanius</hi> Volumns: And when the far greateſt part of the Clergy was long <hi>Arrian:</hi> And when the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> and <hi>Futychians</hi> ſo greatly multiplied after the condemnation of the Councils: And when the <hi>Novatians</hi> lived ſo many years in reputation: and when the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> nor they were not diminiſhed by Prelates or Councils Cenſures, till the ſword diſperſed them. And cannot the Sword be drawn without ſuch as have no power of it?</p>
            <p n="3">3. And as to the laſt (and greateſt) reaſon, that the Apoſtles have ſucceſſors who muſt order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe their Government; it is anſwered 1. The common doctrine of the Church was, that all Biſhops are their Succeſſors ſo far as they have ſucceſſions; and every Church of one Altar had a Biſhop in the daies of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and long after. 2. The Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> ſaid, None of us call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf Biſhop of Biſhops. 3. But if any be ſet as the Biſhop of many Biſhops and Churches, ſo be it they uſe no violence, but govern volunteers as all the old Biſhops did, and ſorbid them nothing commanded of God, nor command them any
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:62986:156"/>
thing which God forbiddeth, and deſtroy not the order, doctrine, worſhip or diſcipline of the leſſer particular Churches, we have before ſaid, that we ſhall ſubmit to ſuch.</p>
            <p>§41. IV. As to the queſtion, whether the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſetled by Chriſt in National Churches be (as to the Clergy from all parts, Monarchical) Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratical or Democratical, and who muſt have the <hi>ſummam poteſtatem?</hi> The diſagreement of the perſons that we have herein to do with, puts us into utter deſpair of any ſolution. And what good will it do us to believe that ſome muſt be obeyed, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be certain who it is.</p>
            <p>§42. V. And to the queſtion, <hi>Whether the King be the formal, or only the accidental Church-head?</hi> We find no more agreement. 1. Some think that the King, as <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> is a mixt perſon, ſecular and Clergy, and hath both Offices to uſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, as they ſay, the Princes before <hi>Aaron</hi> had. 2. Others ſay, that this is not ſo, but that the Clergy-juriſdiction, diſtinct from the Prieſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon power, is a branch of the Chriſtian Magiſtrates power, and ſo derived from the King. 3. Others ſay that the Church, <hi>formally,</hi> is diſtinct from the Civil State, though not alwaies <hi>materially:</hi> And that the King as King, is but an Accidental Civil Head, as he is over Phyſicians and Schoolmaſters, being neither himſelf; and that the National Church muſt have a <hi>formal Clergy-head, (Perſonal</hi> or <hi>Collective)</hi> which ſhall <hi>in ſuo genere,</hi> be the higheſt, though under the Magiſttates Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as Phyſicians are. 4. The Papiſts ſay, that all National Churches are under the Pope as Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Paſtor, who may alter them as he ſeeth cauſe. 5. Some moderate men ſay, that only Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan (and Metropolitical) Churches are <hi>jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:62986:157"/>
and that they are called <hi>National,</hi> only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly from one King, or <hi>concording</hi> aſſociation as <hi>ab accidente,</hi> and not properly from any <hi>formal Clergy-head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 43. VI. Laſtly, which is the formal Head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo what that Church is, we are left as much uncertain. 1. If it be only a Civil Head that denominateth it <hi>One,</hi> then it is but a Chriſtian Kingdom, which we never queſtioned. And Dr. <hi>Rich. Coſins,</hi> in his Tables of the Engliſh Church-Policy, ſaith <hi>[That the King hath Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrationem ſupremam magiſque abſolutam, quae dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Primatus Regius.</hi> And <hi>Tho. Crompton</hi> in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of it to K. <hi>James,</hi> ſaith <hi>[Eccleſiaſtica Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictio plane Regia eſt, Coronae &amp; dignitatis veſtrae Regiae prima, praecipua, indiviſibilis pars: Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae leges Regiae ſunt, neque alibi oriuntur, aut aliunde ſuſtentantur, aut fulciuntur: penes Eccleſiaſticos ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices per Archiepiſcopos &amp; Epiſcopos, derivata a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge poteſtate, juriſdictio Eccleſiaſtica conſiſt it:</hi> And yet our Kings and Church explaining the Oath of Allegiance, declare that the King pretendeth not to the Prieſthood, or power to adminiſter the Word and Sacraments; but, as <hi>Crompton</hi> adds from <hi>Conſtantine, is extra Eccleſiam conſtitutus a Deo E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopus; alii intra Eccleſiam Epiſcopi.</hi> This is plain: If they hold to this, and claim no power in the Engliſh-Policy, but as the Kings Officers, in that part which belongeth to Chriſtian Magiſtrates, who will oppoſe them? But this reacheth not to the Keys, Preaching or Sacraments. 2. Some ſay that the King is partly a Clergy man, as <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> and ſo that he is the formal Head, and might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Prieſtly Office if he would: But this our Kings have themſelves renounced. 3. Some ſay
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:62986:157"/>
that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is the formal Head; but that cannot be, becauſe he is no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour over the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> or his Province. 4. Moſt ſay that the <hi>Convocation</hi> is the formal Church-Head, which makes it One Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church. But 1. If ſo, then why ſaith the Canon that the Convocation <hi>[is the true Church of England by Repreſentation]</hi> and thoſe excommunicate that deny it? We enquire after the Church-Head or Governour: And that which is but the Church it ſelf by repreſentation, is not its <hi>Head,</hi> unleſs the Head and Body be the ſame, and the Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it ſelf, and ſo it be Democratical: The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and Governours, ſure, are not the ſame. 2. And the <hi>Supream Power</hi> is ſuppoſed, by thoſe that take Epiſcopacy for a diſtinct Order, to be in the <hi>Supream Order</hi> only: But the far greater part of the Convocation are not of the <hi>Supream Order:</hi> Nay, thus the Presbyters ſhould be partly the chief Governours of the Biſhops while they make Canons for them. 3. When we did but motion that according to Arch-Biſhop <hi>Uſhers</hi> form of the Primitive Epiſcopacy, Presbyters might joyn with the Biſhops in proper executive Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inſtead of Lay-Chancellors, and ſuch like, they decryed it as <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and call us <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> ever ſince: And if they ſay that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters have ſo great a part in the Supream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment it ſelf, which obligeth all the Nation, how much more would they be themſelves <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> which they ſo abhor?</p>
            <p>§ 44. Having oft ſaid that we deſire <hi>Chriſtian Kingdoms</hi> as the great bleſſing of the world, we mean not either that 1. All in a Kingdom ſhould be forced to be baptized, or profeſs themſelves
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:62986:158"/>
Chriſtians, whether they are ſo or not: For lying will not ſave men, nor pleaſe God; and even the Papiſts are againſt this: 2. Nor that all ſhould be ſuppoſed to be Chriſtians that are in the Kingdom. But that the Kings be Chriſtians, and the Laws countenance Chriſtianity, and the moſt or ruling part of the Kingdom be Chriſtians, and all juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours uſed to make all the reſt ſo: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Churches continued them Catechumens till they were fit for Baptiſm; and though they were for Infant-Baptiſm, they <hi>compelled</hi> none to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in Infancy, or at Age, but left it to free choice. They baptized but twice a year ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. They kept many offenders many years from communion. And if <hi>Crabs Roman Council ſub ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt</hi> be true, they at <hi>Rome admitted not penitents till fourty years</hi> (underſtand it as you ſee cauſe:) The true Elibertine Canons kept many out ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, and many till death, and many abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as ſhewed that they were far from taking all the Nation into the Church. And the Chriſtian Emperours compelled none. It was long before the greateſt part of the Empire were Chriſtians. In the daies of <hi>Valens,</hi> the Biſhops were ſome of them baniſhed into places that had few Chriſtians, if any. In <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, even in St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s daies, the Chriſtians of his flock were not the moſt, but he wrought miracles to convince the Heathens that raged againſt Chriſtianity, where he dwelt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>§ 1. There are two appendent Controverſies handled by ſome, that write for National Churches; which need but a brief ſolution: The firſt is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not an Independent Errour to expect <hi>real holineſs in Church-members, as neceſſary in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:62986:158"/>
of charity?</hi> The ſecond, <hi>Whether it be not ſuch an Errour to require the bond of a Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Baptiſmal Covenant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 2. To the firſt we ſay, that ſo much is written on this point by one of us in a Treatiſe called <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of Right to Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. that we think meet to ſay no more: The Opponents now confeſs that it muſt be <hi>ſaving Faith and Conſent to the Baptiſmal Covenant</hi> that muſt be profeſſed: And Papiſts and Proteſtants agree with all the Ancient Church, that Baptiſm putteth the true Conſenter into a ſtate of certain pardon and title to life: And God maketh not known lying, a condition of Church-communion: <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> It is true, that God hath not made Miniſters Arbitrary Judges of mens ſecret thoughts, but hath limited them in judging to take <hi>their tongues</hi> that <hi>profeſs Faith and Conſent</hi> to be the <hi>Indices</hi> of their minds: But ſure the power of the Keys containeth a power of judging according to Chriſt's Law, who is to be taken into the Church by Baptiſm, and who not: If only the ſeeker be made Judge, it will be a new way of Church-Government, and a bad. And then the queſtion is, 1. Whether he that accepts ones pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſeemingly ſerious, of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Conſent,</hi> and that <hi>de praeſente,</hi> is not bound to hope in charity that ſuch a one doth not lie or diſſemble? 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a baptized perſon, as ſuch, have no right to our ſpecial love which we owe to thoſe that we hope are true Believers, and ſanctified; but only to our common love and kindneſs, which belongeth to thoſe alſo that are the heirs of Hell? Some friends that are gone from extream to extream, and in remembrance of their ancient Schiſms, can
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:62986:159"/>
look but one way with impartial ſenſe, and that have made their repentance the paſſage to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter errour and ſin, ſhould better bethink them them what they do. They did well to ſtand ſtill in the way of Schiſm, when they ſaw here a leg, and there a hand, and there an arm in their way; and who but a mad-man indeed would not: But if they have impartially read Church-hiſtory, and the works of ſuch Fathers as give us hiſtorical no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, and ever ſince <hi>Conſtantine</hi> made a Biſhoprick a bait to a proud and worldly mind; even ſuch as <hi>Nazianzen, Baſil, Chryſoſtom, Iſidore Peluſiota, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Pictav.</hi> and the over-orthodox diſputations of <hi>Cyril,</hi> and the Epiſtles of <hi>Theodoret</hi> rejoycing at his death, and abundance of ſuch like; had they ſeen in the way of Church-pride and tyranny, not here a leg, and there an arm, but here a hundred car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes, and there a thouſand; here two thouſand godly faithful Preachers ſilenced, and many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dry Vines planted in their rooms, and there whole Kingdoms interdicted, and their Churches ſhut up; here Churches and Kingdoms turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to confuſions about a <hi>word,</hi> or about the <hi>interest of Prolates,</hi> ſtriving which ſhould be the <hi>Chief,</hi> and have their will and rule the reſt; and there hundred thouſands murdered in the name of Chriſt, for obeying him, and bloody wars managed by the Clergy againſt Chriſtian Emperours, and Kings ſtabbed one after another; and moſt of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, <hi>Roman, Greek, Moſcovites, Armenians, Abaſſines,</hi> degenerated into doleful ignorance and dead formality under the Government of great High-Prieſts, and millions of the vulgar bred up in ignorance and ſenſleſneſs of ſpiritual and eternal things; this ſhould ſtop them, (at leaſt from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:62986:159"/>
the maſter of ſuch deſigns) as much as a leg, or an arm in the way.</p>
            <p n="3">3. At leaſt we would intreat them to hate that miſtake, which will pretend to do all this for charity, unity and the Churches good; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it is no ſign of charity, 1. To believe that charity ſhould not be exerciſed in judging that men profeſſing ſaving faith do ſpeak the truth, and have the faith that they profeſs: 2. Nor to teach all Chriſts Church, that a baptized Church member <hi>as ſuch</hi> is to be lookt on but as a man in a ſtate of damnation; and no man is bound to love him as a true Chriſtian with a ſpecial love: 3. And that to prove that a man is not to be taken for a true Chriſtian, but to be admitted into Church Communion as one that ſhall have a greater dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation than heathens, without a further renovation, is a great act of Charity, Contrary to the unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table narrowneſs of others. Theſe are too great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes from Anabaptiſtry, but not from real Schiſm.</p>
            <p>§ 3. As for thoſe that will not take the <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſerious profeſſion of true Faith, and Covenant-Conſent</hi> for a credible ſign of the ſincerity of the Profeſſor, till they can ſufficiently diſprove it, but will be the arbitrary Judges of mens hearts, either as pretended heart-ſearchers, or by ſelf-deviſed, or uncertain ſigns, not taking up with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, we are no Patrons of ſuch mens preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and uncharitableneſs.</p>
            <p>§ 4. There are various degrees of Credibility in mens profeſſions; ſome give us ſo much as is next to certainty; ſome but ſmall hopes: But yet till we can diſprove them, we are to take their profeſſions as credible in ſome degree. And if they prove falſe, it is they that will have the loſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:62986:160"/>
§ 5. II. The ſecond caſe about Church Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants deſerveth no longer a diſcuſſion. He that will put any article unneceſſary into any ſuch Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſinfully corrupteth the order of the Church: As if he would bind the people to be Church Governours, or never to depart from that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church but by the conſent of the Paſtor, or the flock, or any ſuch like: And he miſtaketh that will make a more <hi>explicite</hi> contract to be more neceſſary than it is. But it ſeemeth ſtrange to us that any underſtanding Chriſtian ſhould deny, that <hi>conſent</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary to the being of an adult member both of the univerſal, and each particular Church reſpectively. What <hi>bindeth</hi> a man to conſent is another queſtion, but if he be any member of the Church till he <hi>profeſs conſent;</hi> we know not what a Chriſtian or Church member is. An <hi>explicite covenant</hi> is neceſſary to our relation to the <hi>Univerſal Church</hi> for it muſt be <hi>ſolemnized ſacramentally:</hi> That we expreſs it by <hi>writings or words</hi> is not of neceſſity to our memberſhip of a particular Church: But <hi>conſent</hi> is neceſſary; And <hi>mutual conſent expreſſed</hi> ſatisfactorily, is a contract or Covenant: If the Paſtor ſay all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> at conſent, hold up your hand, or ſtand up; or ſtay here while the reſt depart, &amp;c. theſe are ſignifications of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: And if it be notified that all that appear at the ſolemn Aſſemblies, and attend the Paſtors Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, ſhall be taken for Conſenters, their preſence and attendance is a profeſſion of Conſent indeed, and ſo a covenanting. But though the moſt expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit be not neceſſary <hi>ad eſſe,</hi> no man can give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why it ſhould not be beſt <hi>ad bene eſſe,</hi> ſeeing the moſt intelligent and plain dealing in the great things of God, are moſt ſuitable to the work, and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:62986:160"/>
fitteſt to attain the end: why ſhould we not deal openly and above board?</p>
            <p>§ 6. It is certain that to be a Chriſtian maketh no man a member of any mans particular flock or charge. And it is certain that none can be ſuch without conſent. And it is certain that the Paſtor is not to take every Atheiſt, Jew, Infidel, Papiſt, Heretick, &amp;c. in his Pariſh for a member of the Univerſal, or of that particular Church. Therefore he muſt know whom to take for ſuch. And it is certain that the conſent muſt be mutual, ſo far is the Paſtor from being a ſlave, and bound to every mans deſires, that he is entruſted with the Church Keys himſelf.</p>
            <p>§ 7. A worthy perſon on this ſubject maketh theſe ſix things ſufficient to ſuch Church relation: 1. That they be baptized Chriſtians; 2. Neighbours bound to mutual love; 3. And apt to Neighbourly duty; 4. That providence make us ſuch Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; 5. Scripture Churches took their name from cohabitation: 6. The command of authority, that ſo it ſhall be. <hi>Freſh ſuit. pag.</hi> 260.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> By making theſe ſix the ſufficient proof of Pariſh Churches, our friend unhappily would conſequently unchurch them all: For if this were all, certainly they were none at all. For all theſe (which he maketh more than they are) are but the <hi>diſpoſitio materiae,</hi> antecedent to any reception of the form, 1. For all that he inferreth or can infer from them all is <hi>obligation to conſent</hi> and to <hi>other duties after conſent.</hi> But <hi>obligation</hi> maketh not the relation of a member: All that are <hi>obliged</hi> to be Chriſtians are not Chriſtians: All that are obliged to be Paſtors are not Paſtors: Nor all that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to conſent firſt and to do the duty of Paſtors
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:62986:161"/>
after: Even as all that are obliged to conſent to be ſubjects, Husbands, Wives, Maſters, Servants, Tutors, Scholars, &amp;c. are not ſuch: If meer <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi> ſerve to one relation, why not to others? 2. Elſe a man might be a true Paſtor unchoſen, unordained and againſt his will. For he may by his qualifications be obliged to be ordained and to become a Paſtor. 3. And ſo the people may be the flock of one that was obliged to be their Paſtor, when another is ſet over them and in poſſeſſion, becauſe it was the firſt that was obliged, and they to chooſe him: And ſo utter Confuſion will come in: And if a man can prove that another mans wife and ſervant was obliged to be his, he may take them as his indeed. 3. By this rule all the Papiſts, Seekers, Quakers, &amp;c. that renounce our Churches, ſhould yet be members of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they live in the Pariſh, and are commanded to be members: Which <hi>who</hi> believeth? 4. A mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Church hath right to Communion and Miniſterial vigilancie and help: But ſo hath not every baptized perſon that is commanded to be a member, and obeyeth not that command. If a man ſay to a Paſtor, I will be none of your flock, or Church, but yet I require you to do the office of a Paſtor to me, though I renounce your relation to me, and the people to uſe me as a member of the flock, becauſe I am commanded to be a member, this were a ſtrange claim. 5. If this did hold, then no man that liveth in the Pariſh could be a proper ſeparatiſt, ſo as to break off himſelf from that Church, nor become a member of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unleſs he apoſtatized from Chriſt: For he would be ſtill under the Magiſtrates Command and obligation: But the conſequent is abſud: Why do
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:62986:161"/>
the ſame men ſpeak ſo much againſt ſchiſmatical rending mens ſelves from the true Churches, and gathering other Churches, if there be no ſuch thing? The Laws change not, which oblige them. 6. They that are againſt ſchiſm and ſingularity, ſhould be againſt this opinion, becauſe (as it is utterly abſurd, ſo) it is notoriouſly contrary to the Judgment of all the Chriſtian world in all ages to this day, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Church hiſtory may fully inform them. They have ever taken mutual conſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Paſtors and the flock to be neceſſary to the being of a particular Church; and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were obliged to, they were not actually related to each other as Paſtor and flock till they conſented: And therefore have noted ſchiſmatical Churches in the ſame Cities that have been no parts of the Church which they diſowned.</p>
            <p>§ 8. But it is objected, that this unchurcheth our Pariſh-Churches, and all the Churches in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not one: But the contrary would. Our Pariſh Churches are aſſociated by mutual conſent: The Paſtor expreſſeth his conſent openly at his inſtitution, induction and officiating: The Flocks ſhew their conſent by actual ſubmitting to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Office: They hear him, and communicate ordinarily with him, and ſeek Miniſterial help from him; though all that are in the Pariſh do not ſo, thoſe do it that are indeed his flock, or Church. They do not perhaps by <hi>word</hi> or <hi>writing</hi> covenant to ſubmit to him as their Paſtor, but they do it by actual ſignification of conſent to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And the Biſhops in Conſecration enter into a Covenant to watch over the flock (as do the Prieſts) and the Prieſts promiſe (if not ſwear, in
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:62986:162"/>
               <hi>England)</hi> to obey them: This is a Covenant.</p>
            <p>§9. It is objected that this is a diſparagement to Baptiſm, which is the only Church-making Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Baptiſm only, as ſuch, maketh us members of the univerſal Church; but is not enough to make us of any Miniſters ſpecial flock: I am not a member of the Church of <hi>York, Norwich, Briſtol,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe I am baptized: Nor am I a member of the Pariſh Church now where I was baptized. Conſent to be a Chriſtian is one thing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be a member of this particular Church, and to take this man more than all the reſt about us, for the Guide of my ſoul, is another.</p>
            <p>§10. And if a man would ſay, I will be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Pariſh Church, and you ſhall perform ſo much of your Office as I deſire, and no more; I will hear and receive the Sacrament but when I pleaſe, and I will not admit you to catechize or inſtruct any of my family, nor viſit the ſick, nor will I be reſponſible to you for any thing that I hold, or ſay, or do; nor have any thing to do with you, but in the Church; is a Miniſter bound to do his office to men, or take them for his ſpecial flock on theſe terms? The ancient Churches had abundance of ſtrict Canons; if the people ſhould have choſen a Biſhop, and ſaid We will obey none of theſe Canons, nor you but you ſhall be our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop on our terms, was he bound to have conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to have been ſuch a Biſhop? This is really the caſe of no ſmall part of <hi>England,</hi> though they ſay it not openly by words.</p>
            <p>§11. It is objected <hi>that as Apoſtles, ſo ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miniſters have their authority before the conſent of the people and receive it not from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:62986:162"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Who ever queſtioneth it, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate, as to an indefinite charge in the Church univerſal? But what's that to the queſtion? Are all the Miniſters in the world bound to be the Paſtors of this Pariſh or Dioceſs? Our queſtion is what conſtituteth the relations between a Paſtor and his Particular flock? Doth not the ordainer here ſay, <hi>Take thou Authority to Preach the Word of God, &amp;c. when thou art thereto lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called?</hi> Becauſe a man is a Licenſed Phyſician without me, doth it follow that he is my Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician without my conſent? 2. Are all thoſe Church-members that Miniſters are authorized to preach to? Then all the Heathen-world are Church-members. 3. They receive not authority from the people; but their conſent is neceſſary to make themſelves capable receivers of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and right of Church-members. God, and not the Wife, giveth the Husband the ſuperiority; but he is no ſuch Husband to any that conſenteth not.</p>
            <p>§12. God hath laid mens rights and benefits on their wills, ſo that no man can have them againſt his will. It is a great priviledge to have right to communion with a particular Church, and to this or that faithful Paſtors overſight: And its new Doctrine to ſay, that unwilling perſons have this right, becauſe they are willing of ſomething elſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to be members of the Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.</p>
            <p>§13. We conclude therefore that both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams here are falſe; 1. That men can be adult members of a particular Church that conſent not, or taken for ſuch that no way ſignifie their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that it is not uſeful <hi>ad bene eſſe,</hi> that this
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:62986:163"/>
conſent be intelligent and expreſs, and that the Offices conſented to be truly underſtood. 2. That a written, or verbal covenant is of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; or that men ſhould tie themſelves to any thing doubtful, or unneceſſary, but only to the <hi>relation</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> of members (as of the univerſal ſo) of that particular Church. Both theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams we do renounce. Mr. <hi>Zachary Cawdry,</hi> a Conformiſt, hath ſhewed in a particular Treatiſe for Church covenanting, how far he is from the mind of thoſe Objectors; for he would have the people engaged by covenant to their Biſhops and Prieſts.</p>
            <p>§ 14. To conclude, though we renounce fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Enthuſiaſts, yet ſerious conſideration maketh ſome of us think, that too little notice is taken of the HOLY GHOST ſetting Paſtors over the flocks, which the Scripture mentioneth: And though none on pretence of the Spirit muſt reject order or ordination, nor make themſelves the ſole Judges of their own ſufficiency; yet 1. The due qualification of men with wiſdom, faith, love, and heavenly zeal, and ability, is the moſt excellent part of our Calling to the Miniſtry. 2. <hi>Ex quovis ligno non fit Mercurius;</hi> without neceſſary fitneſs no man is a true Paſtor having not <hi>diſpoſitionem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ptivam:</hi> And without eminent fitneſs, few are eminently ſerviceable. 3. Experience aſſureth us, that though the Office hath ſupernumeraries, yet of worthy men God never yet raiſed up ſupernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meraries, but the ſcarcity is lamentably great. 4. All therefore that are duly qualified, and have opportunity, ſhould be choſen, ordained, accepted, and accept the Call, if not offer themſelves, iu
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:62986:163"/>
caſe they cannot otherwiſe enter. 5. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer doth but miniſterially inveſt him with the power, whom the Spirit of God hath qualified for it, by the inward Call. 6. In caſe the Ordainers by envy, or malignity, or faction, refuſe ſuch, where there is true <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> and <hi>Opportunity,</hi> we conceive that mutual conſent of the people and themſelves, may ſuffice to the orderly admittance into the Office, much more if the Magiſtrate alſo conſent: Of which ſee <hi>Voetius de deſparata Cauſa Papatus, and a Diſpute of Ordination,</hi> by <hi>R.

Which things being already ſpoken and manifeſt to us, it is neceſſary that our obedience attend to God's commands: Neither may mans indulgence accept the perſon, or grant any thing to any one in ſuch things where God's preſcription, interced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and giveth a Law. For we muſt not forget what God by the Propet <hi>Eſaias</hi> ſaith to the Jews, reproving them, and angry with them, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the commands of God, they followed the doctrines of men. <hi>This people,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far ſeparated from me; and in vain do they worſhip me, teaching the commands and doctrines of men:</hi> which the Lord alſo in the Goſpel repeateth and ſaith, <hi>Ye reject the command of God, that you may eſtabliſh your own tradition.</hi> Having theſe things before our eyes, and carefully and religiouſly conſidering them, in the Ordinations of Prieſts, we ought to chuſe no Biſhops but men unſpotted and entire, who holily and worthily offering the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſices

Wherefore the Lay people, obeying the Lords commands, and fearing God, muſt ſeparate themſelves <hi>(a peccatore praepoſito)</hi> from a ſinful Prelate (or Paſtor) and muſt not mix themſelves at the ſacrifices of a ſacrilegious Prieſt; becauſe <hi>they chiefly have the power</hi> either <hi>to chuſe Prieſts that are worthy, or to refuſe thoſe that are unworthy:</hi> Which very thing, we ſee, deſcendeth from Divine Authority, that the Prieſt, the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people being preſent, be choſen under the Eyes of

All, and by the publick judgment and teſtimony be approved worthy and meet: As in <hi>Numbers</hi> the Lord commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaying, <hi>Take Aaron thy Brother, and Eleazer his Son, and ſet them before all the Congregation on the Mount, and take off Aarons ſtole, and put it on Eleazer his Son, and let Aaron die there.</hi> God commandeth that the Prieſt be made before all the Congregation; that is, he inſtructeth us, and ſheweth that the Prieſtly Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ſhould not be done, but under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the aſſiſting people, that the Lay-people being preſent, either the crimes of bad men may be detected, or the deſerts of good men predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that ſo that Ordination may be juſt and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, which hath been examined by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſuffrage of <hi>All.</hi> 5. Which thing is after obſerved according to the Divine Magiſteries in the Acts of the Apoſtles, when <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake to the Lay-people about Ordaining a Biſhop in the place of <hi>Judas, Peter,</hi> ſaith the Text, ſtood up in the midſt of the Diſciples, for the multitude was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one. And it was not only in the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Biſhops and Prieſts, but of Deacons alſo, that we note the Apoſtles to have obſerved this. Of which alſo in their Acts it is written, and the twelve, ſaith tbe Text, called together the whole Laity of the Diſciples, and ſaid to them. And the whole buſineſs is managed thus diligently and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telouſly, the whole Laity being convocate, leſt any unworthy perſon ſhould creep into the Miniſtry of the Altar, or the place of Prieſthood. For God himſelf manifeſteth by the Prophet <hi>O ſee,</hi> ſaying, <hi>They have made themſelves a King, but not by me;</hi> that unworthy men are ſometimes ordained by mans preſumption, and that theſe things are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:62986:166"/>
to God, which come not of a legitimate and juſt Ordination. 6. For which cauſe it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to be obſerved and held as of Divine Tradition, and Apoſtolical Obſervation, which is held alſo with us, and in a manner (or almoſt) through all the Provinces, that to the right cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating of Ordinations, all the next Biſhops of the Province <hi>come together to the Lay-people to whom the Biſhop (praepoſitus)</hi> is <hi>ordained,</hi> and that a Biſhop be made, the Lay-people being preſent, who moſt fully know every mans life, and diſcern every mans acting by his converſation; which we ſee done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with your ſelves in the Ordination of our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league <hi>Sabinus,</hi> that by the <hi>ſuffrage</hi> of the whole fraternity, and by the judgment of the Biſhops, who at the preſent met, and who wrote Letters of it to you, the Epiſcopacy ſhould be delivered to him, and hands ſhould be laid on him inſtead of <hi>Baſilides.</hi> Nor can it reſcind the Ordination which was rightly perfected, that <hi>Baſilides,</hi> after his crimes detected, and his conſcience laid bare by his own confeſſion, going to <hi>Rome,</hi> deceived our Colleague <hi>Stephen,</hi> who lived far off, and was ignorant of the matter of fact, and of the ſilenced truth, that he might compaſs to be unjuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed in his Biſhoprick, from which he had been juſtly depoſed. 7. The effect of this is, that the offences of <hi>Baſilides</hi> are not ſo much aboliſhed, as cumulate, that to his former ſins, the crime of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and circumvention is added. For he is not ſo much to be blamed, that was negligently decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as he to be execrated that fraudulently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him. But if <hi>Baſilides</hi> can deceive men, he cannot deceive God. For it is written, <hi>God is not mocked.</hi> Nor will fallacy profit <hi>Martial</hi> to keep
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:62986:166"/>
him who is involved in great offences, from a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful loſing of his Biſhoprick. Seeing the Apoſtle warneth us, and ſaith, A Biſhop muſt be without crime as the Steward of God: Wherefore, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as you wrote, beloved brethren, and as <hi>Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> and <hi>Sabinus</hi> our Colleagues aſſevere, and as another <hi>Faelix</hi> of <hi>Caeſar Auguſta,</hi> an honourer of the Faith, and a defender of the Truth, ſignifieth by his Letters) <hi>Baſilides</hi> and <hi>Martial</hi> are conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by a wicked Libel of Idolatry. And <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilides,</hi> beſides the blot of this Libel, when he lay ſick blaſphemed God, and confeſſed that he blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, and becauſe of the wound of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience voluntarily depoſing his Epiſcopacy, turned himſelf to a repentence, begging pardon of God, and being ſatisfied, if he might but communicate as a Lay man. And <hi>Martial,</hi> beſides the filthy and dirty feaſts of the Gentiles, and the oft fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting of their Colledges, and the depoſing his Sons in the ſame Colledge after the manner of the exterior Nations, in prophane Sepulchres, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them with aliens, did alſo by publick acts with the Ducenary Procurator, teſtifie that he obeyed Idolatry: And ſeeing there are many other and great offences in which <hi>Baſilides</hi> and <hi>Martial</hi> are held guilty; in vain do ſuch men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to uſurp to themſelves the Office of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, when it is manifeſt that ſuch kind of men may neither be Guides of the Church of Chriſt, nor ought to offer Sacrifices to God: Eſpecially when <hi>Cornelius</hi> alſo our Colleague, a pacifick and juſt Prieſt, and honoured by God's vouchſafement with Martyrdom, did with us, and all the Biſhops ſettled in the whole world, decree, that ſuch men be not admitted to Repentance, but that they be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:62986:167"/>
from Clergy Ordination, and Prieſtly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. 8. And let not this move you, moſt belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Brethren, if with ſome in the laſt times, their ſlippery Faith do nod, and their irreligious fear of God do ſhake, or paciſick Concord perſevere not: It was foretold that theſe things would be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the world; and by the joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs of the Apoſtles it was foretold, that the world declining, and Antichriſt drawing near, all good things would fail (or decay) and evil and adverſe things increaſe (or proſper.) And yet, though it be in the laſt times, neither is Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical vigor ſo fallen in the Church of God, or doth the ſtrength of Chriſtian Virtue or Faith ſo languiſh, but that there remaineth a <hi>portion</hi> of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> which yields not to theſe ruines of things, and ſhipwrack of Faith, but as ſtrong and ſtable do with obſervation of fear maintain the honour of the Divine Majeſty, and the Prieſtly dignity. We remember and hold, that when the reſt did yield and fall, <hi>Mathatias</hi> did valiantly defend the Law of God: And that when the Jews failed and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Divine Religion, <hi>Elias</hi> ſtood and ſtrove ſublimely: That <hi>Daniel,</hi> neither deterred by the ſolitude of a ſtrange Country, nor by the infeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of daily perſecution, did frequently and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly give glorious teſtimonies (or Martyrdoms) and that the three young men, neither broken with years, nor threats, did faithfully ſtand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Babylonian</hi> fires, and even in their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity conquered the conquering King. 9. The number (or party) of prevaricators or trayors that now <hi>riſe up in the Church againſt the Church,</hi> and have begun to ſpoil both Faith and Verity, ſhall ſee it; that yet with the moſt there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:62986:167"/>
a ſincere mind, and entire Religion, a ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to none but their Lord and God; and that other mens perfidiouſneſs doth not depreſs the Chriſtian Faith to ruine, but doth more excite it, and exalt it unto glory. Even as the bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth and ſaith, <hi>What if ſome of them have fallen from Faith? ſhall their unbelief make void the ſaith of God? God is true, and every man a lyar:</hi> And if <hi>every man be a lyar, and God only be true,</hi> what elſe ſhould we, Gods ſevants, do, and ſpecially his Prieſts, but relinquiſh the errours and lies of men, and keeping the Lords commands, remain in the truth of God? 10. Therefore, moſt beloved brethren, though there have been ſome of our Colleagues, who think that the Divine Diſcipline ſhould be neglected, and do raſhly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with <hi>Baſilides</hi> and <hi>Martial,</hi> that ought not to trouble our Faith, ſeeing the Holy Ghoſt in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> doth threaten ſuch, ſaying, <hi>Thou hatedſt Diſcipline, and haſt caſt my words behind thee:</hi> If thou ſaweſt a Thief, thou concurredſt with him, and didſt place thy portion with Adulterers. It ſheweth that they are made Conſorts and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of other mens ſins, who have been coupled with the ſinners. And <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle writeth the ſame thing, and ſaith <hi>[Whiſperers, detractors, haters of God, injurious, proud, boaſters of themſelves, inventers of evil things; who when they knew the judgment of God, they underſtood not that they that do ſuch things are worthy of death;</hi> not only they that do them, but they that conſent to them that do them. He ſaith, that <hi>They that do ſuch things are worthy of death.</hi> He manifeſteth and averreth that not only they are worthy of death, and come to puniſhment who do the evils, but
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:62986:168"/>
they alſo who conſent to them that do ſuch things, who while by unlawful communication they are mingled with bad men, and ſinners, and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent perſons, they are polluted by the contact of the guilty; and while they are joyned in the fault, they are not ſeparated in the puniſhment. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, moſt beloved brethren, we both praiſe and approve the religious care of our integrity and faith; and as far as we are able by our Letters, exhort you, that you do not by ſacrilegious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion mingle your ſelves with prophane and blotted Prieſts (or Biſhops;) but in religious fear do keep entire and ſincere the firmneſs of your Faith.

                  <hi>SAith</hi> M. Paris, In theſe daies when the Lord Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4th. <hi>had ſignified by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Writings, commanding the Biſhop of</hi> Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln <hi>that he ſhould do ſomewhat which he took to be unjuſt, and diſſonant to reaſon, as he frequently did to him and other Engliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Prelates; <hi>he wrote back to him in theſe words</hi> [Be it known to your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, that I devoutly and reverently, with filial affection, obey the Apoſtolical Precepts: And being zealous of the paternal honour, I am againſt and reſiſt the things which are againſt the Apoſtolical mandates
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:62986:168"/>
For I am bound to both by Gods Commands: For the Apoſtolick mandates, neither are, nor can be any other, than conſonant and conform to the Apoſtles Doctrine, and to the Doctrine of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the Maſter and Lord of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, whoſe type and perſon the Lord Pope chiefly beareth in the Hierarchy of the Church <note n="*" place="margin">It muſt be known that this Biſhop li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the depth of Popery, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the Popes Power, as men do now the Biſhops.</note>. For our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>He that is not with me, is againſt me.</hi> But the moſt Divine Sanctity of the Apoſtolical Seat, is not, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be againſt him <hi>(Jeſus Chriſt)</hi> Therefore the tenor of the foreſaid Letter is not conſonant to the Apoſtolick Sanctity; but very much abſonant and diſcordant: Firſt, becauſe of the ſuper acoumulated <hi>Non obſtante of that Letter, and ſuch like,</hi> that are diſperſed far and wide, not brought in by any neceſſity of obſerving the Law of Nature; whence a deluge of inconſtancy, audaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and procacity, immodeſty, lying, deceiving, hardly believing or truſting any doth ariſe: And from theſe a deluge of innumerable vices, moving and troubling the purity of the Ghriſtian Religion, and the tranquility of ſocial humane converſation.</p>
               <p>Moreover, next after the ſin of <hi>Lucifer, which in the later times will be alſo the ſin of Antichriſt the Son of perdition,</hi> which the Lord will deſtroy with the ſpirit of his mouth, there neither is, nor can be any other kind of ſin ſo adverſe and contrary to the Apoſtles and the Evangelical Doctrine, and ſo hateful, deteſtable and abominable to our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelf, as to kill and deſtroy ſouls by defrauding them of the care of the Paſtoral Office and Miniſtry: Which ſin they are by moſt evident
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:62986:169"/>
teſtimonies of Sacred Scripture known to commit, who being placed in the power of Paſtoral Care, do get the ſalary of the Paſtoral Office and Miniſtry, from the milk and fleece of the ſheep of Chriſt, who are to be made alive and ſaved, but admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter not their dues. For the very not adminiſtring of the Paſtoral Miniſteries, is, by the Scripture Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, the killing and deſtroying of the Sheep. And that theſe two ſorts of ſins (though with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity) are the worſt, and ineſtimably ſuperexceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every other ſort of ſin, is manifeſt by this, in that they are (though with diſparity and diſſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) directly contrary to the two ſaid exiſtent things that are beſt: For that is the worſt thing that is contrary to the beſt: And as much as lieth in the ſaid ſinners. One of theſe ſins is the deſtruction of the very Deity, which is ſupereſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, and ſupernaturally Beſt; the other is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of the Deiformity and Deification, which is Beſt Eſſentially and Naturally by the gracious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipations of the beams of the Deity. And becauſe, as in good things, the Cauſe of good is better than its Eflect; ſo alſo in evils, the Cauſe of evil is worſe than its Effect. And it is manifeſt that the Introducers of ſuch moſt evil Murderers of this Deiformity and Deification in the Sheep of Chriſt, in the Church of God, are worſe than theſe moſt evil Murderers themſelves, and neereſt to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> and Antichriſt; and in this pejority they are gradually the worſt, by how much they ſuperexcel, ſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It cannot be therefore that a moſt holy Apoſtolick Seat (to which
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:62986:169"/>
by our moſt holy Lord Jeſus Chriſt, all power is given, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, for Edification, and not for Deſtruction) ſhould ever command, bid, or any way endeavour any ſuch thing, or any thing verg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards ſuch a ſin, ſo odious, deteſtable and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo utterly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieious to mankind. For this were either a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or a corruption, or an abuſe of his evidently moſt holy and full power, or an utter elongation from the Throne of the Glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the neareſt coaſſeſſion in the Chair of Pestilence, to the two foreſaid Princes of darkneſs, and of the pains of Hell. No one that in immaculate and ſincere obedience is ſubject and faithful to the ſame Seat, and not by Schiſm cut off from the Body of Chriſt, and the ſame holy Seat, can obey (ſuch) Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates or Precepts, or any endeavours whatever, whenceſoever they flow, though it were from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Order of Angels <note n="*" place="margin">Or <hi>Anglorum,</hi> for its a various Lection.</note>, but muſt neceſſarily with his whole power contradict them and rebel: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Reverend Lords, from the duty of obedience and ſidelity, which I owe to the Parent of the holy Apoſtolical Seat, and out of the Love of Union in the Body of Chriſt with it, I do alone <hi>(unice)</hi> filially and obediently diſobey, contradict and rebel againſt the things contained in the foreſaid Letter, and eſpecially as is before touched, they most evidently verge towards the ſin which is moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and moſt pernicious to mankind, and are altogether adverſe to the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of the Apoſtolical Seat, and are contrary to the Catholick Faith. Nor may your diſcretion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determine any thing hard againſt me, becauſe all my contradiction and action in this Cauſe is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:62986:170"/>
contradiction or rebellion, but a filial honouring of Gods command due to a Father, and of you. Brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recollecting all; I ſay, that the holineſs of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Seat can do (or hath power to do) nothing but that which tendeth to edification, and not to deſtruction <note n="*" place="margin">But a Papiſt will ſay, who ſhall be Judge?

               <p>PAge 30, 31. 1. Simplicity above all things beſeeineth an Oath: That is, The nature and obligation of an Oath is ſuch, that whoever ſhall bind himſelf by ſo ſacred a bond to do any thing, he may be altogether held by the Religion of an Oath, and ſeriouſly from his heart intend, and as much as in him lyeth, diligently endeavour faithfully to do all that which he hath promiſed
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:62986:170"/>
to do, without all craft, fraud, or ill deceit or diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation. (See the reſt there)</p>
               <p>Page 32, 33, 34. Contrary to this ſimplicity of an Oath, are two ſorts of ſimulation; one as to the foregoing part, which is either antecedent or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant with the act of ſwearing: of which, though the former be the worſer, yet neither of them is free from perjury. <hi>David</hi> ſeemeth to comprehend both in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. and 24. <hi>[He that ſweareth not deceitfully,</hi> that is, <hi>with a mind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive—</hi>And <hi>He that ſweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not]</hi> that is, who when he hath bound himſelf by an Oath, will rather, even to his own great loſs, perform that which he incommodiouſly ſwore, than for any temporal commodity violate his faith.—Theſe things the greater part of men now in being, ſeem to me not to think of, or not ſeriouſly; who fear not to ſwear without any ambage prolixly, and in the very words, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is propoſed to them, by ſuch as have power to do them hurt: Yea and think themſelves the only wiſe men, and diſdainfully deride their ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and vain fear, who, leſt they hurt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, forſooth, do ſeek a knot in a ruſh, and vex (or ſollicit) the <hi>forms preſcribed</hi> by ſuch as can proſcribe them: And they ſecurely free themſelves from all crime and fear of Perjury, and think they have well cared for themſelves and their conſciences, if when they ſwear, like the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, they can but any how defend themſelves, by tacite equivocations, or mental reſervations, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle forced interpretations, and quite allen from the words: Or elſe after they have ſworn, can find out ſome artificial evaſion, as a hole to get out by, as the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:62986:171"/>
that taking the words, yet the ſenſe may be elud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome Sophiſm, and all the force of it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be enervated. The old Chriſtians received not this Theology: The ſounder Heathens received not this Moral Philoſophy: Much otherwiſe out of them, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine [<q>They are perjured who keeping the words; deceive the expectation of them that they ſwear to</q>]</hi> And otherwiſe, ſaith <hi>Cicero,</hi> 
                  <q>[<hi>That is to be kept which is ſo ſworn as the mind of the Impoſen conceived it ſhould be done.</hi>]</q> Read the proofs, p. 34, &amp;c. 1. From many Texts of Scripture: 2. From God's own example: 3. From the nature of Truth: 4. From the end of an Oath, p. 38. which is the confirmation of a doubtful matter; that is, that of things otherwiſe uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and depending on humane credit, there ſhould be had ſuch certainty as humane affairs require. For an Oath was inſtituted by God, by force of the Light of Natue, for a remedy of humane defects about Truth; that among mortals it ſhould be Truths laſt garriſon, as oft as all other kinds of proof do fail. But this end would be wholly overthrown, and there could be no certain credit among men, if it were free for the ſwearer, at his own arbiterment, what he ſpeaketh in words to cauſe belief, by ſome tacite ambiguity in ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or after he hath ſworn, by finding out ſome new, and as it were, poſthumous comment ſo to diſable it, as that it ſhall loſe all its force, and be utterly ineffectual. If either of theſe were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an Oath ſhould not be the end of ſtrife, but the beginning, and ſhould rather give occaſion for new contradictions and ſtrifes, than end the old ones.

whereof ſome eff<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ge or lurking-hole may not he deviſed, whereby it may be freed from being a lie. In the mean time, what perverſeneſs, is it that That ſhould by diſhoneſt men be turned into an inſtrument of deceiving, which was inſtituted by the moſt wiſe God to be a help to credit (or mens belief of one another?) Verily, unleſs one will rather uſe God's ſacred inſtitution to another purpoſe, than that to which it was inſtituted (which a godly man will not eaſily do) that which is the end of an Oath, the ſame ought to be the end of the ſwearer: And that is, ſo to make the hearer to believe, that he may become more certain and ſecure of the Truth of that which before was doubtful. But he that diſſembleth, ſtudieth to breed a falſe belief in the hearers, and ſo doth not only ſuffer another to be deceived (which yet is contrary to Charity when he may and ought to hinder it;) but alſo intendeth to deceive; which is not only againſt all Juſtice and Honeſty, but it is alſo conjoyned with the greateſt wrong to God, and contempt of his name. And verily to me ſcarce any other ſort of <hi>Perjury</hi> doth more diametrically ſeem to be againſt either the ſcope of the third Commandment, or the very words (of not taking the name of God in vain) than that which ariſeth from this diſſimulation. For as the word Vanity doth properly and adequately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all that which is any way falſe; ſo in a certain peculiar ſort, and moſt properly, that which is ſo falſe as yet to bear a ſhew of Truth. (See the reſt.)</p>
               <p>The ſecond which pertaineth to the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Oath, is this, <hi>The Obligation of an Oath is of ſtrict right—</hi>That is of ſo juſt an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:62986:172"/>
of right, that the words of the Law may not be drawn further than is meet for the ſake or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of any party; nor conſtrained to ſerve any mans fact or commodity. In a word, <hi>ſtrict Right,</hi> is not here taken ſo as to exclude an interpretation tempered with equity, but to exclude an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Law (or right) corrupted by favour (or for any ones ſake)—The extreams are <hi>A Rigid</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and <hi>A Favourable—A Juſt</hi> interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the mean between both, which ſearcheth after the true and genuine ſenſe of the Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect at all to perſons, out of natural equity and juſtice, and from the words themſelves, as they agree with equity and juſtice. And if this may be plainly made out in the words themſelves, that it is in every caſe ſimply to be retained.—See the reſt.</p>
               <p>P. 45. When I ſay that an Oath is of <hi>ſtrict right,</hi> it is ſo to be underſtood, that the meaning of the Oath, which is plain enough in the words, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be held. But where the ſenſe is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, every one muſt take great heed, leſt we too much indulge our ſelves, and our own affections; and leſt we grant our ſelves too liberal and lax a licenſe of interpreting, that we may the eaſilier get our ſelves out of the bond of the Oath which we are tyed by; and leſt we faſten (or ſeign) any ſenſe on the Oath taken, or on any part of it, for our own commodity or profits ſake, which any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pious and prudent man, of a freer judgment as not intereſſed in the cauſe, would not eaſily draw from the very words themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is twofold; one in reſpect to others, for fear of ſcandal, leſt any that is weak, drawn by our example, think he may do that which he ſeeth
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:62986:172"/>
us do, though unacquainted with thoſe ſubtitues, by which only we uſe to defend our ſelves from the crime of Perjury. The other in reſpect of our ſelves, for ſear of perjury; which moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous crime undoubtedly we commit, if that more benig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> interpretation chance to deceive us, which made us bold to take the Oath. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reſteth on that general, and moſt profitable rule, which bids us <hi>[in doubtful caſes take the ſafe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſide:]</hi> But it is the ſafer <hi>not to ſwear, when the words of the propoſed Oath, according to the common and obvious ſenſe of the words, ſeem to contain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unlawful in them;</hi> rather than by a <hi>Lax In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> ſo to ſoften them for our own uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we may the more ſecurely ſwear them: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we know that ſuch an Oath may be refuſed without danger of perjury, but we know not that it can be taken without danger or fear of it.</p>
               <p>P. 46, 47, 197. Yet we muſt take heed that this <hi>ſtrict</hi> interpretation turn not into a Rigid one—of common right theſe exceptions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions (of promiſſory Oaths) are ever underſtood: [1. <hi>If God permit:</hi> 2. <hi>Saving the Right of others.</hi> And, <hi>as far as is lawful; ſaving the Right of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours:</hi> 3. <hi>Things ſtanding as they do,</hi> or <hi>in the ſame ſtate: As far as I am able,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
               <p>P. 49. But if any admit more dubious excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he boldly and raſhly removeth God's boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of an Oath, and openeth a wide door to all kind of Perjury.</p>
               <p>P. 193: The third Caſe is, when one impoſeth an Oath of an ambiguous ſenſe, only requiring that thoſe words be ſworn, permitting the ſwearer to underſtand the words in what ſenſe he will: I ſay, it muſt deſervedly be ſuſpected that an Oath
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:62986:173"/>
offered on ſuch a condition hath ſome latent ill deceit, and therefore is to be refuſed by a pious and prudent man; &amp; to me ſeemeth to be diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for three cauſes: 1. In reſpect to the Oath it ſelf, in which <hi>Truth</hi> is firſt required: But a ſpeech of indefinite and ambiguous ſenſe before diſtinction made, is no true propoſition; yea, no propoſition at all; when a propoſition, as Boys know, ſhould ſignifie truth or falſhood without ambiguity. 2. In reſpect of him to whom we ſwear: For the proper end of an Oath is, that he to whom it is made have ſome certainty of a thing before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. 3. In reſpect to the ſwearer himſelf, who if he take an Oath in ſuch condition, prepareth either a ſcandal for his neighbour, or a ſnare for himſelf. For ſuch colluſion cannot be imagined to look any other way, than either to draw others by our example to take the ſame Oath (though with a reluctant conſcience) which is to ſcandalize our neigbour: or that ſomewhat elſe he after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us to be done by virtue of that Oath, which is either unlawful, or incommodious; which is to lay a ſnare for our ſelves. Let a wiſe man therefore take heed that he ſuffer not himſelf to be impoſed on by theſe Arts; or leſt he ſo much value the favour or fear of any other man, as to ſwallow the bait when he knoweth that the hook is under it. Verily, that all may be rightly done when you ſwear, it is expedient that all parties be clearly agreed of the ſenſe of the words that are intereſſed in the matter; which by the Antients was called <hi>[Liquido jurare]</hi>
               </p>

                     </gap>]</hi> For though it be certain that we ought not to take the Oath, which we know that we ought not to keep; yet it may come to paſs, and often doth, that we ought to perform that which we ought not to have taken <hi>Joſhuas</hi> Covenant with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> is a moſt clean example of this.—An Oath may be ſaid to be unlawful two waies; either as to the <hi>matter ſworn,</hi> or as to the Act of <hi>ſwearing.</hi> An Oath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful as to the matter ſworn, bindeth not at all. An Oath unlawful in reſpect to the Act of <hi>ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> bindeth, unleſs otherwaies hindered.</p>
               <p>P. 74, 75. A thing lawful in it ſelf may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful by accident;—as by the errour of the ſwearer, or the ill effect of the thing ſworn. The third Caſe is, <hi>When one promiſeth by an Oath to do ſomewhat perhaps lawful in it ſelf, which yet he thinketh unlawful, or at leaſt ſeareth leſt it be not lawful:</hi> As if any one before theſe times, admitted to an Eccleſiaſtical Benefice, had <hi>promiſed</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in Publick Worſhip all the Rites commanded by the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, as the Surplice, the ſign of the Croſs at the ſacred Font, kneeling in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament, and ſuch like, which yet by ſome light prejudice he thought were ſuperſtitious and Popiſh. The queſtion is, <hi>What obligation there is in this caſe?</hi> I ſay, 1. Such an Oath cannot be taken during ſuch errour, without grievous ſin. For he ſinneth grievouſly that ſinneth againſt his conſcience, though erroneous. For when the Judgment of the Intellect is every ones neareſt
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:62986:174"/>
Rule of action, the will, if it follow not, that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment failing from its Rule, muſt needs be carried into ſin. It's a common ſaying, <hi>[He that doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his conſcience, buildeth to Hell.]</hi> Verily he that ſweareth what he thinketh unlawful, would ſwear if it were indeed unlawful; &amp; that becometh unlawful to him that is lawful to another; as the Apoſtle judgeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 14—2. <hi>I ſay, ſuch an Oath doth not bind—</hi>Becauſe an Oath cannot take away a former obligation, nor induce another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation contrary to it. But that Oath which is taken againſt the dictate of conſcience, had a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer obligation ariſing from that dictate. For the dictate of conſcience, whether right or erroneous, alwaies obligeth, at leaſt not to act againſt it. But a following Oath cannot remove that obligation, but is it ſelf invalid, and loſeth its obliging force. 3. But if the ſwearer after better taught, do ſee and correct his errour, the Oath which bound him not before, beginneth then to bind him:</p>
               <p>P. 77. Other Caſes there are of things by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident unlawful, by reaſon of ill effects of the thing it ſelf; as it may be a hinderer of a greater good, or a cauſe, at leaſt an occaſion of evil.—The fourth Caſe is, when the thing ſworn ſeemeth unlawful, as hindering the effect of ſome antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent good, as of a Vow or Promiſe made before: As if one that had before-hand bound himſelf to ſome work of Piety or Charity, after take an Oath that hindereth the fulfilling of the former Vow. As if one that vowed to give half his gain weekly to the poor, ſhall after ſwear to give it all to the war:—This caſe hath no difficulty; I plainly anſwer,—ſuch an Oath is neither lawful nor obligatory, becauſe that the former obligation,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:62986:174"/>
whenceſoever contracted, whether by Covenant or by Vow, or by bare Promiſe, or by meer Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (or Duty) remaineth valid, and puts a bar to every following contrary act.—</p>

P. 208. He is alwaies perjured that intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what he promiſed: but he is not alwaies perjured that performeth not what he promiſed. (The bond being diſſolved.)</p>

               <p>P. 242. Concl. 4. It is a grievous ſin to impoſe an Oath unduly, on another. As 1. An Oath not ſtabliſhed by Law or Cuſtom, &amp;c. 2. An Oath that is repugnant, or in the ſenſe that the words hold forth in the common uſe of ſpeaking, <hi>ſeemeth</hi> repugnant to any Oath by him formerly lawfully taken. 3. They that conſtrain men to ſwear to a thing unlawful, as againſt our duty to God, or our Superiours, or the Laws of the Kingdom, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt good manners, or that which is otherwiſe diſhoneſt, and may not be kept. 4. He who impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth an Oath of ambiguous ſenſe, or any way captious; to enſnare the conſcience, life, liberty or fortune of his neighbour. 5. He that without neceſſity, by fear compelleth, or by Authority impelleth, or by counſel, example, fraud, or other artifice or reaſon induceth another to ſwear, who he knoweth will ſwear againſt the judgment of his conſcience. I would all men in great power would remember how filthy a character <hi>Jeroboam</hi> branded his own conſcience, fame and name with, that made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin: and how greatly they provoke God's great wrath againſt themſelves, that abuſe their power to other mens ruine, which
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:62986:175"/>
God gave them for edification, and not for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>P. 243. Concl. 5. An offered Oath is not to be taken with a reluctant or doubting conſcience: 1. Becauſe what is not of faith is ſin. 2. Becauſe we muſt ſwear in judgment, which he doth not that ſweareth againſt his conſciences Judgment. 3. Becauſe this is done for ſome temporal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, or to avoid ſome loſs, or obtain ſome gain, or to get ſome mans favour, or ſuch like: But how unworthy of a Chriſtian is it, to ſet God behind the World, Heaven behind Earth, the Soul behind the Body, eternal joy behind temporal gain, the hope of the life to come behind preſent eaſe, inward peace behind outward! 4. Becauſe he that ſo ſweareth evidently expoſeth himſelf to the danger of Perjury (a moſt heinous ſin.) For he that for hope or fear of any temporal commodity or diſcommodity can be induced to ſwear that which he ought not, it is ſcarce credible but he may by the like hope or fear be drawn from doing what he ſwore. And PERJURY was by the very heathens accounted one of thoſe moſt heinous ſins, which they believed would bring the wrath of the Gods not only on the guilty, but on their poſterity, yea on whole nations, much more is it to be feared of us, who worſhip that one true God, who hath ſolemnly profeſſed that he will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his name in vain. Leſt, while which way ever we look we ſee ſuch a great and luxuriant crop of Oaths and Perjury even already white to the Harveſt, God the moſt righteous judge ſhould quickly put in the ſickle, utterly to cut down ſo perfidious and profane a nation. We have long felt that our moſt merciful
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:62986:176"/>
Father is angry, and that the infinite patience of God is turned into fury, being infinitely wronged, and (if I may ſo ſay) overcome. It is not eaſy to ſay, for which ſins this chiefly is, when all ſins are very great. But verily he that will ſeriouſly think, ſince God hath begun to ſcourge us by a neerer rod, how we have not grieved for theſe grievous ſins of ſwearing and perjury, yea how greatly on one ſide is increaſed, the unbridled and unpuniſhed licence of ſwearing and blaſpheming, and on the other ſide the ſoul hypocriſie of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing on pretence of religion; it can ſcarce be, but that of <hi>Jeremy</hi> will come into his mind, <hi>Becauſe of Oaths the land mourneth.</hi> Theſe things being to neer, Fathers and Brethren, we that are here and all others that wiſh well to the publick peace of the Kingdom and Church and the private peace of their own hearts and conſciences, muſt be intreated that they firſt carefully beware of the name of God, and the crime of violated fidelity, and wholly avoid unneceſſary Oaths, and conſtantly refuſe thoſe that are unduely impoſed (or offered) by others; and fulfill thoſe faithfully that are duly and rightly taken by our ſelves; and then that as much as we are able, we ſtrenuouſly reſtrain the liberty of ſinning in others; and that we pray to our moſt Good and Great God continually that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught by his ſcourge, and admoniſhed, and humbled under his mighty hand, we fly to his mercy, acknowledge his juſtice, implore his grace, for the pardon of our ſins, the amendment of our lives, and the ſafety of our ſouls, by and for the merits of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: To whom with the Father, and the Spirit, the Three one-Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent God be Kingdom, Power, and Glory for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

It's like Dr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> had ſome ſpecial eye to the Scots Covenant; but doubtleſs he made not any new or ſingular Doctrine for that end, which will not hold true in all caſes by him deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Rich.

               </p>
               <p>And page 73. <hi>[They muſt be accountable at the laſt day, not only for their own ſin, but for that very ſin of Perjury, which the vicious Prieſt is guilty of: For he that inviteth a man to a ſin, is reckoned as if he had committed the ſin himſelf.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then would become of me, if I undertook to juſtifie the Perjury of multitudes?—yea, if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I did by Preſs and Preaching, earneſtly preſs Magiſtrates to execute the Laws upon many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Chriſts Miniſters, becauſe they dare not venture on that which they fear (on ſuch reaſons as are here rendred) to be a participation of many

thouſand Perjuries, nor on the heinous ſacriledge of deſerting their ſacred function, and encouraging neer two thouſand ſilenced Miniſters to do the like by my example, beſides many other feared ſins. If I were the man that for this did plead and beg that they might be laid in Gaols with rogues, and pay fourty pound a ſermon and be baniſhed five miles from all Corporations &amp;c. and all this as neceſſary to the Church and as for God, fathering it all on him who is the God of Truth and Love; and pretending that there is no need of their Miniſtry, becauſe that I and ſuch as I, do better perform all that office againſt ignorance, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and popery without them, &amp;c. How could I expect regard when I preached againſt the ſins of others? Or with what face could I do it? When my ſin ſhall be opened to me, muſt I not with <hi>Origen</hi> after his fall, inſtead of preaching, ſhut the book, and weep, remembring <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16, 17. and the dreadful third Commandment; and tremble when I thought of death and judgment?

[While I long wondered that I could not ſee what ſatisfied both all the Learned Convocation, and the Parliament, for the <hi>truth of the Rule in the Liturgy to find out Eaſter-day for ever,</hi> which is contrary to our Almanacks, and we muſt all be ſilenced (and ruined for Preaching) unleſs we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that we <hi>Aſſent to it,</hi> I met with no Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt that gave me any other ſatisfaction, than to refer me to Dr. <hi>Pells</hi> Book: And meeting him happily, I craved his information; and the grave, learned, honeſt Doctor was ſo far from making me a Conformiſt, that he profeſſed the paſſage now is indefenſible.]</p>
               <p>I was lately aſſaulted with this, as the ſtrongeſt Argument for Conformity <hi>[Deliberate lying is no ſin, but a duty when it doth no</hi> harm but a <hi>neceſſary good; As by a Phyſician to ſave his patient, or to ſave a mans life much more to ſave ſouls by preaching.</hi>
