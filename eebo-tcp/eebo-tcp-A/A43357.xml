            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>FOR an Author to court the Reader by an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> into good humour, is as cuſtomary, and every whit as eſſential a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant of writing, as ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to Bodies, or Envy to Virtue. For I am not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that by the expoſing of this Book, I ſhall expoſe my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf too, to the cenſure of thoſe who take meaſure of every thing by their petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant humours, and have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to ſet off their own
<pb facs="tcp:94417:3"/>
barren inventions, but by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual invectives againſt the multitude of Books which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear every day in the world; whereas indeed the miſchiefs which they complain of, have proceeded not from their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but quality.</p>
            <p>For ſhould every man write an exact Narrative of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious experiences and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Life, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending as well his Vices as Vertues, and them with ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity related, how uſeful would this prove to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, though it would much encreaſe the number? But this ſo impartial an account may rather be wiſhed for, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
<pb facs="tcp:94417:3"/>
ſince men have ever preferred, their own private Reputation before the real good of themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>The Book here offered to peruſal, though it be none of thoſe before-named in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, yet is it a true Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Man in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and having found no leſs Profit than Pleaſure in the Reading of it my ſelf, I could not be detained by a thouſand imperfections which I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it labours under (as well in words as matter) from offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to thoſe who are will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make the improvement which might be made, by a Proſpect of <hi>Humane Miſery.</hi>

               <p>MANY of the Ancient Philoſophers, upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act conſideration, and curious inquiſition into the Nature and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Living of all Creatures whatſoever, have joyntly cry'd out, That amongſt all thoſe which breathe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94417:8"/>
upon the face of the Earth, there's none more Miſerable than Man. Others more rigorous cenſurers of the works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have began to Blaſpheme againſt her, calling her a Step-dame rather than a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and indulgent Mother. Some there have been, that have deplored all their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Calamities whereunto we are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: And ſuch a one was <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> who perſwaded himſelf, that whatſoever we could contemplate under the Cope of Heaven, was nothing elſe but a real Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of Sorrow and Miſery, and worthy of nothing but continued Lamentation and Pity. Others there have been, who have teſtified their paſſion by an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Laughing: And ſuch a one was <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus,</hi> who ſhould he come again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, and ſhould behold the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and confuſions wherein lieth our Chriſtian World, he would have juſt cauſe to heighten and redouble his Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. There has been another kind alſo of Philoſophers, but of a humor more ſtrange than the former, who were not contented to murmur againſt Nature and her effects but by a particular hatred and animoſity, have ſet themſelves againſt Man, their fellow Creature, imagining that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had ſet him as a mark againſt which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94417:8"/>
ſhe would let fly all her Arrows of rage and fury: Amongſt which was <hi>Timon</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Philoſopher, who hath been the moſt affectionate Patriarch of his Sect, and who declared himſelf an open and Capital Enemy of all Men, and witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame in the preſence of every one, and in all places wherever he came; and indeed effectually confirmed it; for he would not be converſant with any man, but dwelt all his life time with brute Beaſts in a Deſart: neither did it ſuffice him to have men in hatred and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, and to avoid their company, but as if they were ſome wild and furious Beaſts, he ſought all means that might deſtroy them: and for that purpoſe he cauſed ſeveral Gallows and Gibbets to be made and ſet up, that all poſſeſſed with deſpair and wearineſs of Living, might hang themſelves thereon; till having at laſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to accomodate himſelf, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large and alter his dwelling, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to pull them down for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of his building: but before he does ſo; he haſtneth with all poſſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to <hi>Athens,</hi> where with piteous and lamentable complaints, Herald-wiſe, he gathers the people, who hearing the hoarſe and barbarous Voice of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94417:9"/>
Monſter, and knowing of a great while his accuſtomed humour, ran to him with the greateſt eagerneſs imaginable to hear what now was the matter with him: who harangued to them after this, or the like manner: <q>O ye Citizens of <hi>Athens!</hi> If any of you have a deſire to hang himſelf, let him haſt quickly and uſe no delays, for I am neceſſitated to cut down (ſore againſt my will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination) my Gallows and Gibbets.</q> And having in ſuch like terms as theſe expreſſed his Charity to them, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Deſart, where he ſpent all his days to the laſt, without changing his humor; and ceaſed not to Philoſophize and ruminate upon Human Miſeries all the reſt of his life time, even to the time of his expiration; and then deteſting our Humanity, ordained expreſly, that he ſhould be Buried as much as could be out of the ſight of any one: and to that end no place would ſerve him but the edg of the Sea, that by the fury and repercuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of its Waves and Billows, all Perſons might be hindred from coming near him: And cauſed this <hi>Epitaph</hi> recited by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> to be Ingraven on his Tomb-ſtone:</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94417:9"/>
                  <l>Having my life in miſery conſum'd,</l>
                  <l>I here in boiſtrous waves do lye intomb'd;</l>
                  <l>And he that would dire <hi>Timons</hi> Corps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move,</l>
                  <l>Ten thouſand Plagues confound him from above.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Here you may behold this poor Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher through too much conſideration of Human Miſery, vehemently deſiring not to have been at all, rather than to have been what he was; and rather to have been a brute, or Irrational Creature, than a Man. But let us leave the Philoſopher <hi>Timon</hi> making his complaints, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Humour: And let us hearken to the juſt Sentiments of that great and no leſs Philoſopher than Emperour <hi>Marc. Aurelius,</hi> who profoundly weighing and conſidering the frailties and miſeries with which we are encompaſſed and beſieged, cry'd out, that the battel of this Life is ſo perilous, the iſſue ſo terrible and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that I do aſſure my ſelf, ſaith he, that ſhould ſome Ancient man come from the dead, and ſhould relate all the paſſages of his life ſince the hour he came from his Mothers Womb, until the day of his Diſſolution; and ſhould recount in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94417:10"/>
Series of Diſcourſe, all Pains and Sorrows which he hath ſuffered: there can certainly be none but would ſtand aſtoniſhed with horror and amazement at the hearing of ſo deplorable a relation. That which I have experienced and made tryal of in my ſelf, ſaith this great and moſt worthy Emperour, I will freely and ingenuouſly confeſs, though it may be, that ſo doing may turn to my diſgrace and infamy; but perhaps to the profit and advantage of future Ages. I have lived fifty years, and have tryed what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and ſatisfaction is to be had in vice and wickedneſs: and truly ſaith he, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a full experience I have found, That the more I eat, the more I hunger: the more I drink, the more I thirſt; the more I ſleep, the more I am deſirous of ſleeping; the more I repoſe, the more I am wearied; the more I have, the more I covet; the more I ſeek, the leſs I find: and finally, I never had any thing in my poſſeſſion with which I was fully contented and ſatisfied, and deſired not preſently to have another as paſſionately as the former; which the great Docter St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerving, hath much admired; after he had bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Calamities of this Life, and the hideous obſcurities wherein we are invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94417:10"/>
wiſhed that he had ſuch a voice that might be heard of every one, that he might inculcate that of the Royal Prophet <hi>David, O ye Sons of men! How long will ye love vanity! how long will you harden your hearts to go on in purſuit of falſe and killing pleaſures!</hi> For whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall conſider the ſtate and manner of the World, the Frauds, Fallacies, Rapes, Inceſts and Adulteries, Violences, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, Ambition and Covetouſneſs, Hatred and Animoſity, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, he may well ſay that we draw nigh to the time of which ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> with ſo great earneſtneſs and lamentation, when he ſaith, <hi>Your iniquities hath made a ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and your God, and your ſins have hid his face from you, that he may not hear you; for your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity, your lips have uttered lyes, and your tongues deceit; no one loveth Juſtice; theres none that doth according to Equity.</hi> St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> in a complaint and lamentation that he made concerning the Miſery of this Life, teacheth man to know his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and weakneſs, without drawing him from himſelf; ſo that by the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf, he might be moved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94417:11"/>
his vileneſs and infelicity. <q>O man! ſaith he, Who art blind and naked, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of human fleſh, and a reaſonable ſoul, have in mind thy miſerable ſtate and condition; wherefore forgetteſt thou, and remembreſt not thy ſelf, and that which ſo nearly concerns thee? wherefore doſt thou fondling-like dote on external, ſhort, and deceitful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and doſt not conſider, that the more near thou approacheſt to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of this world, the farther thou eſtrangeſt thy ſelf from the Joys of the next: the more thou thinkeſt to gain from without, the more thou loſeſt from within; the more thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of temporal things, the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent thou art of ſpiritual things? thou ordereſt and diſpoſeſt of other matters ſo well, and doſt thou contemn and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thy ſelf? There's no Creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeve but thou canſt tame and maſter, and canſt thou not rule and govern thy ſelf; thou art vigilant and watchful in other mens affairs, and art drowzy in thoſe which are properly thine own; thy heart boileth within thee with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of thoſe low things, and divine and Heavenly concerns lye altogether neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected `and deſpiſed by thee: the nearer
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94417:11"/>
thou approacheſt to death, the farther thou removeſt thy ſelf from thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; thou takeſt ſo much pains, and art at ſo much coſt to nouriſh and adorn this body which is but a veſſel of filth, and a Sepulcher of worms and rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and leaveſt thy poor ſoul, which is the Image of God, and Idea of Eternal Wiſdom, altogether neglected.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the complaints which this holy man made in his retirements againſt the Ingratitude and wickedneſs of this World; all which things deduced by him and others, tend to no other end, than to ſtir up Man to the conſideration and knowledg of himſelf, and to ſhew him how vile a Creature he is, that he may at all times learn to conſider that he is in the hands of God, <hi>as the clay and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en veſſel is in the hands of the Potter;</hi> which he may make, unmake, form, break, repair, and deſtroy even as it pleaſeth him, without any injury, or ſuſpicion of injuſtice; which needs but one puſh, and falls immediately and is broken; and yet let what miſery ſoever light upon him, he knoweth not, nor humbleth himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Yoke of his Almighty Creator.</p>

               <p>SO now, having conſidered Mans Eſtate univerſally, it's requiſite to Diſcourſe more largely of this matter, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template and conſider him more nearly. And becauſe that amongſt all Ethnicks, <hi>Pliny</hi> hath beſt Philoſophiz'd on our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, we ſhall produce his Teſtimony, That Chriſtians to their great confuſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, may receive their Inſtruction from a <hi>Pagan,</hi> without God, without Law, without any Ways being illuminated with the light Evangelical: <q>Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, ſaith he, a little, how that man is forced to cover his body at the expence and charge of other Creatures, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favoured with the Liberality of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, bring from the womb of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the one Feathers, the other Hair and Hides,</q>—the grace and favour of whom reacheth even to the Trees and Plants, the latter of which are provided with barks and rinds, as ſheilds or covers
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94417:12"/>
to defend them againſt the violence of the cold, and injury of the heat: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, to ſhow in what great contempt and diſeſteem ſhe has Man in, ſhe hath brought him forth naked upon the Earth, out of diſdain as it were, as an abortive Fruit and Production: and at the day of his birth, made over and aſſign'd cries and tears for his Portion, which are the preſages of his future Calamities and Miſeries. Here you may behold the chief and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal works of Nature, for whom all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures are Created; who is ſo frail and weak of himſelf, that if he be abandoned of the help and ſuccours of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he would certainly periſh. Behold him when he cometh out from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb, and you'l ſee him bound and ty'd, ſprawling and graveling on the Earth: him who is alone born to Pride and Inſolency, that beginneth his life with pain and ſorrow: How long is it before he hath the uſe of his ſpeech? When the uſe of his feet, to how many Maladies and Diſtempers is he ſubject; other Creatures know their natures and abilities, but Man knows nothing, except he learn and is taught it, and underſtandeth nothing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally but to weep and lament: Amongſt all living Creatures, he is moſt ſubject to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94417:13"/>
Pain, Ambition, Avarice, boundleſs deſire of living: he alone is born to Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to fears and anxiety, in reſpect of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture events: In ſhort, he is ſubject to Anger and Enmity: other Creatures live in peace, and Amity with thoſe of their own kind: but Man alone is enemy to Man: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that other Creatures might be acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, Nature has provided them with houſes and habitations, to defend them from the injuries and extremities of the weather. As for Beaſts ſhe hath helped them to Caves and Dens. And to Birds and Fowls, the Trees and Buſhes. As for the <hi>Tortois</hi> and <hi>Snail,</hi> ſhe hath ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated them; that wherever they go, they carry their houſes with them.

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Beaſts and Irrational Creatures advantages over us, further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in reſpect of thoſe many Diſeaſes wherewith Man is Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, partly by Nature, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his own Intemperance.</head>
               <p>FUrthermore, if we compare the health and ſtrength of other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with our own, we ſhall find that they have a marvellous advantage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us; for nature hath indued us with a temperament ſo weak and infirm, and ſubject to ſo many kinds of Maladies, that ſcarcely we are ever perfectly freed from them: She hath alſo charged Man with ſuch an unſatiable Appetite of eating, that he ceaſeth not continually to ſeek for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties; and having found to his taſt and reliſh, he cannot, without great reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, abſtain from taking in ſo much as may turn to his prejudice; whence proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Rhumes, and Catarrhs, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company of Diſtempers: But as to other Animals, they content themſelves
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94417:14"/>
with that which Nature has prepared for them, without violating their natures, that they may pleaſe their Appetite: Moreover, ſhe has given them a temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of body ſo exactly regular, that they ſeldom or never take more than what is requiſite for their nouriſhment and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, either as to eating or drinking: But as to Man, all the Fruits of the Earth, all ſorts of Herbs, Plants and Roots, the Fiſhes of the Sea, and the Birds of the Air do not ſuffice him, but he muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, vary, and ſophiſticate, change the ſubſtance into accident, that by ſuch irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as theſe, Nature might be provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as it were neceſſitated. The Stomach being over-charged and filled, makes all the ſenſes ſo confus'd and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that there's not one of them that can exerciſe their office; and I am aſham'd that I muſt ſay, that the exceeding great Luxury which reigns at preſent amongſt Chriſtians, cauſeth many that they ſtick not to abandon their members to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of villany and wickedneſs, though never fo vile and abominable; and it's a wonder to me that many mens Bellies are not corrupted and putrified, by reaſon of their exceſs and Luxury! and in the mean time poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> lies in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94417:14"/>
Streets, and at Dores, being ready to periſh and dye with hunger, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the crumbs, though he never ſo much need them that fall from the rich Man's Table. And ſuch Gormands as theſe, are well call'd by the Prophet <hi>bruit Beaſts;</hi> for their ſouls and ſpirits, which are the better part of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo perfum'd and inebriated with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and luxury, are retain'd captive as in a dark Dungeon; and their Senſes and Faculties, which are the inſtruments they ought to make uſe of, are buried and intombed as in the intrails of ſome brutiſh Animals: And againſt ſuch Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons as theſe, who make their Belly their god and only deity, exclaimeth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; <hi>Wo to you that riſe early to follow drunkenneſs unto the even, that you may ſtupifie your ſences with wine.</hi> Which Vice is ſo common and familiar amongſt men, that there is ſcarcely any Nation or Province, who are not infected with it, and who glory and vaunt not in their boundleſs and unmeaſurable drinking. The <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Greeks,</hi> have celebrated Drunkenneſs amongſt their greateſt Pomps and Triumphs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained either to Drink, and do as they did, or depart and leave their company.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94417:15"/>
The <hi>Macedons</hi> were inſtructed and taught by their Emperor <hi>Alexander,</hi> to Drink without meaſure. But above all Nations, <hi>Italy</hi> has preceeded and gain'd the prize, from all Countries and Regions whatever; and that in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s time, who writeth of Drunkenneſs, That it was ſo much in vogue and faſhion in his days, that they uſually drank, and pour'd it down, till they threw it up again. <hi>Paul Diacre</hi> in his Hiſtory of the <hi>Lumbards,</hi> relateth a Story which ſeems little leſs than prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. <q>Of Four Ancient Men, who made a Banquet, or Aſſignation, at which they defied and callenged one another to Drink, one againſt one, reckoning the time of each one's years, and he that drank againſt his oppoſite Companion, muſt be inforced to drink as oft, and as many times as he had lived years; and the youngeſt was more than Fifty five, the Second Sixty three, the Third, Eighty ſeven, and the Fourth Ninety two; after which manner, 'tis unknown what they drank at this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But 'tis certain that he that drank leaſt, drank Fifty five Cups of Wine, the others following, and conſequently as many as they had years; ſo that one of them drank Ninety two Cups.</q>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:94417:15"/>
It is not without cauſe therefore, that the great Philoſopher <hi>Plato</hi> knowing the prejudice that Men receive by Wine, ſaid, that the gods had given it to them for their torment and puniſhment, that they might take vengeance of their ſins and offences; making them after they are therewith infatuated, murder one another. Which <hi>Cyneas</hi> Ambaſſador of King <hi>Pyrr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hus,</hi> conſidering the exceſſive height of their Vines in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſaid, that with great reaſon ſuch a Mother was hang'd ſo high, feeing that ſhe bore ſuch a dangerous off-ſpring as Wine: Wherefore <hi>Androci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> advertis'd this great Monarch <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> That wine was the blood of the earth, and that he ought to have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial care in the uſe of it; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not obſerv'd, through his intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, kill'd <hi>Clitus,</hi> burn'd the City of <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> put to death his Phyſitian, and and committed many other infamous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities.</p>
               <p>And 'tis not only of our time, that theſe guzlers have begun to lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Drunkenneſs and Luxury; but they began to do ſo, as ſoon as they began to be at all: The Luxury of our firſt Parents, was the cauſe why the Gates of Paradiſe were ſhut up and barred againſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94417:16"/>
us; <hi>Eſau</hi> ſold his birthright: The great Prophet St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> after the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting of wicked <hi>Herod,</hi> was cruelly ſlain. <hi>Dives</hi> was damn'd: For it is ſaid expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Text, <hi>That he fed himſelf deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, for which he was caſt into hell. Noah</hi> being overcome with Wine, ſhew'd the ſubject of his ſhame, and was mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own Children. <hi>Lot</hi> deflowred his own Daughters. It plainly appears then, how much nature hath favoured other Creatures more than us, in that they can ſo well bound and regulate their appetites, that they take in but juſt what is neceſſary and expedient for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their health: So that they are not vexed with an infinite of Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and diſtempers, as we are; and when at any time they are ſo, Nature hath taught them their proper Remedies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need or recourſe to Phyſitians; who under pretence of a <hi>Recipe,</hi> change R in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to D and make it <hi>Decipe;</hi> and we muſt pay very dear for the aſſiſtance of him that takes away our lives: For the moſt part of their Lapative Medicines, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but ſo many Hammers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they knock men on the head, and deſtroy them.</p>

               <p>WHen it comes to paſs, that other Creatures are ſick, Nature hath made and taught them Remedies; as <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doves, Jays, Partridges,</hi> &amp;c. who purge their ſuperfluities with the Leaves of the Lawrel. The <hi>Pigeons, Turtles,</hi> and <hi>Pullets,</hi> with the herb <hi>Helixine.</hi> The <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Cats,</hi> by eating of <hi>Graſs.</hi> When the Hart is wounded, he has recourſe to his <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi> When the <hi>Weaſel</hi> would combat with the <hi>Rat,</hi> ſhe prepareth, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth her ſelf with <hi>Rue,</hi> that ſhe may more vigorouſly ſet upon her enemy. The <hi>Boors</hi> Phyſick themſelves with <hi>Ivy,</hi> The <hi>Bears</hi> with <hi>Mandragoras.</hi> The <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles</hi> knowing the impediments which they have in their Productions, by reaſon of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94417:17"/>
their ſtreightneſs, ſeek every where for the Stone called <hi>Aetites,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Eagle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> which they bring into their Neſts for that purpoſe; which is at this time made uſe of by ſeveral of the <hi>Italian</hi> Women, for the eaſing their Travel. When the <hi>Swallows</hi> perceive that by the Smoke of the Chimnies their young ones are offended, they help them with the herb <hi>Gelidon.</hi> The <hi>Snakes</hi> and other <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents</hi> in the Spring of the year, that they may caſt off their skin more eaſily, and feeling that their ſight fails them, eat <hi>Fennel</hi> in order to their reſtauration. The <hi>Pellican</hi> letteth himſelf Blood, to heal the wounds received of the <hi>Serpent.</hi> The <hi>Stork</hi> (as Naturaliſts report) hath taught <hi>Apothecaries</hi> the uſe of <hi>Clyſters,</hi> putting <hi>Moſs</hi> in their ſeats, when they find themſelves oppreſſed with ſtoppages. And <hi>Plutarch,</hi> as though raviſhed with admiration at the favours which Nature hath beſtowed on other Animals, hath aſſured us, That they are not ignorant of the Three kinds of Medicines; for after he hath proved that they know the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſeveral Herbs and Simples, as we have afore noted; addeth, That they know alſo the ſecond part, which we call diet: For when they feel themſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-filed,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94417:17"/>
they moderate their feeding, and uſe abſtinence; as <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> who perceiving the incommodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ariſing to them by their fatneſs, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from fleſh, and couch themſelves, till they have all digeſted. And as to the Third part, which is Chirurgery, it is held for certain, That the <hi>Elephants</hi> have skill in't; for they draw out the Darts and Arrows out of the Bodies of them which are hurt with them, and that with no ſmall dexterity.</p>

               <p>AN Ancient Greek Philoſopher named <hi>Herophilus,</hi> he with many Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations bewailed the miſerable condition of Man, who though elevated above all other Creatures, yet in many things was he to learn of them; witneſs the <hi>Swallow,</hi> who hath taught him building; for when they are near the time of their breeding, they take ſtrong twigs, and lay them for the foundation of their Neſts, and ſoft ones on the top; and when by reaſon of the heat they can't get durt, which they uſe inſtead of Lime or Morter in their Edifices, they fly to ſome River, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in bathe themſelves tell they are well wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and then take duſt, which they mingle with water, and ſo plaiſter their Neſts, ſtop and fill up the holes and crannies, and build their little habitations in form of a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94417:18"/>
Spire round and exact, not fourſquare; knowing that to be more proper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for to preſerve their young from the attempts of thoſe that would hurt them: But who wonders not when he ſees and conſiders the admirable work of the <hi>Spider;</hi> the Scholars of whom are our Women, who learn of them to make the Linnen, and the Fiſher-men their Nets: They are excellent in their labour, and exceeding advantageous in the induſtry, for there's no knots in their work, or ſuperfluous coſt, for all proceedeth from their little bodies; and they gently part and divide their labour betwixt them; for the Female ſhe ſpins and maketh the Web, and the other he goes out upon the chaſe for their living, and is lying in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhcade that he might intrap the prey, and make him fall into his Nets; and though their bodies be no bigger than a Pea, yet nevertheleſs they have ſo much vivacity and induſtry, that they take the greateſt flies, and ſometimes the little <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard</hi> in their Neſts: and obſerve ſo well the ſeaſon of hunting, that they ſeem to have skill in Aſtrology; contrary to us, who ſtay for the fair weather: for the time of their hunting is when the Sky is cloudy, which is to us a preſage of rain, as writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94417:19"/>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Animals.</hi> The Story of <hi>Plutarch</hi> concerning the <hi>Crow,</hi> which he ſaith was ſeen by him in <hi>Aſia,</hi> is not a little wonderful: <q>Who being urged with thirſt and want of water, he perceived a narrow veſſel which had ſome ſmall quantity in it, but by reaſon of its depth and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could not reach it, and therefore caſt in ſtones that by that means it might riſe up, that he might the better ſip of it.</q> But who taught this Animal this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of Philoſophy? that heavy things tend downward, and thoſe things that are lighter aſcend upward and give place? If we would conſider the wiſdom and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of men, we ſhall find little Beaſts that are continually trodden under feet, in many things to excel and ſurpaſs man, and ſeem to have ſome natural vertue in every property, in Prudence, Force, Clemency, Rigor, Diſcipline and Erudition; for they know one another, they diſtinguiſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, they deſire thoſe things that are profitable, and avoid the contrary; ſhun danger, and oftentimes cozen and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-reach men: provide for the future, heap up what is neceſſary, as well for the time to come, as that which is preſent; which being attentively conſidered by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94417:19"/>
many Ancient Philoſophers, who were not aſham'd to diſpute and call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether the Bruits were not, with us, participators of Reaſon? To lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Medicine, Chyrurgery, and Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, and other Melancholy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines, in which, we have proved the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals to have no ſmall infight, and ſometimes to have been the Tutors of Men:</p>
               <p>Let us ſearch into ſome more ſprightly Sciences, ſuch as is Muſick and Harmony; For who is in the World, that is ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and blockiſh, dull and ſenſeleſs, who is not aſtoniſhed with inexpreſſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation, in hearkening to the melodious harmony of the diverting <hi>Nightingale?</hi> and that a voyce of ſo high a ſtrain, and ſo pleaſing a ſound, ſhould be heard from ſo little a creature? Moreover that he ſhould continue ſo obſtinate in his chant, that his Life ſhould rather leave him than his voyce! So that it ſeemeth that he has been inſtructed by ſome exquiſite Maſter in Muſick: Sometimes he counterfeits the Bace, ſometimes the Treble, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Tennor; and when he is weary of his warbling, he counterfeits his voice, and ſings like another Bird that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed but to one ſingle note; and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94417:20"/>
then anon all of a ſudden, he penetrateth ſo high, that he paſſionates ſwounds, and is as it were in a trance, with an infinite variety of diviſion, which elevates the ſoul to Heaven, not only of men, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little Birds, whom he charmeth and ſtoppeth with his Notes, and invites them by his melifluous Song to hearken to him, and imitate him; and not only content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this, you'l ſee him ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing his young, and provoking them to the ſame harmony, learning to obſerve the tone, and carry them on at one breath, ſome in length, aſpirating the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſometimes to curb intire notes, and duly to change and divide them into Minimes and Crotchets; ſometimes to quaver his voyce, and ſometimes to run by diviſion, that no humane artifice could ever yet counterfeit: Although <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> in his Comedy of the ſinging Birds, hath employed all the force of his wit, in thinking to imitate them: Which did not a little affect <hi>Democritus</hi> with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and aſtoniſhment, who publickly maintained, That the <hi>Swans</hi> and <hi>Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingales</hi> had taught men Muſick; and that all thoſe ſpritely Airs wherewith we are ſo much delighted, are nothing elſe, but the Petty Larcinies which we ſtand guilty
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94417:20"/>
of to the Birds: Wherefore it was, that wiſe <hi>Solomon,</hi> well knowing in how many things we are ſurpaſſed and excelled, even by the very Beaſts; ſends us to their Schools and Univerſities, when he ſaith in his <hi>Proverbs, That there are Four little creatures on the earth, who are wiſer than the wiſeſt. The Ants who are a feeble people, and yet nevertheleſs, they provide and lay up in the Summer, their proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſuſtenance for the Winter. The Conies who are a kind not ſtrong, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs make their houſes in Stone. The Graſshoppers who have no King, and yet go out in Bands. The Spider weaveth ſnares with his Fingers, and is in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces of Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a thing almoſt beyond belief, when we conſider, and behold the little <hi>Ants</hi> bearing their heavy burdens with ſo great and exceſſive a diligence, and ſo exact an order amongſt them, biting the tops of the Corn, which they carry into their little holes, for fear they ſhould bud and putrifie, parting them by the middle, that they may carry them more eaſily into their Storehouſes; and if they are damped or wetted, lay them into the Sun, that it may dry them. But with what art and induſtry are their little
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94417:21"/>
lodgings compoſed with! The entrance and going in of which, is not foreright and ſtraight; but is crooked and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, and full of circuits and turnings; to prevent the ſurpriſing entrance of any other creatures; they are not alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their different apartments and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions; they have one Chamber in which ſits their Parliaments and Aſſemblies, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in which they ſtore up their yearly ſuſtenance and proviſion. The third, as ſaith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> is their Coemitry or bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, wherein they interr their dead Brethren: For it's moſt certain, that they are great and ſtrict obſervers of Funeral-Rites and Solemnities. The Philoſophy of <hi>Solomon</hi> therefore is not at all unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, who admoniſheth us by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Simile, drawn from the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and diligence of theſe little creatures, To fly and avoid, as much as may be, all inclinations to ſloth and idleneſs. The Primitive Church commanded, that each one ſhould live by his pains and labour, without licenſing and permitting idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to conſume and waſte the goods of the earth; which manner, as <hi>Cicero</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, was obſerved by the <hi>Romans</hi> with ſuch great exactneſs and ſeverity, That no <hi>Roman</hi> in times paſt, durſt walk about
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94417:21"/>
the City without a Badg or Mark, by which he might ſhew the Trade and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation wherewith he got his living; that all men might know that he lived by his labour, and not by the ſweat and pains of other men: for which Reaſon the Conſul had born before him his Rods and Axes, the Prieſt a Hat or Chaplet, in manner of a Coif, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune a Mace, the Gladiator a Sword, the Taylor his Shears, the Smith a Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Orator and Rhetorician a Book; they ſuffering not, that thoſe that were Maſters of the Sciences, ſhould be the Diſciples and Scholars of vices: So that <hi>Mar. Aurel.</hi> making mention of the ancient diligence and induſtry of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> writeth, <hi>That they ſet themſelves with ſo great earneſtneſs to their labour, that a perſon in all</hi> Rome <hi>could not be found ſo much at leaſure, as to carry Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters two or three days journey, though of never ſo great importance.</hi> Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, may not a little reflect upon thoſe which make profeſſion of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for if all the idle and uſeleſs perſons were chaſed and baniſhed out of our Cities; the remainder would be a very ſmall and inconſiderable number.</p>
               <p>And if we would conſider all things
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94417:22"/>
whatſoever which God hath created, we ſhall find no one but Man who remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in idleneſs: For by how much the more the things that are created are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and perfect, the more is there gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them of labour and travel; you ſee the Sun, how 'tis never free from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and perpetual motion; as alſo the Moon, how greatly unacquainted with ſtops and ſtayings! The fire can never be without ſome kind of operation; the Air flies continually, whirling from one ſide to the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Waters, Fountains and Rivers flow, and are in perpetual agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the earth is never at reſt, but is always buſied in producing one thing or other: wherefore laying all things before our conſideration, we ſhall find that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture never ceaſeth her operation. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there's no plague more pernicious to the publick than idleneſs, for its inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and broodings, are ſcarce any thing elſe than vice and wickedneſs; ſo that we ought to eſteem idle perſons far worſe than the bruit Beaſts, whoſe hides ſerveth us for Shoes, their fleſh for Meat, their force and ſtrength to cultivate the earth; but the idle perſon ſerveth for nothing, but to offend God, and ſcandalize the innocent, and eat the bread which other
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94417:22"/>
men have ſweated for: We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore apprehend by what hath been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, how liberally nature hath fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured other creatures, and hath been, as it were, prodigal in their behalf; ſo that men are conſtrained, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the indulgences of nature to other Animals in their regular way of living, to follow, and imitate them in many things. But what Murderer can there be, though never ſo great an affronter of Nature, and deſirous of human Blood, that will not moderate his deſire of miſchief and malevolency, when he conſiders, that there is no Animal, though never ſo fierce and furious, that will kill his own Kind? What Child can there be ſo ungrateful towards his Parents, who will not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to gratitude, when he ſeeth the little <hi>Storks</hi> feeding their ancient and decrepit Parents, in acknowledgment of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that they have received from them? <hi>Aelian</hi> reports a matter not a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable: <hi>That their Young are ſo tender of them, that if proviſion is not at hand to relieve them; then they strain and enforce themſelves to vomit, and caſt up that which they had eaten the day before, leſt they ſhould periſh with hunger; and with this they ſuſtain them, till they have gotten ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:94417:23"/>
                  <hi>from abroad.</hi> Where is the Father, who is ſo cruel and unnatural, or the Mother ſo eſtranged from humanity, that dares to murder their off-ſpring, or be guilty of the leaſt unkindneſs, if they call to mind the <hi>Dolphins</hi> zeal for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their young, who if it come to paſs, that any of them are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Fiſhers, follow them continually, even to the very laſt extremity; and will rather ſuffer themſelves to be taken? The which is not only peculiar to the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> but alſo to another Fiſh called <hi>Glaucus;</hi> who though not ſo ſociable and familiar with men as the other, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he hath ſuch great affection for his young, that whenſoever he ſeeth any that may ſeem affrightful, he taketh them up into his mouth, ſwallowing them down alive; and when the peril and fear is over, he diſgorges them whole into the water; which is indeed a thing almoſt incredible, that his love ſhould be ſo great to his young, that he ſhould force his Nature, and endure any pain, rather than they ſhould be prejudiced. Who is he that will not bear contentedly the irkſomneſs of poverty, if he conſiders the nature of a Fiſh called <hi>Polypus;</hi> who feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf urged with hunger, and ſeeing that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94417:23"/>
food is wanting to him, eateth the ends of his Finns and Curtails, knowing in time that they will grow again? Where is the Man ſo puſillanimous and fearful, who is not in ſome meaſure comforted againſt the fear of Death when it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf to him, when he hath conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ſweet ſinging of <hi>Swans,</hi> and that when their end approaches, though they are without hopes or thought of living again? There is no Father can be ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, barbarous or unnatural, to defraud ſome of his Children to advantage the others, if he hath taken notice of the order which the little <hi>Swallow</hi> obſerveth in the nouriſhing of his brood; who, as ſaith <hi>Aelian</hi> in his <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtory of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, keepeth exactly to the rules of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributive juſtice; and becauſe ſhe cannot bring all at once, ſhe goes divers times to her feeding, and violateth not in the leaſtwiſe the right of Primogeniture; for he that is firſt born, is firſt fed; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the ſecond rank; and ſo conſequently the others: which was the cauſe that an <hi>Indian</hi> Philoſopher named <hi>Diphilus,</hi> after having contemplated the manner and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this little Bird and others, cryed out, <hi>That Nature had engraven in them, as it were, certain laws and formularies,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:94417:24"/>
                  <hi>for the aſſiſtance of men in the conduct of their lives.</hi> Is there any Man ſo ſtupid and blockiſh, that encreaſeth not his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, by conſidering the prudence of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed <hi>Cuckoo,</hi> who being ſenſible by inſtinct of Nature, of his infirmity and exceſſive frigidity, ſo that he cannot hatch his eggs, watcheth, and at laſt ſpieth an occaſion, that he may lay them in other Birds Neſts, firſt breaking theirs that were there before? Which manner of the <hi>Cuckoo, Eulgentius</hi> obſerving, ſaid, <hi>That he was not unworthy in ſome things to be imitated by thoſe Fathers who have many Children, and by reaſon of their poverty cannot bring them up themſelves; they would do well to place them out in others Houſes, whereby they may get an honeſt ſubſiſtence.</hi> What Servant is there ſo dull and ſloathful, that is not a little moved, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth the noble generoſity of the Warr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe, who is ſo courageous, that he had rather dye than leave his Maſter in danger; ſo that he hath ſuch a brisk kind of ſprightfulneſs, that is beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, with which we ſee him, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like thunder and lightning, ſtrike through the Armed Soldiers, murdering and trampling under his feet thoſe who would hinder his paſſage; ſurmounting
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94417:24"/>
thoſe difficult ſtreights; and finally, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not till the Victory is gotten by him that commands him? And if Man may learn fidelity by the example of a Horſe, yet is all that but little, in compariſon of what we have experienced in our <hi>Dogs,</hi> who knowing their Maſters, flatter, and ingeniouſly inſinuate, accompanying them throughout all the World, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them only for their maſters that keep them; and are ſo faithful guardians of their goods, that they will rather dye than ſuffer them to be robbed: For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of which, ſhall only one inſtance be produced out of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be ſufficient to terrifie all bloody mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and others, who ſo little ſet by mens lives: which vice our great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor hath in ſo much deteſtation, that he permitteth the bruit Beaſts to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of his juſtice; as it is evidently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the Hiſtory which follows. <hi>The Ancients who have written of the nature of Animals, make mention of a King called</hi> Pyrrhus, <hi>who marching one day with his Army, he came to a place, where a Dog kept his Maſter who lay dead in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and having looked upon this pitious ſpectacle, he was given to underſtand by ſome Peaſants, that it was the third day ſince</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:94417:25"/>
                  <hi>the poor creature had not ſtirred from the place without meat or drink: wherefore the King cauſed the corps to be interred, and that the Dog ſhould be kept for his fidelity, cauſing inquiſition to be made ſometime after concerning the murder; yet nevertheleſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs in his enquiries and diſcovery of the Murderers: but it happened a while after, that the King muſtering his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and cauſing them all to paſs before him, that he might ſee their equipage; the Dog aforementioned, always kept near to the King, ſad, mute and heavy, till thoſe that had killed his Maſter paſſed by; then with a furious impetuoſity, he run and ſet upon them, and would have torn them in pieces, turning and frisking up and down with ſuch barkings and howlings, ſuch ſtrange kind of fury and vehemency, that it was taken notice of by every one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times running towards</hi> Pyrrhus, <hi>and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him ſo attentively, as if he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and waited for juſtice; by reaſon of which, the King immediately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuſpecting them to be guilty of the murder, they were examin'd, convicted, and puniſht for their fault as they deſerved.</hi> A thing certainly miraculous! and plainly ſhewing our God to be ſo juſt in his judgments, and that his hatred is ſo great againſt Murderers,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94417:25"/>
that he ſometimes permitteth the bruit Beaſts to accuſe them.</p>

               <p>IT is evidently certain, That a harmony of Philoſophy may be found in the contemplation of Animals, as well Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as Moral; for in conſidering the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and actions of them, ſo well order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the uſage of nature, their juſtice, temperance, fortitude, and oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy in their adminiſtration in their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Republicks, their continency in their works of nature, and ſome other parts of vertue that they exerciſe, by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of which, Man may make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on himſelf to great purpoſes: Wherefore our Lord calleth (in St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>) the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees, children of Vipers.</hi> And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> reproaching the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> of their ingratitude towards God,

               <p>HEre then is the firſt Act of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy of human Life, during the time of his impriſonment in his Mothers Womb; and being now got out of his maternal dungeon, let us contemplate a little what he is being on the Earth: And what is he elſe, but like to a poor worm creeping thereon? With what Garment is he cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, making his magnificent entrance into the Palace of this World, but Blood, wherewith he is all over beſmeared? which is no other than the repreſentation of ſin, which in the Scripture is ſignified unto us by Blood. O grievous neceſſity! O cruel and miſerable condition! That before this creature hath ſinned, he is the bondſman and ſervant of ſin; it is the <hi>bitter grape,</hi> of which ſpeaketh the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, that the fathers have eaten of, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edg.</hi> What is the firſt Song which Man ſingeth entring into this World, what are his chants, but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94417:31"/>
weeping, wailing, and groaning, which are the meſſengers and augures of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Calamities, which becauſe he cannot expreſs by words, he teſtifies by cries and tears: and this is the beginning of Monarchs, Kings, Princes and Emperors, and others who make ſuch a buſtle in the world.</p>
               <p>The worm, though he be ſo little, as ſoon as Nature hath brought him forth, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to crawl on the earth, to ſeek his paſture and ſuſtenance: The little <hi>Chicken</hi> as ſoon as it is out of the ſhell is clean, and needs not to be waſhed as man; runneth after its Mother when ſhe calleth it, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to pecking, feareth the <hi>Kite,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever having made tryal of his malice; and avoideth the danger by the ſole gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and inſtinct of Nature.</p>
               <p>But behold man, as ſoon as ever he is on the earth, he is as a hideous monſter, and maſs of fleſh, who letteth himſelf be eaten by other Animals, and knoweth not in the leaſt how to ſuſtain himſelf, being ignorant of the ways of his nouriſhment, and would ſoon ſtarve and periſh with want and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, was he not relieved by others: But leave we him in his little neſt, where he is covered with his own dung, being ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent that he cannot caſt out his excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94417:32"/>
which the little Birds and other Animals eaſily do; and let us remember that theſe are the perfumes wherewith Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath adorned Man, who calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter and Lord of all others.</p>
               <p>Now this wretched creature being plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in this gulf of miſery, muſt be brought up, and hath need of nouriſhment to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the infirmity of his nature, which office is aſſigned to Mothers, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which they have given them paps, which are as little bottles proper for that effect: But how many Mothers are there at this day, or to ſpeak better, cruel Stept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dames rather, who think it abundantly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that they have brought them into the world, reſerring their nurſery to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whom perhaps they never ſaw in their lifes before, and who it may be change them, putting others in their ſtead; and ſome of them are leſs aſhamed for to hold little <hi>Dogs</hi> in their arms, than their own Children born of their bodies? which manner is not practiſed by the brute Beaſts, though never ſo brutiſh; for they do not commit their little ones to the keeping of others, though the number which Nature hath given them be never ſo many, but nouriſh them themſelves, and are ſo zealous protectors of them, that they ſcarce ever
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94417:32"/>
have them out of their arms; and that which is moſt wonderful, there is begotten a jealouſie betwixt the Male and Female, who ſhall be their Guardian, and which is ſometimes to them a matter of no ſmall ſtrife and diſſention, eſpecially to the <hi>Apes,</hi> and not only to them, but alſo to the Beaſts who are of a Nature ſo fierce and cruel, and yet have they their lettle ones in ſo great affection, that they are not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to nouriſh them with their Milk, but as ſoon as they are brought forth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſcarcely any form, they lick and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them that they may render them more perfect: And not only they, but the Birds too; who although that they have oftentimes 5 or 6 under their wing, and have neither milk nor grain, nor any thing elſe to ſuſtain them; nevertheleſs they ſpare no pains nor diligence whereby they may bring up their little ones, which is a true teſtimony of Human Miſery; foraſmuch as man is deprived betimes of that which is his due by the ſtrict right of Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to ſuck the milk of a ſtranger, and very often of her who hireth her ſelf the cheapeſt, whatever corruption or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity ſhe is poſſeſſor of, which many times is ſo contagious to the Child, that it had been better for him perhaps to have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94417:33"/>
been nurſed up by ſome brute Beaſts in a Deſart, than to ſtand at the mercy of ſuch Nurſes; for not only the bodies are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and ſpoil'd, as was Experienced in <hi>Titus</hi> Son of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> and many others (whom as writeth <hi>Lampridus</hi>) was all the time of his life ſubject to a multitude of maladies and diſtempers, by reaſon of his being delivered to be Nurſed by a woman troubled with divers ſickneſſes and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but the worſt is, that there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an impreſſion in the mind and temper, by reaſon of this vicious Nutrition, as <hi>Dion</hi> intimateth in his 2 Book of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> when he taketh notice of <hi>Caligula</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> the cruel inhumanity of whom was not imputed to Father or Mother, but to her who Nurſed and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him; who moreover as ſhe was cruel and barbarous of her ſelf, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding rubbed and chafed the end of her paps with human blood, and then cauſed him to ſuck them; which he practiſed ſo well afterwards, that he was not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to commit an infinite of Murders, but ſucked the blood which was wont to be on his Sword or Dagger, and licked it with his tongue; and wiſhed that all the World had but one head, that he with one blow might cut it off, and he himſelf reign
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94417:33"/>
alone on the earth. The Child then had not ſuffered vexations enough in the womb of his Mother, and had not been enough afflicted, unleſs that making his entrance in the world, there had been prepared new ones by the ingratitude of thoſe Mothers who are ſo nice and delicate, that they think it too burdenſom a thing for them to take it upon themſelves, and therefore make them ſuck them whoſe milk is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times corrupt and putrified, from whence followeth many diſtempers, as the Pox, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, and innumerable others, (as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians have obſerved) to the great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of their poor Children, and eternal infamy of the Mothers: for it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that if the Nurſe be ſquint-ey'd, or given to ebriety, and ſubject to maladies, or corrupt manners, the Child ſhall be ſquint, not by her milk, but by often and frequent intuition and obſervation of his Nurſe: If ſhe be a Drunkard, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth the infant for Convulſions and weakneſſes, as we read in the Life of the Emperor <hi>Tyberius:</hi> Who was exceſſively addicted to that Vice, by reaſon of his Nurſe who ſuckled him; who her ſelf was an exceſſive and unmeaſurable drinker; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtoming the Child alſo to the eating of Toaſts ſoaked in Wine; where we may
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94417:34"/>
obſerve how great an influence the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and temperament of the Nurſe has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Child, ſo that if ſhe be ſick, ſhe will render him infirm; if ſhe be ſtupid, ſhe will make him ſo too: but leaving him in the Govenrment and Tuition of his Nurſe,</p>
               <p>Let us conſider how many perils and dangers he is environed with, during the time of his bringing up: what pain and vexation have they, who have the charge of him? Some do even tear and burſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with crying and howling, ſo that there needs no larum-bell to rouſe them in the night that have the charge of him: Others are continually running and daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves againſt one thing or other, and there's ſcarce any thing elſe for the moſt part but wounds and bruiſes to be ſeen in their poor little bodies; without reckoning many Hereditary diſeaſes which they bring from the corruptions of their Parents.—But who ſtandeth not aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, to think that ſo miſerable a creature, one ſo overwhelmed with poverty and malediction, ſo vile and mean an Object; yet in a little while ſhould become ſo proud and haughty. If then the great Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> with vehement compaſſion hath deplored the ſtate of Captive <hi>Babylon:</hi> If the Conſul <hi>Marcellus</hi> hath lamented the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94417:34"/>
City of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> when he ſaw it burning: And <hi>Saluſte</hi> the corruptions of <hi>Rome;</hi> we may with them well deplore the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate of Man entring this World; his Progreſſion and Perillous Converſation therein, and his ſorrowful and woful exit; which made <hi>Job</hi> grieve and lament that he was not ſtifled in the womb of his Mother, and murmured that her knees had ſuſtained him; and complaining of the breaſt that had gave him ſuck: And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> moved by the like paſſion, conſidering that man is formed of the duſt, conceived in ſin, and born in ſorrow; and at laſt made the prey of Worms and Serpents: wiſhed that the womb of his Mother had become his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, and the Matrix his Tomb: And the ſame <hi>Job</hi> again ſaith, That man born of a woman liveth but a ſhort time here on earth, who cometh up as a flower and fleeth as it were a ſhadow, and never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in one ſtay: What could be more forcibly and efficaciouſly ſet forth, than this Diſcription which this holy man makes of human Calamity? In compariſon of which, all the Sentences and Treatiſes of the <hi>Ethnicks</hi> are but as dreams and ſmoke. When the Spirit of God would induce man to humble and know himſelf, he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him ſon of a woman; and has he done
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94417:35"/>
it without cauſe? for amongſt all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which God hath Created, there is none more ſubject to weakneſſes and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities than a woman, eſpecially them who are big with child; for ſcarce have they one month in a year which is not ſpent in fear and trembling: Then afterwards he ſaith, <hi>Living a ſhort time,</hi> and indeed what is more ſhort than the life of man? when 'tis but ſtopping his noſe or mouth, and his life is ended: For his life is nought elſe but a blaſt which is incloſed therein, by reaſon of which, <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> and many other Ancients, murmured againſt Nature, that ſhe had indued the <hi>Hart</hi> and <hi>Crow</hi> and many other Animals with ſuch a long life, and that to no purpoſe: whereas to man, 'tis quite otherwiſe; his life being ſo ſhort and of ſo little durance, that though he has occaſions enough to imploy it, yet nevertheleſs is it retrenched and abrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that by ſo many ways; as ſleep, dreams, anger, and all manner of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: So that if we would reckon every thing, there remaineth leſs than nothing of that which we may call life; ſeeing that the Prophet compareth man to a ſhadow, what other thing then is a ſhadow, but that which deceiveth the ſight? A phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm, a deceitful figure without ſubſtance;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94417:35"/>
which ſometimes appeareth to be great, ſometimes little; the very ſame is it of man, ſometimes he ſeemeth to be great, when indeed he is but little, or rather no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all; for when he is moſt highly lifted up, and when he is on the greateſt and moſt elevated degree of honour; he then periſheth ſuddenly, and we know not what is become of him, no more than of a ſhadow when the night is come: <hi>I ſaw the wicked,</hi> faith <hi>David, mighty and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing as the green Lawrel tree; but I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by, and I ſaw ſuddenly he was not; I ſought for him, but he was no where to be found.</hi>

in their houſes, and ſhewing them a good pattern for there imitation, corrupt and deprave them by their vicious and wicked Example: for the firſt Precept and Rule of good living they receive from them, is to Curſe and Blaſpheme, to be Intemperate in their eating and drinking, and to diſſipate their ſubſtance in Whoring, Gaming, and all manner of debauchery? there being not alſo a few Mothers in the world, who do as <hi>Herodias,</hi> learning their Daughters to dance, paint, plaiſter, patch and diſguiſe their Faces; to load themſelves with Rings and Jewels, that they may tell every one that meets them, how inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly barren they are of all true worth and value: But it will be with them in the end, as it was with <hi>David,</hi> the Sin of whom was puniſhed by his Children; who were ſo irregular, that one of them violated his own natural Siſter, <hi>Tamar,</hi> and conſpired the death of his own Father, and drove him out of his Kingdom. For the Rule of the ancient Philoſophers has always proved true, that man committeth many faults in this world, the puniſhment of which, God reſerveth in the other: but this ſin of not well Educating our Children, he uſually puniſheth in this; for the Father in beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Sons, gives them nothing but mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality

and weakneſs; but by good Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Fame and everlaſting Renown: We will conclude then, that if the Children have been in great peril and miſery often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the corrupt milk of their Nurſes; yet nevertheleſs the danger is double, in reſpect of them who ought to inſtruct them; for as much as that the nutriment of the body is of far leſs conſequence, than that of the mind.

God having driven man out of <hi>Paradice,</hi> he ſent him as an exile or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed man, and declared to him that the

               <p>BUT leaving the poor Husbandmen making their complaints: Let us ſeek farther and inquire into the buſineſs of Merchants, which at firſt view ſeemeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt and void of Miſeries, promiſing ſome repoſe upon the account of the Riches wherewith it aboundeth: which employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment many wiſe men, as <hi>Solon, Thales, Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> and others have exerciſed, which is a great cauſe of the Amity and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which we have with Forreign Princes, tranſporting to one City what aboundeth in another; but we cannot ſo well diſguiſe the matter, but that at firſt ſight almoſt we may diſcern with how great diſquiet the lives of Merchants are accompanied; to how many dangers are they ſubject, and that continually, as well by Sea as Land?
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94417:42"/>
without reckoning, that for the moſt part of time they are as Fugitives and Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds out of their Towns and Countries, and are unlike in nothing to baniſhed men, but only that their baniſhment is voluntary, becauſe that they would ſteal, ranſack and raviſh, burn and ſpoil every thing, as well by Sea as Land, and all for that they might ſatisfie their covetous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of gain; and are contented to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the reſt and comfort that they might receive from their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Lands and Poſſeſſions, and be every minute in hazard of their lives, and all for an unſatiable avarice, which torments them, without taking notice that the firſt Sanctuary of their Confraternity, is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than to ſwear, forſwear, cheat, and deceive their Neighbour; ſo that ſcarce any one Trafficking, can enrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but by fraud and couſenage: and they have a common Proverb amongſt them, <hi>That there needs but only turning their backs towards God for two or three years, and a little ſtraining their Conſciences, for to enrich themſelves and make up their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes:</hi> With which alſo we may reckon many evils and vexations which belong thereunto; when they bring Merchandize from other Countries, which are not any

ways neceſſary to the life of man, hut on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the amuſement of women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as if our nature of it ſelf was not enough infirm and inclinable to dote on fopperies, but we muſt by ſuch fooleries as theſe whet and ſtir it up, whileſt that there is neither Kingdom nor Province which they cheat not by theſe novelties; and the worſt is, having received an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſtrange manners, they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them to us with their Merchandize: and that's not all neither; for under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and colour of Traffick, they hold Intelligence and Correſpondency with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes, diſcover our ſecrets, lend them Money, and in the end ſell and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their Country; which hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in <hi>France,</hi> to the great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deſolation of many people: But letting paſs thouſands of their frauds which they uſe, as Sophiſticating and diſguiſing their Drugs, though mens lives are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them, yet nevertheleſs their art depends ſo much upon't, that they inſtruct their Factors and Servants in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, and to them who can with moſt cunning falſify, forſwear, lye, aequivocate, counterfeit the <hi>Genuoiſe, Florentine, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> they will give greater wages. And the matter is brought now to that paſs,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94417:43"/>
that you durſt ſcarcely go out of a Shop, after having bid money for a Commodity, but returning preſently, you ſhall find it changed and another offered to you as the ſame by theſe youngſters, who make it no matter to engage their ſouls to the Devil, that they may enrich their Maſters.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort alſo of Merchants, whom we have not as yet taken notice of, who ſet forth their Shops with other mens eſtates, and borrow of one and the other, and after that they have by ſuch artifices as theſe amaſſed great ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, turn Bankrupts, and fly far enough from their Creditors finding them, where they live at their eaſe on that which they have cheated and defrauded, leaving their Creditors oftentimes in ſuch poverty, that there has been them ſo deſperate as to hang themſelves, ſeeing that they are fruſtrated of that which they thought as ſure, as in their own poſſeſſion: Which things being ſeriouſly conſidered by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> they would not permit that Merchants ſhould dwell with other Citizens, but ordered them certain places a-part, where they exerciſed their Merchandize: There hath been many Ancient Common-Wealths where the Merchants were not received

               <p>NEXT let us conſider the Tragical Life of them which ſerve in the Wars, which is ſo ſevere and rigorous, that even the brute beaſts would have it in horror, who lie cloſe and hid in the night in their Holes and Caves: but the Soldier he watches always, and lodgeth himſelf at the Sign of the Moon; indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Rain, Wind, Hail, Snow, ſuffers hunger, heat and cold; and when he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſorrowful ſign of Battel, he muſt reſolve with himſelf, either to receive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Death, or elſe to Murder his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: and offereth himſelf to be killed for five-pence a day. But wouldeſt thou know how piteous and deplorable a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle War is? Have you ever ſeen the Conflict of the <hi>Bear</hi> with the <hi>Lyon,</hi> or other like furious Beaſts? what roaring, what rage, what cruelty they uſe in tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſmembring one another? But
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94417:44"/>
how much greater cruelty is it when we ſee Man againſt Man, transformed as it were into brute Beaſts, exerciſing their paſſionate humours againſt their fellow Creature? But not to take notice of an infinite of evils which thereon depend.—It is the poor people who have Built ſo many Famous Towns and Cities, and who by their pains and labour have enriched them, Fortified and maintained them; but they ſee them demoliſhed, waſted and ſpoiled; their Cattel driven away, their Corn burnt up and deſtroy'd, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times their ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>murdered; always in fear and perpetual anxiety. There's no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily that lamenteth not: The Arts and ingenious Sciences are neglected, and lye altogether diſregarded; the poor people hindred, and are forced to ſtarve and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with hunger, or fly and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to unlawful ways, that they may ſuſtain their poor and miſerable lives.—The Virgins they are Violated, the Chaſte Matrons are Forced and Raviſhed, the Laws are Silenced, Humanity and Affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are Extinguiſhed, Equity is Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Religion is Contaminated, Holy Places Prophaned, the Ancient Men car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away Captive, and ſee oftentimes their Childrens brains daſhed out before
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94417:44"/>
their Faces,—Women made Widows; Children, Orphans; and an infinite of evils and Calamities too long to be recounted. The Kings, Princes and Monarchs envied for the Subſidies which they Levy from the people; there's ſcarce any thing ſave mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, hatred, curſings and imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.—Strangers muſt be courted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained into ſervice; great ſums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney muſt be disburſed for the carrying on the deſign, whether by Sea or Land.—Muſt Fortifie Bulwarks, Ramparts, ſet up Tents, Train Machins, Cannons, Armed Chariots, clear Ditche, ſet Watches and Sentinels, and the like exerciſes of War. But alas, Is it not ſufficient that Nature hath created Man ſo miſerable and abject a Creature, and ſubject to ſo many evils, but that over and above, he muſt be plagued with the miſeries of War! a peſt ſo ſtrange and pernicious, that it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth and ſurmounteth all other kind of evils: So cruel and contagious, that it flicteth not only the wicked, but many times the harmleſs and innocent. Moreover, If that our rage exerted it ſelf only againſt the Stranger, or <hi>Barbarian,</hi> the Victory over whom being gained, might bring ſome contentment to the Victor.—But good God!

Glories and Trophies of the Wars amongſt Chriſtian Princes? Their ſaftey and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is the ruin of their Neighbours, their riches are the poverty and ſpoils of others, their joy is the lamentation and tears of others; and for the moſt part, their Victories are not ſo Fortunate, but that the Victor and Vanquiſhed do lament both together: for there was never any Battel ſo happy, but the Conquerour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf repented, if touched with the leaſt Humanity. Some Heathens there have been that have freely confeſſed it, as the great Emperour <hi>Marc Aurelius,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many glorious Victories obtained of his Enemies; as he was received in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in <hi>Rome,</hi> reſenting in his ſoul the injury which he had done his fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, begun to cry out as he was drawn in his Triumphant Chariot: <hi>What greater foolery or vanity can a</hi> Roman <hi>Emperour be guilty of, becauſe that he has forced many Towns and Cities, altered and diſturbed their Pacifick Government, deſtroyed and raiſed their Fortereſſes and Caſtles, robbed the poor, and enriched the Tyrants, made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite of Widows and Orphans, and for the amends of all this waſte and damage, we are received with Triumph and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence?

               <p>WE have before diſcourſed on the buſineſs of War, and the gain and advantage which accrues to men thereby: Let us look now into the Palaces of Princes, and ſee what is the Felicity of the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier: and to him who looks that way, can there ſeem to be any greater happineſs than to be favoured by his Prince? have always his ear ready?—Be careſſed, honoured, and ſought to by every one? but you ſhall find them there who are crafty as the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who as ſoon as ever his Net is filled, up he draws, and is gone with all: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who play at put-out; ſome ſtay till

they are full as Sponges, and in the end are ſqueezed themſelves out of all they have: Others do nothing elſe but invent Subſidies, and ſeek means whereby they may fill the Treaſury of their Kings, and enrich themſelves with the ſpoils of the poor people: and the Princes ſometimes deal with them as we do with our <hi>Hogs,</hi> letting them fat themſelves, that we may eat and devour them, and then preferring new ones in their places. Behold how theſe poor miſerable Courtiers ſell their liberty to enrich themſelves. They muſt obey all commands, whether juſt or unjuſt; forcing themſelves to laugh when their Prince laugheth, and cry when he cries; to approve what he approves, to condemn what he condemns; muſt ſubject his humor to every ones, alter and wholly change his nature: be ſevere with thoſe that are ſevere, ſad with the ſorrowful, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf almoſt into the nature of them whom he would pleaſe: If the Prince be incontinent, he muſt be ſo too; if he be cruel, he muſt take delight in effuſion of blood: In ſhort, he muſt ſympathize with the humor of the Prince whom he ſerveth, though oftentimes a ſmall offence wipes out all the ſervices which he has done in all his life before. Which they who ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> experienced, who after having been by him raiſed up to the higheſt Eſtates and Dignities, by the means and reports of ſome flatterers, were not only diveſted of that honour which was given them, but were alſo declared his Capital Enemies: Which <hi>Plato</hi> having conſidered and foreſaw in the Court of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> left them their delicacies, yet howſoever could not ſo well rule him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but that he returned to <hi>Denis,</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who in the end ſold him to Pirates; and worſe fared it with <hi>Zeno</hi> the Sage Ancient Philoſopher, whom <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi> for ſatisfaction of his Services, put cruelly to Death: In the like manner did the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> to <hi>Anacreon,</hi> and the Noble Philoſopher <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> to his Maſter <hi>Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtenus,</hi> becauſe he would not adore him, cutting off his feet, ears and hands, and plucked out his eyes, leaving him to the mercy of an auſtere Priſon, where he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably ended his days: and this hath been oftentimes the reward of many Learned men, who not willing to obey the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable deſires of their Princes, loſt their lives for the recompence of their Services and wholeſom Counſels.

               <p>BUT leave we the Courtiers with their reſtleſs and miſerable Life: And let us now conſider the Life of Monarchs and Emperours, for whom it ſeemeth as it were that Felicity was created: for if you would ſet before you every thing which may make the Life of Man happy, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and content, you ſhall find, that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, amongſt all other mortals, hath been abundantly Munificent to them: What maketh man more admirable than plenty of Riches, Dignities, Kingdoms and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires? Licence and Power to do either good or evil, without Contradiction or Correction? means to exerciſe Liberality, all forts of Voluptuoſneſs and Pleaſures, as well of the mind as the body? all that may be wiſh't for, or any ways condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to the delight of man, whether it be in reſpect of eating or drinking? as alſo in their Magnificent Services, Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils and Veſtments, which may tickle the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94417:49"/>
Senſes, and cajole Humane Concupiſcence? all which are prepared from the Cradle, that they might lead their lives with greater Content and Felicity: Which Diſcourſe if we will only conſider externally, there's none but would confeſs that they Triumph alone in that which all others languiſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but if we would conſider things a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more near, and weigh them in a juſt balance, we ſhall find that thoſe very things which we think degrees whereby to reach Felicity, are the true inſtruments of Vice and Miſery. What ſignifies their coſtly Robes, their Honourable Attendance, and delicate Meats, when that they are in continual fear of being poiſon'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd by thoſe that Serve them? Have we not had experience of this in our time? Does not <hi>Platinus</hi> write of a certain Pope who was poyſon'd by his Servants that preſented him with paper coming off from his ſtool: Others with the ſmoke of <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo's</hi> and <hi>Torches.</hi> 'I is a thing horribly ſtrange, that humane malice is ſo much increaſed; there having been found them that have mingled poyſon with the Sacred Hoſt, as did a certain <hi>Sienois,</hi> who caus'd the death of many perſons; and effected in this manner the death of the Emperour <hi>Hen. 7th,</hi> as may be ſeen in <hi>Fuſchius</hi> in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94417:50"/>
the <hi>1ſt</hi> Book of his <hi>Compoſition of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments.</hi> Hiſtories make mention of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Emperours, who durſt not repoſe themſelves at night on their Beds, till there had been ſearch made in all the parts of their Chambers for fear of being Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered whilſt they ſlept: others would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver permit that Barbers ſhould ever touch their Faces, leſt that taking off their Hair, they ſhould take away their lives; and are moreover ſo fearful, that they dare not put the meat which they have before them in their mouths, till eſſay be made whether it be poyſon. Were it not better, ſaith <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> to dye once, than to live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in ſuch a continual fear? And what felicity can he have, though chief of all, having ſo many under his protection, who muſt watch for them all, and hear all their complaints, and the particular grievances of every one, endeavouring the ſafety of every individual: inviting ſome by liberality to do well, others by fear and terror.—He muſt not be leſs ſolicitous for maintaining peace amongſt his people, than to defend them from the Incurſions and Invaſions of Foreigners. <hi>Pogge Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentin</hi> hath made a particular Treatiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Infelicity of Princes (he means wicked ones), where he ſaith, <hi>That uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:94417:50"/>
                  <hi>three ſorts of people are to them moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable and familiar: the flatterers hold the firſt rank, who are the Capital enemies of truth, empoyſoning their ſouls with ſo peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous a venome, that it is contagious to all the world; their raſhneſs and fooliſhneſs they term wiſdom and prudence; their cruelty, juſtice; their luxury and laſcivouſneſs, gaye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and paſtimes; if they are covetous, they call them thrifty and frugal; if prodigal, free and liberal: ſo that there can be no Vice with which their Prince is not infected, but they'l diſguiſe and palliate it under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſome Vertue. The ſecond are the inventors and contrivers of new Subſidies, who reſt never a night, but that in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they bring ſome new project to the Prince, how he may draw Money from his poor people; cauſing new Laws to be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, abrogate, form, reform, diminiſh, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn, demand confiſcations and proſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſo that their whole ſtudy is nothing elſe but to encreaſe the calamities and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Subject. There are alſo another kind, who under pretence of honeſty, and love of virtue and goodneſs, have always their eyes on the lives and manners of others; eſpying and watching their miſcarriages, that they may give notice of them to their Prince, that they may get their Eſtates, and build</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:94417:51"/>
                  <hi>up their own Fortunes upon the ruins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, and care not if they make them loſe their lives, ſo that they may go away with what they have.</hi>—Wherefore the Ancients (as writeth <hi>Heroditas</hi>) if that their Kings and Princes were born away by injuſtice in publick adminiſtrations, they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them for Devils after their death: aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling themſelves with their Prieſts in their Temples, and publickly prayed their gods that they would not receive them into happineſs, recommending them to the Infernal furies, that they might condignly torment them. Which has not been only obſerved of the Ancients, but alſo of the Moderns of our time, who have uſed ſuch like imprecations, as recounteth <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonine de Guevara,</hi> Chronicler to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, in his Epiſtle, where he ſaith, <hi>That to the Viceroy of</hi> Sicily, <hi>for vengeance of the Tyrannies that he exerciſed towards his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, they put after his death on his Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre the</hi> Epitaph <hi>which follows:</hi>

                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:94417:51"/>Theſe then are ſome of the miſeries which accompany the Scepter; the Thorns which they have for counterpoiſe of their Royal Dignity, which ought to be as a Lamp to light all the world; but when 'tis obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Vice, it is more ſignally reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than in any private perſon: for they ſin only (as writeth <hi>Plato</hi>) through the fault that they commit, but theſe by the ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample which they give. If it be hard then and difficult to be good (as writeth <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiod</hi>), yet is it harder and more difficult for Kings to be ſo: For the great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Deliciouſneſs which they ſee themſelves poſſeſſors of, are as ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to evil. What was <hi>Saul</hi> before he was choſen King? how greatly was his Virtue celebrated in holy Writ, whom the Lord himſelf had choſen? yet nevertheleſs was it ſoon eclipſed. How admirable was the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Solomon?</hi> but being plunged in Kingly delights, he gave himſelf wholly a prey to women. Of twenty two Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> there was but five or ſix found who perſiſted in virtue and goodneſs. As for the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if you would ſearch into their Lives, from <hi>Jeroboam</hi> Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> even to the laſt, they being nineteen in number, have all of them ill governed and managed the affairs
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94417:52"/>
of their Kingdoms. If you conſider the Eſtate of the <hi>Aſſyrians, Perſians, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> they will preſent more bad than good. What have been the Kings and <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, who have gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one of the moſt flouriſhing Empires of the world? have they not been devoted to all kind of vice and cruelty? ſo that we cannot read their ſcandalous Lives in Hiſtory without horror and deteſtation. What was the State of the <hi>Roman</hi> Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, before that <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> maimed it, before <hi>Cataline</hi> and <hi>Catullus</hi> troubled it, before <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded it, before that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>M. Anthony</hi> deſtroyed it, before <hi>Tyberius</hi> and <hi>Caligula</hi> defamed it, before that <hi>Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> corrupted it? for although they enriched it with many Countries and Kingdoms, yet nevertheleſs the Vices that they brought with them, are greater than the Kingdoms that they Conquered: for the riches thereof are loſt, but the Vices continue. What remains are there now of the memory of <hi>Romulus,</hi> to whom the <hi>Roman</hi> City owns its Foundation? of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Pompilus,</hi> who erected ſo high the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol? of <hi>Ancus Marcius,</hi> who environed it with walls? of <hi>Brutus,</hi> who delivered it from Tyrants? of <hi>Camillus,</hi> who drove
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94417:52"/>
out the <hi>French?</hi> Do they not yield us the knowledg, how little felicity there is in Principality, which is more ſubject to the aſſaults of Fortune, than any thing elſe in the world; for oftentimes the thread of their lives come to break in the hour that they hope moſt; and the infamy of their actions is ſet down in Hiſtorical Record: which Kings and Princes, and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in Authority, ought a thouſand times more to fear, than the ſlanderous tongue that can defame only the living; but writing makes ignominious thoſe that are dead: Which things being exactly weigh'd by <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and other Princes, they abandoned their Scepters and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, and betook themſelves to ſolitary retirements; and were contented with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, rather than luxuriouſly to enjoy the volatile pleaſures of the world.</p>

               <p>BUT leave we Kings and Emperours: And let us come to the Eccleſiaſticks, beginning at their chiefs, which are the Popes and Prelates: And are they not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and fortunate in this world? Their Dignities being the Supreme of all, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired without pain and labour; without Wars, Weapons, and effuſion of blood, and conſerv'd without perils; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and controul all: Monarchs reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and honour them; being rich and impal'd with Honour and Dignities. But if you will conſider the end of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, you will be ſo far from judging them happy, or envy their high Eſtates, that you would rather pity them. For if they would well govern the Ship of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> according to the Command of God, they muſt become as a publick Vaſſal, whoſe life is expoſed for the common good: they watch alone whileſt others ſleep, being as it were the Sentinels of the people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94417:53"/>
relief or repoſe, all the minutes of their lives being employed for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſafety, leſt any of their Flock be ſeduced and led away by Satan.—For if it be ſo as St. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> obſerves, (trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Firſt of the <hi>Hebrews</hi>) that he that is regent of one Church only, may hardly be ſaved, ſo great a charge hath he: In what danger then ſhall we ſay are the Popes, who are Guardians and Protectors of ſo many Churches? which Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> (being a man of a good life) was accuſtomed to ſay with tears to his private Friends, That amongſt all the States in the world, there ſeemed none to him more miſerable than that of the Papacy and Prelacy: For although the Throne where he ſits be richly ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yet was it beſet with Thorns and Prickles: the coſtly Robes with which they were covered being ſo weighty, that it wearied the ſhoulders of the moſt ſtrong and vigorous; and as for the Diaper'd Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre which they wore on their heads, it was a real flame, which burned to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt receſſes of their ſouls. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo great is their charge, ſo great and ſtrict is their account which they muſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Great Shepherd of the Fold, that it would make a man tremble with
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94417:54"/>
horror to think of it: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, and the particular and poſitive Prohibition of the Church to the contrary; yet how many are there that heap up Parſonage upon Parſonage, and ioyn Living to Living, and are more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous for the encreaſe of their Benefices, than they are for the Souls of their people? committing them to their Curates, and to them oftentimes that will be hired the cheapeſt; who as they ſerve God by their Procurator, will if the Lord prevent not, be damn'd in their own proper Perſons. I know and am fully perſwaded that there are ſome, who as they are called to greater Offices and Dignities in the Church than others, ſo likewiſe they have need of greater Revenues than others to ſupport them: I mean our Reverend and Sacred Hierarchy; but with the others it is not ſo, the caſe being quite otherwiſe.</p>

               <p>BUT leaving the Popes and Prelates: Let us come to conſider the Lives of thoſe who Adminiſter in Publick Affairs, as the Judges and Stateſmen; and we ſhall find them too, as little free from miſery as the others: and if there ſeem to ariſe any pleaſantneſs from the honour of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, yet is it tranſitory and inconſtant; their actions alſo paſſing before the eyes of the vulgar, who although they cannot perfectly underſtand the reaſons of things, yet will they cenſure and defame them whoſe doings are ahove their capacities: And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> well compared them to a Monſter with many heads, Fraudulent, Mutable and Uncertain; prone to Anger, to Praiſe, Diſpraiſe, Eſteem, Vilifie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Judgment or Diſcretion, Inflexible, Unlearned; and the Lives forſooth of them who are the Rulers, muſt be conformable
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94417:55"/>
to their Opinion: for as they Judg in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, ſo will they judg them in private; and not only concerning matters of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, but of thoſe which are of little conſequence (and as <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of), they will always have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which will be the matter of their contradiction. The <hi>Athenians</hi> murmured againſt <hi>Symonides,</hi> becauſe he ſpoke too loud. The <hi>Thebans</hi> accuſed <hi>Paniculus</hi> for his often ſpitting. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> becauſe he went with his head ſtooping. The <hi>Romans</hi> found great fault in <hi>Scipio,</hi> by reaſon of his ſnoring in ſleeping. The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ticenſes</hi> defamed good <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> becauſe that in eating he chewed on both ſides of his mouth. <hi>Pompey</hi> ſeemed to them uncivil, becauſe he ſcratched himſelf only with one finger. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> blamed <hi>Hannibal</hi> becauſe he went unbut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned. Others reprehended <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> becauſe forſooth he wore his girdle care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly. Yet is all this but little in reſpect of what they have done to other Famous Worthies; Baniſhing and putting them to Death for the good Service which they have done them. The great <hi>Grecian</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> who was ſo Loyal a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Republick, was Baniſhed by them as a perſon guilty of ſome
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94417:55"/>
notable crime. <hi>Socrates</hi> was likewiſe poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned. <hi>Hannibal</hi> was ſo ill treated by his own, that he was forced to wander up and down miſerably through the world. The <hi>Romans</hi> handled <hi>Camillus</hi> after the ſame manner. The <hi>Grecians</hi> ſerved far worſe <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> one of whom was ſtoned, the other having his eyes pull'd out, was as a murderer drove into exile. And as we have ſet before us the faults and miſeries which ariſe from the peoples part, ſo likewiſe muſt we put in counterpoize the errors and corruptions which abound in wicked Judges; ſome of whom are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aw'd by fear, leſt they ſhould diſpleaſe ſome great Perſonage, and therefore vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Juſtice, and are as <hi>Pilate</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Jeſus Chriſt for the fear which he had of diſpleaſing the Emperour <hi>Tybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius:</hi> Other Magiſtrates are corrupted by affection, as <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Tetrarch,</hi> who that he might fooliſhly comply with the love which he bore to the dancing Girl, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to death St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his being ſenſible of his Vertue and Innocency. Some are withheld from the doing of Juſtice through hatred and particular animoſities, ſome by gifts and preſents, as were the Sons of the Prophet and High-Prieſt <hi>Samuel: They love gifts,</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:94417:56"/>
ſaith the Prophet, <hi>and ſeek after retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they do not juſtice to the Orphans and Fatherleſs, and hear not the cauſe of the Widow:</hi> and in another place, <hi>Curſed be all ye who are led away by money and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, by love or hatred, that judg evil good, and good evil; making light darkneſs, and darkneſs light:</hi> Curſed be ye who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect not to the merit of the Cauſe, but the Perſon; who have not regard to the equity of the matter brought before ye, but the Gifts and Preſents; who mind not what reaſon ſuggeſts, but only affection. You are diligent in the cauſes of the rich, but put away them of the poor; you are to them auſtere and rigorous, but to the rich affable and tractable; the poor cryeth out, but no one regardeth; the rich ſpeaketh, and all the world hearkeneth, extolling his words to the heavens: and yet this is not enough, for when they are in the height of honour, they have another worm that gnaws them, like the Mother of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> that their Children might be placed in their honours and dignities, although they be never ſo ignorant and uncapable. <hi>They are exalted and enriched,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah, They are become fat, they have had no regard to the Father leſs, and have not executed judgment for the poor:</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:94417:56"/>
                  <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe things, ſaith the Lord? ſhall I not take vengeance on ſuch a people? you have condemned and put to death the innocent,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James, you have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in delights on the earth, taken your eaſe, filled your hearts: And now ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Weep and howle in you miſery: Your riches are corrupted, your coſtly and ſumptuous garments are full of moths, your gold and ſilver is everſpread with ruſt, and the ruſt of it ſhall witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as fire: For the tears of the Widows have pierced even unto my Throne.</hi> Theſe are the complaints which the Prophets and Apoſtles poured out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mercenary Judges; theſe are the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which the Lord hath thundred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the Miſeries of Marriage.</head>
               <p>LET us now conſider the happy or unhappy ſtate of Marriage: and it is moſt certain, that if we would forge in our minds the Idea of an excellent and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht Marriage on every ſide, as <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> hath made in his Republick, and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> in his <hi>City of God;</hi> There's nothing in this world which may equal that ſtate in delight: it being the conſummation and real comfort of all our hopes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and the end of all our travel: That this is true, will more certainly appear, if we conſider every thing: their Fortunes as well proſperous as adverſe, are common; the bed common, the children common; and which is more, there's ſo great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monality of body and union of ſouls, that they ſeem as two transformed into one: and if the pleaſure ſeemeth great to us, of conferring our affairs and ſecrets to our Friends and thoſe that are neareſt us, how much greater is the delight which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the opening of our hearts to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94417:57"/>
her, who is linked to us in ſuch bonds of love and duty, who is even as our ſelves, &amp; to whom we diſcover the moſt intimate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of our ſouls? What greater teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can there be of vehement and indiſſolui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amity, than to abandon and forſake Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother, and all Relations, and to be as it were an enemy to ones ſelf, for to follow a Husband whom ſhe wholly cleaves to; and having all other things in <hi>mépriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> depends alone on him? If he be rich, ſhe keeps his wealth; if poor, ſhe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the artifice which nature hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her to ſhare with him in his adverſity; if he be in proſperity, his felieity is doubled in her, ſeeing her participate in it; if he be in adverſity, he beareth but half of the evil; and moreover he is comforted and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by her; if he would dwell retired and ſolitary at home, he hath one that will bear him company, who will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him and make him digeſt more eaſily the incommodiouſneſs of ſolitude; if he will go into the Country, ſhe conducteth him with her eye as far as the ſight of it can reach; ſhe deſireth and wiſheth for him being abfent, ſigheth and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, lamenting as if he was always near her; being returned, he is welcomed and received into her imbraces: ſo that it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94417:58"/>
ſeemeth to ſpeak the truth, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is a Coeleſtial gift beſtowed upon man, as well for the refreſhment and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Youth, as the repoſe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of his old Age. Nature can give us but one Father and one Mother, but Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage repreſenteth many to us in our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who reverence and honour us, and have us more dear unto them than their own lives; being young and little, they toy and prattle about us, and prepare us an infinite of pleaſures: ſo that they ſeem as it were amuſements and play-things which nature hath given us to deceive and paſs away part of our miſerable life. Are we beſieged with old Age (a thing forced and common to all), they mitigate the irkſomneſs of it, cloſe our eyes, and take care of our decent burial; they being our fleſh and blood, in ſeeing them we behold our ſelves; ſo that the Father ſeeing his Children, ſeeth himſelf as it were young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in them, who immortalize him in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creating of others after him.</p>
               <p>I would not for fear of being accuſed of inconſtancy, deſpiſe that which I have ſo much exalted; but becauſe my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which treateth of all States of Life, requires that I ſhould not excuſe this no more than others: I ſhall therefore in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94417:58"/>
ſhort, recapitulate that which I have read in many Authors, who confeſs with me that there is much of ſweetneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſs in Marriage; but if one did well conſider and weigh in a juſt balance the great and inſupportable vexations which are found in it, it will appear to be repleniſh'd no leſs with miſeries than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The <hi>Athenians,</hi> a people famous for their wiſdom and prudence, obſerving that the wives could not well accord with their Husbands by reaſon of an infinite of ſtrifes and diſſentions which aroſe ordinarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, were conſtrained to eſtabliſh in their Republick certain Magiſtrates, whom they called Reconcilers of thoſe that were Married, the office and only buſineſs of whom was to reduce them to concord by all ways and means that were poſſible. The <hi>Spartans</hi> in their Republick had likewiſe ordered certain Magiſtrates, whoſe charge it was to correct the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of women, repreſs their arrogancy, and curb their audaciouſneſs towards their Husbands. The <hi>Romans</hi> would not ordain Magiſtrates (thinking with themſelves (perhaps) that men were not able to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the unbridled temerity of women) but they would have their refuge to their gods, and to that purpoſe they Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94417:59"/>
a Temple to the goddeſs whom they called <hi>Viriplaca,</hi> where they in the end made up their Domeſtick and private quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels: But who can patiently endure the charges of Marriage, the inſolency and arrogancy of women, the yoke of ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect a Sex? Who can furniſh and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their luſtful appetite, their inſatiable pomp? Saith not the Ancient <hi>Proverb, That Women and Ships are never ſo well fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that one ſhall find ſome thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that lacks mending.</hi> If thou takeſt her being poor, ſhe will be deſpiſed, and thy ſelf leſs eſteemed; if rich and wealthy, thou makeſt thy ſelf her ſlave and ſervant; for thinking to eſpouſe an equal compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, thou ſhalt betroth thy ſelf to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable Miſtreſs; if thou takeſt her deformed, thou canſt not love her; if comely and handſome, ſhe will be as a buſh at thy door to draw in company; beauty is a Tower which is beſieged and aſſaulted by all the world: and indeed that thing is difficult to keep and preſerve, of which every one pretends to have the Key. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the hazard, ſaith <hi>De la Perriere,</hi> of thy round-heads being made forked, which indeed were a fearful Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis if it were viſible and apparent: The concluſion then is, That riches makes a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94417:59"/>
proud; beauty, ſuſpicious; defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, odious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Diponates</hi> having experimented the torments of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſaid, <hi>That there was but two good days in it, one the wedding day, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the which the wife died; the one whereon they were Married and in which they feaſted and made good chear; the other day</hi> (which he ſaid was good) <hi>was that on which the woman died, by the death of whom the Husband was freed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from ſervitude.</hi> Hiſtory makes mention of a Noble <hi>Roman,</hi> who the next morning after he had lain with his Wife, was very ſad and penſive; and being queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by ſome of his Friends and familiars of the reaſon of his ſadneſs, ſeeing that his wife was comely, rich, and of a Noble Extraction: ſhewing them his foot, he ſaith, <hi>Friends, my Shooe is new, neat, and well made, but you know not what part of my foot it rings me in. Philemon</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>That a woman was a neceſſary evil: that there was nothing more ſcarcer in the world than a good woman:</hi> Following the ancient <hi>Proverb, That a good Woman, a good Mule, and a good Goat, were three wicked Beaſts.</hi> Is any thing, ſaith <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> nimbler than the tongue of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled woman? any thing more ſharp
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94417:60"/>
than her outrages? more raſh than her audaciouſneſs? more execrable than her malignity? more dangerous than her fury? and more diſſimulative than her tears? not to take notice of every thing which he reckons up, that is more vexatious in a Conjugal ſtate; where oftentimes one is forced to bring up children of other mens getting; or if our own, we are in danger of their being wicked, and they are oftentimes the diſhonour and deſtruction of their Family, and a reproach to all their Generation. The Emperor <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was fully ſenſible of this, when he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his Wife had been Barren, and oftentimes called her and his Niece two blood-ſuckers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marc. Aurelius</hi> knowing well the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Marriage; as he was importun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome to marry his Daughter, Trouble me no more, faith he, with that matter, for if all the conſultations and advices of all the wiſe men in the World were met in one, yet would they not ſuffice in the buſineſs of Marriage; and do you think that I can do it alone, and that ſo ſuddenly. It is ſix years ſince, ſaith he, that <hi>Antonius Pius</hi> choſe me for his Son-in-law, and gave me the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire for a Dowry with his Daughter;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94417:60"/>
and yet notwithſtanding both of us herein deceived, I in taking his Daughter for my Wife, and he in taking me for his Son. He was called <hi>Pius,</hi> by reaſon of his mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Clemency to every one; but to me, ſaith he, he hath been hard and cruel, for in little fleſh he hath given me a great many bones, which are as <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Aloes,</hi> which we find mingled in the ſweets of Marriage; which (to ſpeak the truth) we cannot ſo well mask or diſguiſe with artificial words, but that we ſhall be conſtrained to confeſs, that if we would put in counterpoize the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and misfortunes, (eſpecially in ſecond Marriages) with the pleaſures and delights thereof, that the one will weigh down and far ſurpaſs the other; and indeed he that hath Children by his firſt wife, and hath thoughts of a ſecond Marriage, ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things to conſider (if ſo be his Children are beloved by him, and doth deſire that they ſhould ſo continue), that he now betroths himſelf to one whoſe ends and deſigns run in a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel quite contrary to his; and ſhould we ſuppoſe her to be a woman of an even and pious temper, and one who in almoſt all things elſe would ſteer by the rules of impartial juſtice and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94417:61"/>
yet in this caſe would ſhe cry out with <hi>Julius Caeſar, In aliis pietatem colam,</hi> and with <hi>Rebecca, That the Son of this bond-woman ſhall not be heir with my Son,</hi> how well ſoever outwardly ſhe may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the contrary.</p>

               <p>BUT leaving the miſeries of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, whether firſt or ſecond, they being enough to fill up whole Volumes: let us betake our ſelves to the conſideration of other matters, which help to compleat mans miſery; and as if it were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that all other things were full of ſorrow and anguiſh, and yielded us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94417:62"/>
but thorns and thiſtles, yet we muſt add and create to our ſelves more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and which indeed is the greateſt and comparatively the only miſery of all, I mean, the diſſentions and differences in Religion; for, ſeeing there is but one Verity amongſt ſo many variety of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and but one way to Happineſs, though people have fancied thouſands: what do the poor ignorant ſort then think, what ſtraits and fears are they in, when they behold wiſer than themſelves crumbled into as many Sects as Men? nay every little pretender to have gotten the keys of Heaven, and they therefore muſt come over to them if ever they think to get in there: and upon that account it is we ſee them flock (poor wretches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to be happy) to theſe Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bancks, who aſſure no leſs, than to make them ſo, and indeed it would make a man think no leſs, by their ſawcy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they pretend to have with the Divinity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> making as if they were as privy to the inmoſt Counſels of Heaven, and knew its decrees as perfectly as their own diſſimulations; and have power to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if not to damn all that oppoſe them, though they tell them nothing but that which they will at laſt certainly find
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94417:62"/>
true; that 'tis not words, nor looks that will make a man a favourite of Heaven, but a vertuous and pious temper; neither can any man judg of his Relation to God, but by his unwearied diligence in making himſelf like him: and though men of corrupt minds and various intereſts cry up Religion to be another matter, yet the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, and will do, againſt all the reſtleſs underminings of its adverſaries, who for the vain-glorious Epithetes of Guide &amp; Leader, and the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their reputation amongſt the ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Rabble, will continue to lead them on (notwithſtanding the dictates of Piety and Reaſon) into remedileſs and endleſs deſtruction; who were they really vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and as much lovers of God as they are of their own private humours, the miſchiefs ariſing from the diverſity of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, would be for the moſt part, if not altogether extinguiſhed. How eaſie were it for men, did they love themſelves and others, in a real religious reſpect, to centre altogether in union and concord in this World, and in endleſs repoſe and happineſs in the next? But alas, men love to be miſerable and humourſom, and will prefer the Butterfly of their own private fancy, before the quiet and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94417:63"/>
of the whole race of Mankind; would men ſpend half that zeal and emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in endeavours after Humility, and Charity, and contempt of the World, as they do in oppoſing Government and Order: Would men be as ready and as willing to gratifie and meet Truth, as they are ready to cry out they are ſo: Would they be as willing and as ready to hearken to its ſuggeſtions, as they are to thoſe of pride and conceitedneſs: we ſhould then have no cauſe to complain of Humame miſeries upon this account, nor indeed upon any other.</p>

               <p>THE City of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> hath been afflicted with ſo great and ſuch an unheard of Peſtilence, that they that were ſtruck with it, imagin'd that their approaching deaths were not occaſioned by the maladies they groaned under, but that they were kill'd by others, and died furiouſly with theſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. In the time of <hi>Heraclee,</hi> there ſprung up ſuch a contagion in <hi>Italy,</hi> that in a little time it ſwept away thouſands; and the violence of the diſtemper was ſo great, that many through impatiency in their ſickneſs, precipitated themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the River <hi>Tiber</hi> that they might obtain ſome refreſhment in that extream heat which inwardly parched them. <hi>Thuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides a Greek</hi> Author writeth, That in his time the Air was ſo corrupted in <hi>Greece,</hi> that there died an infinite number of people, without finding the leaſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Moreover, he addeth a thing more
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94417:64"/>
ſtrange, <hi>That thoſe who returned to their former health, loſt their memory and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg ſo far, that they knew not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the Father not knowing his own Son. Marc. Aurelius,</hi> an Author worthy of Credit, aſſureth us, <hi>That in his time there was ſuch a Mortality in</hi> Italy, <hi>that the Hiſtorians who wrote of thoſe times, found leſs difficulty in counting the ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that were alive, than in count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great number of thoſe that were dead.</hi> The Soldiers of <hi>Vidius Caſſius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Selucia</hi> a City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> entred the great Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> where they found a Cabinet, which having opened, and hoping therein to find a great and ineſtimable Treaſure; there came out ſuch an infectious air, that it corrupted firſt all <hi>Babylon,</hi> afterwards <hi>Greece,</hi> and then <hi>Rome,</hi> where it excited ſo many Peſtilences, that it deſtroy'd almoſt the third part of the World. But leaving the Ancient Hiſtories, let us deſcend to them which have paſt under our own age, as it were; that we who are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may learn by theſe great miſeries and afflictions which God ſends us, to know the great weakneſs and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our Humane Condition. For when his anger is inflam'd againſt our
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94417:64"/>
ſins, he makes us feel the ſmart of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſo rigorouſly, that there is no kind of torment and vexation with which he does not afflict and perſecute his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: What experience have we had of this in the Year 1528, that when the Peſt invaded the <hi>French</hi> Camp during the Siege of <hi>Naples,</hi> the violence of the Diſtemper was ſo ſharp and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that one was ſooner dead, than thought to be ſo. And this unhappy Diſeaſe afflicted not only the Vulgar (who were by it almoſt extinguiſhed) but alſo the Nobility and Commanders, the Lords of <hi>Lautrec,</hi> of <hi>Vaudemont, De la val, De Moleac,</hi> the <hi>Chateignary, Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and other notable perſonages, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of whom cannot be rehears'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſorrow; which happened alſo to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> when they had taken <hi>Boulon.</hi> In which City was ingendred ſo great a Peſtilence, that the living could ſcarce bury the dead: ſo that the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> could not find in his Countrey any that would go and inhabit it: and was neceſſicated to carry them thither by force, bound and Manicl'd, for the more they carried, the more they died: ſo that the Cantons of the City were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and putrified, through the Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94417:65"/>
and Vapors that proceeded from the dead Carcaſſes.</p>
               <p>The Year after that the defunct <hi>French</hi> King eſpous'd Queen <hi>Elenor, Germany</hi> was aſſaulted with a new kind of Malady, of which the Infected died in leſs than 24 hours in a peſtilential Sweat; and this diſtemper having taken its original from the Ocean, ſpread in an inſtant through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Germany,</hi> as a ſudden conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which waſteth and conſumeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing; for before there could be found a Remedy, there died ſo many thouſands of men, that many Provinces became as Deſarts and waſte places through the putrefaction of the Air that conſum'd all that did touch it; and that the Air was ſo much infected, that their Garments were ſtain'd as it were with a red Croſs. <hi>Joachim Scilerus</hi> writeth, <hi>That when the Peſtilence ſo vehemently tormented</hi> England <hi>for ſo long time, the vigour of the Poyſon was ſo ſtrong, that not only Men were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated and extinguiſh'd by it, but alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he Birds left their Eggs, Neſts, and little ones; the Beaſts their Dens and Caverns, the Serpents and Moles appear'd in Troops upon the Earth, leaving their proper abodes for vexation of the venomous Vapor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:94417:65"/>
                  <hi>in the Earth, ſo that they were found dead under the Trees in the Fields, with Puſtules and Sores on their little mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Year five hundred forty ſix, the laſt day of <hi>May,</hi> aroſe a Plague which laſted nine Months, ſo great and terrible in <hi>Aix,</hi> a City of <hi>Province,</hi> that the people died at their Victuals, ſo that the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards were ſo full of dead Corpſes, that ſcarce any place was to be found for the interring of thoſe that were brought thither: the moſt part of the ſick, the ſecond day fell into a Frenſie, and caſt themſelves into Wells: Others threw themſelves out at Windows; Others were troubled with a Flux of Blood at the Noſe, which ran down night and day like a Flood, and with this effuſion of Blood they ended their lives: nay, the matter came to that extremity and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that the Women with Child miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried in four days time, they and the Children which they went withal periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who were found afterwards changed to a Violet and Azure colour, as if the blood was ſcattered through the whole Body.

Gold and Silver in their hands oftentimes died through hunger and thirſt: and if it happen'd at any time that they had wherewith to ſatisfie Nature, the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was ſo ſevere and violent, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes they were found dead with the meat in their mouths; and the fury of the Malady was ſo enflam'd, that ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could there be found a perſon free from it. And indeed, people were by one ſingle look infected, a thing wonderfully ſtrange; and their breath was ſo venomous, that thence immediately aroſe peſtilential Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes. That which a Phiſician hath left us in writing, is a thing wonderful and monſtrous in Nature, who being depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them of the City for to help and ſuccour the ſick, recounteth, <hi>That this Diſtemper was ſo cruel and malign, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all Medicines, it ceas'd not to deſtroy all them that were therewith ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, having no other hope of eaſement in their pains than by death; and were ſo opiniated and reſolute in this, that as ſoon as they found themſelves therewith ſeized, they themſelves put an end to their miſerable lives.

               <p>WHEN our God is angry with us for our ſins, he uſually puniſheth us in this World, with Sickneſs, Wars, Fires and Famines: all which, the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, we have to our ſorrow, I wiſh I could ſay to our amendment, in theſe our days experimented: and that ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, that former Ages cannot parallel it; Let us fear therefore, and not only ſo, but deprecate and avert Gods anger by our Repentance, leſt that we feel like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the effects of thoſe menaces which he by his Prophets in Holy Writ hath threatned us: When he ſaith, <hi>That he</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:94417:67"/>
                  <hi>will make the Heavens as Braſs, and the Earth as Iron:</hi> that is to ſay, barren and fruitleſs. And for this cauſe, our Lord declaring to his Diſciples the evils that ſhould come to paſs; after having fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>That Nation ſhould riſe up againſt Nation, and Kingdom againſt Kingdom:</hi> He immediately addeth (as if one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the other) <hi>That there ſhould be great Peſtilences and Famines throughout the Regions of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After <hi>Totillus</hi> had beſieged <hi>Rome,</hi> they of the City fell into ſuch ſcarcity and want of Proviſion, that having nothing left them, they began to eat all ſorts of Animals: as Horſes, Dogs, Cats, Rats and Mice, and all other manner of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and in the end one another. A thing certainly moſt dreadful, that when the Juſtice of God preſſeth us, we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſuch neceſſity, that we ſpare not our own Kind, nor the Mothers their own Children, which happened likewiſe in the ruine of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> noteth in his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</hi> When Grand <hi>Scipio</hi> beſieged the great City of <hi>Numantia,</hi> having taken from them all means of proviſion, they were reduced to ſuch Extremity, that they went every day to chaſe after the <hi>Romans</hi> as the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

There is mention'd in the Holy Scripture a Famine which was in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> in the time of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> which I think ſurpaſſed the precedent; for, there was ſo great a dearth and ſcarcity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, that <hi>the head of an Aſs was ſold for four ſcore pieces of Silver; and the fourth part of the meaſure of Pigeons dung, five pieces: and when all was conſum'd, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eat their own Children;</hi> ſo that a poor Woman of that City formed her Complaint to the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (ſeeing him on the Wall) That her Neighbour would not obſerve the Contract and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement betwixt them; <hi>For we have,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>dreſſed and eaten my Son, and ſhe hides and conceals hers. And when the King heard this which the Woman had ſaid, his heart had like to burſt and ſplit with ſorrow, and he began to rent his Garments, and cloathe himſelf with Sackcloth.</hi>

'tis come to that paſs, that if I ſhould ſave thy life, thou wilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the perpetual ſervitude of the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: <hi>Come then my Child, be thou as food unto thy Mother, and terror to the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who have left me nothing, and to the Ages to come a memorial of horror and pity; and after ſhe had ſpoke theſe words, ſhe kill'd it, and put it on the Spit and roaſted it, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the half of it, and ſetting up the reſt. Immediately after ſhe had acted this deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Tragedy, the Soldiers returned again to her, who ſmelling the ſavour of the roaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

                  <hi>meat, began to threaten her with death if ſhe ſhewed them not where her food was; but ſhe being reſolute in her rage, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but how ſhe might accompany her Son in death, without being the leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed, ſaid to them, Hold your peace, my Friends, I have not been unjuſt to you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaved you exactly your part: and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe words, ſhe produced the Child on the Table; at which the Soldiers were ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and confounded, that they ſtood as mute and vanquiſh'd: but ſhe on the contrary with a furious and undaunted look, ſaid, What, my Friends, 'tis my Child, 'tis my doing, why feed you not? I am glutted already: Are you more ſcrupulous than the Mother that bore it? Diſdain you the meats which I have us'd before you, and will now ſhew you by eating the ſame, the great diſtreſs you have drove me to? But they who could not ſuffer or endure ſo piteous a ſpectacle, fled away and left her alone with the other part of her Child, which was in ſhort all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder which they had left her.</hi> See the Hiſtory of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> the very place; which I have the rather tranſcribed Verbatim, for what was contained in it.

Age, and ſee it with their Eyes, and touch it as it were with their Fingers: I would therefore now ſhew that our God ſpareth us no more than the Ancients, when he's angry with us for our ſins, as ſhall be amply manifeſt by the Hiſtory which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, written by <hi>Paradin,</hi> a man of great Induſtry, in that which concerneth Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; in his Treatiſe of the memorable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our time, where he ſaith, <hi>That the Kingdom of</hi> France <hi>was ſo greatly afficted, that it was thought that all was reduced to the laſt end and period: For during the ſpace of five whole years, which began in</hi> 1528, <hi>the Seaſon was in ſuch indiſpoſition and diſorder, that the four Elements left their natural courſes, and ſhewed themſelves confus'd, perverted and prepoſterous: the Spring beginning in</hi> Autumn; <hi>that in the Spring; the Summer in Winter, the Winter in Summer; but above all, the Summer had the dominion over the reſt, and quite againſt its nature; ſo that in the heart of Winter</hi> (viz.) <hi>in</hi> December, January <hi>and</hi> Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary, <hi>when the Earth expected its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and ripening by Froſt and cold, there was ſo great and vehement a heat, and the Earth was ſo ſcorched, that in five Years there happened no Froſt that dured above a day or two: that which did, was ſo weak,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:94417:69"/>
                  <hi>that it could not freeze the water; and by this great and unaccuſtom'd heat, was maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and nouriſhed the Vermin of the Earth: as Snails and Caterpillars, and them in ſuch quantity, that the young and tender bud of the ſtalk coming out into the blade, it was immediately gnawed and devour'd by them, which was the cauſe that the Corn which ſhould have multiplyed and ſpread, wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſhrunk up, all into one and the ſame ſtalk, and produced only one or two blades, and they ſteril and blaſted; in ſo much, that when they came to thraſh it, they found only their ſeed, and ſcarce that.</hi> And this Famine dured five years without ceaſing, which was the cauſe that an Horſe-load of Corn was ſold in <hi>Lyons, Foret, Auvergne, Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Savoy</hi> &amp; <hi>Dauphin,</hi> and many other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, at the value of 14, 16, 17, 18 <hi>French Piſtols:</hi> and the poor people who lived com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently enough before, were then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to abandon and forſke their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, going up &amp; down begging their bread for Gods ſake. And the number of the poor Mendicants encreas'd after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that it was dreadful to behold them in ſuch crouds, &amp; impoſible to relieve them, there iſſuing out alſo of their bodies great ſtinks and infectious vapours, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by their filling their bellies with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94417:70"/>
all ſorts of Herbs good and bad, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and venomous; ſo that there were no Herbs in the Gardens, even to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry roots, which they devoured not; and when there were no more left to take thence, they had recourſe to thoſe that grew by the high-way ſide; boyling great Chaldrons of <hi>Maloes</hi> and <hi>Thiſtles,</hi> ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling therewith ſometimes a little Bran, and ſo ſtuffed themſelves like Swine, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king bread of <hi>Acorns</hi> and any corrupted root; ſo much were they conſtrained by eagerneſs of Appetite: and remembring that the Hogs loved <hi>Fern</hi>-roots, they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd of them to make bread to feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, defrauding the Swine of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per food: whereupon enſued an infinite number of Maladies: the richeſt of the people fell into great fear and trouble ſeeing ſuch troops of men and women, young and old trembling in the ſtreets, having their skins ſwoln as if they had the Dropſie; others being half dead, on the ground drew their laſt gaſps, and with ſuch people were the ſtables and out-houſes filled; others were ſo faint, that they could ſcarce tell their neceſſities, and had hardly breath left in their bodies, ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering up and down more like ghoſts and ſhadows than men: After all this,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94417:70"/>
that which was more to be lamented than the reſt, was to ſee great number of poor Mothers ſurrounded with many little Children, who for want of Victuals cried and howled to them, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a manner, that it would have mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the moſt obdurate heart into pity. The aforeſaid <hi>Paradin</hi> writeth, that he himſelf hath ſeen in <hi>Burgundy</hi> a poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who by a great purchaſe and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity had obtained a morſel of bread, the which was ſuddenly ſnatch't away by her little child which ſhe ſuckled in her arms; who did eat the hard and dry bread with ſo ſtrong an appetite, that it ſurpaſſed imagination; and the Mother being willing to gather up the little crumbs which fell from the mouth of the child, the ſaid infant ſet it ſelf as it were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and cry out of deſpite to ſee its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gather up the remainders, being afraid of not having enough. The ſame Author reciteth moreover, that in a Village there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about were found two women, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to aſſwage their hunger, fed on a venemous Herb called <hi>Scyla,</hi> much like the <hi>Leek,</hi> knowing not the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or vertue of the ſaid Herb, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with poyſoned themſelves, ſo that their feet and hands became as green as <hi>Lizards,</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:94417:71"/>
and there ran ſuch a venom from under their Nails, that notwithſtanding all the help that was adminiſtred to them, they died ſuddenly: So much were all creatures animated and buſied in the execution of Gods anger: finally, this miſery and calamity of the Seaſon, being of long and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duration, the Country people whoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings lay all in Lands, were conſtrained to have recourſe to rich Merchants (ſome of whom had amaſſed great quantities of Corn) that they might buy of them as long as their money would laſt; and when that was gone, the poor people were fain to Mortgage their Lands and Livings, ſome ſelling them out-right, at a very low Rate, that they might have wherewithal to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their hunger.</p>

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have been tied up to ſo ſtrict a diet, and ſmall quantity of food, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the violence of their Diſtempers, that they have been conſtrained to drink their own Urine to quench their thirſt, and eat their Plaiſters, that they might

moderate their hunger.

Such are the poyſons which men make now-a-days, and that ſo dexterouſly, that there can be no preſervation from them, unleſs men ſhould ſhun all Society, and betake themſelves to Deſarts with the brute Beaſts, in the company of whom he is more certain of ſafety than with men. Some Ancient Authors, as <hi>Orpheus, Orus, Medeſius, Heliodorus,</hi> and <hi>Aratus,</hi> have taught the Compoſition of five hundred ſorts of Poyſons; and ſome others have ſince augmented the number; but if they were now alive, they would be reputed as dull and inſiped; ſo much is humane malice increaſed.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94417:73"/>
and was ſold at an hundred Crowns an Ounce; ſo great a Tribute paid he that uſed them: yet nevertheleſs they had this conſideration, that they made him Swear who bought them, that he ſhould not uſe it in their Province, nor againſt their Friends and Allies, but only againſt ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: but men are grown in theſe our times ſo ingeniouſly induſtrious to do evil, that they have found out ways to poyſon men by ſcent only, as did a certain <hi>Sienois</hi> to his Corrival, preſenting him with a Noſegay of Flowers, the ſmell of which ſtruck him dead immediately. Another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a <hi>Florentine</hi> Cavalier, having taken off his Head-piece that he might refreſh himſelf, was eſpied by his Enemy, who rubbed on the inſide of it ſo deadly a poyſon, that as ſoon as ever he put it on his head, made him give up the Ghoſt immediately. They ſpare not in <hi>Italy</hi> ſo much as their Flamboies and Torches, but corrupt and ſophiſticate them, and that ſo artificially, that the ſmoak of them poyſoneth; ſo that you dare ſcarcely light your Torches for your conduct in the night, if you have ſuſpicion of an Enemy. 'Tis a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to apply poyſon to meats and drinks, as in time paſt: for men have found out means now-a-days to poyſon the very Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaddles,

Boots and Spurs; and that which ſeemeth more pernicious, is, that ſome have loſt their lives by ſhaking hands with them, whoſe pretence was Friendſhip. Some have been poyſoned by Letters and Papers ſent them, which when opened, there flies out ſuch a poyſonous vapour, which riſing upward, penetrateth to the brain: And ſo artificial are they in theſe Compoſitions, that the venom killeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intention of the Murderer: for if he pleaſes, the party ſhall live three months, ſix month, a year, or longer; ſo that death ſhall anſwer the time of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Compoſition: Moreover, if they pleaſe they can ſo order the effects of the poyſon, that it ſhall hurt but one member at a time. An experiment not much unlike to this we now ſpeak of, hath been found too true, to their coſt, who drank of a poyſoned Fountain on this-ſide the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which cauſed their teeth to fall out of their heads who taſted of it: but mens malice hath extended farther yet, and hath given greater teſtimony of their execrable wickedneſs, in that they have not ſtuck to mingle poyſon with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament.</p>

of this Element, as is written by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles.

               <p>THE Air is ſo requiſite for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Man, that there is no Creature can live without it; and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it's ſo pernicious to mankind when it is corrupt and putrified, that the moſt part of the forementioned Peſtilences take their firſt original from it. The Earth, which is the moſt ſweet and tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of the Elements, being the common Mother and receptacle of us all; being born, it nouriſheth and ſuſtains us, and at laſt takes us into her entrails as in our Couch, and keepeth us until our God ſhall call us to appear before his Tribunal: and yet nevertheleſs ſhe produceth all the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom and poiſon with which our poor life is continually aſſaulted; and ſometimes by her quakings and agitations, many Towns have been demoliſhed, and many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Men ſwallowed down into the depth of her Abyſs. In the Reign of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi> the Earth began to be moved with ſuch an impetuoſity, that there was
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94417:77"/>
not only many Cities ruined, but there was above a hundred thouſand people ſwallowed up in it. In the Reign of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> there was ſuch a great number of Cities and their Citizens ruined in <hi>Aſia,</hi> that with great difficulty could the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians number them: In the time of <hi>Iſocrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> the Earth ſo opened in <hi>Europe,</hi> that two great Cities with all their Inhabitants, were in an inſtant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown and ruined. There was never ſince the memory of man read of a more terrible Earthquake than that which was in the time of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> by which in the ſpace of a night, twelve great Cities were ſwallowed with all their Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: amongſt which was <hi>Rollonia, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Caeſarea, Philadelphia,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Marc. Varro,</hi> one of the moſt worthy Authors that have written in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, ſaith, <hi>That in</hi> Spain <hi>there was a great Town ſcituated in a Sandy-placc, which was ſo hollowed and digged by the Connies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that finally the Inhabitants for ſook it for fear of being buried in its Ruins.</hi> The ſame Author writes, <hi>That there was a City in</hi> France, <hi>which was rendred uninhabitable by reaſon of the great number of Frogs:</hi> The ſame happened in <hi>Africa,</hi> by means of the <hi>Graſhoppers. Theophraſtus</hi> makes
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94417:77"/>
mention of a certain <hi>Province</hi> made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate by innumerable companies of <hi>Worms. Pliny</hi> makes mention of a <hi>Province</hi> that borders on the limits of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> where the <hi>Ants</hi> and <hi>Scorpions</hi> and other Vermin, have drove into exile the Men that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited there. The <hi>Flies</hi> drove away the <hi>Magarenſes</hi> in <hi>Greece.</hi> The <hi>Waſps</hi> chaſed the <hi>Epheſians. Anthenor</hi> writeth, That great ſwarms of <hi>Bees</hi> drove from a City its Inhabitants, and made their Neſts in their Houſes. What teſtimony have we here of Humane frailty? what a School and Diſcipline to learn Man to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in? what evidence of the Power of God over his Creatures, whoſe Judgments are ſo terrible and affrightful, that as ſoon as ever Man beginneth to glory and raiſe himſelf againſt his God, he knoweth well how to depreſs him: and therefore he ſendeth him Heralds and forerunners of his Anger, War, Famine and Plagues: But moreover, there's no Element nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creature though never ſo contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, which ſeeketh and worketh not his ruin, and who are not as Miniſters and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of the Divine Juſtice, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt not only by the teſtimony of <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> but alſo by the Sacred Writings, when the <hi>Frogs</hi> and <hi>Graſhoppers</hi> abandoned their

               </p>
               <p>We have hitherto deduced a ſtrange Philoſophy of the miſery of Man; for if he were of Iron or Steel, or harder than a Diamond, it would be notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding miraculouſly wonderful how he could laſt the one half part of his life-time without being ſhattered and broken, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pain, anguiſh, travel and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom which he muſt every minute en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: and yet notwithſtanding the many misfortunes wherewith he is continually afflicted, he humbleth not himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Almighty hand of his Creator; which thing being not well underſtood by <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> ſeeing this great Gulf of miſery in which Man is plunged from his Birth even to his Sepulchre, they have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Nature, Step-dame and cruel Extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who cauſeth Man to pay ſo much for his Excellency and Dignity; But both the one and the other have under the name of Nature unreaſonably accuſed God of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and injuſtice: for all theſe evils, and this Sea of Miſery wherewith Man is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed, cometh not from the hatred of God, but from the malice and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man; for he equalling himſelf
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94417:78"/>
with his Maker, declined and fell from his priſtine Nobility, defacing in himſelf the Image of God, and imprinting inſtead thereof the Image of the Devil. Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy and Audaciouſneſs is the cauſe of all the wounds and maledictions which he receiveth: for, had it not been for Ambition and deſire of being great, we had been as the Angels; we had remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and been now what we ſhall be in the Reſurrection, crowned with Glory and Honour. Neither is this all, but what is worſe, and far more vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, are the diſtempers of our minds, they being far more dangerous than thoſe of our bodies: for they of the Body ſhew themſelves by ſigns, either by the bad co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Viſage, or by the unequal beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pulſe, or ſome other intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, or ſigns of diſorder; and having known them, the Remedy is preſently ſought after: but he that is diſtempered in mind, is render'd uncapable of judging of his own Condition; ſo that the Patient knowing not his diſtemper, ſeeketh not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Remedies; and yet is there alſo a greater abuſe of them which have their bodies afflicted, for we call them by the names of the Diſeaſes wherewith they are tormented: as them who are troubled
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94417:79"/>
with Phrenſie, we call them Phrenetick; them who are vexed with the Palſie, we call them Paralytick; them who labour under Joint-evil, we call Gouty. But we do quite otherwiſe in the maladies of the Mind: for thoſe who are angry and Cholerick, burning in their Paſſion, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering one another, we call them Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and Magnanimous, and look on them as perſons having their Honour in great Recommendation; Thoſe who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Women and Maidens, immerſing themſelves in Luſt and laſciviouſneſs, we term them Lovers, and perſons endued with Kindneſs, Hmility and ſweetneſs of Diſpoſition: Thoſe who are Ambitious, and do endeavour by all illicite means to make themſelves Great and Honourable, we call them Noble, Gallant, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Noble and active Spirits: Them who are Covetous, and make themſelves Rich in a ſhort time, circumventing their Neighbours by a thouſand Subtilties and Inventions, we call them thriſty and good Husbands, who manage well their affairs: and ſo of all the others, calling thoſe things Vertues, which are really Vices; making thoſe things worthy of Honour which merit nought elſe but blame and miſpriſion. And now if we
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94417:79"/>
would in order purſue the infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ldies with which the minds of Men are for the moſt part at this day torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as we have done thoſe of the Body; What Eloquence, what Words are there that can reach it? What Majeſtick Sentences can comprehend it? ſeeing the Age wherein we are, is for the moſt part involved in ſo many Vices, that it ſeemeth, as if all the Vices of the precedent Age were met together in this.</p>

This is the time of which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>The Earth is full of Gold and Silver, there is no end of their Treaſure: they joyn Houſe to Houſe, Field to Field, as if they alone would inhabit in the middle of the Earth.</hi> And out of this peſtilent root of Covetouſneſs, proceedeth (as from a Fountain) all the Evils which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorged on the whole World: from thence is the original of the moſt part of the War and effuſion of Blood wherewith the Earth is bathed: From thence ſpring Murthers, Treaſons, Sacriledges, Pillages, Uſuries, Frauds and Perjuries, corruption of Judges, and perverſion of Witneſſes: from thence proceed Poiſonings, prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94417:80"/>
of Law-ſuits, with which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Courts are repleniſhed: and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, this Vice is ſo frequent and common amongſt men, that you can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell any ſtate or condition that is not therewith tainted. <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> planted the firſt Root, which hath ſince ſo well encreas'd, that there's ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Province in Chriſtendom which can be ſaid to be free from it. In the time when the Goſpel was firſt planted in the World, and its Profeſſors were haraſſed by a continued and uninterrupted perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, then were the indigencies of poor diſtreſſed people, taken care of, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for; but now in theſe laſt and worſt times wherein men have fallen into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality and hypocriſie, their wants are ſo far from being relieved, that they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve for Objects whereon to exerciſe our ſcorn. I am almoſt aſhamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a monſtrous Hiſtory of the Avarice of an <hi>Italian</hi> Prelate, named <hi>Angelot,</hi> who was exalted to the dignity of a Cardinal, and was ſo poiſoned with this unhappy venom of Covetouſneſs, that when the Groom had at night given Oats to his Horſes, he came down by a falſe Door into the Stable alone without light, and being there, robbed his own Horſes
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:94417:81"/>
of their Provender, and continued ſo to do, and that for ſo Iong a time, that at laſt the Groom perceiving them grow leaner and leaner, hid himſelf one night in the Stable, where catching his Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the very act, gave him ſo many blows with the Fork, that he was fain to be carried into his Chamber, receiving this Treatment as a worthy recompence of his baſe and greedy Humour; which ſtory would ſeem fabulous, had not <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lphe,</hi> and <hi>Jovian Pontanus,</hi> in his Book concerning Liberality, and many other Authors, made mention of it. Theſe are the fruits, this the profit of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Riches, which are gotten and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with ſo much pain and labour, and kept and preſerved with ſo much Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and parted from with ſuch groans and Exclamations. The ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> when their Republick was governed by poor people, had all the proſperity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable; but through great Riches and Victories obtained by their Predeceſſors, as the deſtruction of <hi>Corinth, Achaia, Antioch, France, Italy, Egypt</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> their Empire began to decline: for their Victories, Prey and Plunder, were the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their Manners and of their ancient Government and Diſcipline, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94417:81"/>
the occaſion and original of cruel War: for they which could not be brought down and ſubdued by force of Arms, were vanquiſhed and overcome by ſoftneſs and luxury, ſo that their Riches have taken vengeance on themſelves: and it has been with them as it is with Cloth which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth and engendreth Moths; and as it is with Corn, which breedeth worms that eat it; which the great King <hi>Solomon</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented in himſelf, when he had amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch great Treaſures, that his Riches ſurpaſſed the Glory of all other Kings of the Earth: and who hath made a full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of the delights which ariſe from the enjoyment of the goods of this world, and leaveth us his advice and judgment, as followeth: <hi>I made me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>great Works, I builded me Houſes, I planted me Gardens and Orchards, I ſet Trees of all ſorts of fruit; I made me Ciſterns of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the refreſhing the Foreſts of green Trees: I got me Men ſervants and Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants, great herds of Cattel, greater than any before me in</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>I amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed great quantity of Gold and Silver; I got me Men-ſingers, and Women-ſingers, and all the delights of the ſons of Men; I made my ſelf great, yea, greater than was any yet before me, I denied my ſelf nothing,</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:94417:82"/>
                  <hi>and had all which my heart deſired: and after all this, I began to contemplate all the works which my hands had made, and all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour which I had taken under the Sun: and I conſidered and ſaw all that I had made, and behold it was nothing but vanity and vexation of ſpirit, and that there is nothing laſting under the Sun.</hi> Let us hearken a little to the Prophet <hi>Baruch,</hi> whom we ſhall find to be a more ſharper reprover of thoſe who are ſo affectionately given over to their delights and pleaſures: <hi>Where,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are the Princes, and ſuch as rule and have dominion over the Beaſts on the Earth? they that have their paſtime with the Fowls of the air, and they that hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up Silver and Gold wherein men truſt, and made no end of ther gettings? are they not vaniſhed and gone down to the grave, and others come up in their ſteads? they have ſeen light and dwelt on the Earth, but the way of knowledg have they not known.</hi>

every day amongſt Chriſtians: for our age is come to that paſs, that if there could be one found amongſt us who had the beauty of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> the ſtrength of <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> the wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Agility of <hi>Azael,</hi> the Riches of <hi>Creſus,</hi> the Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Vigor and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Hector,</hi> the Eloquence of <hi>Homer,</hi> the Fortune of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> the Juſtice of <hi>Trajan,</hi> the zeal of <hi>Cicero:</hi> yet let him be certain of this, that the number of his Vertues ſhall not be greater than the number of thoſe who will envy him; and this curſed Vice ſeizes not only on them who are of a moderate Fortune, but thoſe who are of a higher Condition; for when they are on the top of the Wheel, and think themſelves in a peaceable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the favours of Kings and Princes: ſome one or other through Envy gives them a caſt down from their height and greatneſs. Wherefore the Sage Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Marc.

And for this cauſe the Ancients counſelled the Rich, that they ſhould not dwell near the Poor, and the Poor that they ſhould not dwell near the Rich; for from the Riches of the Rich ſprung the ſeed of the envy of the Poor.</hi>

                  <hi>ſeen ſome perſone anatomiz'd who died of this Diſtemper, having their entrails ſhriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſhrunk up, their Hearts burned, their Liver ſmoaked, their Lungs, roaſted, all the ventricles of their Brain damnified: their ſpirits exhauſted and dryed up by the exceſſive heat which they endured when the Feaver of Love had ſurprized them; and as the cure of this Malady is hard and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, ſo alſo is the original doubtful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them who have writ of it.</hi> The Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians ſay, That this fury of Love which rageth ſo vehemently, and which ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth the whole World, proceedeth from the correſpondent quality of the blood, and that the affection engendreth this Diſtemper. The Aſtrologers would be a party, and have alſo put their Sickle in the Harveſt of Lovers, ſaying, That Love proceedeth when two meet, having the ſame aſcendant, or when they conform in ſome Conſtellation: for then they are conſtrained to love each other. Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſay, <hi>That when we come to caſt our eyes on the thing which we deſire, ſuddenly the ſpirits which are engendred of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileſt and moſt perfect part of the Blood, part from the heart of the thing which we love, and ſuddenly aſcend and mount up to the Eyes, and afterwards burſt themſelves</hi>

                  <hi>into inviſible vapors, and ſo enter into our Eyes, which are diſpoſed to repreſent them juſt as a ſpot on a Looking-glaſs, which being looked on, from thence penetrateth even to the heart, and by little and little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth it ſelf every where: the miſerable Lover being drawn by theſe new ſpirits which deſire continually to joyn themſelves and approach to their principal and natural abode, and is conſtrained to grieve and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his loſt liherty.</hi> Others after a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand conceits and gueſſes, were fain to give over their Enquiries, as not being able to find out the ſource and original of ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Malady; ſaying, <hi>That Love was I know not what, and came I know not how: was enflamed after an unknown manner:</hi> A thing perhaps not untrue. For whoſoever ſhall conſider the geſtures, countenances, and behaviour of theſe poor paſſionate wretches, he will confeſs that he never ſaw a more ſtrange Metamorphoſis, nor a more ridiculous Spectacle. Sometimes you ſhall ſee them altogether melted into Tears, making the air ſound with their ſhreekings and lamentations, murmurings and imprecations. Sometimes you ſee them frozen, benumb'd, pale, deſpairing, ſliding up and down like-Larves and Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms. Other times, when they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94417:86"/>
ſome comfortable Speeches, good and favourable Looks, and kind recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from them whom they love; you ſhall ſee them gay, jocund and airy, in ſo much that you'l think they are changed into ſome other ſhape: Sometimes they love private and ſolitary places, that they may talk alone, reaſon, deſign and diſpute with themſelves. Sometimes you'l ſee them paſs five or ſix times in a day through the ſame ſtreet, to eſpy and watch that they may have a favourable look from them whom they Love: and the poor Varlets have their Skins broken with running, their Arms wearied and aking with ſerubbing, rubbing, dreſſing and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Maſter, and if there happens to them any ſparks of Jealouſie, then they mount up to the higheſt degree of fury, and are then in inexpreſſible peril and danger, there being no ſenſible part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them which is not ulcerated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming raſh, bold and venturſom; there being no Art, Invention or Machine which they produce not; becoming <hi>Lycanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,</hi> and running up and down in the Nights like howling Wolves: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Malady be of it ſelf fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical enough, yet according to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which it meets withal, it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94417:86"/>
ſtrange and wonderful effects: For if the Lover be poor, there ſhall be no office of Humanity which he employeth not, even to the ſacrificing and cutting himſelf in pieces, if need be: If he be Rich, <hi>His Purſe</hi> (as ſay the <hi>Greeks) is tied and faſtned by a hair;</hi> If he be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, he becometh immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal and open-handed, which moved <hi>Plautus</hi> to ſay, <hi>That Love muſt be the firſt Invention of the Wallet.</hi> If the Perſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected be a man of Letters, and has any meaſure of Spirit and Fancy, you ſhall then ſee him feigning a Sea of Tears, a Lake of Miſeries, redoubling his Cryes, accuſing the Heavens, anatomizing his Heart, freezing the Summer, burning the Winter, adoring, idolizing, admiring, feigning of Paradiſes, forging of Hells, making himſelf a <hi>Siſiphus, Tantalus, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius;</hi> and if it happen that he would extol that which he loves, then her Hair is nothing but fine Gold, her Eye-lids, Arches and Vaults of Ivory; her Eyes ſtars, her Looks Lightning, her Mouth Coral, her Teeth Eaſtern Pearls, her Breath Balm, Amber and Musk, her Throat Snow, her Breaſts Alabaſter; and generally, all the reſt of her Body is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the prodigality and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

of Heaven and of Nature, who had reſerved her as a choice Veſſel, wherein ſhe would pour in thoſe eminent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable perfections, for which he loves and adores her; and thus this cruel Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady of Love torments thoſe who are therewith affected: and yet nevertheleſs there is ſo many People, Nations and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces troubled with theſe furious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, that were there an Army to be raiſed of all the Lovers which are in the World, there's no Emperour, Monarch or Potentate whatſoever, but would trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the ſight of ſo many fools in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and this Peſtilent evil (by cuſtom and habit) hath gained and prevailed ſo far on mankind, that there cannot be found any Remedy, although that many <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Phyſicians have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all their moſt excellent Medicines to deliver them from their Martyrdom. <hi>Samocraſius, Cigidus</hi> and <hi>Ovid,</hi> have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten many great Tomes and Volumes of the remedy of Love, in which they ſhew Remedies for others; but the miſchief on it is, that they could not find any for themſelves, they all three dying, purſued and deſtroyed, not for the hurt or ill which they did at <hi>Rome,</hi> but for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which they invented at <hi>Capua.</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:94417:87"/>
The Emperour <hi>Marc. Aurelius,</hi> knowing that <hi>Fauſtina</hi> his wife was enamoured with a Fencer, and that ſo ardently, that ſhe was ready to die and pine away for the love of him, aſſembled together a great number of Learned men in all Faculties and Sciences for to adviſe with, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel him how he might put out that Fire wherewith his Wife was enflamed; but after many conſultations, ſome Empericks counſelled him, <hi>That he ſhould cauſe him on whom ſhe ſo much doted, to be killed, and the blood of him to be ſecretly given her to drink,</hi> which was ſpeedily execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This indeed was a great Remedy, for her affection was cooled; but yet was it not of ſo great efficacy (as writeth <hi>Capitolin</hi>) but that <hi>Anton.

But yet is all this but little in reſpect of what I have read in many Hiſtories: the matter coming to that paſs, that when this fooliſh Frenzy ſeizeth and taketh hold on our ſpirits, it maketh us brutiſh
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94417:88"/>
and ſenſleſs, as is evidently and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhown in a Youth of one of the richeſt Families in <hi>Athens,</hi> and well known by all the Inhabitants of that City; who having oftentimes contemplated an excellently well-made Statue of Marble, which was fixed in a publick place in <hi>Athens:</hi> He was ſo exceedingly taken with it, that he could not part from the ſight of it, as if it had been endued with Life and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and was ſo greatly affected, that when he was out of the ſight of it, he cryed and lamented with ſo great paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that 'twould have moved the moſt harden'd to pity; and in the end this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion gained ſo much upon him, that he was reduced to ſuch extremity, that he deſired the Senate to ſell it him at what prize they pleaſed, that he might carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with him, and have it at home, and all places wherever he went: Which they would not agree to, becauſe it was belonging to the Publick, and that their power extended not ſo far. At which being much troubled, He cauſed a Crown of Gold, with other rich and ſumptuous Ornaments to be made, and went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Statue, putting the Crown on its Head, and adorning it with rich Veſtments: and then began to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94417:88"/>
and adore it with ſuch obſtinacy and pertinaciouſneſs, that the Vulgar being ſcandalized with his fooliſh and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Amours, he was at laſt deterred by the Magiſtrates from coming near it. At vvhich he vvas ſo grievouſly caſt down and troubled, that at the end he killed himſelf. For the operations of this paſſion is ſo great, that ſince it hath made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the hearts of Men, it vvalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth incurable through all the vital and ſenſible parts of the Body: and being in full poſſeſſion of us, cauſeth an infinite of trouble and ſorrow, and that ſo ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it many times puts an end and period to our lives: vvhich the great Philoſopher <hi>A Pollonice Thiance</hi> confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> vvho vvith importunate Entreaties deſired him that he would tell him vvhich vvas the moſt cruel and painful of all Torments which could be invented by all the ſecrets of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, that therewith he might puniſh and chaſtiſe a young Gentleman vvhom he had found in Bed vvith a beautiful Damoſel whom he affected; <hi>The greateſt Torment,</hi> ſaith the Philoſopher, <hi>which can be invented for to puniſh him, is, To let let him live; For you ſhall ſee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That by little and little the vehement Fire</hi>

               <p>I have been ſomewhat tedious in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this Subject; but indeed the thing requires it, being the entire Corruption and ruin of the moſt part of the Youth of our Age: for when they have never ſo little wetted their feet in the delights of this World, it is the hardeſt thing in nature for them to retrieve themſelves; Youth, Liberty, and Riches, being the greateſt Pimps and Bawds in the World.</p>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94417:91"/>
ſome of Worms; and yet nevertheleſs man knoweth not the end; and when he thinketh himſelf permanent and laſting, he falleth and periſheth. What an affrightful Spectacle is it to behold a man on his bed of Sickneſs, preſſed with the agonies of Death? what trembling! what horror! what alteration and change in all the bands of Nature! the Feet become cold and benum'd, the Face waxeth pale, the Eyes hollow, the Lips and Mouth draw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inward, the Pulſe diminiſheth, the Tongue grows black, the Teeth ſhut, and preſs one againſt another, the Breath fails, and a cold ſweat appeareth over the whole Body; which is a certain ſign and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration that Nature is overcome and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: And when it comes to the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful departure of the Soul from its ancient Habitation, all the veſſels and ligaments of Nature are broken; then the Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Hoſt, as ſo many Vultures, ſurround the Sick-mans Bed; for there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention or ſubtilty which they practiſe not, to induce us to ſettle our thoughts and hopes on our good Living, on falſe Opinions, and deſtructive Preſumptions, or elſe ſetting before us ſuch an infinite number of our ſins and offences (with ſuch horrid aggravations), that the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and immediately the Trumpet ſhall ſound to call them to Judgment; then ſhall the People and Nations of the earth, howl and lament, <hi>and hide themſelves in the holes and caves of the earth, and ſhall call upon the mountains to fall down upon them, and cover them from the face of him that ſitteth on the Throne.

the diminution of a drop of it. And if it was a cruel ſpectacle to behold the Beaſts leave the earth (which is their proper Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment), following the anger of God, and entring into the <hi>Ark</hi> with <hi>Noah,</hi> and as it were imploring his aid and ſuccor; how much more dreadful will it be to them who have lived unjuſtly, to appear before the great and dreadful Judg? When the Books ſhall be opened, that is to ſay, the Sins and Enormities of our poor ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Conſcience, ſhall be at that time ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted and laid open to the ſight of Men, Angels, and Devils. If the Vail of the Temple was rent, if the Earth trembled, and the Sun was darkned and obſcured for the injury which was done to our Saviour on the Croſs, although he had in nothing offended; with what countenance can poor ſinners look, who have offended and blaſphemed ſo many times? If that the Viſion of an Angel is ſo terrible to us, that we cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, as teſtified St. <hi>John,</hi> who was not able to behold ſuch ſplendor and brightneſs, but fell to the earth for dead. And the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that they earneſtly deſired <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſpeak unto them himſelf, ſaying, <hi>We will hearken to thee when thou ſpeakeſt; but we</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:94417:94"/>
                  <hi>cannot bear this voice coming from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which cauſeth us even to give up the ghoſt</hi> (although that the Angel ſpake fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable): How will the poor ſinner then endure the Voice and Splendor of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God, being in his Throne of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? When he ſhall ſay, as ſpeaketh the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Now is the hour wherein I will avenge my ſelf on my enemies, and my anger ſhall be accompliſhed; and they ſhall know that I am the Lord, who have ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten admoniſhed, wooed, beſeeched and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them; for I will ſtand before them as a Bear, who is robbed of her whelps: I have been ſtill for a long time and kept ſilent, but now I will cry out as ſhe that is in labour, I will ſcatter, I will ſwallow up all together: I will reduce the Mountains to Deſerts: I will cauſe the Herbs to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Rivers and Floods to be dried up, and hinder the courſe of the Spring, and turn the darkneſs into light.

                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:94417:94"/>

               <p>How ſhall we be able to ſtand before him, whoſe countenance is as Lightning, and before whom there goeth a conſuming Fire? and yet ſtand we muſt, and give an account of all the various circumſtances and caſes of our Life; then we muſt come to a reckoning concerning the good we have received, and the good which we our ſelves have done; then 'tis that we muſt give an account of the improvement which we have made of all thoſe wholſom inſtructions, and Fatherly chaſtiſements wherewith we have been corrected; then will it be exacted of us how we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained thoſe good motions and ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Divine Spirit hath put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts; how we have withſtood the ſuggeſtions of Satan, and the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world, and our own carnal inclinations; then ſhall we be examined how we have employed all the faculties of our ſouls, and members of our bodies; then ſhall we give an account not only of all our wicked words and actions, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of our impure thoughts and filthy ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,

which ſhall all be laid open to the ſight of Men and Angels; then muſt we give an account of all filthy and naſty ſpeeches, prophane writings, and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury jeſts, nay of every idle word; ſo ſtrict a tryal ſhall we then be put upon.</p>

               <p>Then muſt we give an account of the employing of our Man-hood, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that has been grounded and ſetled in Piety and Devotion, or paſſed over in reſolved enjoyments of ſenſual and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Then alſo muſt we give an account of our demeanour in old Age, and whether or no, then drawing nearer the time of our departure out of this world, we have quietly and willingly reſigned up our ſouls into the hands of our God, as unto a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creator.</p>

               <p>So that then 'tis that every man muſt give an account of his behaviour in his particular Calling.</p>
               <p>'Tis the hour wherein the Mariner muſt give an account of the advantages which has been put into his hand, of his being extraordinary Religious, by going <hi>down into great waters, and ſeeing the wonders of the Lord in the deep.</hi>
