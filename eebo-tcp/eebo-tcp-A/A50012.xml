            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

unto Man, often debauching his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
abating his Courage, darkning his
Judgement, and making Virtue to be of no
value in his breaſt, when that before hand is
poſſeſt of the chair. If ſome Philoſophers
may be credited, it is the cauſe of all diſorders
in the world, and is no leſs the deſtruction of
whole Eſtates, then it is the Ruin of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Families. 'Tis ſhe has ſo often mingled
the poyſon with the drink, made Subjects Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
cauſed Soldiers to keep ſecret correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies
with their Enemies, and oblig'd chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to give death to thoſe from whom they

belyes its name, ſince it never affords us
true and real Pleaſures, but hurts us in its fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
makes Martyrs of its ſlaves, and indeed
beſtowes nothing leſs upon its votaries, then
what it makes them hope for.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould be aſhamed to defend the Opinion
of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> did I ſeriouſly think it was the
protector of ſo infamous a felicity, and that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42113:7"/>
the Original of all its good things had their
ſource from all our evil ones. But his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
to me ſeems too rational to approve of
ſuch extravagancies, and he hath ſentiments
too Noble to authorize in publique that which
the moſt impudent and ſhameleſs themſelves
condemn in ſecret. Thoſe, who will take the
pains accurately to conſider and weigh his
Writings and narrowly ſearch into his
thoughts, may obſerve that he had no other
intention, when he ſpake ſo to the advantage
of Pleaſure, then to make his wiſe man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
to looſe his body from griefs and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
to fill up his mind with delight, and to
render them both equally ſatisfied. Thoſe
who have thought otherwiſe, have ſcandalized
his innocence, and can find no other wayes to
pleaſe his diſciples, then in the publication of
their malice or their ignorance. For what
Stoick is there that does not deſire to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from cares and troubles? and what
Philoſopher thinks himſelf unhappy, becauſe
he enjoyes a perfect health, ſees his mind free
from ſorrowes, and diſtempers at a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
from all the parts of his body? what
favourable opinion ſoever we receive of the
merits of Virtue, yet would ſhe be but little
grateful to us, if alwayes ſhe appeared per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
and froward, only giving us an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of her miſeries, without ever ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42113:8"/>
the enjoyment of her, pleaſant and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable.
She ought to make a diſcovery of
her Charms, as well as Beauty, to oblige us
to be in love with her, and to promiſe us full
contentment and ſatisfaction, to ingage our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to an earneſt purſuance of her.</p>

Pleaſure, and look upon Vertue as the mean

who to ſecure himſelf from Poverty, paſſes
the Seas, deſpiſes dangers, finds out Lands
Incognito with the hazard both of his Safety
and his Life, and all to get him Riches, is no
longer affected with the pleaſure of them,
then whilſt he is heaping them up, and as the
profitable Gain does charm his Travels, ſo is
his delight of them loſt and gone, as ſoon as
they are lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

after the Treaſures he has not, and
diſregards what are in his own poſſeſſion,
and only thoſe good things which he hopes for
can give his Thoughts contentment. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Man is as much unhappy as him that is
Covetous; for when he is ſweating with the
pains he takes to get himſelf Honors, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the credit of his Friends hat ſo he may
come to be above them, and often taking on
him an undecent humility, that at laſt he may
arrive at ſome Eminency in the World, the
Glory only then appears delightful to him,
when he beholds it as the recompence of all
his Labors and Humiliations. But no ſooner
are his deſires accompliſh'd, and he has made
his Inferiors of his Equals, but he languiſhes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42113:14"/>
in the midſt of his Honors, he only regards
thoſe that are yet wanting to him, and being
puſh'd on by the inquietude of his deſires, he
does acknowledg no other happineſs, then that
which promiſes him the Dignity and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he earneſtly thirſts for. What is the joy
of a Philoſopher, when he is become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
of his Paſſions, and maſter of thoſe
ſlaves that would oppreſs his Liberty? he does
no violence to himſelf but ſuch as gives him
Pleaſure, all his pains are agreeable to him,
and he reckons all his Combats happy ones,
ſince they lead him unto Victory. But has he
excluded Vice from his breaſt, is the object of
his affection become that of his hate, and has
he ſubjected that which before did Tyrannize
over him? His vertue is forſaking him, his
pleaſures dwindle, and he muſt combat with
new Difficulties, if he would procure to
himſelf Delights.</p>
                  <p>This Principle granted, it is no hard task to
prove that honeſty and Profit are in affinity with
Pleaſure, and it is only ſhe that ingages us in
their purſuit. For the profitable good is not
diſireable only for its ſelf ſake, ſince that the
poſſeſſion of it is Sterile, and gives no ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to thoſe who are once made maſters of it.
It muſt be Pleaſure that moves them to it, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
it under a form that is agreeable, and
appearing beautiful as well as profitable, to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42113:14"/>
make one be in love with it. Eating, which
is ſo neceſſary to Man, is ever follow'd with
pleaſure, and I doubt whether we ſhould be
at the trouble of ſelf-preſervation if we were
not invited to it by the contentment, as well
as by the neceſſity. Riches, which are made
the Divinities of the world, and which moſt
Men idolize, would be in little eſteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, if they did not diſcover the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

and flatter them with an aſſured Felicity. For
they diſplay all that poſſibly can make them

rich Habits, Tables ſpread with all the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

Marriages, and a vaſt retinue of Servants,
who attend their Perſons, and obſerve their

their Affections, and makes them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Difficulty, conſecrate their cares and
diligence in the Acqueſt of thoſe goods which
promiſes them ſo many advantages.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the ſeeking of that good, we
call Honeſt, is more pure, it is not beholding

poſſeſs it, all Mankind has a Reverence for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42113:15"/>
it, and as it has the Wicked for its admires,
ſo all good Men too load it with their Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks.
Honor is its Appanage and portion,
all perſons that regard it, give it their praiſes,
and thoſe ſpectators muſt become enemies to
it, that can refuſe it this recompence. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
which is one part of it, does it not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
a bundance of delight and pleaſure in the
Learned? And can they mount up into the
Heavens, make a diſcovery of the Stars,
ſound Nature, and penetrate into the Abyſms
of the Earth, without a tranſport? As ſhe is
the light of our Underſtanding, ſhe with it
infuſes joy into our Souls, exalts us above our

and from Death to Life. None, but thoſe who

are not ſenſible of its Sweetneſs and

Good in its nature, they would find themſelves

that in effect which they blame in Appearance,

were baniſhed from his ſoul, and while theſe
lament the loſs of Battles, and afflict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the revolt of their ſubjects, and
groan under the weight of their Diadems, he
enjoy'd a ſweet Repoſe, and liv'd in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found

ſhun'd the Courts of Princes, it was becauſe
he knew the troubleſom cumber and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

it was becauſe he counted them as ſpecious
Servitudes; and if he preferr'd the caelibate
life to Marriage, it was becauſe the name of

look'd upon the ſociety of Women as ſuch,
who would always be commanding, though

enjoy'd a perfect freedom: his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries

her Glory from the ſincerity of her Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
has yet a paſſionate earneſtneſs for her,
it loves it in the object it reveres, its preſence
contributes to her happineſs, and ſhe never

                  <p>There is nothing more pure then the vertue
of the Ancients, who have expos'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to dangers, not valuing their lives, but
chooſing an inevitable death to preſerve their
Countries from thoſe miſchiefs which have
threatned them. It ſeems thoſe generous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
had no other Sentiments then thoſe of
Honor, they had only a regard to Vertue,
when they made themſelves Victims to her.
Notwithſtanding we may ſay that Pleaſure
was the life and ſoul of all their actions, they
ſtirr'd not but as ſhe did move them, and
though they ſought out miſeries, they were
not leſs the Slaves of Pleaſure. They ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that Poſterity would give them Elogies,
that their Children would become the peoples

their Statues would be Ornaments and Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations

in the celebration of their Names,
and all Pens imployed in relating their
Merits. Death, which is ſo terrible to the

Evil in compariſon of the honors they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to themſelves; and as they were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by the deſire of Glory, they only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
the Immortality that would crown their
actions.</p>
                  <p>Juſtice, which pleaſes it ſelf with Rigour,
and moſt of her time is taken up in the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

againſt his Son, and favors his Accuſers,
and becomes his perſecuter as well as his Judg,
making his natural affection give place to that
of his country, and condemns him to a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
death; one may well ſay he is enrag'd with
himſelf, he puniſhes himſelf in the perſon of
this Mallefactor, and he feels by Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thoſe torments that ſhould put an end to
his life. For who can imagine that a ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſo ſenſible, and touching, ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with contentment, and that any
Man who has a Love for his Children, can
become their Parricide with ſatisfaction.
Yet we may be aſſur'd that he receives joy from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42113:18"/>
it, that by taking away his Son's life, he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
himſelf famous in the World, that by this
Rigor he acquires to himſelf the title of Juſt,
that he has ridd himſelf of a perſon that would
have blemiſh'd his Reputation, and whoſe
crime would have been an eternal Blurr upon
his Family, had he not waſh'd it away in his
blood. As his Int'reſts are faſtned to thoſe of
the publick, and none can attacque his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
without intrenching upon his libertie;
he ſtudies its conſervation in that of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
he is ſatisfied that the one cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd,
but the other muſt lie grovelling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
its Ruines, and that all thoſe are his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who have a deſign at her overthrow.</p>
                  <p>What has been ſaid of Poverty, Force,
and Juſtice, might with much more eaſe be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the other Vertues, ſince they do
more agreeably inſinuate themſelves into our
breaſts, without oppoſing the inclinations of
Nature, to make themſelves Maſters of it.</p>
                  <p>There is but therefore one difficulty behind
to be remov'd upon this Subject, to clear up
<hi>Epicurus,</hi> and to juſtify him againſt the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of his Adverſaries. If that Pleaſure be
ſo link'd to Vertue, that ſhe and it are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable,
why does ſhe oppoſe it, and declare
her ſelf its Enemy wherever ſhe meets it?
Temperance keeps her in awe and ſubjection,
and will not ſuffer her to make any Sallies, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42113:19"/>
as if ſhe was the ſhame of Nature, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
all her eſcapes and extravagances.
Prudence blames the uſe of her, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
what diſorders ſhe cauſes in her Slaves,
obliges us to ſhun all her approaches. This
Objection ſtands in need but of a ſlight An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
in ſaying, that Vertue does not reject
all manner of Pleaſures, but if ſhe condemns
thoſe that are Infamous and Criminal, ſhe
permits on the other hand, all thoſe that are
Natural and innocent. She allows the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Man to take delight in his Sobriety, the
Judg, to be pleaſed in the equity of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
the Philoſopher, to extract his joy
from the conqueſt he gets over his Paſſions,
and the politique States-Man to hugg himſelf
in the happineſs that favours his Deſigns, when
he ſees his deſires accompliſh'd. Evil is not
always the object of our Hatred, and if it
afflicts us when we feel its firſt aſſault, we are
well pleas'd when we behold it flying away
from us, and Diſcomfitted.</p>

is that of the Mind; it is a Luſtre that
diſſipates its Darkneſs, a flame that clears it
up in all its deſigns, and which ſeperating the
Good from the Bad, creates in it, a Love for
the one, and Honor for the other. As ſhe is
active, and intereſſed in her good ſucceſs,
ſhe regulates all its motions, and will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to take reſolutions to its diſadvantage.
She preſcribes ſuch a comely Moderation to
its Sallies, that it ſets about nothing but by
the order of Reaſon, her judgment is depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
upon its advice, and diſcovering to it
the nature of ev'ry thing, puts it out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of chooſing doubtful good things, for
certain ones, and thoſe which are only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
for True and Real.</p>
                  <p>The vertues, that are the Daughters of the
Will, fetch all their light from this Sun, ſhe is
their perfection as well as guide, and as they
are animated by her light, they are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to all her commands. Thoſe, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
her conduct, do eaſily change from being
natural, and degenerate into Vitious, they
become the ſhame or the puniſhment of their
Slaves. Temperance ceaſes her Empire over
the Paſſions, when ſhe leaves off being ruled
by Prudence, her moderation is turn'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
and following the vain Fancies of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
ſhe lets her ſelf be carried out to
extremities that are very hurtful and prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.

Juſtice loſes its name, and takes that

ſhe may happily ſucceed in this purpoſe, ſhe
lets nothing eſcape her ſight, ſhe conſiders up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the differences of time, and comparing
the future with what is paſt, ſhe judges of the
event of affairs which ſhe has been meditating
on. Making uſe of the memory to learn the
conduct of our Anceſtors, correcting her

Faults by their Errors, and taking advantage
from their loſs and damage. Things preſent,
little touch her, for as they are eaſy to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
and there needs but a mean Capacity to
judg of them, ſhe troubles not her ſelf but
with futurities, ſhe thinks upon what may
happen, though the events may ſometimes
betray her deſigns, we can't condemn ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
her Conſultations or Fore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but ſhe dares undertake to defend them
though all the world condemn her of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
She is aſſur'd that her knowledg of
things can't prove deceitful, ſince they are
grounded upon ſo many Precautions, and ſhe
never undertakes any thing without having
the judgment for her Arbitrator, Reaſon for her
Miſtreſs, and the Memory for her Warrant.
The firſt diſcovers to her the nature of things,
ſeparating the falſe from what are true, and
ſerving her as a light, and guide, will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
her to be miſtaken in her Choiſe. Reaſon
inſtructs her in what ſhe ought to chooſe, and
paſting from diſcourſe to actions, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the general Maxims to particular Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.
The Memory makes her reflect on what
is paſt, ſhe preſents to her view all that has
any likeneſs to her enterprizes, and
conſulting the actions of Predeceſſors, ſhe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42113:22"/>
draws from thence her examples and copies.</p>
                  <p>But though all theſe particulars go to the
making up of Prudence, ſhe ſeems to have her
moſt abſolute dependance on the laſt, and is
more redeveable for her clear perſpection into
things to the faithfulneſs of the Memory, then
to the diſcernings of Judgment, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions
of Reaſon. For as the affairs of the
world are as it were chain'd and link'd one to
another, and the laſt ordinarily depending on
thoſe precedent to them, ſhe regards the things
that are paſt and gone, and comparing them
with theſe preſent, from thence gathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
advantages. Paſt Events are to her
inſtead of premiſſes, and ſhe grounds her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
on their Evidence; as our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
never make a judgment before they be
clear'd up and enlightned, ſo ſhe never makes
any Reſolutions, but what ſhe draws from
thoſe of former times. She conſults the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
and remarques the accidents that fall out
in them, ſhe examines the Counſels of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Soveraigns, and according to the
deſigns projected by her, approves or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
them. In ſhort, She runs through all
the differences of time, and appearing as an
Hieroglyphick of Eternity upon Earth, ſhe
regards paſt Ages, inſtructs her ſelf of the
preſent, and fore-ſees what will be the future.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>Epicurus</hi> having well known the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

inſtrument of Man's felicity, and would

Health's ſake it procures to us: That Art
which has inſtructed us to ſail upon the Seas,
is not commendable, but for its uſefulneſs to
us, and by giving an equal ſatisfaction to the
greedy deſires of covetous perſons, and to
the Ambition of Conquerors. So we eſteem
Prudence, adoring it as a Divinity, becauſe
it beſtows upon us abundance of Delight and
Pleaſure, and banniſhing from our breaſts
the ugly forms of Fear and Sadneſs, ſhe is
in a continual engagement about our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                  <p>THough our own Intereſts commonly make

our ſelves without tranſgreſſing the ordinances
of our Creator. This affection is born with
us, it grows up with our age, and never leaves
us till we come to our Graves. For as our
perfections do dazle us with their luſtre, we
are apt to look upon our ſelves as the little
Demy-gods of the Earth, we make every
thing ſerviceable to our conſervation, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

that they have ſome for us.</p>
                  <p>Prudence, which accounts it her glory to
regulate our life, acts always according to
this apprehenſion, ſhe conſults our inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
when ſhe would conduct us to ſome kind
of living, and examining our ability and our
deſires, ſhe invites us to undertake nothing
that may oppoſe or jusſle with them. She
would have us follow our Genius in all our
Enterprizes, and that Nature ſhould be as
well our guide as Reaſon. From thence it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42113:23"/>
happens that ſhe perſuades the Sturdy and
Couragious to Warlike exerciſes, and cauſes
thoſe Men of blood to find abundance of
pleaſure in Carnages and Murders. And thus
Husbandmen are in love with the toils and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

to paſs, that ſhe ſtirrs up the Ingenious to

Families.</head>
                  <p>IF Oeconomie be not the moſt Noble, ſhe is
the moſt Antient of Empires, Fathers of
Families were ſeen before Kings, and the firſt
who have ſet themſelves over the liberty of the
People, were but as Prentices to them. Their
Rules have ſerv'd them for Inſtructions, they
have got from theſe Sources wherewithal to
govern their States, and have learnt the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
in obſerving the Maxims of particulars.
If the conduct of Families has not ſo much of
Pomp in it as that of a Kingdom, it has not
leſs of Difficulty, and I queſtion which is the
eaſieſt, to command Subjects, or to keep a
Wife in her duty, and Children in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
The ill humor of the one, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagence
of the others, put a whole Houſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
diſorder, Correction and Chaſtiſement are
oftentimes little profitable to them, and the
fear that aſſures their Eſtates, almoſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
puts their Perſons into danger.</p>
                  <p>Therefore does Prudence boaſt of her aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42113:26"/>
us in our Neceſſities, becauſe ſhe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
us not raſhly to ingage our ſelves in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
but to conſider well beforehand the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of that perſon one deſigns for a Wife,
and rather to be affected with the perfections
of her Soul, then the charms of her Face. It
tells us that Beauty is but ſeldom innocent, that
Pride is inſeperable to it, that the Fair are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſcornful, and commonly deſpiſes the
company of their Husbands to entertain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with that of their Adorers. That the
Rich are imperious, that they love to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
but will never obey, that they muſt not
be contradicted in their will without making
them angry, and that we muſt reſolve to bear
with their Inſolence, if we would be quiet in
our houſe. To make our Marriage happy, ſhe
would have our conditions equal, our humors
of a pretty near reſemblance, our Love mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and ſhe does not aim ſo much to unite our
Bodies, as our Minds and Affections. When
Heaven ſmiles upon our Choice, and we find
all theſe qualifications in the Perſon of her we
Court, ſhe obliges us to conſider her as our
Spouſe, and not as our Friend only, to receive
her into our counſel, to make her ſhare in our
Secrets, and to conceal nothing from her that
may give her a ſuſpicion of our miſtruſt. Tis
to Sollicite her to abate her Kindneſs, to
doubt of her Diſcretion, and to reveal all that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42113:26"/>
is not committed to her Fidelity. Love ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers

by Vertue? Effects have ſtill relation to
their principles, and 'tis to miſtake the nature
of things, to make 'em depend on cauſes to
which they are oppoſite. Some Philoſophers
have had the ſame Sentiments of Temperance,
they can ſcarce comprehend that it produces
Pleaſure; ſince it is ſtill oppoſing of it, and
labors as much as can be to o'rthrow and ruin
it.</p>
                  <p>But yet theſe two Paradoxes are true, and
it will be ſufficient to give a Curſory Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, that their Evidence might be
the more clear and manifeſt. The wiſe Man
is ſenſible of Joy in the midſt of Torments,
becauſe he is wholly retired in his Soul, does
not at all communicate with his Body, and
places all his Glory and Felicity in his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
Temperance, gives birth to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
in her reſiſting of Pleaſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching
of Diſorders, and ſubmitting her
ſelf to the Laws of Reaſon. For, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
is nothing elſe but a Controuling
Power that She as Soveraign has over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcible
Appetite, which governs thoſe
paſſions that are moſt agreeable, and which
gives us ſatisfaction from their Moderation or
their Overthrow. She repreſſes the Deſires,
and ſuffers not thoſe Rovers to take their flights
out of our Selves. She reſtrains Hope, and
does not permit the ambitious ſeeking of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42113:32"/>
Goods, which are prejudicial or unprofitable
to us. She retains Love, preſcribes Laws to
that Tyrant, and qualifying its fury, ſhe
keeps it from raiſing up Tempeſts that might
be a trouble to our Repoſe. But her chief
work is to oppoſe Pleaſure, to ſuppreſs its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
Violence, and to hold the moſt dangerous
of our Paſſions to its Duty. She is a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of infamous Pleaſures, and knowing
they are Scandalous, and dare not produce

that Marriage authorizes his Liberty, ſince
that Intemperence may make him impudent,
he ought to love her, but not to be her Idolater;
it is fit his approaches be as reſpectful as they
are free, and that he purſues in his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,
the Rules of Moderation, and
not the motions of Luſt and Concupiſcence.
He runs the riſque of wounding his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

and of loſing the name of a Husband, and
taking up that of an Adulterer. Shame is ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Though theſe Reproaches are Shameful, he

Thoſe eat not but when they are oppreſs'd by
Hunger, nor do they drink, but when Heat
has caus'd a Drowth in their bodies; and all
Objects become indifferent to them, when
they ceaſe to provoke their deſires. But Man
is an unſatiable Monſter, he is never wearied
but perpetually Cramming, he is ſtill calling
for his Viands though he is but juſt before
ſated with them, and the Wine he is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſwilling himſelf with, does not ſo much

An Acre of Land is ſufficient to nouriſh many
Oxen, and thoſe Beaſts that are eating moſt

of a ſmall compaſs to ſuſtain their lives. One
Wood keeps many Elephants, and thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy

But nothing is capable to ſatisfy Man's Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry

Earth, forc'd its entrails to afford him Viands
and turn'd its Excrements into Nurture, he is
preſently for the Sea, penetrates into the
Abyſms of it, and ſpares nothing of all that
Nature has there hid, to ſatisfy and appeaſe
his inſatiable Gluttony.</p>
                  <p>Temperance, which Glories in attacquing
this Monſter, inſtructs us to reform theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
and not to extend our deſires beyond
things neceſſary. She would have Nature be
our Miſtriſs in the management of our lives,
not to ſet about any thing that ſhe diſapproves,
but let her Conduct be our Inſtruction, and as
ſhe rejects thoſe ſervices of Meats that are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
we ſhould be contented with her
Proviſion for us. She condemns Debauches,
for they deſtroy the Health, change the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and Conſtitution of the Body, and cauſe
diſorders in all its parts. Impudicity, is, a
thing annexed to this immoderate Feeding,
thoſe two Vices are never ſeperated, and it is
almoſt a Prodigy, to ſee a Man chaſte that is a
lover of Good-Cheer. Diſeaſes proceed from
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42113:35"/>
the inordinacy of Feeding, the crudities of
the Stomach, the pains of the Head, and the
dizzineſs of the Brain, would be unknown in
the world, if Feaſts and Banquets were not
the unhappy cauſes of them. On the contrary,
Sobriety ſmothers theſe Vices in the Cradle,
it prevents their diſorders, and is equally the
defence of Chaſtity, and the companion of
an honeſt and vertuous Life. It keeps the
Body in health, maintains a good Intelligence
between its Members, and according to its
humors, it makes its Paſſions become obedient
and orderly. Maladies have only reſpect to
thoſe that live not according to its Rules;
Grief and Pain is the partage of thoſe that are
Intemperate, and when Infirmities weaken
Man's Body, the <hi>Gout</hi> torturing his Nerves,
the <hi>Feaver</hi> filling his Veins with burning fire,
the <hi>Chollick</hi> tormenting his Bowels, we may
juſtly ſay, that he himſelf is the cauſe of all
theſe Evils, or that he does derive them from
his Anceſtors.</p>
                  <p>Wine is a gift from Heaven, as well as a
preſent from Earth; the Poets make it the
Parent of Pleaſure, the enemy of Sadneſs,
and an innocent Magician, that enlightning
their minds, ſerves them as a Guide to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Wonders of Nature. Its Heat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to the conſerving of our Health, its
Spirits animate and enliven our Bodies, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42113:35"/>
moderating the qualities of thoſe Elements of
which it is made, keeps its ſtrength with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and Pleaſure. But the immoderate uſe
of it o'rthrows all this Beautiful and Comely
Order, it deſtroys the Memory, and cauſes
this Guardianeſs of Sciences to loſe the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſita
which it was intruſted with. It darkens
the Judgment, perverts the Underſtanding,
and thoſe meſſengers which are ſo acquir'd

when they are Obfuſcated by thoſe Vapours.
The Blood that nouriſhes our Bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

Maladies to carry him to his Grave; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy
of his Viands is not more Pernicious to
him, and though it is the more to be excus'd,
tis not the leſs dangerous. Thoſe Diſhes dreſt
with ſo much Coſt and Sumptuouſneſs, decay
the natural heat, and ſpreading a malignant
fiery influence into all the Veins, conſume
that Radical Moiſture which is the principle of
Life. Who is ignorant that the weakneſs of

Breath are not the effects of Delicacies, which

Superfluities as do infect it? Health is the
daughter of Abſtinence, one ought to be
Sober, to be full of Strength and Vigour,
and he very unprofitably hopes to ſee the Heat
agree with the moiſture and coldneſs of his
Body, who is never but filling it with curious
and ſtudied Rarities. How happy was the
Age that knew no Cooks, but look'd upon
them as the Adulterers of Nature, as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

As his body is diſpos'd, that the functions of

                  <p>That which advances a ſober Man's Happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

It is true, this Perfection is not much relieved,

a Science that teaches us to beat back Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,

object of this Noble Habitude, and it cannot
be ſaid to ſubſiſt in nature, if it has not Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to combat with, and Difficulties to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.
Some have confounded Force with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42113:44"/>
they have thought that Courage was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
for Conquerors, and that one ought to be
conſtantly in Battles, and gaining Kingdoms, to
merit the name of Mighty and Victorious.
But Certainly they have but imperfectly
known the nature of Force; the moſt Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Actions are not always the moſt Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
An affliction is often more difficult to
get the maſter of, then an Enemy; and I

this difference, that the force of Beaſts is
true and real, and that of Men oft-times but

To what purpoſe ſerve the managing of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

how to turn tail with a good Grace, and to

as to fear them. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> have

Victory is not always the reward of

Troubles but to procure us Pleaſure.
For Evil is odious, it ſhocks our inclinations
inſtead of drawing them, and we ſhould never
reſolve to deſtroy it, if we did not promiſe to
our ſelves joy and ſatisfaction from the Defeat,
Death is the terribleſt of all evils, it makes a

breaks the moſt ſtrict and perfect Friendſhips
that ever were in the world, and taking upon it

the perfection of Vertues; and to poſſeſs it,

Chaſte and Penitent.</p>
                  <p>But as Religion and a Holy life is almoſt
continually miſerable, and Calamities ſeem to
be annexed to Vertue, its ſpectators have a
horror for it, thoſe who revere it, ſhun it
likewiſe, and judging of its worthineſs by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearances, they do ſuſpect it of Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy
or Superſtition. It is a hard thing to make
them believe that Man, whom Almighty God
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42113:50"/>
loves, ſhould be the object of his wrath, that
he ſhould perſecute an Innocent inſtead of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging
him, that he ſhould turn his love into
cruelty, and only heap up miſeries and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
upon him, whom he conſigns for
happineſs in Heaven.<note place="margin">Supera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundo gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio in omni tribulatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne noſtrâ. St <hi>Paul.</hi> 2 ad <hi>Cor.</hi> cap. 7.</note> But thoſe who are brought

that their repreſentation takes away their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that they have nothing leſs then
what they make the greateſt outward ſhew of.
The wiſe Man glories in his afflictions, and
terms thoſe favors which others poſſibly call
by diſgraceful Appellations. That holy pride
he diſcovers in his actions, and that Joy which
almoſt continually poſſeſſes his countenance,
is an evidence of the Tranquility of his mind;
Tempeſts do not diſturb his repoſe, and he
ſeems to be never more unſhaken, then when
moſt of all he is toſt up and down. All things
have their changes in Nature, and thoſe bodies
which are ſo neceſſary to the Conſervation of
others have their Viciſſitudes and their Periods.
The Earth does tremble under our feet, and
the Fire or Wind which moves its Bowels,
puts diviſions between its parts. The Sea is an

Beauty, we muſt acknowledg that it is not
without its blemiſhes and imperfections, and
that the Philoſophers were not altogether void
of Reaſon, when they many times preferr'd
even unhandſomneſs to its perfections. For not
to inſtance that it is a frail gift of nature,
which decays with time, deceives its admirers,
and is in the power of the leaſt Diſtemper to
do it outrage: beſides how it is fain to borrow
the greateſt part of its Charms from the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the beholders, that its Puiſſance is
malignant, that it makes impreſſion only upon
the purblind, and its poſſeſſion is not ſo much a
true, as it is an imaginary good. It perſecutes
the Subject whoſe glory her ſelf is, and as if
It had conjured his ruin, it troubles his repoſe,
robs him of the greateſt part of his life, and
fills him with thoughts only after infamous or
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42113:53"/>
criminal things. It is an Enemy that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
him wherever he goes, that torments

not ſuffer him to diſcern between truth and
falſe-hood, nor to diſtinguiſh the vice that flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
him, from the vertue he ought to aſpire
to. Alſo thoſe who are acquainted with its
vanity, with ſatisfaction ſuffers its loſs, and
no whit are troubled to be deprived of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
ſo prejudicial to their felicity. They
judg their body ought to be without attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſince it is the vileſt part of them, every
day tending towards Corruption, and that it
is but juſtice it ſhould be humbled, ſince it
was born to obey.</p>
                  <p>Reaſon is Man's only good, it is an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that he can diſpute with all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and he may eſteem himſelf happy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reaſonable. Beauty is a ſtranger to it,
that gives place to Flowers and Birds, and
we ſee even Inſects diſpute it with the moſt
charming and powerful Beauties on Earth. As
Homelineſs is a remedy againſt Love, it puts
out, and extinguiſhes Concupiſcence, and by
a wretched kind of happineſs, makes us often
diſeſteem thoſe perſons we cannot affect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing violence to our ſelves. The defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the body is not an enemy to the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the mind, the moſt precious things are
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42113:54"/>
ordinarily ſuch as are moſt hidden, and they
are moſt valuable from the obſcurity of the
places where they lye in. Pearls are ſhut up
in ſhells of Fiſhes, Chryſtal is buried in ſtones
and Rocks, Gold is lockt up in the barren
ground, and the Earth produces nothing that
is choiſe and curious, but what is embowelled
in Dirt and Filth. The mind is oft-times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
under a frightful deformity, and if
we will take Antiquity for our warrant, the
ſubtle Philoſophers have made their Wiſdom
ſhine forth through the caſements of moſt
dreadfully hideous and deformed Bodies. He,
who made the Beaſts to ſpeak, and who in
one little Volume has coutched up all humane
pollicy, was a Monſter in appearance, and
approached nearer the ſhape of a Bear then of
a Man, and if his Reaſon ſhould not have
broke forth at his tongue, he might have been
taken for the debauch of a diſorderly Father.</p>
                  <p>It does not depend upon us to be Handſom,
but it is in our power to be good; Honeſty is
fixt to our will, and whatever defects may
happen to our bodies, they cannot hinder us
from being vertuous. That perſon who does
aſpire to this glorious Title, can eaſily laugh
at the advantages of the body, and as he
knows that the mind is above that groſs and
heavy lump, he contemns its imperfections,
that he may ſeek his Soveraign. We have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held

the Laborers did not ripp up its Entrails

their neceſſities according to the Seaſons
of the year. Temperance was ſo natural to its
Inhabitants, that they took for favors what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Sun and the Rain gave unto them;
Their productions made them neglect the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the Field, and they thought it a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilement
to their Conſciences to embrue their
hands in the blood of Innocents. The waters
of the Fountains ſupplied their thirſt, and they
as yet were unacqainted with that liquor
which diſturbs our Intellects, and makes
thoſe who drink of it to exceſs, become ſtupid
or mad. All Men lived in a profound tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
fewds and contentions had not as yet
made a diviſion in their Families, and as
they were juſt in all their actions, they were
fearleſs of Judges or Magiſtrates. Love had
not yet corrupted their inclinations, they were
faithful to their Wives as well as Children,
and Adultery was as much abhorred by them,
as Inceſt and Homicide. Every one obſerving
the Laws of Nature was honeſt without Artifice,
and as they never made any unjuſt Vows, ſo
they were afraid of nothing to ſhock them.</p>

found out, to conſerve Right and Property to
every one, and to maintain Humane ſociety
among ſo many diviſions. So that Juſtice took
its Origine from our diſorders; and as firſt

to make Edicts for their repreſſion. For Juſtice
according to our Civil Lawyers, is a conſtant
and immutable Will of rendring to every one
what of Right does belong to him: Or to
ſpeak more clearly, it is an Idea in the Soul,
that preſcribes things juſt, and forbids thoſe
that are diſhoneſt. But as Self-love is the rule
of that which we have for our Neighbor,
this Virtue obliges us to begin at our ſelves, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man to be firſt equitable towards himſelf,
and not to commit any thing that may trouble
the repoſe of his Conſcience. It would have
reaſon to be our guide, and us to ſubmit our
paſſions to its conduct, and not to undertake
any thing it does not command or approve of.
It ingages us to bring down our Fleſh, to rebate
its inſolence, to ſubmit it to the Judgment,
and to keep it from ſuch exorbitances that are
diſadvantagious to it. It teaches us to make
our intereſt ſtoop to our duty, to prefer inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
to our Reputation, and more to be afraid
of our own Conſcience, then the preſence of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42113:58"/>
Judges and Soveraigns. It obliges us to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect
in what we chooſe, to make a good
uſe of our Judgments to preſcribe to us ſuch
objects as ought to imploy them, and not to
let them ſeduce us by their unfaithful relations.</p>
                  <p>But as Man is not only born for himſelf, but
Nature has allied him to his fellow creatures,
and he ought to live in Community with them;
Juſtice preſcribes him different duties, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliges
him to ſatisfy every one of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his condition. It ſhows him the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
he ought to have for his Superiors, the
love he ſhould bear towards his Equals, and
the Empire he ought to keep over thoſe that
are ſubject to him, the patience he ſhould exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
towards his Enemies, the charity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
he ought to render to the Poor and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.
From thence it came that a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
did confound Juſtice with the other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and that he imagined it ſufficient to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable
to become Prudent, Valiant, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.

between the Soul and its faculties, which guides
it in its operations, which ſubmits the ſenſitive
Appetite to Reaſon, and which ſhows to the
will, the good it ought to chooſe, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
it ought to avoid. 'Tis that which procures

Univerſe, which gives Laws to Monarchs,
which maintains love between God and Man,
and which obliges him to regard his Creatures
as his Children, and them to revere God as
their Soveraign. 'Tis that which continues
Peace in Cities, which keeps Husband and
Wife in perfect accord, which inſpires that
reſpect in Servants they owe unto their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,

                  <p>But that which ſtill advances the merit of
Juſtice, and which exalts its Majeſty, is that
it imitates <hi>Almighty God</hi> in its procedure,
that it admits of no diſtinction of Perſons, and
has as little conſideration for Relations as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

                  <p>THere is no neceſſity at all to have a notable
piercing and diſcerning judgment to find
out that Sin is the greateſt of all Evils, that
it perverts the Nature, changes the Man to
become beſtial, and makes of a Child of <hi>God,</hi>
the Slave of the Devil. Neither need we be
learned in <hi>Theology,</hi> to know that Malice is
prejudicial and bloody to the Soul, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
it to nothing, and brings death to a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that <hi>God</hi> hath made Immortal. Holineſs,
which is the form of it, quits it as ſoon as it
receives this Monſter, and makes a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
with Grace, to fall into the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of its enemy. Its empire would be
Eternal, if that <hi>Almighty God</hi> did not come
to our ſuccour, and furniſh us with weapons
to expell this Uſurper. Oft by an exceſs of
bounty, he adds his favors to our deliverance,
and renders us happy after he has redeemed us
from Servitude. For Repentance which abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes
our crimes, ſtifles our evil inclinations,
and reinſtates us into Grace and favor with
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42113:63"/>
our Maker, does contribute our felicity, and
obliges us to call our faults happy ones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it changes our Pride and Inſolence into
Modeſty, cauſes innocence to ſucceed our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
and equals our condition to that of the
greateſt things that ever have been upon the
face of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Scripture obſerves none more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
then St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, according
to its Language he was the greateſt and moſt
Holy of the Sons of Men, and though he
was conceived in Sin, we have this aſſurance
that he never bore the quality of a Criminal in
the world. He was a Virgin to the death, and
Impurity never made a breach upon his So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

He was a Martyr, and loſt his Head in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

paſt the greateſt part of his life in Deſarts.
In ſhort, He appear'd as an Angel upon earth,
and living amongſt Men, he entertain'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with thoſe in happineſs. Repentance
cauſes part of all theſe advantages unto Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
it changes their wantonneſs into conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
and teaches them to become Virgins
after they have loſt their C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them Martyrs, and cauſes them to feel the
pains and miſeries of thoſe generous Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who are dead for the cauſe of the Son of

them into Solitudes, and making them find a

retreat in their Hearts in the midſt of their
Cumbers and troubles in the world. It exalts
them to the quality of Angels, it teaches
them Purity, ſanctifies their diſpoſitions,
and gives them a foretaſt of the pleaſure of
happy Souls.</p>
                  <p>Though the Crime be always odious, and
it is not permitted us to commit a fault that ſo
we may reap advantage from it, yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Repentance gives a new birth to our former

all who came to him to inrich himſelf,
who was reckoned as a publick Robber, and
who even ſuck'd the blood of the poor by his
extortions, has deſerved the name of the firſt
of the Evangeliſts, his penitence acquired him
that honor, and he became as famous in merits,
as he had been execrable in his uſurious deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
The Church Univerſal is redevable to his
labors, his Writings are become her Oracles,
ſhe reveres all the words that are there record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and He, who was known for an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture

Repentance rend'red him in ſome meaſure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous,

Yet thoſe glorious Slaves had hankerings after
Liberty, and remembring the honors they had

This Hope was not utterly Temerarious, ſince
that <hi>Almighty God</hi> ſhows ſuch favor and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to the Penitent, that he always hearkens
to their Prayers, and does more uſually honor
the repenting then the innocent Perſon. When
the Evangeliſts exhort us to appeaſe divine
Juſtice by grief and ſorrow, and to puniſh
upon our bodies the ſin we have committed,
he does not put us in the middle between Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence
and the Kingdom of Heaven, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperably
unites this vertue to Glory, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42113:64"/>
ſeems to prefer the grace beſtow'd upon us
through our Affliction, to that which we have
conſerv'd by our Innocence.</p>
                  <p>But though Penitence ſhould not work this
Miracle, ſhould add nothing to our firſt Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
nor make us diſpute with the Saints the
qualities that render them famous in the
Church, yet ſhould we be oblig'd to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
that in remitting our ſins, it puts us in
a ſtate above Calumny; and has freed us
from the blame which conſequently would
have follow'd them. It makes us to hold up
our heads in the midſt of our enemies, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
us inſenſible of all their reproaches, and
does not ſuffer us to paſs for Criminals,
though we have been culpable. Indeed it is to
be unjuſt towards ones ſelf to revive a Crime
which we have waſh'd away with our tears, and
to refreſh our memories with what <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
has pas'd over with forgetfulneſs. 'Tis
to be ſeverely malitious to our ſelves to ripp up
a fault which divine Juſtice has aboliſhed and
cancell'd, and to give an infamous name to that
which has left off being in Nature.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing more dreadful then to fall
into the hands of the Son of <hi>God,</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſpeaks of Him, as of an inexorable Judg,
and as if it had a mind to inhance and amplify
the ſeverity of his decrees; it gives him all the
qualities that may render him Rigorous. It

calls him a living <hi>God</hi> when He puniſhes the

and that he was more ſet upon the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſing

works, it ſays he acts freely, that he is the
abſolute Maſter of his Creatures, that his
Power is above all their Laws, and that he
follows no other motions then thoſe of his

appeaſe the anger of <hi>God</hi> whom they
have provoked, that their ſins ſhall be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

white as Snow, and ſoft as Wool, and what
ought to tumble them down to Hell, ſhall

all things co-operate to the good of thoſe
that love <hi>God,</hi> their Malice ſhall be turned
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42113:65"/>
into Piety, their ſins which merited eternal
Puniſhments ſhall bring upon them as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Recompences, and Grace taking away
what was horrible in them, makes thereof
the occaſion of their Felicity and Glory.</p>
                  <p>There is no perſon but receives an extream
Joy and ſatisfaction when he finds himſelf
clear from Servitude, that his Tyrants
ceaſe to perſecute him, his vices are vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Innocence taking new poſſeſſion
in his heart. Who does not leap with joy
when he ſees his Safety ariſe from his Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?
his Miſeries to be the cauſe of his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs?
and that his crimes which rank him
in the number of thoſe to be reproved,
crown him in Heaven? Penitence ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
theſe wonders in the Church, and
animating Sinners againſt themſelves, it
gives them a bleſſedneſs in Heaven, after
it has made them Martyrs, and Anchorites,

to the Language of <hi>Logitians,</hi> it ceaſes
to ſubſiſt in the world as ſoon as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
in their Community. And yet does
Friendſhip every day overthrow this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
it unites the Souls of thoſe who are
in Love one with another, diſtance of places
does not hinder their approaches, and we
may affirm they are inſeperable though they
are at a great remoteneſs each from other.
Their number does not at all combat with
their unity,<note place="margin">In Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſame thing, though they be of different
Natures. Though their Riches do reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
their outward Man, yet have they no
aſſured Maſter, thoſe that ſhare in their
friendſhip, may pretend ſome kind of right
in them, and preſume to diſpoſe of that
which their affection has acquired to them.
Their goods and their evils are common,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42113:67"/>
what wounds the one grieves the other,
and their Wills are in ſo ſtrict a union,
that even one and the ſame thing does e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
both rejoyce and afflict them.</p>
                  <p>They are ignorant what Diſſimulation is,
their words are the interpreters of their
thoughts, their Heart makes its reſidence
upon their Tongue, and if they but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the minuteſt ſecrets to themſelves, they
believe that they betray that Vertue which
unites them. Some have (moſt unwiſely)
thought that Friendſhip was the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
of reaſonable and intelligent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that Darkneſs was preferrable to
its abſence, and that they ought rather to
deſire they might be deprived of the
light of the <hi>Sun,</hi> then to live and not be
Friends. The malice of an Enemy may
render them blind, Juſtice may banniſh
them into obſcure holes, and bury them
quick under Earth. But Miſeries can make
friends flock together, they ſupport and
ſtay themſelves in what place ſoever they find
them, the diverſity of their conditions does no
whit alter their Virtue, but they do cheriſh
them under misfortunes as well as in proſperity.</p>
                  <p>What is there can befal a Man more
to his heart's deſire, then to have a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to whom he may diſcover his thoughts?

who knows his Secrets are ſafe in his breaſt,

                  <p>Yet we meet with but a few of this ſort of
People in the World, and I dare affirm, it
is long ſince that true affection has been
banniſh'd from it, <hi>Oreſtes</hi> and <hi>Pylades</hi> are

imitates Prudence, Temerity takes upon it

borrows the attractions of Friendſhip,
it inſinuates it ſelf into the ſouls of thoſe
that harken to it, and renders it ſelf ſo much
the more agreable as the Venom that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes

know an enemy that carries himſelf towards
us with an obliging reſpectfulneſs, and who
makes it the greateſt part of his ſtudy to
pleaſe us. The Praiſes they give us are always
dear and charming to us, we eaſily ſwallow

the belief that we are Vertuous, that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
is born with us, and that Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is familiar and at home in us, and
that no perſon comes near us but is ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of our liberality, though we know their
words bely their thoughts, and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
reproaches us for our Injuſtice, our
Indiſcretion, and our Avarice.</p>
                  <p>Fatterers, who may very well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Impoſtors and Peſts of Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
have corrupted even the juſteſt Men,
and have in ſinuated into their hearts both
Inſolence and Preſumption. Princes, who
have hearkened to them, have oft-times
changed their Empire into Tyranny, and
ingaging themſelves in unprofitable Wars,
have hazarded their Perſons and their
States. They have broken the Peace that
was neceſſary to the conſervation of their
Subjects, they have attacqued enemies,
whom Policy has obliged them to reſpect,
and have yielded themſelves rather to be

without Conſtraint, he regards the
Advantage of him He loves, and not his
Pleaſure and Satisfaction; and he ſhould
think himſelf unworthy of that name he
bears, if he ſhould rather have a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation

he has been his Director: and receives
his Advertiſments with the ſame tranquillity

that Faith began to caſt its beams into their

World, Men lived in a Community, their
thoughts were no more divided then their
