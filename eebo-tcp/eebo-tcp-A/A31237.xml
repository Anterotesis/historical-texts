            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Wee had ſpoke much ſooner, had we not been ſilent through
conſternation to ſee you inflam'd (whom with reverence we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour)
and alſo to ſhew our ſubmiſſive patience, which uſed no
ſlights or tricks to divert the debates of Parliament: For no

as in all ages we ſee things of publick advantage by the managers
dexterity nipt in the bud, even in the verie Houſes themſelves.
Farr be it from Catholicks to perplex Parliaments, who have been
the Founders of ther Priviledges, and all Ancient Laws: Nay,
<hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelf had its riſe from us: Which we do the leſs
boaſt of, ſince it was not at firſt obtained in ſo ſubmiſs and humble

            <p>We ſung our <hi>Nunc Demittis,</hi> when we ſaw our Maſter in his

            <p>My Lords and Gentlemen, Had this been a new Sect not known

We will no longer trouble you with putting you in mind of any

               </hi> abjure the Pope to ſecure themſelves
of the fidelity of their Subject. We ſhall alwaies acknowledge
to the whole world, that there have been as many brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> in
this laſt Centurie, as in any other place whatſoever: Yet ſince
the excluſion of the Catholick Faith, there has been that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49090:2"/>
by thoſe, who would be faine called Proteſtants, that the
wickedeſt Papiſt at no time dreamt of. 'Twas never heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that an abſolute Queen was condemned by Subjects, and thoſe
ſtiled her Peers; or that a King was publiquely tried and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his own people and ſervants.</p>
            <p>My Lords and Gentlemen, We know who were the Authors
of this laſt abomination, and how generouſly you ſtrove againſt
the raging torrent; nor have we any other ends to remember
you of it, but to ſhow that all Religions may have a corrupted
ſpawn; and that God has been pleaſed to permit ſuch a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which our Progenitors never ſaw, to convince you perchance
(whom for ever may he proſper) that Popery is not the only
ſourſe of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>Little did we think (when your prayers and ours were offered
up to beg a Bleſſing on the Kings Affairs) ever to ſee that day, in which <hi>Carlos, G<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fford, Whitgrave,</hi> and the <hi>Pendreſs</hi> ſhould be puniſhed
by your deſires for that Religion, which obliged them to ſave
their forlorne Prince; and a ſtigmatized man (for his offences
againſt King and Church) a chief promoter of it. Nay leſs, did
we imagine, that by your Votes <hi>Hu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leſton</hi> might be hang'd, who
again ſecured our Soveraigne, and others free in their fat poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that ſate as Judges, and Sealed the Execution of that great
Prince of Happy Memory. We confeſs we are unfortunate, and
you juſt Judges, whom with our lives we will ever maintain to
be ſo; nor are we ignorant the neceſſity of affairs made both the
King and you do things, which formerly you could not ſo much
as fancy. Yet give us leave to ſay we are ſtill Loyal, nay to deſire
you to believe ſo, and to remember how ſynonimous (under
the late Rebellion) was the word Papiſt and Cavaleer; for there
was never no Papiſt that was not deemed a Cavaleer, nor no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valeer
that was not called a Papiſt, or at leaſt judged to be Popiſhly
affected.</p>
            <p>We know though we differ ſomething in Religion (the truth of
which let the laſt day judge) yet none can agree with your Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
or are fitter for your converſe then We; for as we have
as much birth amongſt us as <hi>England</hi> can boaſt of, ſo our breeding
leanes your way both in Court and Camp: And therefore, had
not our late ſufferings united us in that firm tye, yet our like
humours muſt needs have joyn'd our hearts. If we err, pitty our
condition, and remember what your great Anceſtors were; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49090:3"/>
make ſome difference between us (that have twice converted
<hi>England</hi> from Paganiſm) and thoſe other Sects that can challenge
nothing but intruſion for their impoſed Authority.</p>
            <p>But 'tis generally ſaid, That Papiſts cannot live without perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
all other Religions within their reach.</p>
            <p>We confeſs, where the name of Proteſtant is unknown, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Magiſtrates (believing it erroneous) do uſe all ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to keep it
out: Yet in thoſe Countries where liberty is given, they have far
more Privileges then we under any reform'd Government what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.
To be ſhort, we will only inſtance <hi>France</hi> for all, where
they have publick Churches, where they can make what Proſelytes
they pleaſe; and where 'tis not againſt Law to be in any charge
or imployment. Now <hi>Holland</hi> (which permits every thing)
gives us, 'tis true, our Lives and Eſtates, but takes away all truſt in
Rule, and leaves us alſo in danger of the Scout, whenſoever he
pleaſes to moleſt our Meetings.</p>
            <p>Becauſe we have named <hi>France,</hi> the Maſſacre will perchance be
urged againſt us. But the world muſt know that was a Cabinet
Plot, condemned as wicked by Catholick Writers there, and of
other Countries alſo. Beſides, it cannot be thought they were
murthered for being Proteſtants, ſince 'twas their powerful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
(let their faith have been what it would) that drew them
into tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ill mac<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inated deſtruction. May it not be as well ſaid in
the next Catholick Kings raign, that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and
Cardinal (Heads of the League) were kill'd for their Religion
alſo? Now no body is ignorant but 'twas their factious Authority,
which made that jealous Prince deſign their Deaths, though by
unwarrantable means. If it were for Doctrine that <hi>Hugonots</hi> ſuffer'd
in <hi>France,</hi> this haughty Monarch would ſoon deſtroy them now,
having neither Force nor Town to reſiſt his Might and Puiſſance.
They yet live free enough, being even Members of Parliament,
and may convert the Kings Brother too, if he thinks fit to be ſo.
Thus you ſee how well Proteſtants may live in a Popiſh Country,
under a Popiſh King: Nor was <hi>Cha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lemaine</hi> more Catholick then
this; for though he contends ſometimes with the Pope, 'tis not
of Faith, but about <hi>Gallicane</hi> Privileges, which perchance he may
very lawfully do. Judge then worthy Patriots who are the beſt
uſed, and conſider our hardſhip here in <hi>England,</hi> where 'tis not
only a Fine for hearing Maſs, but death to the Maſter for having a
Prieſt in his Houſe; and ſo far we are from Preſerment, that by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49090:3"/>
Law we cannot come within 10. miles of <hi>London.</hi> All which we
know your great mercy will never permit you to exact.</p>
            <p>It has been often urged that our Miſdemeanours in Queen
<hi>Elizabeths,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> his time was the cauſe of our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>We earneſtly wiſh that the Party had had more patience under
that Princeſs. But pray conſider (though we excuſe not their
faults) whither it was not a queſtion harder then that of <hi>York</hi> and

party underſtood the deſign, ſeeing there were not a ſcore of
guilty found, though all imaginable induſtry was uſed by the
Commons, Lords, and Privy Counſil too. But ſuppoſe <hi>(my Lords
and Gentlemen,</hi> which never can be granted) that all the Papiſts of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49090:4"/>
that age were conſenting; Will you be ſo ſevere then to ſtill pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the Children for the Fathers faults? nay, ſuch Children that
ſo unanimouſly joyn'd with you in that glorious quarrel, wherein
you and we underwent ſuch ſufferings, that needs we muſt have all
ſunk, had not our mutual love aſſiſted.</p>
            <p>What have we done, that we ſhould now deſerve your Anger?
Has the Indiſcretion of ſome few Incenſt you? 'Tis true, that is
the thing Objected.</p>
            <p>Do not you know an Enemy may eaſily miſtake a Maſs-Bell
for that which calls to Dinner; or a Sequeſtrator glad to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
being Conſtable? when 'twas the hatred to his perſon and
not preſent office, which perchance egg'd a raſh man to folly.
We dare with ſubmiſſion ſay, let a publick invitation be put up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any party whatſoever; nay, againſt the Reverend Biſhops
themſelves, &amp; ſome malicious informer or other will alledge that,
which may be far better to conceal. Yet all Mankind by a Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto
on the Houſe door are encouraged to accuſe us. Nor are they
upon Oath though your Enemies and ours take all for granted
and true.</p>
            <p>It cannot be imagined, where ther's ſo many men of heat and
youth (overjoy'd with the happy Reſtauration at their Prince,
and remembring the Inſolencies of the former Grandees,) that
they ſhould all, at all times prudently carry themſelves; for this
would be to be more then men: And truly we eſteem it as a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
bleſſing, that God has not ſuffer'd many, through vanity or
frailty to fall into greater faults, then are yet as we underſtand

            <p>We muſt a little complain, finding it by experience, that by

they rage, we are the more forſaken by you. Aſſured we
are, that our Converſation is affable, and our Houſes ſo many

we fear at no time, but it is the ſtranger we dread: (that taking
all on Hear-ſay,) zealouſly wounds, and then examines the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
when 'tis too late, or is perchance confirm'd by another, that
knows no more of us then he himſelf. 'Tis to you we muſt make
our applications, beſeeching you (as ſubjects tender of our King)
to intercede for us in the execution, and weigh the Dilemma,
which doubtleſs he is in, either to deny ſo good a Parliament their

hope for favour from you, as well as <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants find

ſequeſter none for their faith, but for tranſgreſſion againſt the
State; Nor is the whole party involved in the crime of a few, but
every man ſuffers for his own and proper fault. Do you then the
like, and he that offends let him die without mercy; And think
always (we beſeech you) of <hi>Cromwells'</hi> injuſtice, who for the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſome againſt his pretended Laws, drew thouſands into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimation,
(even ignorant of the thing) after they had vaſtly paid
for their ſecurity and quiet.</p>
            <p>We have no other ſtudy but the Glory of our Soveraign, and
juſt liberty of the Subjects; nor was it a mean argument of our
duty, when every Catholick Lord gave his voice for the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Biſhops; by which we could pretend no other advantage
but that 26. Votes (ſubſiſting wholly by the Crown) were added
to the defence of Kingſhip, and conſequently a check to all Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy

            <p>'Tis morally impoſſible that we who approve of Monarchy in
the Church, but muſt ever be fond of it in the State alſo. Yet
this is a misfortune, we now plainly feel, that the longer the late

            <p>How commonly is it ſaid, that the Oath of renouncing their
Religion is intended for theſe; which will needs bring this loſs
to the King and you, that either you will force all of our Faith
to lay down their Armes, (though by experience of great Integrity
and worth) or elſe, if ſome few you retain, they are ſuch whom
Neceſſity has made to ſwear againſt conſcience; and who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will certainly betray you, when a greater advantage ſhall be
offered. By this teſt then, you can have none but whom with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
you ought to ſhun, and thus muſt you drive away thoſe that
truly would ſerve you; for had they the leaſt thought of being
falſe, they would gladly take the advantage of gaine and pay, to
deceave you.</p>
            <p>We know your wiſdom and generolity, and therefore cannot
