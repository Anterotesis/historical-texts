            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>NOtwithſtanding the glorious Light broken forth among us in theſe later Times, yet we ſee groſs Darkneſs covering the face of the Earth; nay, and our Heavens are not ſo clear as we hope e're long to behold them: for tho <hi>the Light is come, yet the Glory of the Lord</hi> is but riſing <hi>upon us</hi>; ours is but the Morning of that long'd-for Day, and poor <hi>Sion</hi> is but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the Wilderneſs: hence are ſo many Diviſions amongſt us; we ſpeak as we ſee, and according to the Light received, and as we are bound by the Authority of Divine Precept to walk: God gradually diſcovers Himſelf, and the true Order and Form of his Houſe and Worſhip unto us: and tho we are ſtill labouring under many difficulties, having had much Rubbiſh to remove (like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they came out of the 70 years Captivity) and many have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to weaken our Hands, yet through infinite Grace we may ſay, the Foundation of
<pb facs="tcp:59587:3"/>
God's Houſe is laid: Tho ſome who would build cannot find the Wall, and ſome ſtrive to bring in a Stone of <hi>Babylon</hi> for a Corner, whilſt others endeavour to caſt away a principal Pillar, becauſe it has lain a long time corrupted and covered amongſt the Antichriſtian Rubbiſh. Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is a glorious work, and 'tis what we all long and breathe after. Mr. <hi>D.</hi> and others have been helpful to the Church of God with reſpect to Baptiſm, but for want of further Light have loſt their way: by which means I perceive many, in one reſpect much behind them, in another are got before them, and may (as far as I can judg) get into <hi>Canaan</hi> as ſoon as they. Impoſition of Hands is the Principle of our preſent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy; and it is to be lamented, that in this day we ſhould be forced to a Work of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Our Brother on this Conſideration was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded from doing what we now ſee publiſhed, and rather on this account than any other; and tho ſome judg'd it would do the Truth it ſelf much injury, by weakning the hearts or hands of thoſe eſtabliſhed in it, or enquiring after it, yet ſome judg'd it ſcarce deſerved an Anſwer: But others conſidering how well he wrote on the other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, thought it might the more likely tend to intangle the weak, and more unwary Chriſtian. Now as to my undertaking the Work, as I judged my ſelf uncapable in reſpect of others: ſo it was not my purpoſe to have been concerned, till put upon it by ſome in this City; and conſidering the backwardneſs of others, it the more induc'd me to it. And tho but abruptly done, yet ſuch as it is, I preſent it to the ſerious peruſal and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb facs="tcp:59587:3"/>
of all, whoſe Souls long after the good, full reſtoration, and perfection of <hi>Sion</hi>; hoping the God of Truth will cauſe it to entertainment in the hearts of the humble, tho I expect it will be ſlighted by ſuch as are paſſionately opinionated of their own attainments and perſwaſions, and who are below receiving inſtruction from their Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. It is the grief of ſome of you (as I believe) to ſee any whom you love and tender in the Lord, oppoſing ſo holy an Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt; but however, this you will find in peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of this Diſcourſe, that tho too many Baptized Chriſtians utterly diſallow and reject it, nay ſeem not deſirous to know the Mind of God herein, yet many godly Perſons both of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Perſwaſions (tho dark and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent about the buſineſs of Baptiſm) have longed, and ſearched after the knowledg and diſcovery of this Truth, nay have attained to a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and ſatisfaction herein, having laboured after a perfect reſtoration of it to its primitive uſe and purity, refining it from the Corruptions and Mutations of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church, not only in reſpect of thoſe abominable additions and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Chriſm, and other ridiculous Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in its adminiſtration, but alſo of the Subject to whom of right it belongs, as abundantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in a Treatiſe of Mr. <hi>Jonathan Hanmar</hi>'s, writ 1658. when 'tis apparent their Spirits were very hot upon it. I find Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> (writing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtolary wiſe in commendation of the ſaid Book) ſpeaking thus: <hi>I conceive</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Learned Author of theſe elaborate Exercitations has deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved well of the Churches, by clearing the way of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:59587:4"/>
admiſſions from Scripture-grounds, and the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Teſtimony of many, both Antient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Writers; alſo by diſcovering and removing thoſe Popiſh Additions and Pollutions, which by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſteps have crept into it.</hi> And further he ſays, that <hi>this ingenious and pious Overture holds forth more,</hi> than moſt Churches have hitherto at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>Alſo Mr. <hi>Vennings</hi>'s honeſt and judicious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions (in his Epiſtle to the ſame Treatiſe) I can't well omit; who ſpeaking of Reformation and Godlineſs, ſaith, <hi>Either by reaſon of our dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſightedneſs, being not able to ſee afar off, nor pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the depth and bottom of them, or by reaſon of the abuſive Traditions, and corrupt Gloſſes with which for many Ages they have been clouded and over-caſt, many Truths ſeem not ſo clear, but they need further clearing; among others, ſuch as relate to Church-Diſcipline and Order, have long been under debate, and not without ſome conſiderable advantage, tho I humbly conceive we have not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far as to be already perfect. It remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we preſs forward, and not be ſo paſſionately fond of our prepoſſeſt Conceptions, as not to have the patience to conſider what may be offered to us, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by ſuch as wiſh well to</hi> Sion, <hi>and deſire to ſee the Goſpel-Temple in its Beauty. If any Perſons are ſpirited to ſearch after further knowledg in theſe Affairs, to dig for it as for hid Treaſures, and when they have found a Vein of Golden Ore, to refine and ſtamp it for us, we ſhould be in readineſs to receive the Truth in the love of it, and pay the tribute and homage of Obedience for the ſake of the God of Truth, whoſe Image and Superſcription it bears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59587:4"/>
               <hi>What great and profitable Pains my much honoured Friend, the Reverend Author of the enſuing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitation, has taken in this one Particular preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to conſideration, and with what Curiouſneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Curioſity, with what Learning without Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>you will beſt perceive by the peruſal of it; and tho my Opinion be of little ſignification, yet I cannot forbear to ſay, that as to the ſubſtance and main of the deſign I judg it of ſo conſiderable impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that I ſee not how it can be neglected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very great prejudice to Church-Communion, to ſay no more. Haply ſome may be ſo nice as to be offended with the Name, and diſlike Confirmation for fear of Biſhoping, as if that old-faſhioned Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had but a piece of new-nam'd Cloth put to it, and dreſt up in another Mode: if it were ſo, can no good come out of</hi> Nazareth? Bonus odor veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis ex re qualibet: <hi>but if any are under ſuch a fear, I think I may aſſure them they are more afraid than hurt, yea afraid where no fear is, as they will quickly find if they pleaſe to come and ſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could wiſh our diſſenting Brethren would weigh the matter more ſeriouſly and moderately; and ſince there has been by many of different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions ſo diligent a ſcrutiny made <hi>ad veritatem inveſt<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gandam,</hi> and ſuch holy longings after the mind of God herein, the reſult was hop'd to have been, a ſingular Agreement in the thing it ſelf. But it may ſeem ſtrange, I confeſs, to all diſcerning Chriſtians, that ſuch ſhould not be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover or find out the Antichriſtian pollutions and mutations in Baptiſm, in reſpect of the Subject and Manner of Baptizing; which is ſo apparently contrary to the Goſpel-rule and pattern alſo.
<pb facs="tcp:59587:5"/>
O that the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would open the eyes of ſome eminent ones amongſt them, to ſee the pure chryſtal Stream of this Inſtitution of Chriſt, or help them (to uſe Mr. <hi>Vennings</hi>'s phraſe) to <hi>find the Vein of this Golden Ore,</hi> ſince they will not receive it as refin'd and ready-ſtampt for them by ſuch, whoſe Skill or Faithfulneſs they ſeem to ſuſpect.</p>
            <p>But, 1. How can they be perfect in Church-conſtitution and Order; whilſt they miſs the mark in ſo conſiderable an Ordinance as Baptiſm, taking a Stone of <hi>Babylon</hi> for a Foundation, and that for Baptiſm which is none? For it has been ſo groſly abuſed, (as a learned Writer noted in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe) that there is nothing remaining of it amongſt them ſave the meer Name.</p>
            <p>And, 2. May it not be admired to ſee Men of ſuch Light and Conſcience be only pleaſed with the Theory and notional part of an Ordinance of Chriſt? They ſee it to be a Goſpel-Inſtitution, but I could never yet underſtand they are in the practice thereof; <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But how contrary to the Rule and glorious Doctrine of the Lord Jeſus would they act, ſhould they get into the practice thereof, whilſt they ſo grievouſly err in the adminiſtration of Baptiſm, ſince that alſo wholly belongs to adult perſons, as muſt be own'd if the Scriptures be a perfect and ſufficient Rule for us to walk by, and expreſs whatever is neceſſary to know concerning this as well as things of the like nature?</p>
            <p>But probably ſome may object, Since moſt of the Authors mentioned in this Diſcourſe for the further evincing the Truth contended for, are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb facs="tcp:59587:5"/>
either in Baptiſm or laying on of hands, or both, to what purpoſe are they produced?</p>
            <p>In anſwer to which I muſt ſay, that what's of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on the account of Authors and Antiquity, has been occaſionally done, Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> having led us in that path. Nay, I might ſay, we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated thereto by his means, unleſs we ſhould leave one chief part of his Book unanſwered, in regard he utterly denies the thing it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> Laying on of hands upon baptized Believers, as ſuch, affirming there is no mention made of any ſuch thing or practice in the Scripture: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in ſaying the Antient Fathers and aſſerters of it flew mainly to Tradition, and the uſage of the Church in the caſe. Should an Adverſary ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny Water-baptiſm, however adminiſtred, and ſay it was never commanded by Chriſt, but is a meer human Invention, or Innovation of Man; yea and affirm that all the Fathers and Confeſſors, that heretofore pleaded for it, wholly made uſe of Tradition, and uſage of the Church in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof: Would not any that is for Baptiſm judg it neceſſary, not only to prove it inſtituted by the Lord Jeſus, and practiſed by the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians, but alſo, in oppoſition to his Opponent, that thoſe Writers both of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and later times who contended for it, did fly to the Scripture for its proof and confirmation, tho ſome of them could not do ſo as touching the Subject and Manner of Adminiſtration? Hence it is we have took the ſame method in the defence of an Ordinance of the ſame Nature and Authority.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear Brethren, I cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, that my Spirit has been much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed

to hear how the work of the Lord has been carried on of late amongſt ſome of you, and the readineſs of many to receive this deſpiſed Truth. I am perſwaded the more a Truth is oppoſed, the more it gets ground, and the Saints with others inquire after it: for ſince Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi>'s Book came forth, at one Meeting in <hi>London,</hi> on one day, upon my own knowledg, near 30 perſons came under the practice hereof: <hi>Vincet veritas,</hi> let Truth go on conquering, and to conquer; the Lord will ariſe and ſcatter all the clouds of Darkneſs and Oppoſition, and take away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach caſt upon his Servants for their Witneſs to his Truth, and Zeal for his Name. Let them be aſhamed who tranſgreſs without cauſe: if we are reproached, let us take it patiently, ſince it is for our precious Redeemer's ſake, who hath ſaid, <hi>You are my friends if you do whatſoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you</hi>; and in another Place, <hi>Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Commandments, and teach Men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of God,</hi> Mat. 5.11.</p>
            <p>Brethren, remember the Spirit of God pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them worthy of commendation who ſtand faſt, and keep the Ordinances as delivered to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. and the more we ſee evil Men and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers (as thoſe called <hi>Quakers</hi> and others) la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring on every ſide of us to tread under feet, and contemptuouſly deſpiſe all of them, let us ſtir up our ſelves with one heart in defence of them all; and as they are appointed as Conduit-pipes for conveyance of the Spirit and bleſſings of the Goſpel to our Souls, ſo let us walk as ſuch that experience the inward Life and Virtue of them, that thereby

we may beautify the Goſpel and Doctrine of God and our Saviour in all things, having Lamps and Oil alſo in our Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> the form of ſound Words, and power of Godlineſs in our Hearts and Lives. And now finally, Brethren, that I may not be further tedious unto you, my breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and deſires are, <hi>that the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Lights, the God of all Comfort and Conſolation,</hi> would fill you with the knowledg of his Will in all Wiſdom and ſpiritual Underſtanding, grant you more clear and heavenly Communion with himſelf, and with one another in the paths of Peace and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and enable you to walk inoffenſively in all well-pleaſing, being fruitful in every good work; and that the God of all Grace would eſtabliſh, ſtrengthen and ſettle you in his Truth and Ways, that ſo you may remain unmovable like a Rock in theſe evil and perilous times, wherein ſo many turn aſide, giving ear to Seducers, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors, and lying Spirits, with which our Days ſo abound, that it will be a choice Bleſſing to be kept from falling, and preſerv'd without blame till the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus, the great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the blood of the everlaſting Covenant,</hi> would ſanctify you throughout, and keep you from falling, and preſent you without ſpot before him, in the day of his glorious Appearance, ſhall be the conſtant and hearty Prayer of</p>

               <p>AS it is matter of grief and trouble to many ſober and pious Chriſtians, ſo it is no leſs of admiration to ſee ſuch eminent and worthy Perſons beclouded and darkned concerning one Ordinance, that are ſo clear in, and ſo much for the practice of another. How well have ſome of our Brethren written concerning Baptiſm? And how have they defended it againſt the ſtrongeſt oppoſition, as a glorious Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt? but yet how have they oppoſed this other ſacred Ordinance, or holy Oracle of God? <hi>Heb. 5.12.</hi> and Principle of the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

poſition of hands upon baptized Believers as ſuch? which they have ſome of them cried down as much as they have cried Baptiſm up, rendring it nothing ſave a meer human Innovation, or Antichriſtian Forgery; whereas nothing can be more clear, than that it is of the ſame nature and authority with Baptiſm, and ought equally to be contended for, being <hi>inter prima Rudimenta Fidei Chriſtianae, among the firſt Rudiments of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi> Dangerous it is to pull one ſtone out of the Foundation of the Houſe of God: the Lord open their eyes to ſee their weakneſs. However, what they have written concerning this Principle, is in this enſuing Treatiſe examined, weighed, and particularly anſwered.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Danvers</hi> in his <hi>Introduction</hi> tells us, pag. 3. after having given us an Account both from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> of the buſineſs of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, in its Inſtitution, Subject, Manner, and End, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it may neither be unneceſſary nor unprofitable to give us an account of <hi>Laying on of hands,</hi> not only becauſe it <hi>immediately follows that of Baptiſm, Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. but more eſpecially becauſe for <hi>Confirmation</hi> (as it has been called) it had been next after Baptiſm ſo ſolemnly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, practiſed and enjoined, both in former and later times, as an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of Chriſt, and eſſentially neceſſary to Church-Communion: But what this <hi>Laying on of hands</hi> is, and how that of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59587:8"/>
                  <hi>Confirmation</hi> is founded on the Word of God, he tells us, he ſhall conſider, examin, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the judgment of all diſcerning, and impartial Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> He hath in his Treatiſe of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> done well; <hi>Jehovah</hi> bleſs his Work and Pains therein. And is it ſo in very deed? Is the ground and reaſon why he undertook to write about <hi>Laying on of hands,</hi> becauſe it <hi>immediately follows Baptiſm, Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2? Did he find it ſo clearly there? and has that of Confirmation, as it is called, been ſo ſolemnly aſſerted in former and later times as an Ordinance of Chriſt, and neceſſary to Church-Communion? Methinks if this be ſo, he ſhould have been very careful how he ſpake or wrote againſt ſuch an Ordnance, which ſo immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows Baptiſm according to the Scripture; and more eſpecially conſidering what he ſays about Authors and Antiquity, concerning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, or laying on of hands, it having been ſo ſolemnly aſſerted, practiſed, and enjoined, as above ſaid.</p>
               <p>Tho for my part I judg it not worth my while to make ſuch a narrow ſearch into <hi>Authors, Canons, Decrees of General Councils,</hi> and the like, as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he and many may do: conſidering we have the Word of Chriſt ſo plain and clear in the caſe, what need we trouble our ſelves further, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied, as ſome of the Fathers have ſaid themſelves, that no <hi>Doctors,</hi> nor <hi>Councils</hi> are of any authority or credit without the <hi>Word of God?</hi> Yet finding ſo many of the Antients ſpeaking ſo clearly touching this <hi>Ordinance,</hi> tho under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name, it <hi>confirms</hi> me in my belief and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59587:9"/>
herein; and one would think it ſhould the more ſtumble them: for whatſoever credit, or eſteem ſome of thoſe Authors have whom he mentions, yet I judg he will grant <hi>ſeveral</hi> of them to be as famous as moſt who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſince the Apoſtles time, as hereafter may be hinted.</p>
               <p>In the next place he tells us, what <hi>method</hi> he will obſerve in writing his Treatiſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Give us an account what he finds of this <hi>Rite</hi> (as he is pleaſed to call it) in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> How aſſerted and practiſed by the Antients, with the Opinions of the Fathers, and Decrees of Councils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How practiſed and injoined by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> How by the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> How practiſed and injoined by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Baptized Churches in this Nation.</p>
               <p>Then he proceeds to ſhew, how <hi>Laying on of hands</hi> was us'd in the <hi>New Teſtament:</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> I readily grant what he ſays about the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Laying on of hands,</hi> and the uſe and end of them, but muſt needs except againſt what
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59587:9"/>
he ſpeaks concerning the third ſort: he affirms that Hands were laid upon Perſons for conferring the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit; and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions two Scriptures for proof,<hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note rend="inter">See God's Oracle, p. <hi>62, 63.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 9.17. and <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14, 15. in which affirmation he altogether begs the queſtion, and proves nothing, nor removes what has been ſaid to this very point. In this I muſt withſtand him, for he goes too faſt. I ſhould be glad could I be an Inſtrument in the hand of Chriſt to rectify their underſtanding herein who doubt about it; for they ſeem to be much miſtaken about that Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.17. but eſpecially that in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14, 15. I ſhall therefore offer ſomething in the firſt place to this; Doth not the Scripture ſay plainly in <hi>Acts</hi> 9.17. that <hi>Ananias put his hands upon Saul, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his ſight?</hi> why ſhould he ſay then, it was for the <hi>extraordinary Gifts</hi> of the Spirit? If that which is expreſt to be the effects of <hi>Ananias</hi> his putting his hands on <hi>Paul,</hi> was the only end of that Service, which is according to his own arguings upon <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.16. then it was only for his <hi>ſight</hi>; for it is ſaid he received his ſight, but not a word of his receiving the Holy Ghoſt, when he laid his hand upon him: that he was ſent to <hi>Saul,</hi> that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit, is granted; but whether by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands, or ſome other means, is yet to be proved: And this being an extraordinary caſe, and different from that in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14, 15. <hi>viz. Ananias</hi> his laying hands on <hi>Saul</hi> as a blind Man, that he might receive his ſight (which anſwers to that in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.18.) and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59587:10"/>
their hands on them in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14. as on bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Believers as ſuch, for their receiving the Holy Spirit, makes nothing to the Controverſy depending, tho Mr. <hi>D.</hi> hath put them together, as if the Subject, Manner, and End, were one and the ſame.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, to proceed to that Scripture <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14. where mention is made of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s laying their hands on baptized Believers in <hi>Samaria,</hi> which our Brethren affirm was alſo to confer the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit; but how much they are miſtaken herein, ſhall be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined: Since it appears not that the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did either ſend <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> upon that account, or that they laid their hands upon thoſe believing <hi>Samaritans</hi> to that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end, 'tis very ſtrange Mr. D. or others ſhould affirm any ſuch thing; therefore to prevent this miſtake, let us once again examine theſe Texts; <hi>Now when the Apoſtles, which were at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>heard that</hi> Samaria <hi>had received the Word of God, they ſent unto them</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>who when they were come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,</hi> ('tis not ſaid the <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gifts,</hi> but the Holy Spirit, thoſe you ſee are the expreſs words) <hi>for as yet</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>he was fallen upon none of them, only they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus: then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Verſ. 14, 25. I know 'tis <hi>objected</hi> from the following words, that the Spirit came upon them in ſome viſible or extraordinary manner, becauſe <hi>Simon</hi> ſaw, that thro' laying on of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles hands the Holy Spirit was given. This is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59587:10"/>
only a ſuppoſition: for who can tell what kind of Manifeſtations of the Spirit might appear in them, to convince <hi>Simon</hi> that they had the Holy Spirit? The Text doth not ſay, they either <hi>ſpake with Tongues,</hi> or wrought Miracles. But if for arguments ſake, we ſhould grant they receiv'd the Spirit in ſome extraordinary manner, as thoſe in <hi>Acts</hi> 19. it would not follow, that this was the abſolute end of this Service; for if we may reaſon as they and others have done after this manner, that what was the effects of their laying their hands upon them, was the end why they laid on their hands, and that End is by none attained in theſe days, therefore <hi>Laying on of hands</hi> is not prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable in theſe days; we ſhall ſhew you the ſad Conſequences and Abſurdities that would follow ſuch an Inference. To proceed, 'tis ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> 4.31. that when the Apoſtles had <hi>prayed,</hi> the place was ſhaken where they were aſſembled; Now mark, becauſe this Miracle was wrought as the <hi>effect</hi> of their praying, can it be thought that was the <hi>end</hi> of Prayer, or that we muſt not <hi>pray</hi> becauſe no ſuch effects are wrought now? And when <hi>Philip</hi> had <hi>baptized</hi> the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.39. 'tis ſaid the Spirit caught away <hi>Philip,</hi> that the <hi>Eunuch</hi> ſaw him no more: what a ſtrange thing was this that followed Baptiſm? But now becauſe this Miracle followed as the effect of that Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration then, ſhall we conclude it was the end of the Ordinance of Baptiſm? But again in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. while <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>preaching</hi> the Word to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and unto thoſe that were in his Houſe, 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard the Word, ſo that they ſpake with Tongues,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59587:11"/>
Now ſhall we ſay, the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, or Miracles, were the end of Preaching, becauſe ſuch kind of Effects followed preaching? Surely none will argue ſo, that underſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for if that was the End of preaching, becauſe it was the Effect that followed, and that Effect now never following, we may ſay as many do, Preaching is ceaſed, if he and others argue right: for ſuch and ſuch extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit followed (ſay they) when baptized Believers did come under laying on of hands in the Apoſtles days, and theſe Gifts are not given now; therefore that Ordinance is ceaſed, it being only for the Confirmation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
               <p>Now ſay I, by the ſame Argument, all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Chriſt may be denied, as well as lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands: As <hi>Firſt,</hi> Meeting and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling together; ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1. 'tis ſaid, <hi>They were all met together with one accord in one place, and ſuddenly there came a Sound from Heaven as of a ruſhing Wind, and it filled all the Houſe where they were ſitting.</hi> Verſ. 2. <hi>And there appeared unto them cloven Tongues like fire, and ſat upon each of them.</hi> Verſ. 3. <hi>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with Tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is no mention of any <hi>other</hi> Ordinance, ſave only aſſembling together, God graciouſly being pleaſed firſt to confirm the Time of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip under the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt Day of the Week, for ſo was the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition has handed it down: and mind what effects followed. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59587:11"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis not ſo now, ſhall we therefore aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble together no more? <note n="*" place="bottom">The Seekers uſe this Objection againſt all Ordinances, ſaying none are impowered to adminiſter any, becauſe not ſo indowed with Power from on High; and their Arguments fully agree with theirs herein againſt laying on of Hands. Of this let the rational judg.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the Apoſtles <hi>prayed,</hi> the Houſe was ſhaken, but 'tis not ſo now; doth Prayer therefore ceaſe to be a duty?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When Chriſt was <hi>baptized,</hi> there was a voice heard from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed</hi>; and the Spirit came down in likeneſs of a Dove. And when the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was baptized, the Spirit caught away <hi>Philip</hi>; but ſuch Effects follow not now when Perſons are baptized; <hi>ergo</hi> it's not the duty of any to be baptized now, if theirs be right Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Peter <hi>preached</hi> to the <hi>Jews, Acts</hi> 2. and at one Sermon <hi>three thouſand</hi> were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And he preached to <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10. and while he preached, the holy Spirit came upon them that heard the Word, <hi>that they ſpake with Tongues, and magnified God,</hi> But ſuch Effects as theſe follow not now when we preach; <hi>ergo</hi> no Man is authorized to preach now, by their arguing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When <hi>Paul laid his hands</hi> on thoſe baptized Believers, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. the holy Spirit came upon them, and <hi>they ſpake with Tongues,</hi> &amp;c. but theſe Effects follow not now when baptized Believers have hands laid upon them;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59587:12"/>
muſt we therefore lay hands no more? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we have no more reaſon to neglect or lay this aſide, than we have all the other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, conſidering the like Effects follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them reſpectively, as well as Laying on of hands: But <hi>contrariwiſe</hi> I muſt needs ſay, inſtead of being ſtumbled, or weakned in my Faith and Practice concerning laying on of hands, from the conſideration of thoſe extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit being the Effects that followed once or twice as expreſt in the Scripture, that I am thereby abundantly confirmed, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, and that becauſe I find <hi>every</hi> Goſpel-Ordinance and Inſtitution of Chriſt was in the primitive time more or leſs <hi>confirmed,</hi> according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. by <hi>Signs, Wonders, and divers Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own Will.</hi> And finding this Ordinance of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands,</hi> ſo viſibly owned by <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and wonderfully confirmed by the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, like as Aſſembling together, Prayer, Preaching, and Baptizing hath been; it is, I ſay, of an eſtabliſhing nature to me. And I ſee no ground to except againſt this Ordinance more than any of the other, notwithſtanding what ever hath been ſaid or written againſt it from hence. And becauſe I know it has ſtumbled many, that the end of laying on of hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.19. was for the extraordinary <hi>Gifts</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, I ſhall be the larger upon this particular, fully to remove and take off this Objection, which in part has already been done. But to proceed, I affirm again that the end of that laying on of Hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14, 15. and <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6. was not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59587:12"/>
for the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, and I argue thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe it was never propounded as the End of it, neither can it be prov'd it was. What can they inſtance in the Caſe, ſince what they mention of ſuch and ſuch Effects which followed, proves nothing in the leaſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It could not be for the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, or Miracles, becauſe not <hi>promiſed</hi> unto baptized Believers as ſuch, nor was it ever given but to ſome particular Perſons; only I grant, the Holy Spirit is promiſed to all, as he is the <hi>Comforter,</hi> according to <hi>John</hi> 14.16. <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments. And I will pray the Father, and he ſhall ſend you another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, even the Spirit of Truth, which ſhall abide with you for ever.</hi> All the Diſciples of Chriſt who believe, and are baptized, have the Spirit promiſed to them, as further might be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Then ſaid</hi> Peter, <hi>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt for the remiſſion of Sins, and ye ſhall receive the Gift of the Holy Spirit; for the Promiſe is to you, and to your Children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> The Spirit being ſo plainly promiſed to all that were obedient to Jeſus Chriſt, or the Called of God, the Apoſtles that were at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> hearing how God had called by his bleſſed Word and Spirit, the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> to Obedience, they well knew, and were aſſured that the Holy Spirit, the <hi>Comforter,</hi> was their Right, Promiſe and Privilege, as well as any other Goſpel-Believers; and therefore ſent them <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> that they might receive (through
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59587:13"/>
the uſe of that holy Ordinance) the Promiſe of the Father: and upon conſideration that the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi> were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or a mixt People, or ſuch as were not of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Fleſh, and ſome of the firſt of the Gentile Race that were called by the preaching of the Goſpel, <hi>Jehovah</hi> was pleaſed to give ſome viſible ſign and demonſtration of his receiving them into his Grace and Favour, to ſatisfy any of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſciples that might doubt concerning the <hi>extent</hi> of the Bleſſings of Chriſt and the Goſpel: for palpable it is that for ſome time after the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, few of the Apoſtles themſelves underſtood the glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and purpoſe of the Almighty, in bringing in the <hi>Gentiles, making them fellow-Heirs, and of the ſame Body,, and Partakers of his Promiſe in Chriſt, through the Goſpel,</hi> Eph. 3.6. This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be one reaſon, why God ſo <hi>viſibly</hi> own'd the Ordinance of Laying on of hands when ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, as well as for the Confirmation of the Ordinance it ſelf; and that Chriſt might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them he had made good his Promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 14.16. But if you will ſtill ſay, that the Reaſon, End, or Cauſe why <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did lay their hands on thoſe baptized Believers, was not for the Spirit, the Comforter, as ſo conſidered, but for the <hi>extraordinary</hi> Gifts thereof, I ſhall proceed to a third Reaſon; and thus I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Either <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> when they laid their hands on thoſe Believers, and prayed for the Spirit, prayed <hi>in Faith,</hi> or <hi>not in Faith</hi>: If in Faith, then they had (I preſume) ſome
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59587:13"/>
ground or <hi>Promiſe</hi> of God and Chriſt, to build their Faith upon, as to what they prayed for: But if it was for the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, as ſome affirm, where ſhall we find any ſuch <hi>Promiſe</hi> that they might ground their Faith upon? And is it not ſinful to <hi>pray</hi> for that which God has no where promiſed, conſidering what the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23? There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Promiſes, as hath been hinted, made by God of giving the Spirit, I grant, but not the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Gifts <note n="†" place="bottom">If any ſhould object againſt me <hi>Mark 16.17, 18.</hi> and ſay, miraculous Gifts are promiſed to ſuch as do believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, that by <hi>believing,</hi> cannot be meant the Grace of Faith in that place; for if it ſhould, we may ſay, no man doth now believe, or hath true Faith in Chriſt: it is therefore meant of the extraordinary Gift of Faith, or Faith of Miracles, according to <hi>1 Cor. 12.9.</hi> and <hi>13.2.</hi> He that ſo believes, nothing can be too hard for him.</note>. God promiſed, he would pour out his Spirit on his Servants and Hand-maids; and our Lord Jeſus in <hi>John</hi> 14.16. promiſed, the Comforter to all that love him, and keep his Commandments: And in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to all that repent, and are baptized; And doubtleſs it was by virtue of theſe Premiſſes, or Promiſes of the like nature, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> prayed, and laid their hands on thoſe Believers in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> on thoſe at <hi>Epheſus, Acts</hi> 19. or elſe ſhew us what Ground or Promiſe they had.</p>
               <p>If you ſay, the extraordinary Gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit were promiſed; then ſay I, they were promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Perſons of ſuch or ſuch a Name, or ſo or ſo qualified. Now ſurely none will ſay, to Perſons of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59587:14"/>
ſuch or ſuch a Name; therefore it muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Perſons ſo or ſo qualified, and thoſe Qualifications alſo muſt be known: if the Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations be not Repentance, Faith, and Baptiſm, then aſſign what they are: If you ſay, Faith and Repentance be the Qualifications; then ſay I, the Promiſe of the extraordinary Gift is made to every Chriſtian Man and Woman; yea and every ſincere Believer muſt receive thoſe Gifts, or God doth <hi>fail</hi> of his Promiſe: For I am ſure there is not one Soul that is a Believer indeed, having obeyed from the heart the form of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine taught and delivered to the Saints, but hath more or leſs received the Spirit of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promiſe or Promiſes made to them as Perſons ſo and ſo qualified or called, as hath already been minded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The end of that Laying on of hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. could not be for the extraordinary, Gifts of the Spirit, becauſe thoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gifts, or Miracles, <hi>ſerve not for them that believe, but for them that believe not.</hi> Now can any think, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were ſent by the Apoſtles from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to thoſe that had received the Word, and were baptized in <hi>Samaria,</hi> for the profit and benefit only of the Unbelievers there, that they, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as did not believe in <hi>Samaria,</hi> might by beholding the Miracles, or extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit given to them that did believe, be convinced that Jeſus was the Chriſt? Surely no Man can think, or imagine ſuch a thing, eſpecially conſidering the Text ſays plainly, <hi>They were ſent to them that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Word, and were baptized</hi>; ſent for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59587:14"/>
their particular Comfort, and further Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt Jeſus, that ſo they might ſtand compleat in the whole Will of God, and might be made Partakers of the Spirit of Promiſe made to every believing Soul baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. for as much as it was their right, and they ſtood in great need of it, as all poor Souls do who enter themſelves under Chriſt's Banner: For as our Lord Jeſus, after he was baptized, had the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit deſcending upon him, and was ſtraightway expoſed to temptation from the Devil; even ſo are all his Followers, when they take up the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpel, to expect to meet with ſore Trials, Temptations, and Afflictions, and therefore have need of more of the <hi>Spirit</hi> to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, encourage, ſupport, and comfort them, and to give them further aſſurance of the Love of God, that they may not flag, nor be diſheartned, but may be abundantly enabled to overcome all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Oppoſition, and remain faithful to the Lord Jeſus unto the death. To this end doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Apoſtles ſent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>; who when they came, pray'd and lay'd their hands upon thoſe Men and Women bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, even for the Holy Spirit of Promiſe, for their particular profit, comfort and benefit, and not for extraordinary Gifts or Miracles, which was ('tis plain from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4.) for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Goſpel to them that believe not, (according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22.) <hi>Wherefore Tongues are for a ſign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not; but propheſying ſerveth not for them that believe not, but them which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59587:15"/>
                  <hi>Fifthly</hi>; This being ſo, it could not be for the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles laid their hands on thoſe in <hi>Samaria,</hi> becauſe there was no <hi>need of further</hi> Miracles, foraſmuch as <hi>Philip</hi> had wrought ſuch mighty Miracles and Wonders in that City before, in ſo much that they were all convinced; yea the very <hi>Sorcerer</hi> himſelf <hi>believed, and continued with</hi> Philip, <hi>and wondred, beholding the Miracles and Signs which were done,</hi> Acts 8.13. Surely the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hearing of thoſe things, and how the People, yea the whole City, were convinced and ſatisfied that Jeſus was the Chriſt, would never have ſent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to do <hi>that work</hi> which was ſo effectually done before by <hi>Philip</hi>; and therefore I conclude, that that laying on of hands <hi>Acts</hi> 8. was not for Tongues, Miracles, or the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, as our Brethren affirm: and this being ſo, my work is near done already; for if they miſs in giving us a true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how Laying on of hands was uſed in the New Teſtament, they miſs in the main caſe of all; and if that Laying on of hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14, 15. and <hi>Acts</hi> 19. was not for the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, the greateſt Objection is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the chief ſtumbling-block taken out of the way of God's People: For if Prayer, and Laying on of hands was practiſed upon baptized Believers as ſuch, as a Principle of Chriſt's Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, for the promiſed Spirit, the Comforter as ſo conſidered, which is the abſolute Right, Portion, and Privilege of every believing Soul to the end of the World, then doubtleſs the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance muſt needs remain in full force and virtue
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59587:15"/>
as God's way, means, or method of conveyance of the ſaid Spirit to all his Choſen always, even until the end. But becauſe I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more to this anon, I forbear inlarging upon it here.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>MR. <hi>Danvers,</hi> Pag. 6. proceeds to ſhew how Laying on of hands has been aſſerted by the Antients, and by the Canons and Decrees of ſeveral Councils; <hi>Pag.</hi> 15. how by the Church of <hi>Rome; Pag.</hi> 17. how by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; Pag.</hi> 24. how aſſerted by ſome both of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Perſwaſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What earnings or advantage he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to himſelf by filling up ſo many Pages in his Book with Stories of this kind, I know not. Many (as I am informed, and ſome in my owm hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) do judg what he has done in this reſpect, makes more againſt himſelf than us; Nay ſome, who are for this Ordinance, ſeem to be much <hi>confirmed</hi> by what he has ſaid concerning Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in reſpect thereof, and look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as beholden to Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> for his pains in ſearching into Authors, and in producing ſo much, both from <hi>Antient</hi> and <hi>Modern</hi> Writers,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59587:16"/>
for Laying on of hands as immediately following Baptiſm, and as neceſſary to Church-Communion: And I muſt confeſs, I did not think ſo much could have been produced from Authors and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in the caſe, as I perceive there may, having through his means, according as I am capable, made ſome ſearch; Tho I muſt ſay, if there were ten times more to be urged on that account, had we not the Authority of God's Word to warrant our Practice, it would ſignify nothing: For we will ſay with <hi>Ignatius; Whoſoever ſpeaks more than is written, altho he faſt, altho he keep his Virginity, altho he work Miracles, altho he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, yet let him ſeem to thee a Wolf amongſt the Sheep:</hi> Epiſt. ad Hierom.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, I wonder Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſhould condemn, and wholly caſt away Laying on of hands upon baptized Believers, and have nothing to do with it, becauſe it had been <hi>corrupted</hi> by the falſe Church; the Subject, and Manner of Adminiſtration being quite altered, and changed; the Ordinance, or pure Inſtitution being turned into abominable Superſtition: may he not as well caſt away <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> alſo, ſince they have been every way as much corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, changed, and polluted as this? Nay, what Ordinance has not? Our work is to diſcover, and remove all Popiſh Additions and Pollutions, which in the days of darkneſs crept in, that ſo we may ſee <hi>every Inſtitution</hi> ſhining forth in its primitive purity and ſplendor; and not reject any Ordinance of Chriſt, becauſe polluted by Antichriſt. What tho (as he ſaid) thoſe <hi>Popes,</hi> Councils, and Fathers, that enjoined and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59587:16"/>
impoſed Infants Baptiſm for an Ordinance of Chriſt, enjoined that of Confirming In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> If it was as <hi>early</hi> corrupted, altered, and changed as Baptiſm, ought we not, ſince God has given us the Light of his Word and Spirit, to <hi>recover</hi> it from thoſe Corruptions as well as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm? Infants Baptiſm we all ſay, is a Popiſh Tradition, or humane Innovation; yet is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm Chriſt's Ordinance: ſo in like manner we ſay, is laying on of hands upon Infants, or ſuch as have only been baptized in Infancy, a meer Popiſh Rite, and Innovation: yet Laying on of hands upon baptized Believers as ſuch, is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Chriſt, as divers worthy Men have clearly proved from God's Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And tho the Antient Fathers and Councils he ſpeaks of, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> do wholly fly unto <hi>Tradition,</hi> to prove their practice of Laying on of hands upon Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; this will no more weaken our practice of Laying on of hands upon baptized Believers, than their flying to Tradition, and Uſage of the Church, to prove their Infants Baptiſm, weakens our practice of baptizing Believers.</p>
               <p>Moreover, thoſe of the falſe Church, who wholly make uſe of Tradition to prove their <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſm,</hi> might without doubt, had God been pleaſed to open their eyes, ſeen that Baptiſm was a Divine Inſtitution practiſed by the Apoſtles; even ſo might they alſo have eaſily ſeen, that that Laying on of hands practiſed by the Apoſtles next after Baptiſm, was Chriſt's holy Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; tho they could not find their ridiculous
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59587:17"/>
Rite, and Popiſh Ceremony of Confirming Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſo to be, there being not the leaſt Word of God for it.</p>
               <p>But from what our Opponents ſay of Authors, I obſerve, that in the Antichriſtian Church, ever ſince the Apoſtacy from the good old way of the Goſpel, there has been ſomewhat practiſed and kept up in the room and imitation of that Laying on of hands (inſtituted by Chriſt, and practiſed by the Apoſtles) upon baptized Believers as ſuch, and as neceſſary to Church-Communion, as well as they have kept up ſomething they call Baptiſm, in imitation of the true Baptiſm. And 'tis evident, that as the Romiſh Church has abominably corrupted the Ordinance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm as to the Subject and Manner of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and added many ridiculous, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Fopperies to it; even ſo they have done by Laying on of hands: <hi>The Silver is become droſs, and the Wine mixed with Water,</hi> Iſa. 1.22. <hi>He ſhall</hi> (ſaith <hi>Daniel</hi>) <hi>think to change Times and Laws</hi> (ſpeaking of the little Horn) <hi>and they ſhall be given into his hand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.25.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, do our Brethren utterly detect all thoſe impious Forgeries and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> uſed in Baptiſm, and contended for by thoſe Fathers, Councils, and corrupt Churches they ſpeak of, and ſo clearly witneſs againſt them, for changing the Subject, and Manner of Baptizing; and yet all the while hold for Baptiſm it ſelf, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully contend for it; yea and conclude too, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thoſe Abuſes, and Corruptions by the Antients, and in the falſe Church, Baptiſm all along was maintained? this I ſay, rather confirms
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59587:17"/>
and proves the thing it ſelf to be an Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt than otherwiſe (tho not as they perform and practiſe it) why cannot they do the like concerning that <hi>Rite</hi> of Popiſh Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation? We do detect and abominate all thoſe ſuperſtitious Ceremonies uſed by them, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt them for <hi>changing of the Subject, viz.</hi> from baptized <hi>Believers</hi> to ſprinkled <hi>Infants,</hi> or ſuch as were rantiſed in their Infancy; and yet contend for the thing it ſelf, as practiſed in the Apoſtles time: and little reaſon they have to blame us herein; ſince the work of Reformation, or to labour to reduce Ordinances to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Purity and Luſtre, is by all accounted a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Work; yea, and it is a full and compleat Reformation we all long for, not only for one Ordinance to be reſtored and refined from the droſs, and abominable filth of Popiſh Traditions, but every Appointment and Ordinance of Chriſt.</p>

of God; and as to Confirmation or Laying on of hands, as aſſerted and practiſed by ſome he ſpeaks of, I marvel not that they leave the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and fly to Tradition: For firſt, as to that which the Popiſh Church calls an Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, 'tis ſo blaſphemous and ridiculous (as he well obſerves) that the very naming of the particulars thereof may fully detect the folly and impiety of it; whether reſpecting the Name, which is called <hi>Chryſm, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, Perfection,</hi> &amp;c. or the Nature, which is done by putting the ſign of the Croſs, with the Biſhop's finger, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Confirmed, with theſe words: <hi>I ſign thee with the ſign of the Croſs, and with the Chryſm of Salvation, in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit</hi>; the Party being in a white Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his Head bound with Linen, his Hair cut, and attended with Goſſips, or Sureties; this is (ſaith Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi>) what ſeveral Popes and Councils have by their Canons and Decrees de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and enjoined as the great Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> pag. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Well might <hi>Hommius</hi> tell us, that it is not only contrary to the Scriptures, but Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and Idolatrous, and the vain Invention of ſuperſtitious Men. And well might <hi>Tilenus</hi> call it, an Excrement of Antichriſt: And <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſay, the reaſons given for the ſame by the Papiſts, are both empty, and vain; and Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> cry out againſt it, as is minded by Mr. <hi>Danvers.</hi> To which I might add a paſſage out of a Treatiſe of Mr. <hi>Hanmer,</hi> a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> who tho very clear as touching Laying on of hands upon Adult Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Baptized before they are admitted to the

               <p>ADmit we grant what Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſpeaks concerning <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> and the Decretal Epiſtles of the firſt Popes, to be impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lies and Forgeries, ſhall we therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they are all ſuborned Witneſſes. <hi>viz.</hi> the Antients who have written concerning Laying on of Hands? Surely many of the Fathers who have born witneſs thereunto, are generally received, and their Authority approved as the beſt of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Writers: What ſay you to <hi>Tertullian,</hi> ſhall we call him a Knight of the Poſt?

After Baptiſm the Hand is impoſed by Bleſſing, and calling and inviting of the Holy Spirit, who willingly deſcends from the Father on the Bodies that are cleanſed and bleſſed.</hi> Moreover he ſaith:<note rend="inter">Tertul. de Bapt. ad Quintil. cap. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the fleſhly, or outward act of Baptiſm, that we are dipt in water; the ſpiritual effects, that we are freed from our Sins: Then follows Laying on of hands, the Diſpenſer inviting

               </p>
               <p>Another Witneſs I ſhall call in, ſhall be <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> (not the Pope of that Name) but <hi>Euſebius Pamphilus,</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>Conſtantinus Magnus</hi> the Emperor, about three hundred Years after Chriſt; he certifies fully to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, (<hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 2.) that the <hi>antient manner</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Members into the Church, was with Prayer, and Laying on of hands.

               <p>Again, <hi>Euſebius</hi> declareth, (<hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 26.) That <hi>one</hi> Novatus <hi>being ſick was baptized, if it may be called a Baptiſm</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which he received, for he obtained not after his recovery that which he ſhould have done by the Canon of the Church, to wit Confirmation by the Hands of the Biſhop; which having not obtained, how can he be ſuppoſed to have received the Holy Spirit?</hi> This was about the Year 260. 'Tis alſo to be noted, that in neither of thoſe places, nor any where elſe in <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> is the leaſt mention made of Croſſing, or Chryſm, in the adminiſtration of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is cited by Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> himſelf; with <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and others, whoſe Authority is not queſtioned: To which I might add <hi>Chryſoſtom, Theodoret,</hi> &amp;c. Several others, yea many might be produced, beſides thoſe he calls ſuborned Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; and yet have we far better Authors and Witneſſes to defend this ſacred Truth; for we have the Authority of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 'tis left on record amongſt the firſt Principles of his Doctrine; we have the Teſtimony of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi>; and one not inferior to

them, <hi>viz.</hi> bleſſed St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (<hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. and 6. 1, 2.) as hath, and ſhall (God aſſiſting) be made further evident: And upon no better Authority, I muſt confeſs, is this ſacred Ordinance impoſed upon us.</p>
               <p>But now to ſpeak more directly to Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> what he inſiſts on in <hi>pag.</hi> 33. about the Rite of Confirmation, as practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and as corrupted from the pure Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we readily grant it is of no better Authority than Infants Baptiſm. And as touching what he ſpeaks of <hi>Rivet,</hi> (<hi>Controv. Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>Exercit.</hi> p. 44.) that it was neither inſtituted by Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles, 'tis ſpoken with reſpect of the Popiſh manner with <hi>Chryſm,</hi> and other ridiculous Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which was before done with Prayer and Impoſition of hands without <hi>Chryſm: They did,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter, make haſte to corrupt it; they quickly introduced the Croſſes, and Chryſm; but from the beginning it was not ſo.</hi> And as to what he ſays concerning <hi>Ambroſe, Jerom, Auguſtin,</hi> and ſome others, it is granted, they lived in thoſe times when the Church was adulterated, and the holy Appointments of Chriſt corrupted, and changed from their primitive purity; yet this makes no more againſt the holy Ordinance of Laying on of hands, than it doth againſt Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the Supper of our Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as I have already ſhewed. All that Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath ſaid hitherto of Tradition, and Fathers, makes only againſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and others who have drunk of the Whores Cup; thoſe things which they cry up for Apoſtolical Traditions, are nought elſe ſave meer human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59587:23"/>
and curſed Inventions of corrupt Men. I ſhall cloſe this with a paſſage of Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor,</hi> who treating about Laying on of hands upon bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Perſons as ſuch, ſaith, <hi>This was antient, and long before Popery entred into the World; and that this Rite has been more abuſed by Popery than by any thing.</hi> As to what Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> that the true ones were againſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands; if that be true, yet it muſt be underſtood of the Popiſh Confirmation, which they diſowned as a Sacrament, accompanied with Ceremonies; for ſo I find they expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Such a Confirmation, I grant, they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt, as being none of Chriſt's Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but introduced by the Devil's Inſtigation; 'twas the corruption of it, and not the thing it ſelf, doubtleſs they witneſs againſt: but that they owned not Laying on of hands at all after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, before admiſſion was granted to the Lord's Table, I judg too hard for any to make appear. But if they were ignorant of this Truth, 'tis no marvel, conſidering the Day they lived in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If it be objected, they with other Churches and People he mentions, were much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned into the Truths of the Goſpel.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Calvin,</hi> who gives this only as the chief thing intended by the Apoſtle in this place, from hence draws this remarkable Inference; wherein (ſaith Mr. <hi>Hanmer</hi>) he plainly declares his apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the Original and Antiquity of this practice in the Church of Chriſt: <hi>Hic unus locus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This one place</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>abundantly teſtifies that the-original of this Ceremony,</hi> viz. <hi>Confirmation, or Laying on of hands, flow'd from the Apoſtles, which yet afterwards was turned into a Superſtition; as the World almost always dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates from the best Inſtitutions into Corruption: Wherefore to this day this pure Inſtitution</hi> [mark] <hi>ought to be retained, but the Superſtition to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</hi> Why ſhould Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> preſume to ſay theſe Men confeſs the Scripture is but a probable ground, and that Tradition and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is the more certain?
And again <q>that there is nothing but a faint inſinuation from the Scripture to ground Laying on of hands upon? What Men can ſpeak more fully to a Text?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:59587:25"/>But to proceed, he adds <hi>Hyperus,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Impoſition of hands,</hi> Heb. 6.2. <hi>was in the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that had been baptized and rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.</hi> He urgeth ſeveral other Perſons of the ſame mind, as <hi>Illyricus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Deering,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To which I might add what Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi> late of <hi>Plymouth</hi> in his Ep. to Mr. <hi>Hanmer</hi>'s Book, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this account, ſpeaking of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. It is by ſome glorious Lights in the <hi>Church</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>underſtood of Confirmation, in that Phraſe of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, annexed to Baptiſm,</hi> Heb. 6. <hi>Whence it is ſaid, that this abundantly teſtifies that the Original of this Ceremony flowed from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I proceed, I might cite a paſſage full to the ſame purpoſe, as the Judgment of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aſſembly of Divines, which take as follows, out of their Annotations on Heb. 6.2. <hi>Laying on of hands,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is uſually called Confirmation; which ſtood firſt, in examining thoſe that had been baptized what progreſs they had made in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Secondly, In praying for them, that God would continue them in the Faith, and give them more Grace, ſtrengthning them by his Holy Spirit, they laid their hands upon them: whence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Conſtitution was called Laying on of Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, What Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks upon this account I can't well omit, <hi>Confirmat. p.</hi> 124, 125. <hi>If the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have uſed Prayer, and Laying on of hands, as a practice received from the Apoſtles, and no other beginning of it can be found; then we have no reaſon to think this Ceremony ceaſed, or to interpret the foreſaid
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59587:26"/>
Scripture contrary to this practice of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church. But the Antecedent is true,</hi> ergo. <hi>And if any ſay, Anointing and Croſſing were antient</hi>; I anſwer (ſaith he)</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That they were as antient in the Popiſh uſe as the matter of a Sacrament, or neceſſary Signs, is not true, nor proved, but frequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by our Writers againſt Popiſh Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Nor can it be proved, that they were as antient as indifferent things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>We prove the contrary, becauſe they were not in Scripture-times, there being no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>So that we bring Antiquity but to prove the continuance of a Scripture-practice, and ſo to clear the practice of it: But the Papiſts plead Fathers for that which the Scripture is a ſtranger unto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall cloſe this with Reverend Mr. <hi>Hooker: The antient Cuſtom of the Church</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Eccleſ. Polit. p.</hi> 351.) <hi>was, after they had baptized, to add thereto Impoſition of hands, with effectual Prayer for the illumination of God's moſt Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to confirm and perfect that which the Grace of the ſaid Spirit had already begun in Baptiſm: for the means to obtain the Graces which God doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, are our Prayers; and our Prayers to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent are available as well for others as for our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to paſs by this, I intreat the Reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that tho we have urged the Teſtimony of ſeveral Authors, who are one with us in the main concerning our Practice herein, yet we build not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59587:26"/>
upon Men or Tradition, but on the Word of God; neither do we ſuppoſe any neceſſity for us to take up new weapons to defend ſo plain a Truth, ſince our Adverſaries have been ſo ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently worſted and put to flight by the Sword of the Spirit, as uſed by ſeveral eminent Saints in times paſt. What we have mentioned of Authors, we have been in part forced to by what Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> and others have ſaid of them. And that leads me to what he ſpeaks, <hi>pag.</hi> 40. of the Scripture-grounds on which the Baptiſts have aſſerted this Rite (as he calls it) and founded this Practice of Laying on of hands upon baptized Believers, as neceſſary to Church-Communion, <hi>as before eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially held forth,</hi> Heb. 6.1, 2. <hi>tho not affirmed with that ſobriety and modeſty, as the other from Probability, but rather Infallibility, denying fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to any that do not receive it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>HOW thoſe learned Perſons he ſpeaks of have writ and aſſerted Laying on of hands from that Text, I ſhall leave to the judicious Reader, by conſidering the Inſtances forecited; and that they hold it alſo as neceſſary to Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, might I preſume be made manifeſt, but that is not our preſent work, but rather to make the thing it ſelf appear to be an Ordinance of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59587:27"/>
Jeſus Chriſt; and in order to this, thoſe two Particulars, or Principles Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> lays down we will conſider, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That to every Ordinance of Chriſt there muſt be ſome plain poſitive word of Inſtitution to confirm it; and not only human Tradition, or far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetcht Conſequences and Inferences, ſuch as the many Volumes written of Circumciſion, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Holineſs, to aſſert Infants Baptiſm to be an Ordinance of Chriſt, which no ordinary Capacity can reach, and only Men of Parts and Abilities can trace, and follow in their Meanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That to practiſe any thing in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God for an Ordinance of his, without an Inſtitution, is Will-worſhip and Superſtition,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The great Text urged for this Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſays, is <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Therefore leaving the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of Repentance from dead Works, and of Faith towards God, of the Doctrine of Baptiſms, Laying on of hands,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is the Text affirmed, ſaith he, to be the great Charter of the Church, for this point of Faith and Practice; but how to find the leaſt warrant for the ſame there, he ſays we ſee not: <hi>If it was indeed ſaid, let all baptized Believers have hands laid upon them, with as much plainneſs, as let all Believers be baptized,</hi> Mat. 28.29. Acts 10.43. or, <hi>let all baptized Believers eat the Lord's Supper,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.24. Acts 2.41. <hi>it was ſomething to the purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, we grant that to every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt there muſt be ſome word of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59587:27"/>
and that ſuch far-fetch Conſequence, as he minds, will not do, or be ſufficient: but that every Inſtitution muſt be laid down in ſuch <hi>plain poſitive Words, as he ſeems to affirm,</hi> viz. <hi>Let all baptized Believers have Hands laid upon them,</hi> I deny, it being none of our Principle I judg, nor theirs neither; ſince they practiſe ſuch things as Inſtitutions of Chriſt, which are no where in ſo many plain poſitive words command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as may hereafter be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>But as to the other thing he minds, we do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with him in that matter, and ſay, Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is done in the Worſhip and Service of God, without an Inſtitution, is Will-worſhip; and you ſhall ſee that our Principles agree and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with all thoſe honeſt Proteſtant Principles concerning what we have to ſay further about Laying on of hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to reply to what he ſays concerning <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. it matters not whether it be <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. or <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. or <hi>Acts</hi> 8.16, 17. or <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6. or any other Scripture, that is the chief Text urged to prove Laying on of hands an Ordinance and Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt; provided that the Scripture urged on this account, will prove it ſo to be. But whereas he ſays he finds not the leaſt warrant for the ſame, I ſomewhat marvel at it, conſidering what has been formerly written, and proved from that Text, by ſeveral worthy and able Men, whoſe Books he, nor none elſe have ever yet anſwered. But it ſeems he would have it ſaid in ſo many plain words, Let all baptized Believers have hands laid upon them, or elſe all is juſt nothing that is aſſerted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:59587:28"/>But is it in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. or <hi>Acts</hi> 10.48. ſaid in ſo many plain words, Let all Believers be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? 'tis not ſo read in my Bible. Nay, and I affirm, that from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. none can prove that all Believers ought to be baptized in Water, without making uſe of ſome Inference, or ſome other Text of Scripture to prove it, for as much as Water is not expreſt or mentioned there. Suppoſe a <hi>Quaker</hi> ſhould tell you, the Apoſtles had power given them to baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, and that Chriſt commanded them to baptize all thoſe that were taught, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, with the Spirit, and that it intends not Water in the leaſt; what would you ſay or do to refute him? Do you think you ſhould not need ſome Conſequence or other, or help from ſome other Scripture, to prove 'tis Water which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended there?</p>
               <p>But again, ſecondly; Is it ſaid in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. in ſo many plain words, Let all Believers eat the Lord's Supper, or in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42? The <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſts</hi> ſay, how can you prove by ſo many plain words, that Women received the Lord's Supper? I grant 'tis eaſy to prove they did, yet when they demand ſuch plain Texts for it, how do you anſwer them? is it not by Inferences? And I ſee not how ſuch Anſwers do in the leaſt betray the truth, or the juſtice of our Cauſe; as do not our Anſwers to ſuch Queries ſo uſually brought by thoſe that aſſert <hi>Pedobaptiſm</hi> confute us, as you are pleaſed to ſay <hi>p.</hi> 54. for we are not in the leaſt againſt drawing of Inferences, or natural Conſequences from the Scripture. And would not you allow any <hi>Pedobaptiſt</hi> to urge a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59587:28"/>
Text of Scripture, and infer what he will from it for his Practice, provided it may naturally be infer'd or drawn from the Premiſes or Text he brings? ſurely you, as well as we, will readily give him that liberty. But when Men ſhall mention Scriptures to prove their Principles or Practice by, and infer this or that from them, to the palpable wronging and wreſting of the Text, it being as far from the intent of the Spirit of God therein as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences and Inferences brought from Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and federal Holineſs, to prove Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; they are ſuch kind of Inferences we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt. But we need not trouble our ſelves with things of this nature, having the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo plain for our Practice, as <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. where it is called a Founda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion-Principle of the Doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To this he ſays in <hi>p.</hi> 42. by way of Conceſſion, <hi>That Laying on of hands is a Principle of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt.</hi> But then he ſays, <hi>It muſt be ſuch a Laying on of hands as is ſomewhere taught or practiſed; but ſuch a Laying on of hands upon all baptized Believers, we find no where taught or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed: Jeſus Chriſt had no hands laid upon him by</hi> John Baptiſt, <hi>after he baptized him; neither did he give one word of it in his Commiſſion upon his Aſcenſion; neither do we read that the Church of the Hebrews practiſed any ſuch thing; for there is no mention that the</hi> 120 <hi>had Hands laid on them, nor the</hi> 3000 <hi>in</hi> Acts 2. <hi>or</hi> 5000 <hi>in</hi> Acts 4. <hi>after their Baptiſm, before they broke Bread; neither do we find the leaſt of it in any other Churches in the New Teſtament; neither in</hi> Samaria <hi>by</hi> Philip, <hi>nor</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:59587:29"/>
Corinth, Philippi, Coloſſia, Theſſalonica, Rome, <hi>the Churches of</hi> Galatia, <hi>the Churches in</hi> Aſia, Smyrna, Thyatira, Pergamos, Sardis, Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, <hi>no nor in</hi> Epheſus, <hi>It is true</hi> Paul <hi>laid his hands upon twelve of their number upon another occaſion, as</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John <hi>did in</hi> Samaria, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He has ſaid here a great deal, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed us with as good Arguments as the <hi>Scots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> refuted <hi>Bellarmin</hi>: what is here more than meer Affirmations? he acknowledges there is a Laying on of hands which is called a Principle of Chriſt's Doctrine, but he ſays it muſt be ſuch a one as is ſomewhere taught and practiſed; but he is bold to ſay, this never was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Where is that Laying on of hands taught, which he affirms to be a Principle of Chriſt's Doctrine? Not that I queſtion it, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was taught, tho not as one of the firſt Oracles of God, or beginning Principles of Chriſt's Doctrine; yet where does he find Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands on Officers taught? let him not be too confident; for that Scripture, affirmed by him to be a full Precept for it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. is very doubtful <note n="*" rend="inter">Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> ſays 'tis that of Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> what Laying on of hands is mentioned there. Mr.<note n="†" rend="inter">Confirm. &amp; Reſtaurat. <hi>pag. 123.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Some think by it is meant Impoſition of hands in Confirmation, ſome in Ordination, and ſome for Abſolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let all Men here conſider his partiality; Is this a Precept in ſo many words, Lay hands on all Officers? whereas the word
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59587:29"/>
Officer, or Elder, is not mentioned in the Text, or Verſe, before nor after, nor elſewhere through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that fifth Chapter: we muſt therefore have recourſe to other Scriptures in the caſe of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, which are full Precedents for it, as <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. and 6.6. as we compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15, 17. and 19.6. for the clearing the Truth we contend for, comparing Scripture with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> The words are rather in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Caution or Prohibition than otherwiſe; will he call this a full Precept? the moſt he can aſſert from hence is this, that the words do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that <hi>Timothy</hi> was to lay hands on ſome body, otherwiſe no room for thoſe Expreſſions; but then what kind of Laying on of hands he intends is the queſtion; whether it be only one ſort, or more, from hence it may be hard to decide. May we not conclude <hi>Paul</hi>'s Counſel to <hi>Timothy</hi> thus far comprehenſive, <hi>viz.</hi> do not lay hands ſuddenly on any Man, neither to Office, let them firſt be proved, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10. nor upon Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons baptized as ſuch, they muſt firſt be taught, or inſtructed in the Truth they are about to practiſe; which may be gathered from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. they muſt be ſo taught, and the Truth ſo explained, that Perſons may obey the ſame in Faith, and with underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This muſt needs be granted on all hands, that without ſome Inference, or help of other Scripture, Laying on of hands for Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be proved from this Text, which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> will not admit us to do; we muſt have every Principle of Chriſt's Doctrine in ſo many
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59587:30"/>
plain words, and from Chriſt's own mouth too, or elſe 'tis no Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But may be, ſome will ſay, he urges other Scriptures to prove Laying on of hands on Officers, <hi>pag.</hi> 54. <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6. &amp; 13.3, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Granted, yet thoſe are only brought as Examples (for ſo indeed they are) and not Precepts; and there is none urged by him to prove it commanded, ſave that we have ſpoken to, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. and what can be produced ſave clear Precedents on that account, I know not.</p>
               <p>But now as to Impoſition of hands on baptized Believers as ſuch, we have not only clear Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but alſo the Scripture ſhews it was taught as a poſitive Command and Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, or what was commanded by him; which I ſhall fully ſhew from <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle writing of the ſix Principles, or Foundation-Doctrines of Chriſt, uſes the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the 1ſt Verſe, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the 2d Verſe, that is <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi>; ſo this of Laying on of Hands, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other Principles, the Apoſtle there, by the Spirit of God, calls the Word and Doctrine of Chriſt: now the Words of Chriſt, and Commands of Chriſt, are Terms ſynonymous, or of the like import; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.4. ſhews, where the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are called in the margin ten Words, as moſt ſuting with the Hebrew Text. Again, <hi>John</hi> 14.21. with 23. and 24. v. compared with verſ. 21. further evinces it; <hi>He that hath my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me:</hi> In Verſ. 23. <hi>If any Man love me, he will keep my Words</hi>; and in Verſe 24. called <hi>Sayings:</hi> and the Word is ſaid in <hi>John</hi> 7.16. to be the Father's,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59587:30"/>
and Chriſt's Word ſaid to be what he had from the Father. So now, Laying on of hands, as well as Repentance, Faith and Baptiſm, is the Word and Doctrine of Chriſt, and therefore equally to be obſerved and obeyed by all the Saints, being one of the Principles, or Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truths, which the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Church, at the Command and Word of Chriſt, came under the practice of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. and 6.1, 2. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over this Principle is, by the ſaid Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> called one of the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> which he tells them they had need again to be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in; plainly implying they had once been taught it, and were in the practice thereof. Now <hi>the Oracles of God</hi> are the Commands of God; ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 7.38. where the ten Commandments are called <hi>lively Oracles</hi>; compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> Methinks this might convince any diſſatisfied Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that Laying on of hands, as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Principles, was taught and commanded by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But yet again, conſider that what the Apoſtles wrote to the Churches as the Word of Chriſt, ought to be owned by all that are Spriritual, to be <hi>the Commands of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.37.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Why ſhould you make ſuch a ſtir about an expreſs Command? muſt it be plainly laid down, or expreſt in the Commiſſion, or elſe no Divine Inſtitution? Does not this make as much every way againſt Laying on of hands upon Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, as againſt that on baptized Believers as ſuch? We account that Man very malicious who reſolves to wound his Neighbour, tho himſelf be wounded thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have as plain Precedents for Laying on of hands on baptized Believers, as we have on Officers, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.16, 17. and <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6. yea and more than bare Examples for it: it is called a Principle of the Doctrine of Chriſt; but where that on Officers is call'd ſo I know not: for that the Laying on of hands in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. cannot intend that on Officers, has been clearly proved by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Arguments; and that it intends Laying on of hands on the Baptized for the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and to confirm them in the Faith newly received, is not only our light and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but has alſo been aſſerted to be the ſenſe of that Text by many Antient and Modern Divines of ſeveral Perſwaſions, as has been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But ſuch a Laying on of hands you contend for, was no where practiſed; <hi>John did not lay hands upon Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We will grant you, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did not lay hands on the Lord Jeſus; it cannot be rationally concluded he ſhould, conſidering the leſſer is bleſſed of the greater. Baptiſm might be adminiſtred by <hi>John,</hi> it being a figure of Chriſt's Death, Burial, and Reſurrection; but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Spirit, which is the end of the Ordinance
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59587:31"/>
of Laying on of hands, is ſaid to be Chriſt's own gift, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7. But tho <hi>John</hi> laid not his hands on Chriſt, being not a fit Adminiſtrator thereof, yet I may ſay, the Father laid his hands upon him, and the Spirit came down viſibly in the likeneſs of a Dove, and reſted on him juſt after he came out of the Water; and this might, as many of the Learned affirm, contain the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Adminiſtration contended for.</p>
               <p>Moreover, In this way Chriſt Jeſus was viſibly ſealed by God the Father after he was baptized: ſaith Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Confirm. p. 12. <hi>He had another, or new Adminiſtration paſt upon him for the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Spirit, and this was done for our ſakes; we alſo muſt follow that Example: and it plainly deſcribes to us the Order of this Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and the Bleſſing deſigned to us; after we are baptized we need to be ſtrengthned and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> And again he ſaith (citing a paſſage of <hi>Optatus</hi>) <hi>Chriſt was waſhed when he was in the hands of</hi> John, <hi>and the Father finiſhed what was wanting; the Heavens were opened, God the Father anointed him, the Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently deſcended in the likeneſs of a Dove, and ſate upon his Head, and was ſpread all over him when he was anointed of the Father; to whom alſo, leſt Impoſition of hands ſhould ſeem to be wanting, the Voice of God was heard from the Cloud, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleaſed.</hi> I ſhall leave this to conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But further you affirm, <hi>that Chriſt did not lay hands upon his Diſciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And how do you come to know he did not? may be you will ſay, <hi>'tis no where written
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59587:32"/>
that he did.</hi> But pray where do you read that the 12 Diſciples, or Apoſtles of Chriſt, were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? Doth it follow becauſe we read not of their Baptiſm, they were not baptized?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you ſay, there is not one word of it in the Commiſſion.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is not one word in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as I have ſhewed, concerning any Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands, yet you own that upon Officers to be a Principle of Chriſt's Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is not one word in the Commiſſion concerning the Reſurrection of the Dead, nor of Eternal Judgment, nor Prayer, nor Aſſembling together, nor other things that are undoubtedly Goſpel-Truths and Inſtitutions; yet tho they are not expreſt, they are included, as thoſe words plainly hold forth, <hi>Teach them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you:</hi> And ſurely every one may ſee, unleſs he wilfully ſhut his eyes, that there are many more Precepts implied in the words of the Commiſſion than are expreſt; for if nothing muſt be received for Goſpel-Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions but what are expreſt in the Commiſſion, you muſt throw away the greateſt part of thoſe Precepts you call Commands, or Appointments of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you proceed, and ſay, <hi>That the Church of the Hebrews practiſed no ſuch thing, for there is no mention that the hundred and twenty had hands laid upon them, nor the three thouſand,</hi> Acts 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Church of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed this Ordinance as well as other Churches, is plain in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. As they repented, believed,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59587:32"/>
and were baptized, ſo they were under the practice of Laying on of hands: for that is a practical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance all confeſs; <hi>Not laying again,</hi> ſaith the Author, <hi>Repentance from dead Works,</hi> &amp;c. this plainly ſheweth they had once laid all thoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-principles.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But may be, you will ſay, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this ſignified in</hi> Acts 2. <hi>when that Church was firſt gathered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis very clear you are miſtaken; for is it not ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. <hi>They continued in the Apoſtles Doctrine?</hi> which they could not do, if they had not ſubmitted to every Part or Precept of it; and is not Laying on of hands, as well as Baptiſm, and thoſe other Principles, part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? 'tis called the <hi>Apoſtles Doctrine, Acts</hi> 2. in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Chriſt's Doctrine</hi>; not the Apoſtles any other ways than they were taught it by, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from the Lord Jeſus: and let none con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they were not taught Laying on of hands, becauſe not plainly expreſt, or particularly laid down <hi>Acts</hi> 2. for we may as well conclude, the Apoſtle taught them not the Reſurrection of the Dead, nor Eternal Judgment, ſince we read no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there to that purpoſe: Doubtleſs <hi>Philip, Acts</hi> 8. preached Baptiſm to the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> how ſhould he elſe cry out, <hi>Lo here is Water, what doth hinder me from being baptized?</hi> yet we read not one word of <hi>Philip</hi>'s preaching of it to him. The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (writing to this very People) <hi>ch.</hi> 5.12. tells us, <hi>They had need to be taught again which are the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God</hi>; therefore it follows clearly, they had been taught it, and had practiſed it, as <hi>chap.</hi> 6.1, 2. proves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59587:33"/>Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> goes on, and affirms, that we <hi>find not the leaſt mention of it in any of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the New Teſtament, neither in</hi> Samaria <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Philip <hi>had baptized them, nor</hi> Corinth, Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi, Coloſſia, Theſſalonica, Rome, Galatia, Smyrna, Thyatira, Pergamos, Sardis, Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, <hi>no nor</hi> Epheſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I cannot but admire at ſuch affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but firſt, as to the Church in <hi>Samaria,</hi> 'tis granted <hi>Philip</hi> did not lay hands on them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had baptized them; he being only a <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> it might not upon that account concern, or belong to him to impoſe hands on them: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, God had other work for him to do, <hi>viz.</hi> the Converſion of the <hi>Eunuch.</hi> Yet moſt evident it is, when the Apoſtles and Brethren at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> heard that the People in <hi>Samaria</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Word of God, and were baptized, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they ſhould lie ſhort of any part of their duty, eſpecially that in which ſo great a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is <hi>promiſed,</hi> they would ſend <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to pray and lay their hands upon them; and that it was not for the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit, has been clearly proved. And as to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> 'tis ſaid plainly <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. <hi>That they had obeyed from the heart that Form of Doctrine delivered to them:</hi> And what Form can the Apoſtle intend ſave that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2? we read of no other delivered to the Saints for their obedience. And as to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> we read of their coming under this Ordinance when firſt planted, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And now as to ſome other Churches he ſpeaks of, I grant we read not of their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59587:33"/>
this Ordinance; yet what doth this make againſt it? For where do we read of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance or Faith, of their being baptized, or their believing the Reſurrection of the Dead, or Eternal Judgment? There is nothing ſpoken of ſeveral Churches as to any of theſe other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and it is very obſervable, that we read but of one or two Churches that practiſed the Lord's Supper: yet none doubt but all the Churches continued in the practice of it, God's way being the ſame in every Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. If in ſome Scriptures it is ſpoken of as the duty and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Saints, tho not expreſt in all places, it matters not; for if what is the duty of one Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever as a Believer, be the duty of every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, then there is no need for the Almighty to ſpeak of every particular Church's obedience ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Baptiſm, Laying on of hands, or the Lord's Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing I cannot but call over again, owned and confeſſed by Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> viz. <hi>That there is a Laying on of hands reckoned amongſt the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 'Tis well he will grant this; nay, and it is one of his firſt Teachings, he alſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: then I hope he will allow us to ſay, Chriſt taught a Laying on of hands as a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-principle; and if he taught it, 'twas that it might be practiſed as a Foundation, or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Truth; and then ought not all to yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereto? For as every Perſon is actually to repent, believe, and be baptized, ſo each one ought to come under the practice of Laying on of hands, it being of the ſame extent, nature and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59587:34"/>
quality with the other, and joined to them; and it cannot be ſaid to be obeyed otherwiſe than by practice; as in Baptiſm, I do not yield obedience by believing other Perſons were or ought to be baptized, but by being baptized my ſelf. We grant that ſome Act done upon, or Practice done by others, may be teaching to us, tho not inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in our own Perſons to do the ſame; but then it muſt not be ſuch a fundamental Principle and Practice as this, being of the ſame nature with Repentance, Faith, and Baptiſm; Will it ſerve my turn to believe 'tis another Man's duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? Surely no, I muſt repent and believe my ſelf, or elſe I neglect my duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> And whereas he tells us in pag. 43<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of other <hi>beginning Teachings, proper for all baptized Babes.</hi>

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He pretends to <hi>take the ſtumbling-block out of the way of God's People:</hi> But in this 'tis pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable he rather caſt one in their way; will he make new Foundation-Principles, or call thoſe beginning Principles of Chriſt's Doctrine, or of Church-Conſtitution, which God no where ſo calls? We ſay, ſuch only are to be accounted beginning Principles, which God's Word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares ſo to be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It appears as if he would make Laying on of hands for miraculous healing, to be that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. which has been fully anſwered again and again; they ſhould have refuted Mr. <hi>Griffith</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rider,</hi> before they inſiſt on this: I think it needleſs on that account to ſpeak any thing to it, and ſhall only refer the Reader to their excellent Books for ſatisfaction. But this I muſt ſay, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59587:34"/>
that Laying on of hands for healing belongs not to Babes as ſuch; ſtrong Men, and Fathers may be ſick, and have need of it, as well as others: beſides, this ſort concerns not all (no, only ſick Perſons) and may be practiſed again and again, as oft as Perſons may be ſick, or under bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; but that Principle that is one of the beginning words of Chriſt's Doctrine, is only to be laid, or practiſed once, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Not Laying again,</hi> &amp;c. 2ly. Unbelievers had hands laid upon them for healing, and therefore I might alſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue it appertains not unto Babes as ſuch: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, anointing with Oil is left as the Ordinance for healing in the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſhould make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what Chriſt taught as a Promiſe or Gift to ſome particular Perſons, and what he taught as a general Practice; that which is minded in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. is laid down promiſſory-wiſe to ſuch as ſhould have the gift of Faith, or the Faith of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles <note n="*" place="bottom">Will any ſay, to drink Poiſon, or any deadly thing, or take up Serpents, is Milk for Babes?</note>, and is therefore nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

               <p>But, do they not confute themſelves by thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing? they own the Doctrine of Laying on of hands to be a Foundation-principle of Chriſt; but this they ſpeak of here muſt needs be granted to be temporary, being for the confirmation of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59587:35"/>
Word, as he himſelf confeſſeth; and every Word or Ordinance of Chriſt, as I have ſhewed, was more or leſs confirmed with Signs, and Wonders according to this Promiſe of Chriſt. I ſhall ſay no more to this, but proceed to his next Objection.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We anſwer, by diſtinguiſhing between that Baptiſm that is a practical Duty, and that which is taught or laid down by our Lord Jeſus to be believed: that that is commanded, ought abſolutely to be obeyed by every Babe; and 'tis as neceſſary for every Babe to believe the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Sufferings, which Jeſus Chriſt preached to all that would follow him and be his Diſciples; this was that which he taught, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.22, 23. to the two Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> that they (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all God's Children) ſhould more or leſs <hi>be baptized with.

We ſay not, that every one muſt actually forſake Houſe, and Lands, and Life for Chriſt's ſake, and the Goſpel, or elſe be none of his Diſciples, but be ready in holy diſpoſition ſo to do when call'd to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:59587:35"/>And as to the Baptiſm of the Spirit, that the Spirit is promiſed to every true Believer, ſee <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28, 29. which <hi>Peter</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.17. compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 38, 39.) applies indefinitely to all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent baptized Perſons, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> as their Right by promiſe of the Father to receive; and not to them of that Generation only, but alſo to ſuch as ſhould repent, and be baptized in all ſucceeding Ages; this Promiſe is one and the ſame with that in <hi>John</hi> 7.38. called <hi>Rivers of Water,</hi> implying <hi>fillings</hi>

               <p n="2">2. All are to believe the Baptiſm of the Spirit was given in the Apoſtles days to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Goſpel or Word of Chriſt.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59587:36"/>
must be taught it, that's plain, but that they are obliged therefore to practiſe it, is not here or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to be found.</hi>

Would any judg this Good Divinity? What reaſon can he give, ſeeing all the four are practical Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that the three firſt ſhould be taught ſo as to be perſonally practis'd by all, and the other only to be believ'd? Tho what he ſays here has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been fully anſwer'd, yet I ſhall examin this Text further, and make it evident, that the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands in this Text cannot intend or be meant that upon Church-Officers, but muſt mean that ſort now contended for; and I am more willing to ſpeak further to this Objection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this being anſwered, our work is done.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mind that the Apoſtle is ſpeaking only here of the firſt Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt; are they not ſo called? <hi>i. e. Doctrinae Chriſtianae Initia, ſeu Rudimenta; the Beginnings or Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſtian Doctrine:</hi> Or, as <hi>Beza, Prima Chriſtianiſmi Principia; the first Principles of Chriſtianity.</hi> Now Laying on of hands on Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, is not a beginning Principle, nor of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet of the Chriſtian Religion, I think they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59587:37"/>
will not affirm it ſo to be. May not a Church, or People, profeſs and practiſe the firſt or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Principles of Religion, and proceed very far in the way of Chriſtianity, and yet have no Officers orderly ordained amongſt them?</p>
               <p>But 2. Theſe Principles appertain to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of God's Houſe, being ſuch on which the Houſe is built; they are all equal in kind, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and quality, and one not to be without the other, God having joined them together as all of one rank, for the bearing up this Spiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. But laying on of hands on Officers, is an Ordinance of another rank and nature; a Church muſt be firſt gathered, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and Perſons make a conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the Profeſſion of Religion, before they can orderly be choſen, or ordained to the Office of Elders or Deacons: In ſhort, Officers are not for the being, but well-being of the Church; and therefore ſuch a Laying on of hands cannot be intended here. We read of Churches who had no Officers amongſt them, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5, 6. If a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter were to preach unto a People what are the Fundamentals of a Goſpel-Church, <hi>viz.</hi> what Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought to do, that ſo in an orderly way they may be congregated together in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, or be made regular Members of the viſible Church, would he tell them Laying on of hands on Officers is one Principle? Surely no; he would not affirm this to be one of the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſtian Practice (that which firſt of all a Chriſtian ſhould be inſtructed in and come under, that he may have a being in God's Houſe) nor a Foundation-principle of Church-Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59587:37"/>
but that the Laying on of hands ſpoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. is ſo, nothing is more evident: for if it be a Principle of the Foundation, either it muſt be a Fundamental of Salvation, or of Church-Conſtitution; but none will ſay of the former, therefore it wuſt be of the latter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it cannot intend Laying on of hands on Church-Officers, might appear further, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis joined to, or coupled with Baptiſm; why ſhould Laying on of hands on Officers, be by the Spirit of God laid down after this ſort? Repentance from dead Works, <hi>and</hi> Faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; the Doctrine of Baptiſms, <hi>and</hi> Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands; the Reſurrection from the Dead, <hi>and</hi> Eternal Judgment. May we not ſafely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that the Laying on of hands, which follows here in order of words, is what followed in order of practice? See <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. and 19.6. And is it not according to what they acknowledg ſound reaſoning in another caſe upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. and <hi>Mark</hi> 16. that Baptiſm mentioned in the Commiſſion, joined to, and following Faith and Illumination in order of words, is what the Apoſtles in order of practice, <hi>viz.</hi> after Faith and Illumination, did baptize with? <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and 10. But that was the Baptiſm of Water, which therefore is only intended in the Commiſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus by comparing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Scripture, we may be ſatisfied in thoſe things, which at firſt ſeem'd doubtful.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It cannot be meant here, becauſe all the Church of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as well as that in <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Acts</hi> 8. (and conſequently all other Churches) had laid, or come under this Principle, as they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59587:38"/>
had laid Repentance, Faith, and Baptiſm, when they were Babes: Now, who can reaſonably i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, either that the whole Church of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> were Officers, or that Officers are Babes in Chriſt? That this is the Laying on of hands on baptized Believers, is eaſy to underſtand: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe taught to Babes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. 2. Babes are capable, or meet ſubjects thereof. 3. Babes have need of it, as Children of Milk. 4. Babes we read were in the practice thereof, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and 19.5. Becauſe it belongs to them as ſuch, and were at firſt taught it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. and 6.1, 2. this cannot be ſaid of any other ſort. I ſhall ſay no more, only add ſomething out of Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor,</hi> of <hi>Confirm.</hi> p. 45—48. full to our purpoſe, which conſidering the learning and worthineſs of the Author, I judg may be uſeful; what he minds, take as followeth, ſpeaking of Laying on of hands, called Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: <hi>We have ſeen</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Original from Christ, the practice and exerciſe of it in the Apoſtles, and the first Converts in Chriſtianity: what I ſhall now remark is, That this is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and paſſed into a Chriſtian Doctrine; the Warranty for what I ſay, is</hi> Heb. 6.1. <hi>where the holy Rite of Confirmation, ſo called from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this Adminiſtration, and exprest by the ritual part of it, Impoſition of hands, is reckoned a fundamental Point; and here are ſix fundamental points of St.</hi> Paul'<hi>s Catechiſm, which he laid as the Foundation, or beginning of the Inſtitution of the Chriſtian Church; and therefore they who deny it, dig up Foundations. Now that this Impoſition of hands is what the Apoſtle uſed in confirming the Baptized, and invocating the Holy Spirit upon them,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59587:38"/>
remains to be proved; which is done, by ſhewing,</hi> 1. <hi>It cannot intend Abſolution; nor</hi> 2. <hi>Ordination. And this is evident:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe the Apoſtle would henceforth leave to ſpeak of the Foundation, and go on to perfection, that is to higher Myſteries; now in Rituals there is none higher than Ordination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Apoſtle ſaying he would ſpeak no more of Impoſition of Hands, preſently diſcourſes of the myſteriouſneſs of the Evangelical Prieſthood, and the Honour of that Vocation; by which 'tis evident he ſpeaks nothing of Ordination in the Catechiſm, or Narratives of Fundamentals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This alſo appears from the Context, not only becauſe Laying on of hands is immediately ſet after Baptiſm, but becauſe in the very next words of his Diſcourſe, he enumerates and apportions to theſe Ordinances their proper proportioned Effects,</hi> i. e. <hi>to Faith and Baptiſm, Illumination; to Laying on of hands, the taſting the Heavenly Gift, and being made Partakers of the Holy Spirit; by the thing ſignified declaring the Sign, and by hopes of the Reſurrection, taſtes of the good things of the World to come: He that falls from this ſtate, and turns Apoſtate from this whole Diſpenſation, digging down, and turning up theſe Foundations, ſhall never be built again; he can never be baptized again, and never confirmed any more: If he remains on theſe Foundations, tho he ſins, he may be renewed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by Repentance, and by reſuſcitation of the Spirit, if he had not wholly quenched him; but if he renounces the whole Covenant, diſown and cancel theſe Foundations, he is deſperate, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be renewed. This is the full explication of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59587:39"/>
this excellent place, and otherways it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated; but therefore into this place any notice of Ordination cannot come; no Senſe, no Myſtery can be made of it, or drawn from it, but by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of Confirmation: The whole Context is clear, rational and intelligible.</hi> He cites <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> as ſpeaking the ſame things upon this place, <hi>p.</hi> 50.</p>
               <p>To theſe I might add <hi>Eſtius</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>'Tis</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>undoubtedly to be underſtood of that Laying on of hands, which was adminiſtred to the Faithful preſently after Baptiſm, of which St.</hi> Luke <hi>ſpeaks,</hi> Acts 8. &amp; 19. I might produce <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Heming,</hi> and other modern Authors, upon the ſame place: But having upon occaſion men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſeveral before, I ſhall cloſe this with a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>The first ſtep to Chriſtianity</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is Repentance of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Life, next that Salvation is to be hoped from God, next that we be purged in Baptiſm from our filth, next that by Laying on of hands we receive the Holy Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Danvers</hi> having laboured to weaken the proof of our Practice from <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59587:39"/>
(tho all he ſays ſignifies nothing) comes p. 45. to examine <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. and 19.6. which we affirm to be full Precedents for Laying on of hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on baptized Believers. The ſum of his Objections, or the way he takes to invalidate what we infer from thence, take as follows, <hi>p.</hi> 46.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>As to that of</hi> Samaria, <hi>it is ſaid that ſeveral being converted in that City, and baptized by</hi> Philip, <hi>who wrought many Miracles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſome time with them,</hi> Acts 8.13. <hi>yet did not he impoſe hands upon them as we read of: the Church of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>hearing that</hi> Samaria <hi>had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Word of God, and that the Spirit was not fallen upon any of them,</hi> viz. <hi>in a viſible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> (<hi>which was a Phraſe attributed to thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Meaſures frequently given in thoſe days,</hi> Acts 10.44. <hi>which ſometimes did fall upon them before Baptiſm, and ſometimes after</hi>) <hi>ſent</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>who it ſeems were extraordinarily gifted by God, ſo that on whomſoever they prayed, and laid their hands, the Spirit was viſibly, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, and immediately given; and 'tis ſaid they laid their hands upon them, but how many 'tis not ſaid; ſurely not upon all, for</hi> Simon <hi>by his profane offer diſcovered he had neither lot nor part therein, tho baptized,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The firſt thing he hints at, as an Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt our Practice from this place, is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> Philip <hi>laid not his hands upon them, after he had baptized them:</hi> Which we have anſwered already; but this I muſt ſay now, that if <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> laid their hands on thoſe Believers in <hi>Samaria,</hi> as Men miraculouſly gifted, or by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their extraordinary Attainments, it might
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59587:40"/>
ſeem ſtrange that <hi>Philip</hi> laid not his hands upon them, being (tho but a Deacon) endowed with thoſe extraordinary Gifts, and had wrought won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Signs and Miracles in the ſame City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: The reaſon therefore why <hi>Philip</hi> did not impoſe hands upon them was,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe not miniſterially capacitated ſo to do, it not belonging to him on the account of his Office, nor his extraordinary Gifts and Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This alſo I might further ſhew, becauſe the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did not ſend to <hi>Samaria</hi> Men ſimply indowed with miraculous Gifts, but ſuch as had Miniſterial Power and Authority as the Servants of Chriſt, in his Name to compleat and perfect what was wanting among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis an Act</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on Acts 8.17.) <hi>reſerved to the Rulers of the Church, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated or allowed to inferiour Officers, ſuch as</hi> Philip <hi>the Deacon here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But whereas Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſeems to affirm, that as ſome in the primitive time had the Gift of Healing, ſo others had the Gift or Power to give the Holy Spirit; 'tis utterly denied, and the contrary has often been proved, for that 'tis only the Gift of God, and Chriſt's bleſſed Prerogative; they were found in their Duty, they prayed, and laid on their hands, and left the iſſue to God to give the Spirit, according to his promiſe and good pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But probably ſome may object, <hi>We read of none but the Apoſtles that laid hands on baptized Believers; and tho they acted not by virtue of their miraculous Endowments, nor had power to give the Holy Spirit, yet they might act herein by virtue of their extraordinary call unto that Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:59587:40"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I affirm that they acted in all other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, yea, and did whatſoever they did in the Worſhip and Service of Chriſt, by virtue of the ſaid extraordinary Call unto the Miniſtry, as well as in this: But doth it therefore follow that nothing the Apoſtles practiſed is a Precedent or Rule unto us, as ſome ignorantly have affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs ſo called of God, and endowed as they were?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Had not <hi>Matthias</hi> the ſame power to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Ordinances (who was mediately called to his Office by the Church) as the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles immediately called by Chriſt Jeſus? and is not the End and Work of the Office (however called to it) one and the ſame? <hi>viz. the work of the Miniſtry, the perfecting the Saints, and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We read hardly of any that preached the Word Authoritatively, or officiated in any Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-adminiſtration by virtue of their Office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the extraordinary Apoſtles; and therefore if what they did be not a Law or Rule to us, and to all ordinary Miniſters, to the end of the World, we ſhall be at a loſs in many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: It muſt therefore be granted, that what they taught and practiſed as an Ordinance of Chriſt, and foundation-Principle of his Doctrine, they delivered it <hi>unto faithful Men,</hi> that were their Succeſſors, <hi>that they might be able to teach others alſo,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.3. And this agrees with <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Thoſe things that you have both learned and received, heard and ſeen in me, do; and the God of Peace ſhall be with you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Had it been a Service for that Day only,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59587:41"/>
and none to be Adminiſtrators thereof but thoſe great Apoſtles, it would not have been left as a ſtanding, or foundation principle in God's Houſe, and been joined to Faith, and the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>In the 2d place, he would have us believe the end of that Adminiſtration was for the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary or viſible Gifts of the Holy Spirit, which we have clearly refuted; yet I ſhall ſay further, that by his arguing, the Apoſtles reſolved that all the Church at <hi>Samaria,</hi> yea and that at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſhould have the extraordinary Gifts, ſince they laid their hands on all that were baptized, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception. Nay, it follows roundly, that where ever the Apoſtles found any particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, or Diſciples, that had not received thoſe viſible, or extraordinary Gifts, they were to lay their hands on them to that end: For I preſume Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> judges, had <hi>Paul</hi> found 1200, as he found 12, at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who had not received, nor heard of the Holy Ghoſt, he would have laid hands on them; which preſuppoſes alſo, that thoſe miraculous Gifts were promiſed, and belong to every particular Member in the Church, which is directly contrary to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 7, 8, 9, 29, 30. for tho (as we have proved) the Holy Spirit be promiſed to every ſincere Believer in the Lord Jeſus, yet are not the extraordinary Gifts promiſed to any in particular, being only reſerved in the boſom or breaſt of the Almighty, to whom, and after what manner he will diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them. 1 Cor. 12.4. <hi>There are diverſities of Gifts, but the ſame Spirit; to one is given by the ſame Spirit, the word of Wiſdom; to another the word of Knowledg; to another Faith; to another the gift
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59587:41"/>
of Healing, by the ſame Spirit; to another the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miracles; to another Prophecy; to another diſcerning of Tongues,</hi> v. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Are all Prophets? are all workers of Miracles? have all the Gift of Healing? do all ſpeak with Tongues?</hi> &amp;c. Hence nothing can be clearer than this, that tho all have right to the Spirit, yet but very few had the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Gifts thereof in the primitive Times.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſeems to affirm, is, that all in <hi>Samaria</hi> that were baptized, had not hands laid upon them, becauſe it is ſaid of <hi>Simon,</hi> he had no part nor lot in that matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here he begs the Queſtion, taking for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>Simon</hi> had not hands laid upon him; but why might not <hi>Simon</hi> have lot and part in that matter, if by Lot and Part be meant the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, or miraculous Gifts of the Spirit, ſince Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites may partake of them, as our Saviour plainly ſignifies, and alſo doth our Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2?</p>
               <p n="2">2. He might come under the Ordinance, and yet his heart not being right with God, he might not have any part or lot in the bleſſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, the Spirit of Promiſe; which the World receiveth not, nor can an unſanctified Heart par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their reception of the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, was partly to convince the Apoſtles and Believers themſelves that Chriſt had made good his promiſe of ſending the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By Lot or Part in that matter, may not be meant partaking of the ritual, or external part of the Ordinance, but rather refers to his deſire of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59587:42"/>
having power to be an Adminiſtrator of it upon others, ſo that the Holy Spirit might be given to thoſe he laid his hands on. But,</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we ſhould grant <hi>Simon</hi> had not hands im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon him, which I rather incline to, yet would it not hurt our Cauſe in the leaſt, becauſe he might be diſcovered to be a profane Wretch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came to be his lot to partake thereof: if therefore it appears, and may be granted, that all that were baptized in <hi>Samaria</hi> came under this Appointment ſave <hi>Simon,</hi> we have as much as we deſire: And ſurely this cannot rationally be denied by any that read the words, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>When they believed they were baptized, both Men and Women.</hi> Compare this with <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. that <hi>the Holy Spirit was fallen on none of them</hi> 
                  <note n="†" rend="inter">M. <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> notes the emphaſis to lie in this Pronoun Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>They;</hi> the Antecedent hereunto muſt needs be the Baptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Muſt not <hi>they,</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> mean all who are ſaid to be baptized? So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when 'tis ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>they laid their hands upon them</hi>; doth not <hi>them</hi> intend the very ſame they prayed for? and ſhall we think they did not pray for them all? had not all the like need of God's Spirit? and is it not promiſed to all the Sons and Handmaids? Or ſhall we think the Apoſtle did not pray for the Women as well as the Men, the weaker Veſſels, as well as the ſtronger? In <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. (as 'tis well noted by Mr. <hi>Fiſher</hi>) 'tis ſaid, <hi>Go, teach all Nations, baptizing them</hi>; and in the words following, <hi>teaching them to obſerve all things I have commanded you.</hi> By <hi>them</hi> muſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59587:42"/>
needs intend them all, and every of them that were made Diſciples, and baptized.</p>
               <p>One word or two further concerning what Mr. <hi>D.</hi> objects againſt us from <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6. from the Effects that followed this Adminiſtration; he ſtill arguing as if that were the abſolute End thereof: <hi>Which,</hi> as a great Doctor well obſerves, is too <hi>trifling a fancy to be put in balance againſt so ſacred an Inſtitution.</hi> But let us examin this Scripture a little more: <hi>Have you received the Holy Spirit ſince ye believed?</hi> (ſaith our Apoſtle.) They ſaid unto him, <hi>We have not ſo much as heard whether there be any Holy Spirit. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto what then were ye baptized?</hi> &amp;c. Two things are here very remarkable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Holy Spirit (according to the ſenſe of the Apoſtle inquiring after their recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it) is the undoubted Right of every bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Believer in Chriſt Jeſus, appears from theſe two expreſſions; <hi>Have ye received the Spirit ſince ye believed?</hi> (No.) <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto what then were ye bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized?</hi> It ſeems ſtrange (as if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay) that you having believed in Chriſt, and been baptized, have not yet received the Holy Spirit, ſince it is the great Legacy our Lord and Maſter left to every one of his Diſciples?</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis evident that whoſoever was baptized af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt's reſurrection in his Name was inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into Laying on of Hands, the outward Ceremony, or Miniſtry of it, belonging to them as Perſons ſo conſidered. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to queſtion their Baptiſm, ſince they were wholly ignorant of that glorious Promiſe of Bleſſing, annexed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59587:43"/>
thereto; which conſidered, may fully ſatisfy any unbiaſſed Perſon that the extraordinary or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Gifts could not be the End of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration: and as touching thoſe Effects that followed, 'tis clear the like Effects followed all other Ordinances as well as this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> And whereas Mr. <hi>D.</hi> preſumes to ſay, <hi>They were ſome of the Church of</hi> Epheſus; and again, <hi>not the whole Church.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Can it be thought that thoſe were at that time Members of the Church, and yet ſo ignorant of the Holy Spirit? And ſurely <hi>Paul</hi> would not have baptized them again, if they had been Members of the Church before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are not called the Church, nor of the Church, nor ſome of the Church, but certain Diſciples; yea, and ſuch as appears were only inſtructed into the Baptiſm of <hi>John.</hi>

               <p n="3">3.

The way of God touching the Adminiſtration of Goſpel-Inſtitutions being one and the ſame in all the Churches of the Saints, notwithſtanding what has already been offered, may be a ſatisfactory Anſwer to Mr. <hi>D.</hi> concerning what he minds from thoſe two Scriptures: yet finding ſo many
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59587:43"/>
Learned Men, both antient and of later times, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with us in their Expoſitions on theſe two Places; and not knowing but their Words may with ſome take more place than what ſuch a one as I may ſpeak, I'll cite a Paſſage or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyprian,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. ſaith, <hi>It was not neceſſary they ſhould be baptized again, only what was wanting, was performed by</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>that by Prayer and Impoſition of Hands the Holy Spirit ſhould be invocated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saith <hi>Hierom</hi> on the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, <hi>We find another Inſtance of the Celebration of this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Myſtery, for it is ſignally exprest of the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at</hi> Epheſus: Paul <hi>firſt baptized them, and then laid his Hands upon them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</hi> And theſe Teſtimonies are the great Warranty for this holy Ordinance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eucherites</hi> is cited by Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> p. 43. ſpeaking, thus: <hi>The ſame thing now done in Impoſition of Hands on ſingle Perſons, is no other than what was done upon all Believers in the deſcent of the H. Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He mentions <hi>Zanchius,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I wiſh the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Apoſtles and Primitive Churches were of more value amongſt Chriſtians. It were well if they were ſo,</hi> (ſaith the Doctor) <hi>but there is more than meer Examples; theſe Examples of ſuch Solemnities, the Apoſtles are our Maſters in them, and have given Rules and Precedents for the Church to follow: this is a Chriſtian Law, and written (as all Scriptures are) for our Inſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſtius</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. affirms that the Laying on of Hands mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6. by St. <hi>Luke, is that of Confirmation, whereby the Spirit of God is given to Perſons baptized, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59587:44"/>
with they being ſtrengthned, confeſs the Name of Chriſt undauntedly among the Enemies of the Faith.</hi> And again (ſaith he) <hi>That Hands were wont to be laid upon Perſons baptized, after the example of the Apoſtles, all Antiquity teacheth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> alſo in his <hi>Annot.</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. ſaith; <hi>That it was Confirmation, may appear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, becauſe it ſo ſoon attended their Converſion and Baptiſm. When the Apoſtles which were at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>heard that</hi> Samaria <hi>had received the Word of God, they ſent</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Which agrees well</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with that of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which is an Act reſerved to the Rulers of the Church, and not communicated or allowed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Officers, ſuch as</hi> Philip <hi>the Deacon here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then paraphaſing upon <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6. he ſaith, <hi>After this</hi> Paul <hi>by Impoſition of hands, and benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gave them Confirmation, by which means the Holy Spirit came on them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Ralph Venning</hi> in his Remains, ſpeaking of <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. and 19.6. gives his underſtanding upon them; <hi>That it was the practice of the Apoſtles, after they had baptized Perſons, ſooner or later, to lay Hands upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus from what has been ſaid, I hope it may appear to all inquiring Souls, in oppoſition to what Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſaith, <hi>page</hi> 47. that theſe two Places are clear Precedents and Rules for this Practice, as well as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. and other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we have inſiſted upon, for as much as there was a Laying on of Hands practiſed immediately after Baptiſm, and with much certainty upon every Member, or baptized Believer, and to ſuch an End as is attainable in theſe times.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Further ſhewing, that Prayer, with Impoſition of Hands upon baptized Believers, remains for ever as a ſtanding or perpetual Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>BUT leſt any ſhould ſtill object, this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance doth not continue, neither is the End attainable now, I am willing to add two or three Arguments, for the further evincing of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Lord was pleaſed to bear witneſs to, or ratify this bleſſed Ordinance or Principle of Chriſt's Doctrine, with the like Signs, Wonders, and Gifts of the Holy Spirit, as he did any other Word, Command, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the ſaid Doctrine. Now what was thus eſtabliſhed, muſt needs remain in full force to the end of the World as our duty: and dangerous it is to labour to make it void; for by the ſame Argument may an Enemy lay waſte, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way another, yea, and conſequently every one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Becauſe it is a Foundation-principle of God's Houſe, or one of the great Pillars (next to Chriſt) on which it is built, it muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; and very dangerous it is for any to take away a Foundation-ſtone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis very abſurd</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Blackwood</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> p. 688.) <hi>to think that one of the ſix Foundation-principles,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59587:45"/>
commended to us by the Apoſtle, ſhould ceaſe, and all the other remain to the end of the World: Nay, is not Impoſition of Hands placed in the midſt, betwixt Faith and Repentance on the one ſide, and Eternal Judgment on the other? 'tis fenced in on every ſide, there is no coming to ſlight it. 'Tis abſurd to think the Apoſtle would place one temporary Principle, that was to laſt but a ſhort time, amongst five perpetual Principles, and call them all by the ſame name of a Foundation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Becauſe the Promiſe of the Spirit is very extenſive; 'tis made to all believing and obedient Souls to the end of the World; <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. ult. <hi>Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you always to the end of the World.</hi> John 14.15, 16, 17. <hi>If you love me, keep my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth, which the World cannot receive,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor,</hi> p. 53. ſpeaks excellently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the perpetuity of this Ordinance: And from this very ground, take his own words; <hi>The perpetuity of this holy Rite appears,</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe the great Gift of the Holy Ghoſt was promiſed to abide with the Church for ever: Repent, and be baptized every one of you, and ye ſhall receive the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt; not the meaneſt Perſon amongst you but ſhall receive this great thing; for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to you, and to your Children, and to all that are afar off, even ſo many as the Lord our God ſhall call; this Promiſe is made to all, and unto all for ever.</hi> And preſently, ſpeaking as to Laying on
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59587:45"/>
of Hands, as God's way for the miniſtring of it; <hi>I ſay, ſuch a Solemnity</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>'tis not eaſie to be ſuppoſed ſhould be appointed; that is, it is not imaginable that a ſolemn Rite, annex'd to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Promiſe, ſhould be tranſient and temporary: for by the nature of Relatives, they muſt be of equal abode; the Promiſe is of a thing for ever; the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony or Rite was annexed to the Promiſe, and therefore this alſo muſt abide for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Becauſe the Spirit which is promiſed, is the Comforter that leads us into all Truth, and helps the Saints in their Teſtimony and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for Chriſt; and 'tis that by which they are ſealed alſo to the day of Redemption, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Who after that ye believed, ye were ſealed by that Spirit of Promiſe. He ſpeaks it to the</hi> Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>who well underſtood his meaning, by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring what was done to them by the Apoſtle; who a while before, after he had baptized them, laid his Hands upon them</hi> (ſaith the Doctor) <hi>ſo they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and were ſealed with the Holy Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now do not we as much need the Spirit's gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and to be born up in our Teſtimony, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Temptations, as the Saints of former Ages; and to be ſealed by the Spirit of Promiſe as they did? Why then ſhould we not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to wait on God, in the ſame way he has preſcribed, for receiving a further increaſe of it, even in which the primitive Saints did yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But ſome will ſay, We have the Spirit in as great a meaſure as you, who never came under Laying on of Hands; and what greater meaſure
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59587:46"/>
have you after your obedience thereto than before?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We dare not boaſt of our Indowments; we are poor and needy, and therefore willing to uſe all Advantages, and be found in every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to meet with more of Chriſt and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and if you have ſo much, that you need not pray, nor uſe the means God directs to for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining more, 'tis a rare ſtate you are arrived to.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God be better than his Word, we will not complain; he hath many ways to convey his Spirit into our hearts; yet this is the great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance for diſtributing of it to baptized Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. But may we not ſay with one of the Antients, <hi>By this rite of Impoſition of Hands, God hath promiſed, and the Saints received the Holy Ghoſt? for tho</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Spirit of God was given extraregularly, and at all times as God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet this of Impoſition of Hands was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, this was the Miniſtry of the Spirit; we receive Chriſt when we hear, and obey his Word, we eat Chriſt by Faith; and yet the bleſſed Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Body and Blood of Chriſt: the Lord's Supper is appointed ritually to convey Chriſt's Body and Blood to us; ſo is Laying on of Hands ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ritually to give us the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now probably ſome who are againſt the Lord's Supper, may ſay, they feed upon Chriſt, and have as much Communion with him, and Faith in him, as many of us who often partake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and may be can ſay as much on this account, as you on the other: will you therefore neglect your Duty touching breaking of Bread?</p>
               <p>There is a Promiſe of the Spirit made in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59587:46"/>
yet ſome may ſay, they have more of the Spirit than you or I, and yet never were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. <hi>Cornelius,</hi> tho he had received a large meaſure of the Spirit, yet was very willing to be baptized, and to do what ever <hi>Peter,</hi> from Chriſt's command, enjoined him. And thus the Objection is anſwered.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But extraordinary Effects did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany this Adminiſtration, and ſuch do not follow now; therefore the thing you plead for is ceaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> ſpeak now, for I have largely anſwered this Objection elſewhere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I met with the learned Doctor: <hi>If this be all</hi> (ſaith he, p. 57—59.) <hi>that can be ſaid in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to it, it is infinitely vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In the days of the Apoſtles, the Holy Spirit produced miraculous Effects, but neither always, nor at all in all Men; Are all workers of Miracles? do all ſpeak with Tongues?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Wind bloweth where it liſteth; ſome have Gifts after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſome after that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe Gifts were not neceſſary at all Times, any more than to all Perſons; but the Promiſe of the Holy Spirit did belong to all, and was performed to all, but not in the like manner.</hi> Stephen <hi>was full of the Holy Spirit, of Faith, and Power, the Holy Ghoſt was given to him, to fulfil his Faith principally; working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles was but collateral, and incident: but there is alſo an Infuſion of the Holy Spirit to all, and that for ever, The manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every Man, to profit withal: And therefore if the Grace be given to all, there is no reaſon that the ritual Miniſtration of that Grace ſhould ceaſe, on pretence that the Spirit is not given extraordinarily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59587:47"/>3. <hi>Thoſe extraordinary Gifts were indeed at firſt neceſſary</hi>; (he gives ſeveral reaſons thereof) <hi>one, becauſe of them who could not receive the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of an incorporeal Nature; that if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they be not ſo done, they may be believed by thoſe things which were already done: another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſtate of the Church. But the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Gifts</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were to abide for ever; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis obſervable that St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſays, that the Gift of Tongues is one of the leaſt and moſt uſeleſs things, a meer ſign, and not ſo much as a ſign to a Believer, but to Infidels and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>To every ordinary and perpetual Miniſtry, at firſt there were extraordinary Effects, and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conſignations: We find</hi> 3000 <hi>converted at one Sermon,</hi> 5000 <hi>at another; and Perſons were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly cured by Prayer, at the viſitation of the Sick; and Devils caſt out in the converſion of a Sinner: And now tho we ſee no ſuch extraordinary Effects, it follows not that the Viſitation of the Sick, Preaching, Sermons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are not ordinary and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Miniſtrations; and therefore to fancy that Invocation of the Holy Spirit, and Impoſition of Hands is to ceaſe, when the extraordinary and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Contingencies of it are gone, is too trifling a fancy to be put into the balance againſt ſo ſacred an Inſtitution, relying upon ſo many Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. He argues yet further, ſhewing tho the Gifts of Tongues, and outward Miracles, remain not with the Church, yet the greater, or more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Gifts of the Spirit do continue, <hi>viz. Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and Power, Fortitude and Faith, Hope and Love,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theſe are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Miracles of Grace, to throw down the pride of</hi> Lucifer, <hi>to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59587:47"/>
tread on the great Dragon, and to triumph over our ſpiritual Enemies, to cure a diſeaſed Soul, to be unharmed by the poiſon of Temptation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This is more than to receive the Spirit, or a power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and ſupernatural Products in a natural Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for this is from a ſupernatural Principle, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſupernatural Aids to a ſupernatural End, in the Diviner ſpirit of a Man; and this being more mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous than the other, it ought not to be pretended that the diſcontinuance of extraordinary Miracles ſhould cauſe the diſcontinuance of an ordinary Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this is that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which I was to prove.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He proceeds to other Reaſons, but I think he has ſaid enough; and therefore I ſhall return to Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> p. 48. who labours againſt the ſtream, and would make us believe that the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. are the ſame; which muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, ſince ſeveral Reaſons have been given to the contrary, that have not in the leaſt been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. That <hi>Timothy</hi> had Hands laid upon him twice, tis evident; <hi>i. e.</hi> ſoon after his Baptiſm, and when ordained to Office. One good reaſon for it is given by Mr. <hi>Blackwood: Paul</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſpeaks of ſuch Gifts, as were given by the Laying on of his own Hands, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; but the Impoſition in Ordination was by the Hands of the Elderſhip,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.14. <hi>where the Greek words are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſignifying a conjunction of Perſons; but</hi> 2 Tim. 1.6. <hi>is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to denote the act of one Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And doubtleſs ſuch an Expoſition as Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> gives, too much reflects on the Apoſtle, who hated nothing more than Pride and Arrogancy: Surely he would not have appropriated to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59587:48"/>
alone, what was done by others as well as himſelf.</p>
               <p>But again, I am perſwaded our Brethren are ſenſible of what has been ſaid in reſpect of thoſe Gifts <hi>Timothy</hi> received through Layings on of Hands, which have been ſhewed by ſeveral to be different, (one only relating to his Office, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Power committed to him; the other to ſuch Gifts as are proper to all the Saints) tho they take no notice of it.</p>
               <p>I am loth to ſay, that all that Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> has done in his ſmall Tract, has been to darken Counſel with words without knowledg; yet one would admire to conſider how confuſedly he hath writ on this Subject, who ſeems to blame us for being ſo poſitive as to what Laying on of Hands is intended in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. which is, as if a Maſter ſhould blame his Scholar for affirming A is A, and B is B: Surely if we have not perfectly learned our firſt Leſſon, or Rudiments of our Profeſſion, we ſhall never be good Tutors of others: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle blames the <hi>Hebrews, ch.</hi> 5.22. for being ſuch ill Proficients, that they had gone no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and you ſeem to blame us for going ſo far, as to affirm poſitively what are the firſt Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt. But give me leave to tell you, it is as eaſy to know what Laying on of Hands is intended <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. as what Baptiſm our Saviour refers to, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20.</p>
               <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> You may be aſſured were we at a loſs in the caſe, we ſhould never come to learn of you; for Mr. <hi>D.</hi> by his own grant, <hi>pag.</hi> 49. ſignifieth he had not <hi>attained to a certain knowledg of it, nor was able to be poſitive in the caſe; many
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59587:48"/>
things being hard and difficult to be underſtood, which thoſe that are ignorant, wreſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No marvel if ignorant Men are at a loſs, and captivated in their underſtandings, abuſing and wreſting thoſe myſterious places, or things contained in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, when Men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg ſhall loſe themſelves in ſuch a plain and eaſy path, I knew a Man (may be learned too) who a while ago, knew not but that Baptiſm, and Laying on of hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. might intend thoſe legal Waſhings, and Laying on of Hands upon the heads of Bullocks, ſacrificed in the time of the Law. I am glad to find other Oppoſers of this Truth of another Judgment. Would Men deny themſelves, and not truſt their own underſtandings, they might ſoon ſee the way plain before them, that thoſe firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Oracles of God, called Milk for Babes, and not ſtrong Meat, are none of thoſe things ſpoken of by <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſince</hi> Mr. <hi>D.</hi> ſays, <hi>he will not leave us in the dark,</hi> but reſolves to <hi>give us his apprehenſion of this Text, in which he thinks he has the mind of Chriſt,</hi> pag. 49, 50. we will proceed.</p>
               <p>Yet this let me premiſe, that what he has laid down as his Judgment on this Text, Mr. <hi>Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon</hi> has very well anſwered in a Treatiſe lately printed, <hi>pag.</hi> 22, 23. and ſhewed the ridiculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch an Expoſition. I fear Mr. <hi>D.</hi> did not implore the Throne of Grace for Light and Direction before he begun to write on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he is ſo much beclouded as to the meaning of this Scripture. He conceives, <hi>that the ſix
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59587:49"/>
Principles mentioned here, are very comprehenſive, and may take in the ten Commandments, the Lord's Supper, and ſeveral other things:</hi> Nay he ſays, <hi>that Repentance and Faith may comprehend all, both the negative and poſitive part of Holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If the whole of Religion, or Doctrine of Godlineſs is comprehended in theſe ſix Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, why ſhould the Apoſtle call them firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples? 'tis improper to call thoſe the firſt that comprehend all: by this Argument, when the Foundation is laid, the whole Building is finiſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And if the whole of Piety, or Holineſs, be included in the two firſt Principles, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Faith, there was no need to enumerate any more: Nay, by this Argument, obedience to Chriſt in Baptiſm, and Laying on of Hands, together with the belief of the Reſurrection and Eternal Judgment, are not comprehended in the negative or poſitive part of Holineſs: to what purpoſe then have we ſpent our time in writing about either of theſe Principles?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But again, as Mr. <hi>Tomlinſon</hi> minds, <hi>How could it be the weakneſs of theſe</hi> Hebrews, <hi>that they had need to be taught them again? or how could the Apoſtle ſay, he would leave them to go on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</hi> &amp;c, <hi>Surely if in theſe firſt Principles all Religion be comprehended, he would not do well to leave them; it might rather have been their perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ever to remain there,</hi> viz. <hi>in preaching, ſtudying and practiſing of them, and go no further; or if we muſt needs leave them, we muſt leave all Religion and Holineſs, and ſo turn Ranters, Atheiſts, or Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. But, if the whole Body of Religion and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59587:49"/>
Holineſs is comprehended in theſe ſix Principles, then no Chriſtian had gone further; nay, nor perfectly learned the <hi>A B C</hi> of his Profeſſion, and we muſt always be learning them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo ever be but Babes in Chriſt: and no reaſon had the Apoſtle to blame the <hi>Hebrews</hi> that they had gone no further, ſince in thoſe beginning Principles were comprehended the whole of their Duty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And ſince theſe Principles are in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's ſenſe to be looked upon as Milk, and for Babes; what then is the Meat? and who are the ſtrong Men? Surely when we have done with our Milk, the Feaſt is ended; and there is no after-Diſh, to ſpeak according to the nature of this Metaphor.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>P.</hi> 45. as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> would have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith to comprehend both the negative and poſitive part of Holineſs; ſo he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to tell us how comprehenſive Laying on of hands is; <hi>That it takes in all ſorts that are ſpoken of,</hi> viz. <hi>Miracles, Healings, and Gifts, that were for the Confirmation of the Goſpel, and the Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Church-Officers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is as true as the former, and as good Divinity every whit; and when he has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered our Arguments againſt this ſtrange Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, we will argue that Point further. But doth he not hereby make Laying on of hands for miraculous Healing a perpetual Adminiſtration, it being a part (in his ſenſe) of the Foundation of God's Houſe? We have ſhewed why it cannot intend that on Sick Perſons, nor on Officers of the Church; and as to extraordinary Gifts for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59587:50"/>
Confirmation of the Goſpel, if he mean that ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. and 19.6. we utterly deny it, and clearly prove the contrary, that it was not the end of that Service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no more than of Aſſembling together, Prayer, Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince ſuch Miraculous Effects followed more or leſs every one of thoſe, and other Goſpel-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, as well as Laying on of hands on bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Believers. This conſidered, 'tis ſtrange he ſhould reaſon after this manner.</p>
               <p>But we further ſay, there is but one Laying on of hands intended in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. becauſe 'tis expreſt in the ſingular number, <hi>Laying on of hands,</hi> and not Layings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſaith <hi>This is a meer Criticiſm,</hi> and hath nothing of truth in it. He affirms that <hi>Laying on of hands, is as plural as Baptiſm.</hi> This is all the Anſwer he gives; ſee <hi>page</hi> 51.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If a bare Affirmation may be taken for a Proof in this, we are anſwered, and Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> has done his buſineſs; what is here more? I deſire to know how he would write were he to diſtinguiſh between one Hand and ſeveral, ſince Hands are in the Plural Number? The Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator is not to lay one only, but both his Hands: there can be no diſtinguiſhing (if this Man is not miſtaken) between one and divers kinds; for wherever the Scripture ſpeaks but of one ſort (in our Opponents judgment) 'tis expreſs, as it is here, <hi>viz.</hi> Laying on of hands, and ſo as plural: ſee 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. I need not ſay more, only cite a Paſſage of a Learned Writer upon this very Place, and Objection; <hi>'Tis moſt palpably apparent</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſuch as are not aſleep in their reading
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59587:50"/>
of that Text,</hi> Heb. 6.1, 2. <hi>that it ſpeaks in the ſingular Number, of one Laying on of hands alone, and not of Laying on of hands, as it muſt have been expreſt, had he meant more kinds of Impoſition of hands than one: for tho Hands be the Plural Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 'yet</hi> [note] Laying, <hi>which is the Phraſe you ſpeak to, or elſe you ſpeak</hi> nihil ad Rhombum, <hi>is a Subſtantive of the Singular Number, both in the Engliſh and the Greek.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed: Mr. <hi>D. p.</hi> 51, 52. gives us the ground of his Offence concerning the nature or manner of our maintaining this Principle of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Negatively, he tells us wherein his offence lies not, <hi>viz. Not becauſe we pray for a bleſſing on our Brethren and Siſters, or for the practice or geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Lifting up, or Laying on of hands; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be not urged as of abſolute neceſſity,</hi> &amp;c. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When impoſed as an Inſtitution of Chriſt, a beginning Doctrine, or Oracle of God, a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Chriſtian Religion, to which every Diſciple of Chriſt ought to ſubmit on penalty of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communion, for rejecting a Fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, tho not one word of Inſtitution, Command, Precept, or Example for the ſame; and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of receiving more of the Spirit of Chriſt thereby, which is a Spirit of Love, Meekneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There appears the Spirit of uncharitableneſs, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. rending, and dividing the Body of Chriſt, and for aſſerting for Doctrine and Practice, the Cuſtoms and Commands of Men: it is for theſe things our Offences lie ſo well founded upon</hi> Deut. 4.2. and 12.23. Rev. 22.18. Prov. 30.6.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59587:51"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Could we have ſuch a liberty as to make a holy Inſtitution of Chriſt only a formal or civil Ceremony or Geſture, or a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, to do, or not do; our Brethren, it ſeems, would not be offended.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Were it a true Charge he brings, he would have cauſe to be offended with us; but whether it be a Principle of the Doctrine of Chriſt, and an Oracle of God, or a Tradition of Men, which we contend for, let the impartial Reader judg. Here is nothing offered by our Opponent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any further Anſwer; it calls more for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion than Confutation. Who ſeemed more cenſorious than Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> who charged his Brethren with what they moſt abominated, <hi>viz.</hi> tearing and dividing the Body of Chriſt, Will-worſhip, nay being under the dreadful Curſe of Adding to the Word of God?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether we are guilty of Schiſm, rending and tearing the Body of Chriſt, or thoſe who neglect his Words, or Foundation-Principle of his Doctrine (I might ſay reject it) is fully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in a late Book Intituled, <hi>The Searchers for Schiſm ſearched,</hi> that has not yet been anſwered.</p>
               <p n="4">4. May not the <hi>Independents</hi> and others charge you on the account of Baptiſm, with rending and tearing the Body of Chriſt, ſince you deny Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread with them, on that Conſideration as ſome do with you about Laying on of hands, a Principle of the ſame nature? Doth not Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> in his Anſwer to your former Book of Baptiſm, charge you in much like words, as you do us here? And truly, if I miſtake not, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> has cleared us from Schiſm, and well anſwered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59587:51"/>
in his late Reply, Page 169, 170, 171. as he ſays of Baptiſm:<note rend="inter">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> D<hi>'s</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and Truth vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</note> 
                  <hi>Suffer me to ſpeak of Laying on of hands; There is nothing in the Principle it ſelf but what inclines to Piety and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity: It being deſigned by Chriſt not only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Sanctification, but to further Love and Peace, in the way of Righteouſneſs and Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why ſhould Baptiſm be eſteemed the whole and only Inlet into the viſible Church, when 'tis but one of the Six Fundamental Principles of Church-Conſtitution? Why ſhould he have a greater eſteem for one than for another Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Did our Brethren ſee Laying on of hands to be an Ordinance of the ſame nature with Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, I might hope they would not be of the mind ſome are of: 'tis ſad when a Fundamental Principle of Chriſtian Religion ſhall be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. I have a tender reſpect to all that love Chriſt, yet dare not violate that Holy Order left in his Word, knowing how ſeverely he has manifeſted his diſpleaſure againſt ſuch as have been negligent therein.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now tho we grant Baptiſm an Initiating Ordinance, yet not that alone. <hi>There are two Doors to be paſſed through,</hi> (ſaith a Learned Writer) <hi>before we can come</hi> ad adyta &amp; intima Eccleſiae penetralia, <hi>viz. Baptiſm, and Laying on of hands: whereof the latter properly and immediately gives admittance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hanmer, p.</hi> 22. cites ſome antient Chriſtians ſpeaking thus: <hi>Confirmatione protinus data plena authoritas, &amp; jus Corpori Chriſti &amp; ſanguini cum omnibus Fid<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

(or Impoſition of hands) forthwith gives full authority and right of Communion in the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> And in another place ſaith the ſame Perſon; <hi>He that was not confirmed, was not admitted to the Euchariſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doubtleſs if the Church of <hi>Judea,</hi> firſt planted in the order of the Goſpel, is to be followed, or if that which was the practice of ſome of the Churches, was alſo of every Church, then both theſe Ordinances, as well as the other beginning Principles, muſt precede, or are prerequiſite to Church-Communion and Fellowſhip.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But doth not this ſtraiten and narrow the Interest of Jeſus Christ?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi>'s Reply to Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> about Baptiſm, is a very good anſwer: <hi>viz. This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is no other than Reformation in all Ages (ſince the Antichriſtian defection) hath been charged with, and particularly that Reformation that has been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in that other Ordinance of the Lord's Supper; therefore the</hi> Presbyterians <hi>cry out againſt the</hi> Independents <hi>for ſinful Schiſm, Fomentèrs of Faction, and narrowing of Chriſt's Intereſt, in their reſpective Separations, and Church-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The ſame do the</hi> Prelats <hi>ſay to the</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians; <hi>and the very ſame do the</hi> Papiſts <hi>ſay to the</hi> Epiſcoparians.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>D.</hi> in the work of Reformation excels, or has more light than ſuch he ſpeaks of, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Church-Conſtitution and Communion, and reſolves to purſue his work, tho he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd on this account; why ſhould he blame us, who, according to our light, labour after a pure and perfect Reformation? or doth he judg
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59587:52"/>
he has got to ſuch a degree of knowledg, that he is perfect, and needs no more light nor inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the laſt Stone of Reformation and Reſtoration here is laid, becauſe Baptiſm ſhines forth in its primitive purity? Remember him who ſaid (ſuch was his Humility) <hi>What I know not, teach thou me.</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> tho mighty in the Scriptures, could ſtoop to the Counſel and Inſtruction of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> tho much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to him, <hi>who taught him the way of God more perfectly,</hi> Act. 18.26.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Ought not we to <hi>ſtand faſt, and hold the Traditions we have been taught?</hi> and is not this worthy of Commendation? what ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Now I praiſe you Brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as they were delivered unto you.</hi> And are we not commanded <hi>to withdraw from every Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that walks diſorderly, and not after the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions we have received?</hi> Beſides, can we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably have Communion with ſuch as oppoſe a Command of God, nay, that make it but a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Men, and an Antichriſtian Innovation? And as in all Fundamentals of Salvation, ſo in thoſe of Church-Conſtitution, we ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, before we can orderly ſit down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But to ſay no more, I would caution all our Brethren to take heed what they affirm on this account, I mean concerning us, and this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Inſtitution, ſince they ſeem ſo cloudy in their underſtanding about thoſe Scriptures urged as the great Warranty for our Practice: If God has hid (for reaſons beſt known to himſelf) this
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59587:53"/>
Truth of Impoſition of hands from their eyes, as he hath the holy Ordinance of Baptiſm from the <hi>Independents,</hi> &amp;c. it will be their wiſdom to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Reflections; let them not be angry, leſt it be found to be a Truth of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently prove offended at Chriſt himſelf, who left this as well as Baptiſm amongſt the beginning-principles of his Doctrine. Why ſhould they be offended at us for having an equal love to all the Commandments of Chriſt? I would hope they have reaſon to judg, 'tis from hence we ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly contend with them on this account.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I cannot but marvel, that our Brethren ſhould call Laying on of hands, a Doctrine, or Tradition of Men, and render thoſe who plead for it, guilty of adding to the Word of God; and yet receive ſuch into Communion at the Lord's Table, as are in the practice of it. What uncharitable thoughts do they retain of their Brethren? and what guilt, on this Conſideration, do they bring on their own Souls?</p>
               <p>But let me cloſe with one Caution more; ſince they know 'tis as ſinful every way to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh from God's Word as to alter or add to it, let them take heed leſt they be found guilty therein.</p>
               <p>We have now traced Mr. <hi>D.</hi> quite through, and have little more to do: In <hi>page</hi> 53. he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to remove an Objection brought againſt him from <hi>Antiquity</hi>; and ſince he has fairly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, take it in his own words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the point of Antiquity, tho 'tis granted the Antients, and their Followers ever ſince, have er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not only in the Subject, but in divers Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59587:53"/>
about this Rite of Impoſition of hands, yet in-as-much as there has been all along ſuch a witneſs born to the thing it ſelf, it makes for its Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calneſs, and confirms our Practice therein.</hi> Now take his Anſwer to it: <hi>It doth not appear</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ſuch a Witneſs hath been born all along there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>ingenuouſly acknowledges that</hi> Juſtin Martyr, Ireneus, <hi>and others in thoſe times are ſilent about it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thoſe Authorities that are pretended to aſſert the ſame in the firſt Centuries, have been proved to be ſpurious and ſuppoſititious.</hi> 2ly. <hi>That pretence of antient Preſcription, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Word of God to warrant it, can never juſtify the Divine Authority of any Practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We fully agree with him, <hi>viz.</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is found in antient Preſcriptions concerning this, or any Practice, ſignifies nothing, if God's Word doth not witneſs to it: But having ſuch evident proof from God's Word to warrant this Precept, we never judged it worth while to ſearch into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Authors concerning it; neither ſhould we have cited any now, had we not been forc'd by our Oppoſers. And as to what he ſays concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s ingenuous Confeſſion, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Ireneus</hi> are both ſilent about it, it ſignifies very little; for firſt, we have nothing but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>ſay-ſo</hi> for it, who may be has overlook'd ſome places of theſe Authors, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably not met with all their Works. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Since their Silence only is pretended, it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries no great force with it; muſt we of neceſſity produce all the Antients expreſly witneſſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or elſe is all nothing that is brought from Antiquity in the Caſe? We have mentioned ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59587:54"/>
antient Witneſſes, and ſome of the 2d and 3d Centuries, which are neither ſpurious, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſititious, ſuborn'd Witneſſes, nor Knights of the Poſt, tho Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is pleaſed ſo to call them.</p>
               <p>And now to conclude, we muſt ſay again, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what is mention'd, <hi>p.</hi> 54. that there is a clearer Precept for Impoſition of hands on baptized Believers as ſuch, than can be urged for that on Church-Officers, or the obſervation of the firſt Day of the Week, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ground to conclude Mr. <hi>D.</hi> thinks it his duty to keep holy the firſt Day of the Week, as the Chriſtian Sabbath.</p>
               <p>We gave Mr. <hi>D.</hi> no ground to ſay that which he did of us, <hi>viz. Reproach the Wiſdom of Christ, and ſlight the Authority of the Holy Scriptures, as tho we had not a ſufficient Direction therein in all parts of God's Worſhip.</hi> God forbid we ſhould be guilty of ſuch things! <hi>Rome</hi> and others may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in juſtly be charged; but our Souls witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it as an abominable Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>And that remarkable Expreſſion of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s, as Mr. D. calls it, we can with all readineſs and ſimplicity cloſe in with; and judg it neceſſary once more to recite it, <hi>viz. This then they who hold Communion with Chriſt, are careful of, they will admit nothing, practiſe nothing in the Worſhip of God, private or publick, but what they have his Warrant for: for unleſs it comes in his Name, with</hi> Thus ſaith the Lord Jeſus, <hi>they will not hear an Angel from Heaven; they know the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were to teach the Saints only what Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them.</hi> Communion with God, <hi>p.</hi> 171.</p>
               <p>The Doctor's Rule is ever to be followed, the

Lord open his eyes; for how doth this clearly overthrow all his Arguments for Infant-Baptiſm? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what injury doth it do us, who can ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord Jeſus?</hi> 'tis left on record a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the firſt Principles of his Doctrine, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. 'tis a Command of God, if the Oracles of God be his Command, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. which ſure none will deny; ſince the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> (a Man full of the Holy Spirit) affirm them ſo to be. We believe what the Doctor ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Apoſtles were to teach nothing but what Chriſt commanded them, to whom they were obedient therein: and ſurely then all may ſee a Divine Inſtitution for this Practice; for was it not taught to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Church? <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. And did not <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> teach it to the Saints at <hi>Samaria?</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> to the Diſciples at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and to <hi>Timothy?</hi> yea, and made them obedient thereto? <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17. &amp; 19.6. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.</p>

               <p>BEfore I conclude, I judg it neceſſary to offer two or three Motives, to ſtir up to Obedience ſuch as deſire to be found ſincere Followers of the Lord Jeſus, and of the primitive Saints, and to walk in all the Commandments of the Lord blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; and to conſider, whether they do not lie ſhort of their Duty and Privilege, whilſt they omit or neglect this precious (tho deſpiſed) Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Impoſition of Hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 1. Brethren, Conſider, you have the holy Pattern of the Saints of old to ſtir you up to a diligent ſearch in the Book of God's Law, to find out what his Mind and Will may be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you. How glad were the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when upon enquiry they found out that long-neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Ordinance of ſitting in Booths in the Feaſt of Tabernacles? <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.14,—17. they did not then contend againſt it, or raiſe Objections, ſaying it has not been done for many years: <hi>Samuel, David, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> did it not, who had glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59587:55"/>
Light, and were great Reformers; and we have no immediate Viſion, or miraculous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of God to revive this Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>We find nothing of this nature ſtumbled them, but as they found it written, they ſet about the Work, <hi>and there was great Joy</hi>: They were not like many Souls in our days, who make Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt Baptiſm and Laying on of hands; ſuch and ſuch eminent Men (ſay they) ſee it not, practiſe it not; 'tis not an Inſtitution of Chriſt; if it were, ſure Mr. ſuch a one (a learned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Brother) would be for it; he is a Man of greater light and underſtanding than you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis no marvel they are thus beclouded, whilſt their eyes are ſo fixt on Men; and inſtead of walking by the perfect Light of God's Word, walk by the Light of thoſe that are ſo imperfect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 2. Conſider that by a univerſal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt, you will appear to be his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples indeed, and of the Remnant of the Woman's Seed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.17. Yea you will enter into ſtrong bands of Alliance and Friendſtip with the Lord Jeſus: <hi>You are my Friends</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if you do whatſoever I command you, Joh.</hi> 15.14. This alſo will add boldneſs to the Saints. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>when I have reſpect to all thy Commandments.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mot.</hi> 3. Let the Nature of the Ordinance move you to conſider your fault and neglect herein; and as you deſire that the Church you have given up your ſelves to walk in the order of the Goſpel with, being knit and fitly framed together, may grow into a Holy Temple in the Lord. Be ſure ſee there is no defect in the Foundation, take heed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59587:56"/>
it wants not one principal Pillar; and let none ſpeak ſlightingly of this Inſtitution, leſt he provoke Jeſus Chriſt thereby. Did he command any thing in vain? And by the ſame Argument you adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to caſt off this Principle, another may do ſo by Baptiſm, and conſequently all the reſt; and ſo in time God's Spiritual Houſe be like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the literal Temple, <hi>viz.</hi> not have one Stone left upon another which will not be thrown down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 4. Conſider that thoſe bleſſed Promiſes God has made of giving the Comforter, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, <hi>which the World cannot receive,</hi> are entailed to the obedient Soul; if we will have the Bleſſing, we muſt be found in our Duty. And how has God crowned this Service, as has been ſhewed, with wonderful manifeſtations thereof? Nay, conſider what meaſure ſoever God has given thee of his Spirit, by waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in other Ordinances; yet this of Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands Chriſt has appointed as the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi> thereof to baptized Believers as ſuch: to every particular Inſtitution there is ſome ſpecial and peculiar Bleſſing annexed; and 'tis ordained as God's ordinary way for the conveyance of it, as I might largely ſhew, in reſpect of Preaching the Word, Baptiſm, the Lord's Supper, Church-Cenſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the like alſo in this of Laying on of hands: and tho God is not tied to this or that Ordinance, yet he hath tied us to the exact obſervation of them: He may anticipate his own Order, and give us the Mercy promiſed (in part) in ſome other way; yet we ought not to neglect our Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:59587:56"/>Becauſe I have obtained Faith in ſome other than God's uſual way for the begetting it, ſhall I not hear the Word preached, for the further increaſing it in my Heart? Again, becauſe I have remiſſion of Sins, and other Bleſſings promiſed in Baptiſm before baptized, ſhall I reject that Ordinance? Sure <hi>Cornelius</hi> did not do ſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 45, 47. And again, I feed by Faith on Jeſus Chriſt, and receive his Fleſh which is Meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and his Blood which is Drink indeed; ſhall I therefore refuſe the Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, which is appointed as the Miniſtry of his Body and Blood? God forbid. Even ſo, let none neglect this Appointment, nothwithſtanding any Gift, or Meaſure of the Holy Spirit they have received, ſince it has pleaſed God to direct to it, and left it in his Houſe as a perpetual Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration; <hi>Deſtroy it not, for a Bleſſing that is in it,</hi> Iſa. 65.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 5. Conſider the great need thou haſt of the Holy Spirit, yea and of a further increaſe thereof, tho I ſhould grant thou haſt received it already; for without it none can ſavingly believe, nor call Jeſus Lord. Yet there is a further Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to thee, as thou art a Believer in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: and what can a poor Saint do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit? what Temptations doſt thou meet with, what Luſts and Corruptions ſtill haſt thou to mortify? and what outward Tribulations art thou (who profeſſeſt the Goſpel) expoſed to? O therefore uſe all means, and particularly this, which God injoins thee, that thou mayſt obtain a further meaſure and increaſe of the Spirit of God.</p>

                  <p>REider, Thou haſt had a faithful, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Account of the riſe, growth, and progreſs, of this holy, tho contemned Ordinance of Impoſition of hands, from the beginning of the Goſpel-Miniſtration to this day; and how aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted amongſt many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, with the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities on which it has been enjoined; together with the grounds given by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and Modern Writers to juſtify it: And from the whole we alſo may come to theſe following Concluſions; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there appears full and ample Precept and Practice from Scripture for this Ordinance of Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands on all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Believers as ſuch, before admitted to the Lord's Table.</p>

                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:59587:58"/>2. That the Inſtances to prove it an Apoſtolical Tradition or Inſtitution, are the pious Sayings, and written Verities of Chriſt's Diſciples.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Authorities by which it was at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, were none elſe ſave Great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That many eminent Writers both antient and modern, have born wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for it.</p>
                  <p>All which is worthy to be minded, and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the conſideration of thoſe who having rejected Infants, and imbraced Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Baptiſm, do op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Principle of the ſame nature, and annexed to it, with theſe following Obſervations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is moſt manifeſt that thoſe Popes, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and Fathers, that have corrupted, polluted, and changed the holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper, did alſo change, alter, and corrupt this of Impoſition of Hands.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That tho the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Arguments the Church
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59587:59"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and others who have drunk of the Whore's Cup, do bring to defend the Rite called Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is humane Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and far-fetch'd Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from Scripture, yet there is plain Scripture-proof for the holy Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Impoſition of hands upon baptized Believers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That many godly Perſons in ſeveral ages have oppoſed Popiſh laying on of hands, on the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that we reject Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Baptiſm, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

That which is an Oracle of God, is a Command of God; but <hi>Laying on of Hands,</hi> &amp;c. is an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God, <hi>Ergo.</hi> And as to Examples, we have them alſo: ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and <hi>Acts</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> Becauſe (they ſay) they believe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Lord nor his Diſciples were under it, <hi>pag.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Our Lord, we have ſhewed, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it; the Father laid his Hands upon him when he came out of the Water, and thereby ſealed him; the Holy Ghoſt in the likeneſs of a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59587:60"/>
Dove reſted upon him: And no doubt but our Lord <hi>laid his Hands</hi> upon his Diſciples, ſince he taught this Precept as a Principle of his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. True, we read not of their Baptiſm, nor of this neither; therefore from thence they may as well ſay they were not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, as that they had not Hands laid upon them.</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> Becauſe (ſay they) if the Apoſtles were under it, they muſt have an Adminiſtrator; and who, ſay they, ſhould that be? <hi>p.</hi> 4. But there is nothing ſaid of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Our Lord Chriſt might be the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator, who is the <hi>great Shepherd and Biſhop of our Souls,</hi> as I ſaid afore.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And it no more follows that they were not baptized, than that they were not under <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands; i. e.</hi> becauſe there is nothing ſaid of either.</p>
            <p>4<hi>ly.</hi> Their <hi>fourth Reaſon</hi> is the ſame with their firſt.</p>
            <p>5<hi>ly.</hi> Their <hi>fifth Reaſon</hi> is, becauſe, they ſay, the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not under it, <hi>pag.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Was not the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Church the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Now they, 'tis evident, were under it, or had laid it: <hi>Not laying again</hi> preſuppoſeth they had once <hi>laid it,</hi> or were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, as well as Baptized.</p>
            <p>6<hi>ly.</hi> Their <hi>ſixth Reaſon</hi> is, becauſe an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance neceſſary to Church-Communion ought very plainly to be expreſſed, <hi>p.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:59587:60"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> So is this of Impoſition of Hands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6.</p>
            <p>7<hi>ly.</hi> Becauſe, they ſay, our Lord did leave no Ordinance as abſolutely neceſſary to Church-Communion, but ſuch as holds forth his Death and Reſurrection, <hi>p.</hi> 9. as Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who told them ſo? or doth it follow that becauſe Baptiſm and the Supper are Figures of our Lord's Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore this muſt be a figure of the ſame, or no Ordinance? This is not argumentative nor demonſtrative.</p>
            <p>8<hi>ly.</hi> Becauſe Salvation is promiſed on the Terms of Faith, Repentance, and Baptiſm; and from hence they argue there is no need of any ſuch Ordinance as this of <hi>Laying on of Hands,</hi> p. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Salvation is promiſed particularly to Faith; <hi>He that believeth hath the Son, —hath Life,</hi> and <hi>ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16.16. therefore need not I be baptized? Moreover, I deny that any Ordinance gives a right to Salvation, any other ways than as it is an evidence of that Right or Title to our Conſciences. Our Right or Title is Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, or his active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Obedience only. But ſhould a Man be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that Laying on of Hands, Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, Order, and Diſcipline, or giving to the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were Duties which he omitted, would his pretended Faith, Repentance, and Baptiſm, render him a ſincere Chriſtian? No, he muſt do all things Chriſt commanded, or taught to be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59587:61"/>
done, which he is convinced of, as well as thoſe three things.</p>
            <p>9<hi>ly.</hi> Their <hi>ninth Reaſon</hi> againſt Laying on of Hands, is taken from thoſe Effects that followed this Ordinance, <hi>viz.</hi> the extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſame Effects followed all other Goſpel-Ordinances: this we have alſo anſwered in the precedent Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>10<hi>ly.</hi> Their <hi>tenth Reaſon</hi> is, becauſe the Holy Spirit was ſometimes given without <hi>Laying on of Hands,</hi> pag. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Holy Spirit is promiſed to them that are baptized; but becauſe ſome received the Spirit before baptized, needed they not be baptized? In <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. <hi>Cornelius</hi> received the Spirit, to confirm the Miniſtration of the Word to the Gentiles before baptized, yet was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be baptized; nor had he ſo much of the Spirit as to need no more; and therefore came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Ordinance alſo. Beſides, becauſe God may ſtep out of his uſual way, muſt we do ſo too? No ſure.</p>
            <p>11<hi>ly.</hi> Their <hi>eleventh Reaſon</hi> is, becauſe none but ſuch Perſons as were eminently gifted did impoſe Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Apoſtles did all they did as eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifted: but if they are not to be followed by all regular Paſtors, or Elders (only ordinarily gifted) in Laying on of hands, then not in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Baptizing, nor in the Adminiſtration of any
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59587:61"/>
other Goſpel-Ordinance: but this is alſo fully anſwered in the preceding Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 17, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they would make the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conclude that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> being ſaid to be dull of Hearing, and ſo needed to be taught again the firſt Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, doth not refer to theſe ſix Principles, but to Matters relating to the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis true, the Apoſtle was about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them into higher Myſteries, <hi>viz.</hi> about Chriſt's Prieſthood; but he found them to have <hi>need of Milk, and not ſtrong Meat:</hi> And moſt evident it is, that by ſtrong Meat he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the things which he proceeds to inſtruct them in; but the Milk he ſpeaks of are theſe things, <hi>viz. Repentance, Faith, Baptiſm, and Laying on of Hands,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>They hardly underſtood the firſt Rudiments or <hi>A B C</hi> of the Chriſtian Faith: but to ſuppoſe that Milk, or thoſe firſt Principles he ſpeaks of, is the ſtrong Meat, is prepoſterous. True, Chriſt is properly the Foundation; but by the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation here is meant thoſe firſt Principles which every Babe in Chriſt was to be inſtructed in, and to practiſe, and then to go on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>Doth it follow, becauſe 'tis ſaid, <hi>not laying again the Foundation of Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. that the Apoſtle only refers to Chriſt, who is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Salvation, and of every Principle of the Chriſtian Religion? Evident it is that the <hi>firſt Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt</hi> are here
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59587:62"/>
called the Foundation-principles, not that they are all Fundamentals of Salvation, but of Church-conſtitution: for we will not ſay (nor any elſe we hope) that none can be ſaved who are not baptized, and come not under Laying on of Hands; yet every true regular Church, and regular Member, ought to be under the practice of both thoſe Principles.</p>
            <p>But I ſee no need to add any thing further in anſwer to this Treatiſe, it ſeeming to me to have the leaſt of Argument in it of any Book I have ſeen writ againſt this Ordinance.</p>

            <p>NOw tho I am fully eſtabliſhed in this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt's Doctrine, and do believe it is of the ſame nature with Baptiſm, yet I am not of the opinion that ſuch Members in a Church, who are convinced of it, and are under it, ought to ſeparate themſelves from the Church, becauſe the other Members of the ſaid Church ſee it not: no, but they ought to bear one with another, until God ſhall pleaſe to open their eyes. —<hi>We all ſee but in part, and know but in part</hi>; therefore ought to bear one with another. Yet let that Church who are of one Mind and Judgment in this matter, walk as they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and let all take heed how they ſet light by any Holy Precept and Principle of Chriſt's Doctrine, much leſs to teach Men to break the leaſt of his Commandments, or to caſt ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der contempt and reproach, who in conſcience towards God ſpeak and write according to the Light they have received in this and other Caſes. Muſt we be their Enemies for telling them the truth? Farewel.</p>
