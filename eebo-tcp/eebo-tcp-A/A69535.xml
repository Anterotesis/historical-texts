            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94077:6"/>
an excellent and worthy Work, for that time, when the Church of <hi>England</hi> made her firſt ſtep out of ſuch a miſt of Popiſh Ignorance and Superſtition, wherein it formerly was involved; yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that all humane Works do gradually arrive at their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity and perfection, and this in particular being a Work of that nature, hath already admitted ſeveral emendations ſince the firſt compiling thereof, It cannot be thought any diſparagement, or derogation either to the Work it ſelf, or to the Compilers of it, or to thoſe who have hitherto uſed it, if after more than one hundred years ſince its firſt compoſure ſuch further emendations be now made therein, as may be judged neceſſary for ſatisfying the ſcruples of a multitude of ſober perſons, who cannot at all (or very hardly) comply with the uſe of it as now it is, and may beſt ſuit with the preſent times, after ſo long an enjoyment of the glorious light of the Goſpel, and ſo happy a Reformations eſpecially conſidering that many godly and learned men, have from the beginning all along deſired the alteration of many things therein, and very many of his Majeſty's pious peaceable and loyal Subjects, after ſo long a diſcontinuance of it, are more averſe from it than heretofore; the ſatisfying of whom (as far as may be) will very much conduce to that Peace and Unity which is ſo much deſired by all good men, and ſo much endeavoured by His moſt Excellent Majeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore in purſuance of this His Majeſty's moſt gracious Commiſſion for the ſatisfying of tender Conſciences, and the procuring of Peace and Unity amongſt our ſelves, we judge meet to propoſe,</hi>

            <p>To load our Publick Forms with the private Fancies upon which we differ, is the moſt Sovereign way to perpetuate Schiſm to the Worlds end. Prayer, Confeſſion, Thankſgiving, reading

of the Scriptures, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments in the plaineſt and ſimpleſt manner were matter enough to furniſh out a ſufficient Liturgy, though nothing either of private Opinion, or of Church pomp, of Garments, or preſcribed Geſtures, of Imagery, of Muſick, of matter concerning the dead, of many ſuperfluities which creep into the Church under the name of Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency did interpoſe it ſelf. To charge Churches or Litnrgies with things unneceſſary was the firſt beginning of all Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and when ſcruple of Conſcience began to be made, or pretended, then Schiſme began to break in. If the ſpeciall Guides and Fathers of the Church would be a little ſparing of incumbring Churches with Superfluities, or not over-rigid, either in reviving obſolete Cuſtoms, or impoſing new, there would be far leſs cauſe of Schiſm, or Superſtition, and all the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence likely to enſue would be but this; they ſhould in ſo doing yield a little to the imbecility of their Inferiours, a thing which S. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have rrefuſed to doe, mean while, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever falſe or ſuſpected Opinions are made a piece of Church-Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, he that ſeparates is not the Schiſmatick; for, it is alike unlawful to make profeſſion of known or ſuſpected falſhood, as to put in practice unlawful or ſuſpected actions.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Further, we humbly deſire, that it may be ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that as our firſt Reformers out of their great wiſdome did at that time ſo compoſe the Liturgy as to win upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and to draw them into their Church-Communion, by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying as little as well they could from the Romiſh forms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in uſe; ſo whether in the preſent conſtitution and ſtate of things amongſt us we ſhould not according to the ſame rule of Prudence and Charity have our Liturgy ſo compoſed, as to gain upon the judgement and affections of all thoſe who in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantials of the Proteſtant Religion are of the ſame perſwaſions with our ſelves. In as much as a more firm union and conſent of all ſuch, as well in Woſhip as in Doctrine, would greatly ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Proteſtant Intereſt againſt all thoſe dangers and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations which our inteſtine Diviſions and Animoſities do expoſe us unto from the common Adverſary.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That the Repetitions and Reſponſals of the Clerk and People, and the alternate Reading of the Pſalms and Hymns
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94077:7"/>
with a confuſed murmure in the Congregation, whereby what is read is leſs intelligible, and therefore unedifying, may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the Miniſter being appointed for the People in all Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Services appertaining unto God, and the holy Scriptures both of the old and new Teſtament, intimating the peoples part in publick Prayer, to be only with ſilence and reverence, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thereunto, and to declare their conſent in the cloſe, by ſaying, <hi>Amon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. That in regard the Letany (though otherwiſe containing in it many holy Petitions) is ſo framed, that the Petitions, for a great part, are uttered onely by the People, which we think not to be ſo conſonant to Scripture, which makes the Miniſter the Mouth of the People to God in Prayer, the particulars thereof may be compoſed into one ſolemn Prayer to be offered by the Miniſter unto God for the People.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That there may be nothing in the Liturgy which may ſeem to countenance the obſervation of <hi>Lent,</hi> as a Religious Faſt, the Example of Chriſt's faſting forty dayes and nights being no more imitable, nor intended for the imitation of Chriſtians, than any other of his miraculous works were, or than <hi>Moſes</hi> his forty dayes Faſt was for the Jewes, and the Act of Parliament 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abſtinence from fleſh to be obſerved upon any other than a politick Conſideration, and puniſhing all thoſe who by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Teaching, Writing, or open Speech ſhall notifie, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing of fleſh is of any neceſſity for the ſaving of the ſoul, or that it is the ſervice of God otherwiſe than as other politick Laws are.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That the Religious obſervation of Saints dayes appointed to be kept as holy dayes and the Vigils thereof, without any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations (as we conceive) in Scripture, may be omitted, that if any be retained they may be called Feſtival, and not Holy dayes, nor made equal with the Lords day, nor have any peculiar Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice appointed for them, nor that the People be upon ſuch days enforced wholly to abſtain from work; and that the names of all others not inſerted in the Callendar, which are not in the firſt and ſecond Books of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, may be left out.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. That the gift of Prayer being one ſpecial qualification for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94077:7"/>
the Work of the Miniſtery beſtowed by Chriſt in order to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of his Church, and to be exerciſed for the profit and benefit thereof according to its various and emergent nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſities.</p>
            <p>It is deſired that there may be no ſuch Impoſition of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, as that the exerciſe of that gift be thereby totally excluded in any part of publick worſhip; and further, that conſidering the great age of ſome Miniſters, and the infirmities of others, and the variety of ſeveral ſervices oft time occurring upon the ſame day, whereby it may be inexpedient to require every Miniſter at all times to read the whole; it may be left to the diſcretion of the Miniſter to omit it, as occaſion ſhall require, which liberty we find to be allowed even in the firſt Common Prayer Book of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. That in regard of the many defects which have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in that Verſion of the Scriptures which is uſed throughout the Liturgy, (many fold inſtances whereof may be produced) as in the Epiſtle for the firſt Sunday after <hi>Epiphany,</hi> taken out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Be you changed in your ſhape.</hi> And the Epiſtle for the Sunday next before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> taken out of <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Found in his apparel as a man;</hi> As alſo the Epiſtle for the firſt Sunday in <hi>Lent,</hi> taken out of the fourth of the <hi>Galatians, Mount Sinai is Agar in Arabia, and bordereth upon the City which is now called Jeruſalem.</hi> The Epiſtle for Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> day being taken out of the ſecond Epiſtle of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and the fourth, <hi>We go not out of kind.</hi> The Goſpel for the ſecond Sunday after <hi>Epiphany,</hi> taken out of the ſecond of <hi>John, When men be drunk.</hi> The Goſpel for the third Sunday in <hi>Lent,</hi> taken out of the eleventh of <hi>Luke, One houſe doth fall upon another.</hi> The Goſpel for the <hi>Annunciation,</hi> taken out of the firſt of <hi>Luke, This is the ſixth month which is called Barren,</hi> and many other places; we therefore deſire inſtead thereof the Tranſlation allowed of by Authority may alone be uſed.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. That in as much as the Holy Scriptures are able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation to furniſh us thoroughly unto all good works, and contain in them all things neceſſary either in Doctrine to be believed, or in Duty to be practiſed; whereas divers Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Apocryphal Books appointed to be read, are charged to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94077:8"/>
be in both reſpects of dubious and uncertain credit: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired that nothing be read in the Church for Leſſons, but the Holy Scriptures in the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
            <p n="10">X. That the Miniſter be not required to rehearſe any part of the Liturgy at the Communion Table, ſave onely thoſe parts which properly belong to the Lords Supper, and that at ſuch time onely when the Holy Supper is adminiſtrated.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. That the word (Miniſter) and not (Prieſt) or (Curate) is uſed in the abſolution, and in divers other places; It may thoroughout the whole Book be uſed inſtead of thoſe two words, and that inſtead of the word (Sunday) the word (Lords day) may be every where uſed.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. Becauſe ſinging of Pſalms is a conſiderable part of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip, we deſire that the Verſion ſet forth and allowed to be ſung in Churches may be amended, or that we may have leave to make uſe of a purer Verſion.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. That all obſolete words in the Common Prayer, and ſuch whoſe uſe is changed from their firſt ſignificancy <hi>(as read who ſmote thee)</hi> uſed in the Goſpels for the Monday and Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday before <hi>Eaſter (Then opened be their witts)</hi> uſed in the Goſpel for <hi>Eaſter</hi> Tueſday, &amp;c. may be altered into other words generally received, and better underſtood.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. That no portions of the Old Teſtament, or the Acts of the Apoſtles be called Epiſtles; or read as ſuch.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. That whereas throughout the ſeverall offices the Phraſe is ſuch as preſumes all perſons (within the Communion of the Church) to be regenerated, converted, and in an actuall ſtate of grace, which had Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline been truly and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly executed in the excluſion of ſcandalous and obſtinate ſinners might be better ſuppoſed; But that there having been, and ſtill being a confeſſed want of that (as in the Liturgy is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged) it cannot rationally be admitted in the utmoſt latitude of Charity: we deſire that this may be reformed.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. That whereas orderly connexion of Prayers and of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94077:8"/>
Petitions and expreſſions, together with a competent length of the formes uſed, are tending much to edification, and to gain the reverence of people to them: There appears to us too great neglect of this Order, and of other Juſt Laws of method particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Collects are generally ſhort, many of them conſiſting but of one or two Sentences of petition, and thoſe generally u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherd in with a repeated mention of the Name and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, and preſently concluding with the Name and Merits of Chriſt whence are cauſed many unneceſſary inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions and abruptions, which when many Petitions are to be offered at the ſame time, are neither agreeable to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall example, nor ſuted to the gravity and ſeriouſneſs of that Holy Duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Prefaces of many Collects have not any clear and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reſpect to the following Petitions; and particular peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are put together, which have not any due order or evident connexion one with another, nor ſuitable with the occaſions upon which they are uſed, but ſeem to have fallen in rather caſually, than from any orderly codtinuance.</p>
            <p>It is deſired that inſtead of theſe various Collects, there may be one Methodicall and entire form of Prayer compoſed out of many of them.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. That whereas the Puplick Liturgy of a Church ſhould in reaſon comprehend the ſumme of all ſuch ſins as are ordinarily in Prayer by the Church to be confeſſed, and of ſuch Petitions and Thankſgiving as are ordinarily by the Church to be put up to God, and that Puplick Catechiſmes or Syſtemes of Doctrine ſhould ſummarily comprehend all ſuch Doctrines as are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to be believed, and theſe explicitely ſet down. The preſent Liturgy, as to all theſe ſeems very defective particularly:</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is no preparatory Prayer in your addreſſes to God for aſſiſtance or acceptance; yet many Collects in the midſt of the Worſhip have little or nothing elſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Confeſſion is very defective, not clearly expreſſing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94077:9"/>
Originall ſin, nor ſufficiently enumerating Actuall ſins with their aggrivations, but conſiſting only of generals, whereas Confeſſion being the exerciſe of repentance ought to be more particular.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is alſo great defect, as to ſuch Forms of publick pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and thankſgivings as are ſuitable to Goſpel-worſhip.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The whole body of the Common Prayer alſo conſiſteth very much of meer generals, as to have our prayers heard, to be kept from all evil, and from all enemies and all adverſities, that we may do Gods will without any mention of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars wherein theſe generals exiſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Catechiſm is defective as to many neceſſary Doctrines of our religion, ſome even of the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity not mentioned, except in the Creed, and there not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite as ought to be in the Catechiſm.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. Becauſe this Liturgy containeth the impoſition of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Ceremonies, which from the firſt Reformation have by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Learned and pious men been judged unwarrantable: as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That publick Worſhip may not be celebrated by any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter that dares not wear a Surplice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That none may Baptiſe, or be Baptiſed without the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Image of the Croſs, which hath at leaſt the ſemblance of a Sacrament of humane inſtitution, being uſed as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging ſign in our firſt and ſolemn Covenanting with Chriſt, and the Duties whereunto we are really obliged by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, being more expreſly affixed to that Aery fign than to the holy Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That none may receive the Lords Supper that dares not kneel in the act of receiving, but the Miniſter muſt exclude all ſuch from the Communion, although ſuch kneeling not only differs from the practice of Chriſt and of his Apoſtles; but (at leaſt on the Lords daies) is contrry to the practice of the Catholick Church for many hundred years after, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94077:9"/>
forbid by the moſt venerable Councila that ever were in the Chriſtian world. All which Impoſitions are made yet more grievous by that ſubſcription to their lawfulneſs, which the Cannon exacts, and by the heavy puniſhments, upon the non obſervance of them, which the Act for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity inflicts.</p>
            <p>And it being doubtfull, whether God hath given power unto men to inſtitute in his worſhip ſuch myſticall teaching ſigns, which not being neceſſary <hi>in genere,</hi> fall not under the rule of doing all things decently, orderly, and to edification, and which once granted, will upon the ſame reaſon open a door to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Impoſition of numerous Ceremonies of which St. <hi>Aug.</hi> complained in his dayes, and the things in Controverſie being in the Judgement of the Impoſers confeſſed indifferent, who dare not ſo much as pretend any real goodneſs in themſelves, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than what is derived from their being impoſed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Impoſition ceaſing, that will ceaſe alſo, and the Worſhip of God not become indecent without them; whereas on the other hand in the Judgement of the Oppoſers, they are by ſome held ſinful and unlawful in themſelves, by others very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient and unſuitable to the ſimplicity of Goſpel-Worſhip, and by all of them very grievous and burdenſome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not at all fit to put in balance with the peace of the Church, which is more likely to be promoted by their removal than continuance, conſidering alſo how tender our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf is of weak Brethren, declaring it to be much better for a man to have a Milſtone to be hanged about his neck, and to be caſt into the depth of the Sea, than to offend one of his little ones, and how the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (who had as great a Legiſlative power in the Church as any under Chriſt) held himſelf obliged by that common rule of Charity, not to lay a ſtumbling block, or an occaſion of offence before a weak Brother, chuſing rather not to cat fleſh while the world ſtands (though in it ſelf a thing lawful) than offend his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for whom Chriſt dyed; we cannot but deſire that theſe Ceremonies may not be impoſed on them who judge ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions a violation of the Royalty of Chriſt, and an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of his Laws as inſufficient, and are under the holy Law of that which is written, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 32. <hi>VVhat thing ſoever I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94077:10"/>
command you, obſerve to do it, thou ſhalt not adde thereto, nor dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh from it;</hi> but that there may be either a total aboliſhion of them, or at leaſt ſuch a liberty, that thoſe who are unſatisfied concerning their lawfulneſs, or expedency, may not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polled to the practice of them or ſubſcription to them; but may be permitted to enjoy their Miniſterial Functions and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church without them.</p>
            <p>The rather becauſe theſe Ceremonies have for above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years been the fountain of manifold evils in this Church and Nation, occaſioning ſad Diviſions between Miniſters and Miniſters, and alſo between Miniſters and people, expoſing many orthodox, pious, and peaceable Miniſters to the diſpleaſure of their Rulers, caſting them upon the edge of the penal Statutes, to the loſs not only of their Livings and liberties, but alſo of their opportunities for the ſervice of Chriſt and his Church, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing people either to worſhip God in ſuch a manner as their own conſciences condemn, or doubt of, or elſe to forſake our Aſſemblies, as thouſands have done, and no better fruits than theſe can be lookt for from the retaining and impoſing theſe Ceremonies. unleſs we could preſume that all his Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould have the ſame ſubtilty of Judgement to diſcern even to a Ceremony how farr the Power extends in the things of God. which is not to be expected, or ſhould yeeld obedience to all the Impoſitions of men concerning them, without enquiring into the will of God, which is not to be deſired.</p>
            <p>We do therefore moſt earneſtly intreat the Right Reverend Fathers and Brethren, to whom theſe Papers are delivered, as they tender the Glory of God, the Honour of Religion, the Peace of the Church, the Service of His Majeſty in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that happy Union which his Majeſty hath ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtified his deſires of, to joyn with us in importuning His moſt Excellent Majeſty that His moſt gracious Indulgence, as to theſe Ceremonies granted in His Royall Declaration, may be comfirmed and continued to us, and our poſterities, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſuch as do not yet enjoy the benefit thereof.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. As to that Paſſage in His Majeſties Commiſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are authorized and required to compare the Preſent Liturgy with the moſt ancient Liturgy, which have been uſed in the Church in the pureſt and moſt Primitive Times; we have in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94077:10"/>
obedience to His Majeſties Commiſſion made Inquiry, but cannot find any Records of known Credit concerning any entire Forms of Liturgies within the firſt 300 years, which are confeſſed to be as the moſt Primitive, ſo the pureſt Ages of the Church; nor any Impoſition of Liturgies upon any National Church; for ſome hundred years after we find indeed Liturgical Forms fathered upon St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and St. <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> but we have not ſeen any Copies of them, but ſuch as give us ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to conclude them either wholly ſpurious, or ſo interpolat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we cannot make a Judgement what in them hath any Primitive Authority.</p>
            <p>Having thus in general expreſſed our deſire, we come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which we find numerous, and of a various nature; ſome we grant are of an inferiour conſideration, verbal rather than material, which were they not in she Publick Liturgy of ſo Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Church, we ſhould not have mentioned; others dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſputable, as not having a clear foundation in Scripture for their warrant; but ſome there be that ſeem to be corrupt, and to carry in them a repugnancy to the rule of the Goſpel, and therefore have adminiſtred juſt matter of exception and offence to many truly religious and peaceable, not of a private ſtation only, but Learned &amp; Judicious Divines, aſwel of other Reformed Churches, as of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> ever ſince the Reformation.</p>
            <p>We know much hath been ſpoken and written by way of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology in anſwer to many things that have been obiected, but yet the doubts and ſcuples of tender conſciences ſtill continue, or rather are increaſed: We do therefore humbly conceive it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Work worthy of thoſe Wonders of Salvation which God hath wrought for his Majeſty, now on the Throne, and for the whole Kingdome, and exceedingly becoming the Miniſters of the Goſpel of Peace, with all holy moderation and tenderneſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the removal of every thing out of the Worſhip of God, which may juſtly offend or grieve the ſpirits of ſober and godly people; the things themſelves that we deſire to be removed, not being of the foundation of Religion, nor the Eſſentials of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip, nor the removal of them any way tending to the prejudice of the Church or State; therefore their continuance and rigorous Impoſition can no ways be able to countervail the laying aſide of ſo many pious and able Miniſters, and the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable grief that will ariſe to multitudes of His Majeſties moſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94077:11"/>
Loyal and peaceable Subjects, who upon all accaſions are ready to ſerve him with their Prayers, Eſtates, and Lives: For the preventing of which evils, we humbly deſire that theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars following may be taken into ſerious and tender conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <head>Concerning Morning and Evening Prayer.</head>
               <p>1. Rub. <hi>That Morning and Evening Prayer ſhall be uſed in the accuſtomed place of the Church, Chancel, or Chappel, except it ſhall be otherwiſe determined by the Ordinary of the Place, and the Chancel ſhall remain as in times paſt.</hi>

                  <p>We deſire that whereas theſe words ſeem to give a greater ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy to the blood then to the Body of Chriſt, may be altered thus, That our ſinful ſouls and bodies may be cleanſed through his precious body and blood.</p>
                  <p>Prayer at the conſecration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hear us O merciful father, &amp;c. who in the ſame night that he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave it to his Diſciples, ſaying, take, eat, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:94077:13"/>
We conceive that the manner of conſecrating of the Elements is not here explicite and diſtinct enough: And the Miniſters <note place="margin">Excep.</note> breaking of the bread is not ſo much as mentioned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then ſhall the Miniſter firſt receive the Communion in both kinds,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rub.</note> &amp;c. <hi>and after deliver it to the people in their hands kneeling; and when he delivereth the bread, he ſhall ſay, The body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt which was given for thee, preſerve thy body and ſoul unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and take, and eat this in remembrance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We deſire that at the diſtribution of the Bread &amp; Wine to the Communicants we may uſe the words of our Saviour as near as <note place="margin">Excep.</note> may be, and that the Miniſter be not required to deliver the bread &amp; wine into every particular Communicants hand, and to repeat the words to eachone in the ſingular number, but that it may ſuffice to ſpeak them to divers joyntly, according to our Saviours exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. We alſo deſire that kneeling at the Sacrament (it not being the geſture which the Apoſtles uſed, though Chriſt was perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally preſent amongſt them, nor that which was uſed in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and primitive times of the Church) may be left free, as it was 1 &amp; 2 <hi>Ea.</hi> 6.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And note, That every Pariſhioner ſhall communicate, at the least, three times in the year, of which</hi> Eaſter <hi>ſhall be one; and after ſhall</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rub,</note> 
                     <hi>receive the Sacraments, and other Rites, according to the Orders in this book appointed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch as all Pariſhioners are not duely qualified for the Lords Supper; and thoſe habitually prepared, are not at all <note place="margin">Excep.</note> times actually diſpoſed, but may be hindred by the providence of God, and ſome by the diſtempers of their own ſpirits; We deſire this Rubrick may be wholly omitted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or they altered.

                  <p>And we deſire that the following Rubrick in the Common-Prayer-Book in 5 &amp; 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. eſtabliſhed by Law as much as any other part of the Common-Prayer-Book, may be reſtored for the Vindication of our Church in the matter of kneeling at the Sacrament (although the geſture be left in different) <q>(Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no order can be ſo perfectly deviſed, but it may be of ſome, either for their ignorance and infirmity, or elſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice

and obſtinacy miſconſtrued and depraved, and interpreted in a wrong part.

you give no liberty to omit the too frequent repetition of</hi> Gloria Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria, <hi>nor of the Lord's Prayer in the ſame publick Service, nor do you yield the</hi> Pſalmes <hi>be read in the new Tranſlation, nor the word</hi> Prieſt <hi>to be changed for</hi> Miniſter <hi>or</hi> Presbyter, <hi>though both have been yielded unto in the</hi> Scottiſh <hi>Liturgy; you grant not the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Reſponſals, no not in the Let any it ſelf, though the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be ſo framed, as the people make the prayer, and not the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; nor to read the Communion ſervice in the Desk, when there is no Communion, but in the late Form inſtead thereof, it is enjoyned to be done at the Table, through there be no</hi> Rubrick <hi>in the</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer <hi>book requiring it; you plead for the bolineſſe of</hi> Lent, <hi>contrary to the ſtatute; you indulge not the omiſſion of any one Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; you will force men to kneel at the Sacrament, and yet not put in that excellent</hi> Rubr. <hi>in the</hi> v. <hi>and</hi> vj. <hi>of</hi> Edw. 6. <hi>which would much conduce to the ſatisfaction of many that ſcruple it. And whereas divers Reverend Biſhops and Doctours, in a paper in Print before theſe unhappy Wars began, yielded to the laying aſide of the Croſſe, and the making many material alterations you after</hi> xx. <hi>years ſad calamities and diviſions, ſeem unwilling to grant what they of their own accord then offered; you ſeem not to grant that the clauſe of the fourth commandement in the Common Prayer book</hi> (the Lord bleſſed the ſeventh day) <hi>ſhould be altered according to the</hi> Hebr. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day; <hi>you will not change the word</hi> Sunday <hi>into the</hi> Lord<hi>'s</hi> day, <hi>nor adde any thing to make a difference between Holidaies that are of Humane Inſtitution: and the Lord's day, that is queſtionleſſe of Apoſtolicall practiſe; you will not alter</hi> Deadly Sin <hi>in the Letany into</hi> Heynous Sin, <hi>though it hints to us that ſome ſins are in their own nature Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial; nor that Anſwer in the Catech. of</hi> two Sacraments onely generally neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>although it intimates that there are New Teſtament Sacraments, though</hi> Two <hi>onely neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; you ſpeak of ſinging</hi> David<hi>'s Pſalmes, allowed by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by way of contempt calling them</hi> Hopkins <hi>Pſalmes; and though ſinging of Pſalmes be an Ordinance of God, yet you call it one of our principal parts of VVorſhip, as if it were diſclaimed by you.

And even in one of our conceſſions in which we ſuppoſe you intend to accommodate with us, you rather widen then heal the breach, for in your laſt</hi> Rubr. <hi>before the</hi> Catech <hi>you would have the words thus altered,</hi> That Children being baptized, have all things neceſſary for ſalvation, and dying before they commit any actual ſin, be undoubtedly ſaved, though they be not confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>which aſſertion, if underſtood of all Infants even of Heathen, is certainly falſe, and if only of the Infants of Chriſtians, is doubtfull and contrary to the judgment of many learned Proteſtants, and will give little ſatisfaction to us or others; ſome more we might name, which for brevity ſake we omit: All which conſidered we altogether deſpair of that happy ſucceſs which thouſands hope &amp; wait for from this his Majeſties commiſſion; unleſs God ſhall incline your hearts for the peace and union of the Nation to a more conſiderable &amp; ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory alteration of the Liturgie.

AS we hope it is no matter of offence to acknowledge his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties gracious condeſcention, ſo when his Majeſty by his Declaration hath granted us ſome liberty as to the uſe of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy before the Alteration, and hath by his Commiſſion engaged us in a conſultation for the alteration of it, we conceive our Brethren (nor the world to whoſe obſervation they appeal) had no warrant to cenſure us as unthankful to his Majeſty, becauſe of our preſent forbearance to uſe it, or part of it before the intended alteration:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94077:22"/>
At leaſt till they had heard us ſpeak for our ſelves, and render an account of the reaſons of our forbearance, and they had gone before us more exemplarily in their own obedience to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Declaration. As to our own Conſcience, if we thought not the Common-Prayer Book to be guilty of the general and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular faults which we have layd open to you, we durſt not have found fault with it; and while we took it to be a defective, diſorderly, and inconvenient Mode of Worſhip, it would be our ſin to uſe it of choice, while we may prefer a more convenient way, what ever we ought to do in caſe of neceſſity, when we muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God inconveniently, or not at all. And as to our People, for whoſe Edification, and not Deſtruction, we have our Power or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, we have taken that courſe, as far as we are able to underſtand, which moſt probably tended to their good, and to prevent their hurt and ſeparation from the Church: and conſequently that courſe which did moſt conduce to his Majeſty's Ends, and to his real Service, and the Churches Peace: none of which would be promoted by our obtruding that upon our People, which we know them unable to digeſt, or by our haſty offending them with the uſe of that, which we are forced to blame, and are endeavouring to correct and alter. And we ſee not how it can be juſtly intimated that we uſe no part of it, when we uſe the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Commandments,</hi> the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> the <hi>Chapters,</hi> and ſome other parts; And how much more you expect we ſhould have uſed, that we might have eſcaped this brand of Ingratitude, we know not. But we know that Charity ſuffereth long and thinketh no evil, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, 5.) and that we have not attempted to obtrude any mode of Worſhip on our Brethren, but deſired the liberty to uſe things of that nature as may conduce to the benefit of our Flocks: And as we leave them to judge what is moſt beneficial to their own Flocks, who know them, and are upon the place; ſo it is but the like freedome which we deſire, we are loath to hurt our People knowingly. The time is ſhort, if you will anſwer our reaſonable Propoſals, it will not be too late at the expiration of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or the date of the reformed Liturgy to uſe it: greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty hath been uſed about Liturgies in purer times of the Church, with leſs offence and accuſation.</p>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> If you look to the time paſt, by our Duties we ſuppoſe you mean our Faults; For it is not Duty when it's paſt: If you in theſe words reſpect only the time preſent and to come, we Reply, 1. The Liturgy we are aſſured will not be a leſs, but a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable means of Concord after the deſired Reformation than before; the defects and inconveniencies make it leſs fit to attain the end. 2ly. Whether the Apoſtle by ſpeaking the ſame thing did mean ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (all uſing this Liturgy of ours) or [all uſing any one form of Liturgy as to the words] may eaſily be determined. This is of much later date, unleſs you will denominate the whole form of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and ſome little parts. And thoſe that affirm, that the Apoſtles then had any other, muſt undertake the task of proving it, and excuſing the Churches for loſing and diſ-uſing ſo precious a Relict; which if preſerved would have prevented all our ſtrifes about theſe things. And in the mean time they muſt ſatisfie our Arguments for the Negative: As 1. If a Liturgy had been indited by the Apoſtles for the Churches, being by univerſal Officers inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo of univerſal uſe, it would have been uſed and preſerved by the Church as the Holy Scriptures were. But ſo it was not. <hi>Ergo</hi> no ſuch Liturgy, was indited by them for the Churches. 2ly. If a preſcript form of words had been delivered them, there would have been no ſuch need of exhorting them to ſpeak the ſame thing, for the Liturgy would have held them cloſe enough to that. And if the meaning had been (ſee that you uſe the ſame Liturgy) ſome word or other to ſome of the Churches would have acquainted us with the exiſtence of ſuch a thing, and ſome Reproofs we ſhould have found of thoſe that uſed various Liturgies, or formed Liturgies of their own, or uſed extemporary prayers: and ſome expreſs exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to uſe the ſame Liturgie or Forms: But the holy Scripture is ſilent in all thoſe matters: It is apparent therefore that the Churches then had no Liturgy, but took liberty of extemporate expreſſions, and ſpoke in the things of God, as men do in other matters, with a natural plaineſs and ſeriouſneſs, ſuiting their expreſſions to the ſubjects and occaſions. And though Diviſions began to diſturb their Peace and holy Orders, the Apoſtle
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94077:23"/>
inſtead of preſcribing them a Form of Divine Services for their Unity and Concord, do exhort them to uſe their Gifts and liberties aright, and ſpeake the ſame thing for matter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding Diſagreements, though they uſed not the ſame words. 3. <hi>Juſt. Martyr, Tertull.</hi> and others ſufficiently intimate to us, that the Churches quickly after the Apoſtles did uſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Abilities of their Paſtors in prayer, and give us no hint of any ſuch Liturgy of Apoſtolical fabrication and impoſition, and therefore doubtleſſe there was nothing, for it could not have been ſo ſoon loſt or neglected. 4. It is ordinary with thoſe of the contrary judgment, to tell us that the extraordinary Gifts of the Primitive Chriſtians, were the reaſon why there were no preſcribed forms in thoſe times, and that ſuch Liturgies came in upon the ceaſing of thoſe Gifts: And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. deſcribeth a way of publick worſhiping, unlike to preſcript forms of Liturgy: So that the matter of Fact is proved and confeſſed. And then how fairly the words of the Apoſtles, exhorting them (to ſpeake the ſame thing) are uſed to prove that he would have them uſe the ſame forms or Liturgy; we ſhall not tell you by any provoking aggravations of ſuch abuſe of Scripture. And indeed for all the miraculous Gifts of thoſe times, if preſcript forms had been judged by the Apoſtles to be the fitteſt means for the Concord of the Churches, it is moſt probable they would have preſcribed ſuch: Conſidering 1. That the ſaid miraculous Gifts were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and belonged not to all, nor to any at all times, and therefore could not ſuffice for the ordinary publick Worſhip. 2. And thoſe Gifts began even betimes to be abuſed, and need the Apoſtles Canons for their regulation, which he giveth them in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. without a preſcript Liturgy. 3. Becauſe even then diviſions had made not only an entrance, but an unhappy progreſs in the Churches, to cure which the Apoſtle exhorts them oft to Unanimity and Concord, without exhorting them to read the ſame or any Common-Prayer-book. 4. Becauſe that the Apoſtles knew that perillous times would come, in which men would have itching ears, and would have heaps of Teachers, and would be ſelf-willed, and unruly, and diviſions, and offences, and hereſies would encreaſe: And <hi>Ergo,</hi> as upon ſuch fore-ſight they indited the holy Scriptures to keep the Church in all generations, from error and diviſions in points of Doctrine, ſo the ſame reaſon and care would have moved them to do the ſame to keep the Churches in unity in point of Worſhip, if indeed they had taken preſcribed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94077:24"/>
forms to be needfull to ſuch an unity: they knew that after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture the Church would never have the like advantage, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, authorized, and enabled for delivering the univerſal Laws of Chriſt: And ſeeing in thoſe parts of worſhip, which are of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted uſe, and ſtill the ſame forms might have ſuited all ages as this age, and all Countries as this Country: (in the ſubſtance) there can no reaſon be given, why the Apoſtles ſhould leave this undone, and not have performed it themſelves, if they had judged ſuch forms to be neceſſary, or the moſt deſirable means of unity. If they had preſcribed them, 1. The Church had been ſecured from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in them. 2. Believers had been preſerved from diviſions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the lawfulneſſe and fitneſſe of them, as receiving them from God. 3. All Churches and Countries might had one Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, as they have one Scripture, and ſo have all ſpoke the ſame things. 4. All ages would have had the ſame without innovation, (in all the parts that require not alteration) whereas now on the contrary, 1. Our Liturgies being the writings of fallible men, are lyable to error, and we have cauſe to fear ſubſcribing to them, as having nothing contrary to the word of God. 2. And matters of Humane inſtitution have become the matter of ſcruple, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. 3. And the Churches have had great diverſity of Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies. 4. And one age hath been mending what they ſuppoſed they received from the former faulty, and imperfect: So that our own which you are ſo loath to Change, hath not continued yet three Generations. And it is moſt evident that the Apoſtles being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the delivery of the entire rule of Faith and worſhip, and having ſuch great advantages for our unity and peace, would never have omited the forming of a Liturgy of univerſal uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to avoid all the foreſaid inconveniences, if they had taken this courſe of unity to be ſo needfull, or deſirable as you ſeem to do. Whereas therefore you ſay you know no better or more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatious way than our Liturgy, &amp;c. We reply, 1. The Apoſtles knew the beſt way of unity, and of ſpeaking the ſame thing in the matters of God: But the Apoſtles knew not our Liturgy, (nor any Common-Prayer-book, for ought hath yet been proved) <hi>Ergo</hi> the ſaid Liturgy is not the beſt way of unity, or ſpeaking the ſame thing, &amp;c. 2. The Primitive Church in the next ages after the Apoſtles, knew the beſt way of unity, &amp;c.

We would not have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred you of theſe things, but that you neceſſitate us by pleading your peace in thoſe dayes, as an argument for the impoſing of the Liturgy. 2.

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Prayer and Humility are indeed the neceſſarie means of Peace: But if you will let us pray for peace in no words but what are in the Common-Prayer-book, their brevitie and unapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the cuſtomarineſs, that will take off the edge of fervour, with humane nature, will not give leave (or help ſufficient) to our ſouls to work towards God, upon this Subject, with that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largedneſs, copiouſneſs, and freedom, as is neceſſary to due fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. A brief tranſient touch, and away, is not enough to warm the heart arigne; and cold Prayers are like to have a cold return, and therefore, even for Peace ſake, let us pray more copiouſly and heartily than the Common-Prayer-book will help us to do. And whether this be that cauſe, or whether it be that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-book hath never a Prayer for it ſelf, we find that its Prayers prevail not to reconcile many ſober, ſerious perſons to it that live in faithfull fervent Prayer. 2. And for Humility, we humbly conceive it would moſt effectually heal us, and by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Paſtors of the Church to know that they are not to rule the flocks as Lords, but as enſamples, not by conſtraint, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2, 3. and it would cauſe them not to think ſo highly of themſelves, and ſo meanly of their Brethren, as to judge no words fit to be uſed to God in the publick Worſhip, but what they preſcribe, and put into our mouths, and that other men are generally unable to ſpeak ſenſibly, or ſuitably, unleſs they tell us what to ſay; or, that all others are unfit to be truſted with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of their own deſires: Humilitie would perſwade the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church at leaſt to undertake no more than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did, and no more to obtrude or impoſe their own words upon all others in the publick Worſhip: If they found any unfit to be truſted with the expreſſion of their mindes in publick Prayer, they would do what they could to get meeter men in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and till then they would reſtrain and help ſuch as need it, and not upon that pretence as much reſtrain all the ableſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94077:26"/>
as if the whole Church were to be nominated, meaſured, or uſed, according to the quality of the moſt unworthy. And it is alſo true, that humility in private perſons and inferiors, would do much to our peace, by keeping them in due ſubmiſſion, and obedience, and keeping them from all contentions and diviſions, which proceed from ſelf-conceitedneſs and pride. But yet, 1. The humbleſt, ſureſt Subjects may ſtumble upon the ſcruple, whether Biſhops differ not from Presbyters only in degree, and not in order or office, (it being a Controverſie, and no reſolved point of faith even amongſt the Papiſts, whoſe faith is too extenſive, and favour too Eccleſiaſtical, ambition too great) and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they may doubt whether men in the ſame order, do, by divine appointment, owe obedience unto thoſe that gradually go before them. 2. And they may ſcruple whether ſuch making themſelves the Governours of their Brethren, make not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves indeed of a different order or office, and ſo incroach not on the authority of Chriſt, who only maketh Officers purely Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical; and whether it be no diſloyalty to Chriſt to own ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. 3. And among thoſe Divines that are for a threefold Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, (beſides that of Presbyters, who are <hi>Epiſcopi Gregis)</hi> viz. General unfixed Biſhops, like the Evangeliſts or Apoſtles, (in their meaſure) and the fixed Biſhops of Parochial Churches, that have Presbyters to aſſiſt them, to whom they do preſide, and alſo the Preſidents of larger Synods) yet is it a matter of very great doubt, whether a fixed Dioceſan being the Paſtor of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Churches, having none under him, that hath the power of Juriſdiction or Ordination, be indeed a Governour of Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment or approbation, and whether Chriſt will give us any more thanks for owning them as ſuch, than the King will give us for owning an Uſurper. Humility alone will not ſeem to ſubject theſe men to ſuch a Government. 4. And though their coercive Magiſtratical power be eaſily ſubmitted to, as being from the King, (how unfit Subjects ſoever Church men are of ſuch a power) yet he that knoweth his Superiours beſt, doth honour God more, and ſuppoſeth God more infallible than man, and will feel himſelf moſt indiſpenſibly bound by Gods commands, and bound not to obey man againſt the Lord. And whereas there is much ſayd againſt the peoples taking on them to judge of the lawfulneſs of things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them by Superiors; we add, 5. That humble men may believe that their Superiors are fallible; that it is no impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to command things that God forbids, that in ſuch Caſes, if we
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94077:26"/>
have ſufficient means to diſcern the ſinfulneſs of ſuch Commands, we muſt make uſe of them, and muſt obey God rather than men; that when the Apoſtles acted according to ſuch a Reſolution, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 19. and <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three Witneſſes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. and 3. they all exerciſed a judgement of Diſcerning upon the matter of their Superiors commands; that not to do ſo at all, is to make Subjects Bruits, and ſo no Subjects, becauſe not rational free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, or to make all Governors to be gods. And laſtly, That it will not ſave us from Hell, nor juſtifie us at Judgement for ſinning againſt God, to ſay, that Superiors commanded us, nor will it prove all the Martyrs to be ſinners and condemned, becauſe they judged of their Superiors commands, and diſobeyed them. All which we ſay to ſhew the inſufficiency of the Remedy, hereby you propounded, (the humility of Inferiors) unleſs you will alſo add your help, without obedience there is no order or laſting concord to be expected: And by abaſing the eternal God, ſo far as to ſet him and his Laws below a Creature, under pretence of obedience to the Creature, no good can be expected, becauſe no peace with Heaven, without which, peace with men is but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy haſtning each party to Deſtruction: And therefore abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute obedience muſt be given only to God the abſolute Sovereign. In all this we ſuppoſe that we are all agreed: And therefore, 6. and laſtly, We muſt ſay, that the way to make us think the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to be ſo wiſe, and careful Guides and Fathers to us, is not for them to ſeem wiſer than the Apoſtles, and make thoſe things of ſtanding neceſſity to the Churches unity, which the Apoſtles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made ſo, nor to forbid all to preach the Goſpel, or to hold Communion with the Church, that dare not conform to things unneceſſary. Love and tenderneſs are not uſed to expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by hurting and deſtroying men for nothing; And to ſilence and reject from Church Communion for a Ceremony, and in the mean time to perſwade men that they love them, is but to ſtab or famiſh all the ſick perſons in the Hoſpital or Family, whoſe ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs cannot take down the Diſh we offer them, or whoſe throats are too narrow to ſwallow ſo big a morſel as we ſend them; And when we have done, to tell them, the only remedy is for them to believe we love them, and are tender of them. And who knows not that a man may think well of his Superiors, that yet may queſtion whether all that he teacheth or commandeth him, be lawful.</p>

It is ſtrange, that you muſt ſee it firſt evidently proved unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for men to joyn with the Liturgy (you mean, we ſuppoſe, to joyn with you in the uſing of it, or when you uſe it,) before you will ſee reaſon to alter any thing in it: what if it be only proved unlawful for you to impoſe it, though not for others to joyn with you when you do impoſe it, is this no reaſon to alter it? ſhould you not have ſome care to avoid ſin your ſelves, as well as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve others from it? An inconvenient mode of Worſhip is a ſin in the Impoſer, and in the Chooſer, and voluntary Uſer, that might offer God better, and will not, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13, 14. And yet it may not be only lawful, but a duty to him that by violence is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to offer up that or none. And yet we ſuppoſe the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers ſhould ſee cauſe to make an alteration. If you lived where you muſt receive the Lords Supper ſitting, or not at all, it's like you would be of this minde your ſelves. 3. Why ſhould it be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a [bare pretence of ſcruples] as if you ſearch'd the Hearts, and knew (not only that they are upon miſtake, but) that they are not real, when the perſons not only profeſs them real, but are willing to uſe all juſt means that tend to their ſatisfaction, they ſtudy, read, pray, and will be glad of Conference with you, at any time, upon equal tearms, if they may be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves believed. 4. Even groundleſs ſcruples about the matter of an unneceſſary Law, which hath that which to the weak both is and will be an appearance of evil, may be ſufficient to make it the Duty of Rulers to reverſe their impoſitions, though they be not ſufficient to juſtifie the Scrupulous. 5. If a man ſhould think that he ought not to obey man, even when he thinketh it is againſt the Commands of God, though he be uncertain,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94077:27"/>
(as in caſe of going on an unqueſtioned Warfare, or doing <hi>Doeg</hi>'s execution, &amp;c.) yet it followeth not, that [all Law and Order is gone] as long as all Laws and Orders ſtand that are viſibly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the Laws of God, and to his Sovereignty, or conſiſtent with them, and when the Subject ſubmitteth to ſuffering where he dare not obey.</p>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> If the Liturgie ſhould be altered, as is here required, and deſired by us, that it could be no juſt offence to the generality (or any) of the ſobereſt and moſt loyal Children of the Church (as you ſpeak) is eaſie to be proved, by laying together the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations following: Becauſe it is by themſelves confeſſed to be alterable, as not having it ſelf its former Conſtitution, till leſs than two hundred years ago. 2. And themſelves affirm it to be not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, but a thing indifferent, while they exclude all higher inſtitutions from the power of the Church. 3. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it lawful to ſerve God without this Liturgie, without which he was ſerved by other Churches above 1460 years, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he is now ſerved by other Churches, when the contrary minded doubt whether with it he be lawfully ſerved. 4. Thoſe that deſire the alteration, deſire no more than to ſerve God as the Churches did in the daies of the Apoſtles, that had their moſt infallible Conduct. 5. And they offer alſo ſuch Formes as are more unqueſtionable as to their Congruency to the word of God, and to the nature of the ſeveral parts of Worſhip. 6. And yet though they deſire the ſureſt Concord and an univerſal
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94077:28"/>
Reformation) they deſire not to impoſe on others what they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, but can thankfully accept a Liberty to uſe what is to their own Conſciences moſt unqueſtionably ſafe, while other men uſe that which they like better. So that ſet all this together, with the conſideration of the neceſſity of the preaching the Word, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion that is hereupon denied, and you may ſee it proved, That to have ſuch a Liturgy ſo altered, that is confeſſed alterable, for ſo deſirable an end, to the uſe only of thoſe that cannot well uſe it, without urging others to any thing that they do themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count unlawful, cannot be a matter of juſt offence to the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſober Children of the Church, nor to any one. And as to the reaſon given, it is apparently none. For, 1. Of thoſe that ſcruple the unlawfulneſs of it, there are many that will not peremptorily affirm it unlawful, and condemn all that uſe it, but they dare not uſe it doubtingly themſelves. 2. When our Papers were before you, we think it not juſt that you ſhould ſay, that it's here deſired to be altered, on the pretence that it is a direct cauſe of Schiſm and a ſuperſtitious uſage: Have we any ſuch expreſſions? If we have, let them be recited; if not, It is hard that this ſhould even by you be thus affirmed, as is ſayd by us, which we have not ſayd: We have ſayd [that the Ceremonies have been the Fountain of much evil, occaſioning diviſions, but not what you charge us to have ſayd in words or ſenſe. 3. And may not you alter them without approving, or ſeeming to approve the reaſon upon which the alteration is deſired, when you have ſo great ſtore of other reaſons? The King in his Declaration is far enough from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to own the Charge againſt the things which he was pleaſed graciouſly to alter ſo far as is there expreſt. If a Patient have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that ſome one thing would kill him, if he took it, the Phyſitian may well forbear him in that one thing, when it is not neceſſary to his health, without owning his reaſons againſt it: If his Majeſty have Subjects ſo weak as to contend about things indifferent, and if both ſides err, one thinking them neceſſary, and the other ſinful, may he not gratifie either of them, without ſeeming to reprove their errour. By this reaſon of yours he is by other men in ſuch a Caſe neceſſitated to ſin; For if he ſettle thoſe things which ſome count neceſſary, he ſeems to approve of their opinion, that they are neceſſary: If he take them down when others call them ſinful, he ſeems to own their charge of the ſinfulneſs. But indeed he needeth not to do either, he may take them down, or leave them indifferent, profeſſedly for unity and peace, and profeſſedly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94077:28"/>
the Errors on both ſides. We are ſorry if any did eſteem theſe Forms and Ceremonies any better than mutable indifferent modes and circumſtances of Worſhip: and did hazard eſtate or life for them as any otherwiſe eſteemed: And we are ſorry, that by our Diviſions the Adverſary of Peace hath gotten ſo great an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt us, as that the Argument againſt neceſſary charitable forberance is fetch'd from the intereſt of the reputation of the contending Parties, that things may not be abated to others which you confeſs are indifferent and alterable, and which many of them durſt not uſe, though to ſave their lives. And this becauſe it will make them thought the pious, tender concienc'd men, and make others thought worſe of. But with whom will it have theſe effects? thoſe that you call the generality of the ſober loyal children of the Church will think never the worſe of themſelves, becauſe others have libertie to live by them without theſe things. And the reſt, whoſe liberties you denie, will think rather the worſe of you, than the better, for denying them their libertie in the worſhipping of God. You undoubtedly argue here againſt the intereſt of Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which you ſtand for, your Prefaces to your indulgencies, and your open Profeſſions; and (if you will needs have it ſo) your own Practiſes, will tell the World loud enough, that the things which you adhered to with ſo great hazards are ſtill lawfull in your Judgement, and it will be your honour, and add to your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to abate them to others, when it is in your power to be more ſevere. And if you refuſe it, their ſufferings will tell the World loud enough, that for their parts they ſtill take them to be things unlawful. As for the reaſons by them produced to prove them ſinfull, they have been publickly made known in the writings of many of them; In <hi>Ames</hi> his freſh ſute againſt the Ceremonies, and in the Abridgement, &amp;c. and in <hi>Bradſhaw</hi>'s, <hi>Nicols,</hi> and other mens Writings.</p>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> We call thoſe Opinions which are not determined Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, and though the greater number ſhould hold them as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, they are not therefore the Doctrines of the Church, and therefore might be called Private Opinions; but indeed we uſed not the Word (that we can find:) the thing we deſired, was, that the materials of the Liturgie may conſiſt of nothing doubtfull, or queſtioned among pious learned and orthodox Perſons.] We ſaid alſo (that the limiting Church Communion to things of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſputation, hath been in all Ages the ground of Schiſme and Separation (which is not to ſay, that the Liturgy it ſelf, is a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious uſage, or a directs cauſe of Schiſme,) And we cited the words of a Learned man (Mr. <hi>Hales)</hi> not as making every word our own, but as a Teſtimony <hi>ad hominem,</hi> becauſe he was ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued by your ſelves (as we ſuppoſe) and therefore we thought his words might be more regarded by you than our own. 2. Where you ſay [that the Church hath been carefull to put nothing in the Liturgy, but that which is either evidently the word of God, or that which had been generally received in the Catholick Church.] We reply, 1. We ſuppoſe there is little or nothing now contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted between us, which you will ſay is evidently the Word of God, either the Forms or Ceremonies, or any of the reſt. 2. If by [in the Church] you mean [not by the Church] but [by any part in the Church] how ſhall we know that they did well. And if by [the generality] you mean not All, but the Greater part, you undertake the proof of that which is not eaſie to be proved. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo hard to judge of the majority of Perſons in the Catholick Church in any notable differences. We do take it for granted, that you limit not the Catholick Church, as the Papiſts do, to the Confines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but indeed we can only wiſh, that your Aſſertion were true, while we muſt ſhew it to be untrue, if you ſpeak of the Primitive Church, or of an univerſality of time, as well as place, (if not its more againſt you, that the Primitive Catholick Church was againſt you.) The very thing in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that containeth the reſt [that its needfull to the peace of the Church, that all the Churches under one Prince ſhould uſe one form of Liturgy] was not received by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, nor by the generality in it: when it is ſo well known that they uſed diverſity of Liturgies and Cuſtomes in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. The generality in the Catholick Church received not the Lords Supper Kneeling, at leaſt on any Lords dayes, when it was forbidden by divers generall Councills, and when this prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94077:29"/>
was generally received as an Apoſtolical tradition: We have not heard it prov'd, that the Surplice or Croſs, as uſed with us, wree received by the Univerſal Church; It is a private Opinion not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Catholick Church, that [it is requiſite that no man ſhould come to the Holy Communion, but with a full truſt in Gods mercy, and with a quiet Conſcience,] though it be every mans duty to be perfect <hi>pro ſtatu viatoris,</hi> yet it is not requiſite that no man come till he be perfect. He that hath but a weak Faith (though not a full truſt) muſt come to have it ſtrenthned: And he that hath an unquiet Conſcience, muſt come to receive that mercy which may quiet it. It is a private Opinion, and not generally received in the Catholick Church [that one of the People] may make the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Confeſſion at the Sacrament, in the name of all thoſe that are minded to receive the Holy Communion] It is a private and not generally received diſtinction, that the body of Chriſt makes clean our bodies, and his blood waſheth our ſouls.] It is a doubtful opinion, to ſpeak eaſily, that when the Lords Supper is delivered with a Prayer not made in the Receivers name, but thus directed to him by the Miniſter [the Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c. preſerve thy Body and Soul,] it is ſo intollerable a thing for the Receiver not to kneel, in hearing the Prayer, that he muſt elſe be thruſt from the Communion of the Church, and yet that no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhall kneel, that indeed doth pray: But he may pray ſtanding, and the Hearers be caſt out for ſtanding at the ſame words. It is not a generally received, but a private opinion, [that every Pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner (though impenitent, and conſcious of his utter unfitneſs, and though he be in deſpair, and think he ſhall take his own damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) muſt be forced to receive thrice a year: when yet even thoſe that have not [a full truſt in Gods mercy] or [have not a quiet Conſcience] were before pronounced ſo uncapable, as that none ſuch ſhould come to the Communion.] Abundance more ſuch Inſtances may be given to ſhew how far from truth the Aſſertion is, that [the Church hath been careful to put nothing into the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, but that which is either evidently the Word of God, or which hath been generally received in the Catholick Church] unleſs you ſpeak of ſome unhappie unſuccesful Carefulneſs. But we thankfully accept of your following words, [and if the contrary can be proved we wiſh it out of the Liturgie] which we entreat you to perform, and impartially receive our proofs. But then we muſt alſo entreat you; 1. That the Primitive Churches Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice may be preferred before the preſent declined,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94077:30"/>
much corrupted State. And 2. If Gods Law rather than the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful practiſes of men breaking that Law may be the Churches Rule for Worſhip: For you call us to ſubſcribe to <hi>Art.</hi> 19. that [as the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> hath erred, ſo alſo the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath erred, not only in their living, and manner of Ceremonies, but alſo in matters of Faith: and ſaith <hi>Rogers,</hi> in <hi>Art.</hi> 20. they are out of the way, which think that either one man, as the Pope, or any certain Calling of men, as the Clergie, hath power to decree, and appoint Rites or Ceremonies, though of themſelves good, unto the whole Church of God, diſperſed over the univerſal world,] and indeed if you would have all that Corruption brought into our Liturgie, and Diſcipline, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which the Papiſts, Greeks, and others, that undoubtedly make up the far greater number of the now univerſal Church do uſe: you would deſerve no more thanks of God, or man, than he that would have all Kings, and Nobles, and Gentry, levelled with the poor Commons, becauſe the latter are the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or than he that would have the healthful conformed to the ſick, when an epidemical diſeaſe hath made them the Majority, or than he that would teach us to follow a multitude to do evil, and to break more than the leaſt Commands, becauſe the greater number break them; we pray you therefore to take it for no juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of any uncertain or faulty paſſage in our Liturgie, though the greater number now are guilty of it. 3. And we muſt beſeech you, if the Churches Judgment or Practice muſt be urged, that you would do us the juſtice, as to imitate the ancient Churches in your ſenſe of the quality, and the mode and meaſure of uſing, and impoſing things, as well as in the materials uſed, and impoſed Conſider not only [whether you finde ſuch things received by the ancient Churches,] but alſo conſider how they were received, eſteemed, and uſed,] whether as neceſſary or indifferent, as points of Faith, or doubtful Opinions, whether forced on others, or left to their free choice: If you finde that the generality of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Churches received the White Garment after Baptiſm, and the taſting of Milk and Honie as Ceremonies freely, though generally uſed, you ſhould not therefore force men to uſe them: If you finde that the Doctrine of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> or of Angels corporeity was generally received as an Opinion, it will not warrant you to receive either of them as a certain neceſſary truth. If you finde that the General Councels forbad Kneeling in any Adoration on the Lords daies, but without force againſt Diſſenters, you may
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94077:30"/>
not go denie the Sacrament to all that kneel, nor yet forbid them to kneel in praying. So if you find ſome little parcels of our Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, or ſome of our Ceremonies uſed as things indifferent, left to choice, forced upon none, but one Church differing from another in ſuch uſages or obſervances, this will not warrant you to uſe the ſame things as neceſſarie to order, unitie, or peace, and to be forced upon all; uſe them no otherwiſe than the Churches uſed them.</p>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> The deſire of your hearts is the grief of our hearts, the Conceptions of Prayer by a publick perſon, according to a publick Rule, for a publick uſe, are not to be rejected as private Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: We had hoped you had deſigned no ſuch innovation as this in the Church: When we have heard any ſay that it would come to this, and that you deſigned the ſuppreſſion of the free Prayers of Miniſters in the Pulpit, ſuited to the varietie of ſubjects and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, we have rebuked them as uncharitable in paſſing ſo heavie a cenſure on you: And what would have been ſaid of us a year ago, if we ſhould have ſaid that this was in your hearts? nothing will more alienate the hearts of many holy prudent perſons from the Common-Prayer, than to perceive that it is framed and uſed as an Inſtrument to ſhut out all other Prayers, as the Miniſters private Conceptions. Such an end and deſign will make it under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a means, another thing than elſe it would be, and afford men ſuch an Argument againſt it, as we deſire them not to have: but we hope you ſpeak not the publick ſenſe. As the Apoſtles deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (as aforeſaid) that all would ſpeak the ſame things, without giving them (that ever was proved) a form of words to ſpeak them in, ſo might we propoſe to you, that uncertain opinions be made no part of our Liturgie without putting all their words into their mouths, in which their deſires muſt be uttered. Your heartie deſire, and the reaſon of it, makes not only againſt extemporarie Prayer, but all prepared, or written forms, or Liturgies, that were indited only by one man, and have not the conſent antecedently of others. And do you think this was the courſe of the Primitive times? <hi>Baſil</hi> thus uſed his private Conceptions at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and <hi>Greg. Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturgus</hi> before him at <hi>Neoceſarea,</hi> and all Paſtors in <hi>Juſtin Martyrs</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:94077:31"/>
and <hi>Tertullians</hi> daies. And how injurious is it to the publick Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Chriſt, the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Churches, to be called private men, who are publick perſons in the Church, if they be not? every ſingle perſon is not a private perſon, elſe Kings and Judges would be ſo. And have you not better means to ſhut out private opinions, than the forbidding Miniſters praying in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, according to the varietie of ſubjects and occaſions: You have firſt the Examination of perſons to be ordained, and may ſee that they be able to ſpeak ſenſe, and fit to mannage their proper works with judgement and diſcretion, before you ordain them; And ſome confidence may be put in a man in his proper calling and work, to which he is admitted with ſo great care, as we hope (or deſire) you will admit them; If you are neceſſitated to admit ſome few that are injudicious, or unmeet, we beſeech you (not only to reſtore the many hundred worthy men laid by, to a capacity, but that you will not ſo diſhonour the whole Church, as to ſuppoſe all ſuch, and to uſe all as ſuch, but reſtrain thoſe that deſerve reſtraint, and not all others for their ſakes: And next you have a publick Rule (the Holy Scripture) for theſe men to pray by, and if any of them be intollerably guiltie of weakneſſes or raſhneſs, or other miſcarriages, the words being ſpoken in publick, you have witneſſe enow, and ſure there is power enough in Magiſtrates and Biſhops to puniſh them, and if they prove incorrigible, to caſt them out. In all other profeſſions theſe means are thought ſufficient to regulate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, His Majeſtie thinks it enough to regulate his Judges, that he may chooſe able men, and fit to be truſted in their proper work, and that they are reſponſible for all their maladminiſtrations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſcribing them forms, beyond which they may not ſpeak any thing in their Charge. Phyſitians being firſt tried, and reſponſible for their doings, are conſtantly truſted with the lives of high and low, without tying them to give no counſel, or medicine, but by the preſcript of a Book, or determination of a Colledge: And it is ſo undeniable, that your reaſon makes more againſt Preaching, and for only reading Homilies, as that we muſt like it the worſe, if not fear what will become of Preaching alſo. For 1. It is known that in Preaching a man hath far greater opportunity, and liberty to vent a falſe or private opinion, than in Prayer. 2. It is known <hi>de eventu,</hi> that it is much more ordinary. And if you ſay [that he ſpeaks not the words of the Church, but his own, nor unto God, but man, and therefore it is leſs matter.] We anſwer, it is as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, if not much more, from whom he ſpeaks, than to whom,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94077:31"/>
he ſpeaks as the Miniſter of Chriſt, in his ſtead and name, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20. And it is as a higher, ſo a more Reverend thing to ſpeak in Gods name to the people, than in the peoples name to God; and to ſpeak that which we call Gods word, or truth, or meſſage, than that which we call but our own deſire: We make God a lyer, or corrupt in his words, if we ſpeak a falſhood in his name; we make but our ſelves lyers, if we ſpeak a falſhood to him in our own names; The former therefore is the more heynous and dreadfull abuſe, and more to be avoided: or if but equally, it ſhews the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of your reaſon, (for we will not ſay of your deſign, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping you intend not to make us <hi>Ruſſians)</hi> We do therefore for the ſake of the poor threatened Church, beſeech you that you will be pleaſed to repent of theſe deſires, and not to proſecute them, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that to avoid a leſſer evil (avoidable by ſafer means) you will bring a far greater evil on the Churches, and ſuch as is like to ſtrip theſe Nations of the glory in which they have excelled the reſt of the world, even a learned, able, holy Miniſtry, and a people ſincere, and ſerious, and underſtanding in the matters of their Salvation. For 1. As it is well known that an ignorant man may read a Prayer and Homily as diſtinctly and laudably as a Learned Divine, and ſo may do the work of a Miniſter, if this be it; ſo it is known that mans nature is ſo addicted to eaſe and ſenſual diverſions, as that multitudes will make no better preparations, when they find that no more is neceſſary, when they are as capable of their places and maintenance if they can but read, and are forced upon no exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their parts, which may detect and ſhame their ignorance, but the ſame words are to be read by the ableſt and ignoranteſt man; it is certain that this will make multitudes idle in their Academical Studies, and multitudes to ſpend their time idly all the year, in the courſe of their Miniſtry: and when they have no neceſſity that they are ſenſible of, of diligent ſtudies, it will let looſe their fleſhly voluptuous inclinations, and they will ſpend their time in ſports, and drinking, and prating, and idleneſſe, and this will be a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of Luſt: or they will follow the world, and drown them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Covetouſneſſe and Ambition, and their hearts will be like their ſtudies: As its the way to have a holy, able Miniſtry, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them to holy ſtudies, to meditate on Gods Law day and night, ſo its the way to have an ignorant, prophane and ſcandalous Miniſtry (and conſequently Enemies to ſerious Godlineſſe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) to impoſe upon them but ſuch a work, as in ignorance and idleneſſe, they may perform as well as the judicious and the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94077:32"/>
diligent. If it be ſaid [that their parts may be tried and exerciſed ſome other way] we anſwer, where ſhould a Miniſters parts be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, if not in the Pulpit, or the Church, and in Catechiſing, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Baptiſm, and Communion, and in the viſitation of the ſick? their work alſo is ſuch as a School-boy may do as well as they, their ignorance having the ſame Cloak, as in publick. If it be ſaid [that a Miniſters work is not to ſhew his parts] we anſwer, but his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial work is, to ſhew men their ſins, and to preach the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Myſteries of the Goſpel, to help men to ſearch, and underſtand the Scriptures, and to ſearch, and to know their hearts, and to know God in Chriſt, and to hope for the glory that is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: and fervently to pray for the ſucceſſe of his endeavours, and the bleſſings of the Goſpel on the people, and chearfully to praiſe God for his various benefits, which cannot be well done without abilities. A Phyſitians work is not to ſhew his parts ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, but it is to do that for the cure of diſeaſes which without parts he cannot do, and in the exerciſe of his parts, on which the iſſue much depends, to ſave mens lives. The oſtentation of his good works, is not the work of a good Chriſtian: and yet he muſt ſo let his light ſhine before men, that they may ſee his good works, and glorifie God. And undeniable experience tells us, that God ordinarily proportioneth the ſucceſſe and bleſſing, to the skill, and holineſſe and diligence of the Inſtruments, and bleſſeth not the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of ignorant, ungodly Drones, as he doth the labours of able faithfull Miniſters. And alſo that the readieſt way to bring the Goſpel into contempt into the world, and cauſe all religion to dwindle away into formality firſt, and then to barbariſm and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſſe, is to let in an ignorant, idle, vicious Miniſtry, that will become the peoples ſcorn: Yea, this is the way to extirpate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity out of any Country in the world, which is decaying a pace when men grow ignorant of the nature and reaſons of it, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced in its power and delightfull fruits, and when the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers themſelves grow unable to defend it. And we muſt add, that whatſoever can be expected duly to affect the heart, muſt keep the intellect, and all the faculties awake in diligent attention, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe: And in the uſe of a form, which we have frequently heard and read, the faculties are not ſo neceſſitated and urged to attention, and ſerious exerciſe, as they be when from our own underſtanding we are ſet about the natural work of repreſenting to others what we diſcern and feel. Mans mind is naturally ſloathfull, and will take its eaſe, and remit its ſeriouſneſſe longer than it is urged by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94077:32"/>
neceſſity, or drawn out by delight, when we know before-hand, that we have no more to do, but read a Prayer, or Homilie, we ſhall ordinarily be in danger of letting our mindes go another way, and think of other matters, and be ſenceleſs of the work in hand. Though he is but an Hypocrite that is carried on by no greater motive than mans obſervation, and approbation; yet is it a help not to be depiſed, when even a neceſſity of avoiding juſt ſhame with men, ſhall neceſſarily awake our invention, and all our faculties to the work, and be a concurrent help with ſpiritual motives. And common experience tells us, that the beſt are apt to loſe a great deal of their affection, by the conſtant uſe of the ſame words or forms; Let the ſame Sermon be preached an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times over, and trie whether an hundred for one will not be much leſs moved by it, than they were at firſt. It is not only the common corruption of our nature, but ſomewhat of innocent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity that is the cauſe of this. And man muſt ceaſe to be man, or to be mortal, before it will be otherwiſe; ſo that the nature of the thing, and the common experience of our own diſpoſitions, and of the effect on others, aſſureth us, that underſtanding ſerious Godlineſs, is like to be extinguiſhed, if only forms be allowed in the Church, on pretence of extinguiſhing errors and diviſions: And though we have concurred to offer you our more corrected Nepenthes, yet muſt we before God and men, proteſt againſt the doſe of <hi>Opium</hi> which you here preſcribe or wiſh for, as that which plainly tendeth to cure the diſeaſe by the extinguiſhing of life, and to unite us all in a dead Religion. And when the Prayers that avail muſt be effectual and ſervent, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 16. and God will be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth, and more regardeth the frame of the heart, than the comelineſs of expreſſion; we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be taken with any thing that pretends to help the tongue, while we are ſure it ordinarily hurts the heart: And it is not the affirmations of any men in the world, perſwading us of the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of ſuch a courſe that can ſo far un-man us, as to make us diſ-believe both our own experience, and common obſervation of the effect on others. Yet we confeſs that ſome forms have their laudable uſe, to cure that error and vice, that lieth on the other extreme. And might we but ſometimes have the liberty to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch words as are needful to call home and quicken attention and affection, we ſhould think that a convenient conjunction of both, might be a well tempered means to the common conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of moſt. But ſtill we ſee the world will run into extreams,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94077:33"/>
what ever be ſaid or done to hinder it. It is but lately that we were put to it, againſt one extreme, to defend the lawfulneſs of a form of Liturgie; now the other extreme it troubleth us, that we are forced againſt you, even ſuch as you, to defend the uſe of ſuch Prayers of the Paſtors of the Churches, as are neceſſarily varied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſubjects and occaſions, while you would have no Prayer at all in the Church, but ſuch preſcribed forms. And why may we not add, that whoever maketh the forms impoſed on us, if he uſe them, is guilty as well as we of praying according to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conceptions? And that we never ſaid it proved from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that Chriſt appointed any to ſuch an Office, as to make Prayers for other Paſtors and Churches to offer up to God: and that this being none of the work of the Apoſtolick, or common Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Office in the Primitive Church, is no work of any Office of Divine Inſtitution.</p>

Is it no poſitive error in the Papiſts account, that we profeſs [to receive theſe Creatures of Bread and Wine?] do they think we have no poſitive error in our Catechiſm about the Sacraments, that affirmeth it to be Bread and Wine after the Conſecration,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94077:34"/>
and makes but two Sacraments neceſſary? &amp;c.] 2. And unleſs we were nearlier agreed than we are, it ſeemeth to us no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a Liturgie, that the Papiſts charge it with no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive error. 3. That no Divines, or private men at home, or of Foreign Churches [that ever found fault with the Liturgie, are ſuch to whom the name of Proteſtant properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth] is an aſſertion that proveth not what authoritie of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Brethren you have, but what you aſſume, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth your Charitie no more than it commendeth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that they denie us to be Catholicks. <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> ſubſcribed the <hi>Augustine</hi> Confeſſion, and ſo have others that have found fault with our Liturgie. 4. If any of us have blamed it to the people, it is but with ſuch a ſort of blame, as we have here expreſt againſt it to your ſelves; And whether it be [unlawfull, and ſinfull] the impartial comparing of your words with ours, will help the willing Reader to diſcern.

not the Maſters of all mens experience, but of your own, and others that have acquainted you with the ſame, as theirs: We alſo may warrantably profeſſe in the name of our ſelves, and many thouſands of ſober pious perſons, that we experience that theſe things are againſt our edification, and we beſeech you do not by us, what you would not do by the poor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſervants of your family, to meaſure them all their dyet for quality or quantity, according to your own appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, which they think are diſeaſed, and would be better, if you work'd as hard as they; And we gave you ſome of the reaſons of our judgment. 1. Though we have not ſaid that the people may not in pſalmes to God concur in voice, (we ſpeak of prayer which you ſhould have obſerved) and though we only concluded it agreeable to the Scripture prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, for the people in prayer to ſay but their <hi>Amen,</hi> yet knowing not from whom to underſtand the will of God, and what is pleaſing to him, better than from himſelf, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what the Scripture ſaith of the ordinary way of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip; and finding ordinarily that the people ſpoke no more in prayer (as diſtinct from Pſalmes and praiſe) than their <hi>Amen,</hi> or meer conſent, we deſired to imitate the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt pattern. 2. As we find that the Miniſter is the mouth of the people to God in publick (which Scripture, and the neceſſity of order, do require) ſo we were loath to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the peoples invading of that Sacred Office, ſo far as they ſeem to us to do; 1. By reading half the Pſalmes and Hymnes; 2. By ſaying half the Prayers, as the Miniſter doth the other half; 3. By being one of them the mouth of all the reſt in the Confeſſion at the Lords Supper; 4. By being the only Petitioners, in the far greateſt part of all the Letanie, by their [good Lord deliver us] and [we beſeech thee to hear us good Lord] while the Miniſter only reciteth the matter of the prayer, and maketh none of the Requeſt at all, we fear leſt by parity of reaſon, the people will claim the work of preaching, and other parts of the Miniſterial Office; 3. And we mentioned that which all our ears are witneſſes of, that while half the Pſalmes, and Hymnes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſaid by ſuch of the people as can ſay them, the murmure of their voices in moſt Congregations, is ſo intelligible and confuſed, as muſt hinder

the edification of all the reſt; For who is edified by that which he cannot underſtand? we know not what you mean by citing 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 1, 4. <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 11. where there is not a word of publick prayer, but in one place of an Acclamation, upon an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſight of the Glory of the Lord, which made them praiſe the Lord, and ſay, [He is good, for his Mercy is for ever] When the prayer that went before was ſuch as you call [a long te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious prayer] uttered by <hi>Solomon</hi> alone without ſuch breaks, and diſcants; And in the other places is no mention of prayer at all, but of ſinging praiſe, and that not by the people, but by the Prieſts, and Levites, ſaying the ſame words [for he is good, for his Mercy endures for ever towards <hi>Iſrael.]</hi> The people are ſaid to do no more than ſhout with a great ſhout, becauſe the foundation of the houſe was laid: and if ſhouting be it that you would prove, it's not the thing in queſtion. Let the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary mode of praying in Scripture be obſerved, in the Prayers of <hi>David, Solomon, Ezra, Daniel,</hi> or any other, and if they were by breaks, and frequent beginnings and endings, and alternate interlocutions of the people, as yours are, then we will conform to your mode, which now offends us; But if they were not, we beſeech you reduce yours to the examples in the Scripture: we deſire no other rule to decide the Controverſie by. As to your Citation, 1 <hi>Socrat.</hi> there tells us of the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſinging of the <hi>Aruians</hi> in the reproach of the Orthodox, and that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> (not a <hi>Synod)</hi> compiled Hymnes to be ſung in oppoſition to them in the ſtreets, which came in the end to a Tumult and Bloodſhed. And hereupon he tells us of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of alternate ſinging. <hi>viz.</hi> a pretended viſion of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that heard Angels ſing in that order. And what is all this to alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate reading, and praying, or to a Divine Inſtitution, when here is no mention of reading, or praying, but of ſinging Hymnes? And that not upon pretence of Apoſtolical Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a viſion of uncertain credit. <hi>Theodor.</hi> alſo ſpeaketh only of ſinging Pſalmes alternately, and not a word of reading or praying ſo; And he fetcheth that way of ſinging alſo as <hi>Socrat.</hi> doth, but from the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and not from any pretended doctrine, or practiſe of the Apoſtles; And nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them ſpeaks a word of the neceſſitie of it, or of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing any to it, ſo that all theſe your Citations, ſpeaking not a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94077:36"/>
word ſo much as of the very Subjects in queſtion, are marvellouſly impertinent. The words [their Worſhip] ſeem to intimate, that ſinging Pſalms is part (of our Worſhip) and not of yours, we hope you diſown it not; for our parts we are not aſhamed of it, your diſtinction between <hi>Hopkin</hi>'s and <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, as if the Meetre allowed by Authority to be ſung in Churches made them to be no more <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, ſeemeth to us a very hard ſaying. If it be becauſe it is a Tranſlation, then the Proſe ſhould be none of <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms neither, nor any Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the Scripture. If it be becauſe it is in Meetre, then the exacteſt Tranſlation in Meetre ſhould be none of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. If becauſe it's done imperfectly, then the old Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the Bible, uſed by the Common-Prayer-book, ſhould not be Scripture. As to your reaſon for the ſuppoſed priority, 1. Scripture examples telling us, that the People had more part in the Pſalms, than in the Prayers or Readings, ſatisfie us, that God and his Church then ſaw a diſparity of Reaſon. 2. Common obſervation tells us, that there is more Order and leſs hindrance of Edification in the Peoples ſinging, than in their Reading, and Praying together vocally.</p>

If one man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you draw up a form of Prayer, it is his ſingle conception: And why a man as learned and able may not be truſted to conceive a Prayer, for the uſe of a ſingle Congregation, without the dangers mentioned by you, as one man to conceive a Prayer for all the Churches in a Dioceſs or a Nation? we know not; Theſe words <hi>(That the miſchief is greater than the pretended good)</hi> ſeem to expreſſe an unjuſt Accuſation, of ordinary conceived prayer, and a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing of the benefits: If you would intimate that the Crimes expreſſed by you are ordinarily found in Miniſters prayers, we that hear ſo much more frequently than you, muſt profeſs we have not found it ſo (allowing men their different meaſures of Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as you have even in writing) Nay to the praiſe of God we muſt ſay, that multitudes of private men can ordinarily pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch Imperfection, as ſhould nauſeate a ſober perſon, and with ſuch ſeriouſneſs, and aptneſs of Expreſſion as is greatly to the benefit and comfort of ourſelves, when we joyn with them; And if ſuch general Accuſations may ſerve in a matter of publick, and common fact, there is no way for the Juſtification of the Innocent. And that it is no ſuch common guilt, will ſeem more probable to them that conſider, that ſuch conceived Prayers, both prepared and extemperate, have been ordinarily uſed in the Pulpits in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> before our dayes till now, and there hath been power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the Biſhops and others, before the Wars, to puniſh thoſe that ſpeak Ridiculouſly, Seditiouſly, Impiouſly, or Blaſphemouſly; And yet ſo few are the Inſtances (even when jealouſie was moſt buſy) of Miniſters puniſhed, or once accuſed of any ſuch fault in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as that we find it not eaſy to remember any conſiderable number of them: There being great numbers puniſhed for not reading the

And the former ſhewed that it was not for want of will to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, that they ſpared them as to the latter.

We gave you our reaſon, which you anſwer not; Confeſſion is the exerciſe of Repentance, and alſo the helper of it; And it is noe true repentance which is not particular, but only general. If you ſay that you repent that you have ſinned, and know not where, or do not repent of any particular ſin, you do not indeed repent, for Sin is not exiſtent but in the Individuals: And if you ask for grace, and know nor what grace, or deſire no particular graces; indeed you deſire not grace at all: We know there is time and uſe for general Confeſſions, and Requeſts; But ſtill as implying particulars, as having gone before, or following, or at leaſt it muſt be ſuppoſed, that the people underſtand the particulars included and have inward confeſſions and deſires of them: Which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not here be ſuppoſed, when they are not all mentioned, not can the people generally be ſuppoſed to have ſuch quick and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive

minds, nor is there leiſure to exerciſe ſuch particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance or deſire, while a general is named: And we beſeech you let Scripture be Judge, whether the Confeſſions and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Servants of God have not been particular; As to your objection or reaſon, we anſwer; 1. There are general Prayers with the particular, or without them. 2, There are particular Confeſſions and Prayers proper to ſome few Chriſtians, and there are others common to all; It is theſe that we expect, and not the former. 3. The Churches Prayers muſt be ſuited to the body of the Aſſembly, though perhaps ſome one, or few may be in a ſtate not fit for ſuch expreſſions: What a lamentable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy will you have, if you have nothing in it, but what every one in the Congregation may ſay as true of and ſuitable to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Then you muſt leave out all Thankſgiving for our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and forgiveneſſe of ſin, and adoption, and title to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe many in the Aſſembly are Hipocrites, and have no ſuch mercies, and many more that are ſincere, are miſtaken in their own condition, and know not that they have the mercies which they have, and therefore dare not give thanks for them, leſt they ſpeak an untruth: Then the Liturgy that now ſpeaks as in the perſons of the Sanctified muſt be changed, that the two fore-mentioned ſorts, (or the latter at leaſt) may conſent; and when you have done, it will be unſuitable to thoſe that are in a better ſtate, and have the knowledge of their Juſtification. This is the Argument which the Sectaries uſed againſt ſinging of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms in the Congregations, becauſe there is much in them, that many cannot truly ſay of themſelves. But the Church muſt not go out of that way of worſhip preſcribed by God, and ſuired to the ſtate of the ordinary ſort of the ſpiritual Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, becauſe of the diſtempers, or the ſuper-eminent excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of ſome few: It were eaſy to go over <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms and your own Liturgy, and ſhew you very much that by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument muſt be caſt out: He that finds any paſſage unſuitable to himſelf, is not to ſpeak it of himſelf.</p>

He that hath his Original ſin forgiven him, may well confeſſe that he was born in iniquity and conceived in ſin, and was by nature a Child of wrath, and that by one man ſin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world, and that Judgment came on all men to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The pardoned may confeſſe what once they were, and from what Rock they were hewn: even actual ſins muſt be confeſſed, after they are forgiven, (unleſs the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians hold the truth againſt us in ſuch points. 2. All is not falſe Doctrine that croſſeth mens private Opinions, which you ſeem here to obtrude upon us. We know that the Papiſts (and perhaps ſome others) hold that all the baptiſed are delivered from the Guilt of Original ſin; But (as they are in the dark, and diſagreed in the Explicatio of it) ſo we have more reaſon to incline to either of the ordinary Opinions of the Proteſtants, than to this of theirs, 3. Some learned Proteſtants hold that viſibly all the baptiſed are Church members; pardoned and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, which is but that they are probably juſtified indeed, and are to be uſed by the Church (upon a Judgment of Charity) as thoſe that are really juſtified. But that we have indeed no certainty that they are ſo; God keeping that as a ſecret to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf concerning Individuals, till by actual Faith and Repentance, it be manifeſt to themſelves. Another Opinion of many Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants is, that all perſons that are Children of the Promiſe, or that have the conditions of pardon and Juſtification in the Covenant mentioned, are to receive that pardon by Baptiſme: and all ſuch are pardoned, and certainly in a ſtate of Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereupon: and that the promiſe of pardon is made to the Faithful and to their ſeed: and therefore that all the Faithful and their ſeed in Infancy have this pardon given them by the promiſe, and ſolemnly delivered them, and ſealed to them by Baptiſm, which inveſteth them in the benefits of the Covenant.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94077:49"/>
But withall that firſt, the profeſſed Infidel and his ſeed as ſuch, are not the Children of the promiſe, and therefore if the Parent ludicruoſly or forcedly, or the Child by errour be baptiſed, they have not thereby the pardon of their ſin before God. 2. That the Hypocrite that is not a true believer at the heart, though he profeſſe it, hath no pardon by Baptiſme before God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not an heir of the promiſe, nor yet any Infant of his as ſuch: But though ſuch are not pardoned, the Church that judgeth by profeſſion, taking Profeſſors for Believers, muſt accordingly uſe them &amp; their ſeed, 3. But though the Church judge thus cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably of each Profeſſor in particular, till his hypocriſy be detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet doth it underſtand that hypocrites there are, &amp; ſtill will be in the Church, though we know them not by name. And that therefore there are many externally baptiſed, and in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that never had the pardon of ſin, indeed before God; as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Condition of the promiſe of pardon: Such as <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> was. We have leſs reaſon to take this Doctrine for falſe, than that which pronounceth certain pardon, and ſalvation to all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed Infants whatſoever: And were we of their judgment, we ſhould think it the moſt charitable Act in the world to take the Infants of Heathens, and baptiſe them; And if any ſhould then diſpatch them all to prevent their lapſe, they were all certainly ſaved. We hope by (ſome reliques) you mean that which is truly and properly ſin. For our parts we believe according to the ninth Article, that Original ſin ſtandeth in the Corruption of the nature of every man, whereby man is far gone from Original righteouſneſſe, and inclined to evil; And that this infection of nature doth remain in the Regenerate; And though there is no Condemnation for them that believe and are baptiſed, yet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſence and Luſt, hath of it ſelf the nature of ſin.) you ſay, (The Church acknowledgeth ſuch deſires, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> Devices, and Deſires are Actual ſins and not Original, which conſiſteth in privation, and corrupt inclination: The next words <hi>(There is no health in us)</hi> it ſeems the Tranſlators that put it into the Liturgy miſ-underſtood; But however you ſeem here plainly by your miſ-interpretation to miſ-underſtand it. <hi>Nulla ſalus in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> is ſpoken actively and not poſſeſſively or paſſively, the plain ſence is, that there is no help deliverance and ſalvation in our ſelves: we cannot help our ſelves out of this miſery, but muſt

have a better Saviour; as Chriſt is oft called our ſalvation, ſo we are denied to be our own: ſo that yet here is no confeſſion at all of Original ſin, but of the effects; The two next ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces confeſſe a debility, and privation, but not that it was <hi>ab ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,</hi> but may for any thing that's there ſaid be taken to be ſince contracted; Nor are the words in this Confeſſion, but in ſome other Collects elſe where, which proves not that this Confeſſion ſaith any thing of Original ſin.</p>

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> As to your firſt rule we anſwer. 1. It is one thing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in general, that all be done decently and in order. This God
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94077:51"/>
himſelf hath impoſed by his Apoſtle: And its another thing to impoſe in particular, that this or that be uſed, as decent and orderly. Concerning this we adde, it is in the Text ſaid, Let it be done, but not let it be impoſed, yet from other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we doubt not but Circumſtances of meer decency &amp; order, as determined time, place, utenſils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are common to things civil, and ſacred, though not the Symbolical Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. which afterwards we confute) may be impoſed with the neceſſary cautions and limitations afterward laid down. But 1. that if any Uſurpers will pretend a power from Chriſt, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch things on the Church, though the things be lawful, we muſt take heed how we acknowledge an uſurped power by formal obedience. 2. A juſt power may impoſe them but to juſt ends, as the preſervation and ſucceſſe of the modified Worſhip, or Ordinances. And if they really conduce not to thoſe ends, they ſin in impoſing them. 3. Yet the Subjects are bound to obey a true Authority in ſuch impoſitions, where the matter belongs to the Cognizance, and Office of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and where the miſtake is not ſo great, as to bring great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er miſchiefs to the Church, than the ſuſpending of our active obedience would do. 4. But if theſe things be determined under pretence of order and decency, to the plain deſtruction of the ordinances modified, and of the intended end, they ceaſe to be means, and we muſt not uſe them. 5. Or if under the names of things decent, and of order, men will meddle with things that belong not to their Office, as to inſtitute a new Worſhip for God, new Sacraments, or any thing forbidden in the general Prohibition of adding or diminiſhing, this is a U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation, and not an act of Authority, and we are bound in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God to diſobey them. 6. Where Governours may command at ſet times, and by proportionable penalties enforce, if they command when it will deſtroy the end, or enforce by ſuch penalties, as deſtroy or croſſe it, they greatly ſin, by ſuch commands.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94077:52"/>
therefore we muſt adde: 1. A Judgement is a Sentence, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſome Execution, and Judgements are ſpecified from the ends, to which they are ſuch means; When the queſtion is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what Law ſhall be made, or what penalty ſhall be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? the Magiſtrate is the only Judge, and not the Biſhop or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subject, In the firſt he exerciſes his <hi>judicium diſcretionis</hi> in order to a publick Act. In the ſecond he exerciſeth a publick judgement: When the queſtion is, what order <hi>pro tempore</hi> is fitteſt in Circumſtantials for this preſent Congregation; the proper Presbyters or Paſtors of that Congregation, are the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective Judges, by Gods appointment. 3. The Magiſtrate is Ruler of theſe Paſtors, as he is of Phyſicians, Pailoſophers, and other Subjects. He may make them ſuch general Rules, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for reſtraint, to go by, as may not deſtroy the exerciſe of their own Paſtoral power: As he may forbid a Phyſician to uſe ſome dangerous Medicine on his Subjects, and may puniſh him when he wilfully killeth any of them: But may not on that preſence appoint him what, and how, and when, and to whom he ſhall adminiſter, and ſo become Phiſician himſelf alone. 4. When the queſtion is, who ſhall be excluded from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a particular Church? The Paſtors of the Church (or Congregation) are the firſt proper Judges. 5. When the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, who ſhall be excluded from, (or received into) the Communion of all the aſſociated Churches, of which we are naturally capable of Communion? The aſſociated Paſtors or Biſhops of theſe Churches in Synods are Judg<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>; Beyond this there are no Judges. 6. When the queſtion is, whether the Laws of Magiſtrates, or Canons of Biſhops, are agreeable or not to the Word of God, and ſo the obedience is lawful or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the Conſcience of each individual Subject is the Judge, <hi>per judicium diſcretionis,</hi> as to his own practiſe; And if men had not this judgement of diſcerning, but muſt act upon abſolute implicite obedience, then firſt man were ruled as unreaſonable, Secondly, the magiſtrate were made a God, or ſuch a Leviathan as <hi>Hobbs</hi> deſcribeth him; Thirdly, And then all ſin might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be committed, if commanded: But we are aſſured none of this your ſenſe.</p>

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> To your third Rule we adde; It is firſt conſiderable what the thing is, and then how it is apprehended, if it be really lawful, and well commanded, and to be obeyed, it is no igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, doubt or errour of the Subject that can exempt him from the duty of obeying; But it may enſnare him in a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſinning, whether he obey, or diſobey: For as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth him to obey, and alſo not to do that which man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, when God forbiddeth it; So he obligeth the erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, firſt to lay down his errours, and ſo to obey. But if a thing he forbidden of God, and commanded of man, and one man erroniouſly thinke it lawful, and that he ſhould obey, and another is in doubt between both, it is neither a duty, nor law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for either of them here to obey For mans errour changeth nor Gods Laws, nor diſobligeth himſelf from obedience; But this mans duty is both to lay by that errour, and to refuſe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but if the queſtion be only of the order of ſuch a perſons du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we anſwer; If the thing be really lawful, and obedience a duty, then he that doubteth or erreth, ſhould, if poſſible, ſuddenly lay by his errours or doubt, and ſo obey: But if that cannot be, he ſhould firſt go about the fitteſt means, for his better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation till he be reſolved, and ſo obey. And ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if really the thing commanded be unlawful, if he be ſure of it, he muſt reſolve againſt it; if he heſitate he is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore allowed to do a thing forbidden, becauſe he is ignorant: For his ignorance is ſupoſed culpable it ſelf, but he is firſt to conſult and uſe the beſt means, for his Inſtruction, till he know the truth, and in the mean time to ſuſpend his Act. But yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of humane frailty, between ſeveral faults, we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when we cannot avoid all as we would, in what order moſt ſafely to watch, and to avoid them. And ſo when I have done my beſt, and cannot diſcern whether a Command be juſt, and the thing lawful or not; If it have the face of Idolatry, Blaſphemy, or ſome hainous Sin; that is commanded, and our diſ-obedience have the appearance, but of an effect of involuntary ignorance, it is more excuſable in us to fear the greater Sin, and ſo to ſuſpend till we are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſatisfied, than to do that which we ſuſpect, to be ſo hainous a Sin, though in leed it prove no ſin; So on the contrary, if our diſobedience be like to bring Infamy, or Calamity on the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94077:53"/>
Church, and our Obedience appear to be but about a very ſmall ſin, if we doubt of it, it is more excuſable to obey, than to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, though both be faulty, ſuppoſing the thing to be indeed unlawful, and we diſcern it not. So that your Rule of obeying, where you are not as ſure, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Is an unſure Rule, unleſs as we have fullyer cautioned it.</p>

                  <hi>Repl.</hi> O that you would but do all that God alloweth you, yea that he hath commanded you, for theſe ends! how happy would you make your ſelves, and theſe poor afflicted Churches. But as to the inſtance of your Rule we anſwer. 1. When the indecency and diſorder is ſo ſmall as that it will not croſſe the ends, ſo much as our diſobedience would, we are here ſo far more conformable, and peaceable than you, as that we would even in Gods worſhip, do ſome things indecent, and diſorderly, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than diſobey; And ſo ſhould you do rather than deſtroy your Brethren, or hinder that peace, and healing of the Church. For Order is for the thing ordered, and not contrarily. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, there is much diſorder lies in the Common-Prayer-
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94077:53"/>
Book, yet we would obey in it, as far as the ends of our calling do require. It would be undecent to come without a Band, or other handſome raiment into the Aſſembly: yet rather than nor worſhip God at all, we would obey if that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us; we are as confident that Surplices, and Copes are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, and kneeling at the Lords Table is diſorderly, as you are of the contrary: And yet if the Magiſtrate would be advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by us (ſuppoſing himſelf addicted againſt you) we would adviſe him to be more charitable to you,, than you here adviſe him to be to us: We would have him, if your Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, to forbear you in this undecent and diſorderly way; But to ſpeak more diſtinctly. 1. There are ſome things decent and orderly, when the oppoſite ſpecies is not undecent or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly. 2. There are ſome things undecent, and diſorderly, in a ſmall and tolerable degree: And ſome things in a degree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. 1. When things decent are commanded, whoſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites would not be at all undecent, there Charity and Peace, and Edification, may command a Relaxation; or rather ſhould at firſt reſtrain from too ſevere Impoſitions: As it is decent to wear either a Cloak or a Gown, a Caſſock buttoned, or unbut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd, with a Girdle or without, to ſit, ſtand, or kneel in ſinging of a Pſalm, to ſit or ſtand in hearing the word read, or preached <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. When a Circumſtance is undecent or diſorderly, but in a tollerable degree, to an Inconvenience, Obedience, or Charity, or Edification, may command us to do it, and make it not only lawful, but a duty <hi>pro hic, &amp; nunc,</hi> while the preponderating Accident prevaileth. Chriſts inſtances go at leaſt as far as this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Prieſts in the Temple breaking the Sabbath blameleſly and <hi>Davids</hi> eating the Shew bread, which was lawful for none to eate ordinarily, but the Prieſts: And the Diſciples rubbing the ears of Corn: <hi>(I will have mercy &amp; not ſacrifice)</hi> is a Leſton that he ſets us to learn, when two duties come together, to prefer the greater, if we would eſcape ſin; And ſure to keep an able Preacher in the Church, or a private Chriſtian in Communion, is a greater duty <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> than to uſe a Ceremony, which we conceive to be decent; It is more orderly to uſe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tranſlation of the Scripture, than the worſe as the Common-Prayer-book doth; and yet we would have no man caſt out, for uſing the worſe: It is more orderly decent, and edifying, for the Miniſter to read all the Pſalms, than for the people to read each ſecond verſe; And yet we would not caſt out men from the Church or Miniſtry meerly for that diſorder, It is more order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94077:54"/>
and decent to be uncovered in divine worſhip, than cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And yet rather than a man ſhould take cold, we could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to hear a Chapter or Sermon covered: why (not much more) rather than he ſhould be caſt out. But let us come to the Application. <hi>It is no undecent diſorderly worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, to worſhip him without our Croſſe, Surplice, and kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the reception of the Sacrament.</hi> 1.

We appeal to the common judgment of the Impartial, whether in the nature of the thing, there be any thing that tells them, that it is undecent, to pray without a Surplice in the reading place, and not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to pray without in th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Signs are either arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expreſſions, of a mans own mind in a matter, where he is let free, or they are covenanting ſigns between us and God in the Covenant of Grace, to work Grace on us as moral cauſes, and to engage us Sacramentally to him; ſuch we conceive the Croſs in Baptiſme to be. The Preface to the Common Prayer-book ſaith <hi>(They are apt to teach and excite,</hi> &amp;c. Which is a moral operation of Grace: And the Canon ſaith <hi>It is an honourable badge, whereby the Infant is dedicated to him that died on the Croſs,</hi> We are ſigned with it (in token that hereafter we ſhall not be aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the faith of Chriſt crucified, and manfully to fight, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> now if a thing may be commanded meerly as a decent circumſtance of worſhip, yet it is unproved that a thing, that in its nature as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and in the primary intention is thus ſacramentally to dedicate and ingage us in Covenant to God, by ſignifying the grace and duty of the Covenant be lawfully commanded by man. 1.

The minor is proved thus, If it belong to the univerſal head, or Ruler of the Church as ſuch, then it belongs to the power proper to Chriſt (for we are ready to prove there is none under him, no univerſal head or ruler perſonally, or collectively and civilly one,) But <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If in the reaſon of it, it ſhould be the matter of an univerſal Law, if of any then it ſhould be the work of the univerſal Lawgiver, if any: But <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If in the reaſon of it, it be equally uſeful to the Church univerſal, as to any particular Church or age, then it ſhould according to the reaſon of it, be the matter of an univerſal Law, if of any: But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it hath the ſame aptitude, to engage us to a duty of univerſal neceſſity, and hath no reaſon proper to this age or place for it, but common to all.

But that the world ſhall run into confuſion, rather than we ſhall have leave to ſerve God as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did, without Croſſing, Surplices, and Kneeling at the Sacrament, and then that we ſhall be reproached as the cauſe of all by our diſobedience, God hath told the world by his word, and will tell them by his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that this is not his way to Unity and Peace.

The Apoſtle called thoſe weak that placed a neceſſity in indifferent things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, And not thoſe that underſtood their indifferency; But the truth is the nature of things indifferent, is not well undeſtood by all on either ſide, ſome may think evil of ſome things that deſerve it not, and in this they are weak, though in other matters they may be ſtrong. And for the reſt we ſpeak according to the worſt that you your ſelves can charitably ſuppoſe, you can ſay no more of them, but that they are weaker, that is, in this know leſſe than you, though perhaps we may take them to be ſtronger, that is, to be more in the right, yet are we nor ſo confident as to cenſure you, or others; but ſpeak of things difficult, and doubtful as they are. But how prove you it, we would take it ill, to be our ſelves, or have thoſe we ſpeak of accounted ignorant, in ſuch things as theſe uſe us no worſe than the ignorant ſhould be uſed: and till you would turn a man out of the Miniſtry, or Church for being ignorant of the nature of a Ceremony, (which never
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94077:57"/>
was in his Creed, the Decalogue or Scripture) dealt not ſo by us, that would be wiſer if we knew how. That all our ignorance is our own fault we deny not, but it is an expreſſe of confidence and uncharitableneſſe to rell us, that there is ſo very much written as may ſatisfie any man that hath a mind to be ſatisfied, and when we profeſſe in his ſight that knoweth the hearts, that we have a mind to be ſatisfied, and would know the truth at what rate ſoever if we knew how, what would you have us do that we do not, to be ſatisfied? Do we not read as much for Ceremonies, as the diſſenters uſe to do againſt them? Many Books againſt them are yet unanſwered, and we never ſhunned any publick, or private conference with any of you, and ſuch reaſonings as theſe are not like to convince us. If you will be the judges of your brethrens hearts, and ſay it is not tenderneſſe of Conſcience, but ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we ſhall refer that to the day when your hearts, and ours, ſhall be opened, Muſt none be tender Conſcienc'd that dare not venture to obey you in ſuch things? When you may with undoubted ſafety forbear the impoſing of your Ceremonies, and ſo forbear the caſting out of your brethren, if you will not, who ſhews leſſe tenderneſſe of Conſcience? That the ſcandal is taken and not given, is ſtill the thing in queſtion, as to many things: and if it were not juſt occaſion of oftence, you ought not to lay that which anothers weakneſſe will turn into a ſtumbling block unneceſſarily before them; if the Apoſtles Argument be good <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. the Church may not urge unlawful things, nor things meerly lawful upon ſuch penalties as will exclude things neceſſary. If an idle word be to be accounted for, an idle Law is not laudable, much leſs when all men muſt be excluded the Miniſtry, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion that ſcruple it: when yet a man may be a prophan ſwearer, for 12 pence an oath, and may ſwear an hundred times before he payes that 12 pence. A Papiſt ſhall pay 12 pence for not coming to Church, and a Proteſtant be thruſt out of your Communion, for not kneeling at the Sacrament, and a Miniſter ſuſpended, impriſoned, undone for not croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Child or wearing a Surplice: May Magiſtrates, or the Church thus urge their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? Can any thing be ſpoken plainer, than the Scripture ſpeaks againſt this courſe? And would you make the world believe that the brethren that do not all that you bid them are ſo unreaſonably and obſtinately ſcrupulons, as to have no matter of offence, but what they lay before themſelves? when they have the practice of the Apoſtles, and the cuſtom of the Primitive Church, for many hundred years againſt you, and this called by them an Apoſtolical tradition, and decreed by the moſt uncharitable Councils that ever were. If you had but one of theſe (the decree of a General Council, or practiſe of all the pureſt Churches alone) for one of your Ceremonies, you would think him uncharitable, that ſo reproached you for pretending Conſcience.</p>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> But becauſe at our laſt meeting it was ſaid with ſo much confidence by one, that the caſe in <hi>Rom,</hi> 14. and 15. was nothing to ours, we ſhall here ſay the more to what you ſay, that St. <hi>Pauls</hi> not eating fleſh is nothing to the purpoſe: your reaſons are, firſt, becauſe he ſpeaks of nothing commanded by God or his Church. Secondly, not of any thing of decency or ſignificancy to ſerve in the Church. To the firſt, we have oft told you, that which is undenyable; Firſt, that <hi>Paul</hi> was a Governour of that Church himſelf, that had no ſuperiour to controule him.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94077:57"/>
If you ſay that he then wrote not as a Governour; we anſwer, Yes: For he wrote as an Apoſtle, and wrote the Epiſtle that was to be a ſtanding Law or Canon to them: If this be not an act of his Office, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, there was none ſuch; And then you muſt ſay the like of all the reſt of the Epiſtles. 2ly: Moreover, as <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle excludeth all ſuch impoſitions; ſo he wrote to all the reſident Paſtours that were at <hi>Rome,</hi> for he wrote to the whole Church: and therefore theſe commands extend to the Governours, that they make not ſuch things the matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or Cenſuces, or any uncharitable Courſe, but bear with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in them. Will you call men obſtinate ſelf-offenders, that differ from you, when you have no better anſwers then theſe, to the plain deciſions of the Holy Ghoſt? What we ſpeak of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15. we ſpeak alſo of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. And 3ly. It is to the Rulers of the Church, that we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it is they that anſwer us: and ſhall the Rulers ſay [If it were not a thing commanded we might bear with you] when it is themſelves that command them eccleſiaſtically; and we intreat them but to forbear that, and to concurre with us in petitioning the King, to forbear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them coercively, who no doubt will eaſily for bear it, if they do their part. 4ly. Yea, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> it layeth a heavier charge on ſuch Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, then others: If it be ſo heynous a ſin as <hi>Paul</hi> maketh it, to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or deſpiſe one another, for meat, and daies, and ſuch like things; how much more to excommunicate, ſilence, and undo one another, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive thouſands of ſouls of the preaching of the Goſpel that conſented not to their Paſtours non-conformity? 5ly. <hi>Paul</hi> letteth you know, that theſe things are not the Center, or matter of our neceſſary concord, but of mutual forbearance, &amp; therefore condemneth all that will make them neceſſary to our united Miniſtry, or Communion. And the difference is wholly to the advantage of our cauſe: For thoſe that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake to, were not come ſo high as to go about to force others to do as they did: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſpiſe them for not doing it. 2. And therefore to your ſecond Reaſon we anſwer. 1. If the things had been different, yet ſo was <hi>Pauls</hi> injunction different from our Requeſt; For <hi>Paul</hi> goeth ſo high as to command them to deny their own liberty in not eating lawfull meats themſelves, leſt they offend and hurt their brethren: whereas we are now deſiring you, that you would not force others to do that which they take to be a ſin, and that with penalties that fall heavier on the Church then on them. They had on both ſides fairer pretences then you have: The Caſes before us to be compared, are four; The Caſe of the Refuſers of meats, and obſervers of daies then; The Caſe of the uſers of thoſe meats and non-obſervers of thoſe daies; The Caſe of our Impoſers; And the Caſe of non-Conformiſts. The pretence of their Refuſers of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94077:58"/>
meats had in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. was that being offered to Idols; they thought it made them partakers of the Idolatry, &amp; ſo they ſinn'd through weakneſs in being offended at others, and cenſuring them that uſed their liberty: And had they not here a fairer pretence, for their offence and cenſures, than you for your impoſitions? you cannot ſhew half ſo great an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of good in the things commanded, as they could do of evil in the things for which they were offended. And the offended cenſurer in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. had this pretence, that the thing was forbidden in Gods own Law, even the meats, which he refuſed; and the daies commanded which he obſerved: and he knew not that the Law in theſe matters of Order &amp; Ceremony was abrogated (which <hi>Peter</hi> was ignorant of, when he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to eat things common and unclean.) But you have no pretence of Gods own command, for the matter of your impoſitions, as theſe men had for the matter of their offence and cenſure, ſo that here you are in the worſer-ſide. And for the other party that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. abuſed their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. deſpiſed their brethren, they had a double pretence: one was that it was their liberty, and if every ſcrupulous party ſhould drive them from their lawfull meat and drink, they knew not whither they might drive them: another was, that the Law was abrogated by Chriſt; and therefore if they complied in practice with the ſcrupulous, or did not ſhew their difference, they might ſeem to be guilty of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of the Law, and complying with the Jews, and the Hereticks, that both then were enemies to the Church, and agreed in this: Had not theſe men now a far fairer pretence for eating 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſhewed <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. then you ever yet produced for forcing others from Miniſtry and Church into ſin and Hell, if they will not obey you againſt their conſciences, and all for that which you never pretended to ſhew a command of God for, and others ſhew you, as they think, Scripture and Councils, and cuſtomes againſt. To tell us then that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of things [not decent, and ſign ficant] is [pardon our plaineſs] to ſay much leſs then nothing: For it was not againſt impoſing that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake, but uſing, and not uſing cenſuring, and deſpiſing; And their Arguments were (ſutable to their cauſe) of another kind of moment, then decency, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency, ſignificancy or inſignificancy, even from ſuppoſed Idolatry, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting Gods Law, and complying with the Jews and Hereticks, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the Law, and caſting away the liberties purchaſed by Chriſt even in their private eating, &amp; drinking.

The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles worſhipped God as decently without them, as you do with them; the Miniſter prayeth in the Pulpit as decently without the Surplice, as in the reading place with it. 3d. <hi>Paul</hi> doth but exhort them to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted comlineſs, (as you may well do, if men will do any thing which nature or common reputation makes to be ſlovenly, unmannerly or indecent, as being covered in prayer or ſinging Pſalms, or any ſuch like, about which we will never differ with you,) but even here he talks not of force, or ſuch penalties as tend to the greater hurt of the Church, and the ruine of the perſon.</p>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> We know there wanteth not a <hi>Lindanus,</hi> a <hi>Coccius,</hi> to tell the world of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Liturgy, which yet prayeth that by the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> we may be defended, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and mentioneth <hi>Linus, Cletus, Clemens, Cornelius, Cyprian, Lucia, Barbara,</hi> and abundance ſuch: ſhall we therefore conclude, that there were Liturgies from the firſt? and that what is here conſentient to Antiquity, was in it? There wants not a <hi>Marg. de la Bigne, à Greg. de Valent. à Coccius</hi> to commend to us the Liturgy of <hi>Mark,</hi> that prayeth, <hi>Protege Civitatem iſtam proper Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrem tuum &amp; Evangeliſtam Marcum, &amp;c.</hi> And tells us, that the King where the Authour lived was an Orthodox Chriſtian, and prayeth for the Pope, Subdeacons, Lelors, Cantors, Monks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Muſt we therefore believe that all that's Orthodox in it is ancient? So there wants not a <hi>Bign. Bellarm.</hi> &amp;c. to tell us of S.

There wants not a <hi>Sainctetius,</hi> a <hi>Bellarm.</hi> a <hi>Valentia,</hi> a <hi>Pereſius</hi> to predicate the Liturgy of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> as bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to tranſubſtantiation, for the ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> for praying to Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When yet the exceeding diſagreement of Copies, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſome forms from <hi>Baſils</hi> ordinary forms, the prayers for the moſt pious and faithful Emperours, ſhew it unlikely to have been <hi>Baſils:</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny predicate Chryſoſtomes <hi>Maſſe</hi> or <hi>Liturgie,</hi> as making for praying to the dead, and for them, the propitiatory Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> &amp;c. when in one edition, <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> is prayed to in it, ſaith <hi>Cook:</hi> in another. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus,</hi> and <hi>Alexius</hi> that lived 1080 is mentioned: in another, doctrines are contained (as <hi>de Contaminata Maria)</hi> &amp;c. clean contrary to <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms</hi> doctrine: muſt we now conclude that all is ancient, that is Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, when one Copy is ſcarce like another? or can we try our <hi>Liturgies</hi> by ſuch as this? The ſhreds cited by you prove a <hi>Liturgie</hi> indeed, ſuch as we have uſed while the Common Prayer-book was not uſed, where the Pſalms, the words of Baptiſm, and the words of Conſecration, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration and delivery of the Lords Supper, and many other, were uſed in a conſtant form, when other parts were uſed as the Miniſter found moſt meet ſo <hi>Surſum Corda</hi> was but a warning before, or in the midſt of devotion, ſuch as our [Let us pray] and will no more prove that the ſubſtance of prayer was not left to the Miniſter's preſent or prepared Conceptions, than <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> will prove it.

in the council of Nice, which was in the 4th Century. And even then ſuch a particular teſtimony againſt the <hi>Arrians</hi> might well ſtand with a body of unimpoſed prayers, and rather ſhewes that in other things they were left at liberty; If the <hi>Benedicite,</hi> the <hi>Hymnes,</hi> or other paſſages here mentioned, will prove ſuch a <hi>Liturgy</hi> as pleaſeth you, we pray you bear with our way of worſhip, which hath more of <hi>Hymnes</hi> and other forms then theſe come to; That theſe <hi>Liturgies</hi> had no original from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councils addes nothing with us to their Authority, but ſheweth that they had an arbitrary original: and all ſet together, ſhews that then they had many <hi>Liturgies</hi> in one Prince's Dominion, and thoſe altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not forced, and that they took not one <hi>Liturgy</hi> to be any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary means to the Churches unity or peace, but bore with thoſe that uſed various at diſcretion. We well remember that <hi>Tertull,</hi> tells the Heathens that Chriſtians ſhewed by their conceived Hymnes, that they were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at their religious feaſts, it being their cuſtome <hi>[ut quiſque de ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſanctis, vel de proprio ingenio poteſt, provocetur in medium Deo canere] Apol. cap.</hi> 39.

                  </gap>. But if all theſe words ſeem not plain enough to ſome, it is no wonder when they reſt not in the greater plainneſs of the holy Scriptures, where prayer is ſo frequently mentioned, as much of the imployment of believers; and ſo many directions, encouragements and exhortations given about it: and yet no <hi>Liturgy</hi> or ſtinted forms, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lords prayer, is preſcribed to them, or once made mention of, no man directed here to uſe ſuch, no man exhorted to get him a Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, or to read or learn it, or to beware that he adde or diminiſh not: whereas the holy Scriptures that were then given to the Church, men are exhorted to read, and ſtudy, and meditate in, and diſcourſe of, and make it their continual delight: and it's a wonder that <hi>David,</hi> that menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it ſo oft in the 119. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> doth never mention the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book,</hi> if they had any: And that <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the houſe of Prayer without a Prayer-book, would onely begge of God, to hear [what Prayers, or what Supplication ſoever, ſhall be made

of any man, or of all the people of Iſrael, when every one ſhall know his own ſore, and his own grief, and ſhall ſpread forth his hands in that houſe] 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 29. and that he giveth no hint of any Liturgie or form, ſo much as in thoſe common Calamities; and talkes of no other book then the knowledge of their own ſores, and their own griefs: And in the Caſe of Pſalmes, or ſinging unto God; where it is certain, that they had a Liturgy or form, (as we have,) they are carefully collected, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and delivered to us, as a choiſe part of the holy Scripture. And would it not have been ſo with the prayers? or would they have been altogether unmentioned, if they alſo had been there preſcribed to, and uſed by, the Church, as the Pſalmes were? Would Chriſt and his Apoſtles, even where they were purpoſely giving rules for prayer, and correcting its abuſe, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. &amp;c. have never mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any forms but the Lord's Prayer, if they had appointed ſuch, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſuch to be impoſed, and obſerved? Theſe things are incredible to us when we moſt impartially conſider them. For our own parts, as we think it uncharitable to forbid the uſe of Spectacles to them that have weak eyes, or of Crutches to them that have weak Limbs; and as uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable to undo all that will not uſe them, whether they need them or not: ſo we can think no better of them, that will ſuffer none to uſe ſuch forms, that need them; or that will ſuffer none to pray, but in the words of other mens preſcribing, though they are at leaſt, as able as the preſcribers. And to conclude, we humbly crave, that ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes may not be uſed againſt themſelves, and us; and that you will not innovate, under the ſhelter of the name of Antiquity. Let thoſe things be freely uſed among us, that were ſo uſed in the pureſt primitive times. Let unity and peace be laid on nothing, on which they laid them not; let diverſity of Liturgies, and Ceremonies be allowed, where they allowed it. May we but have love and peace, on the Terms as the ancient Church enjoyed them, we ſhall then hope we may yet eſcape the hands of uncharitable deſtroying Zeal: we therefore humbly recommend to your obſervation the concurrent Teſtimony of the beſt Hiſtories of the Church concerning the diverſity of Liturgies, Ceremonies, and modal obſervances in the ſeveral Churches under one and the ſame civil Government: and how they then took it to be their duty to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear each other in theſe matters, and how they made them not the teſt of their Communion, or center of their peace. Concerning the obſervation of <hi>Eaſter</hi> it ſelf, when other Holy dayes, and Ceremonies were urged, were leſſe ſtood upon, you have the judgement of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops, in whoſe name he wrote in <hi>Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccl. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c:</hi> 23. Where they reprehend <hi>Victor</hi> for breaking peace with the

Churches, that differed about the day, and the antecedent time of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and tell him that the variety began, before their times, when yet they nevertheleſſe retained peace, and yet retain it; and the diſcord in their faſting declared, or commended the concord of their faith, that no man was rejected from Communion by <hi>Victor</hi>'s, predeceſſors on that account, but they gave them the Sacrament, and maintained peace with them, and particularly <hi>Polycarp,</hi> and <hi>Anicetus,</hi> held Communion in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> notwithſtanding this difference. <hi>Baſil Epiſt.</hi> 63 doth plead his cauſe with the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and whole Clergy of <hi>Neocaeſarea,</hi> that were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at his new <hi>Pſalmodie,</hi> and his new order of <hi>Monaſticks:</hi> but he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defendeth himſelf, and urgeth none of them to imitate him, but telleth him alſo of the novelty of their own Liturgy, that it was not known in the time of their own late renowned Bp. <hi>Greg Thaumaturgus,</hi> telling them that they had kept nothing unchanged to that day of all that he was uſed to, (ſo great alterations in 40. years were made in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation) as he profeſſeth to pardon all ſuch things, ſo be it the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal things be kept ſafe. <hi>Socrat.

And therefore becauſe men uſe to keep ſome Feſtivals, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing themſelves from labours, ſeveral perſons in ſeveral places, do cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, of cuſtom, the memorials of Chriſts paſſion arbitrarily, or at their own choice. For neither our Saviour, nor the Apoſtles commanded the keeping of them by any Law, nor threaten any mulct, or penalty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was the purpoſe of the Apoſtles not to make Laws for the keeping of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals, but to be Authours to us of the reaſon of right living, and of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And having ſhewed that it came up by private cuſtom, and not by Law, and having cited <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> as before he addeth, [that thoſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the ſame faith, do differ in point of Rites and Ceremonies] and inſtancing in divers, he concludeth that becauſe no man can ſhew in the monuments of writings, any Command concerning this, it is plain, that the Apoſtles herein permitted free power to every ones mind and will; that every man might do that which was good, without being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by fear, or by neceſſity.] And having ſpoken of the diverſity of cuſtomes, about the Aſſemblies, Marriage, Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He tells us that even among the <hi>Novatians</hi> themſelves, there is a diverſity in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their praying [and that among all the forms of Religions and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, you can no where find two, that conſent among themſelves in the manner of their praying.] And repeating the decree of the Holy Ghoſt,

He ſaith of <hi>Victor,</hi> and <hi>Polycarp,</hi> that [they deſervedly judged it frivolous, or abſur'd, that thoſe ſhould be ſeparated on the account of a cuſtom, that conſented in the principal heads of Religion: For you cannot find the ſame traditions in all things alike, in all Churches, though they agree among themſelves] and inſtancing in ſome Countries, where there is but one Biſhop in many Cities, and in other Biſhops are ordained in the Villages.] After many other inſtances, he adds that they uſe not the ſame prayers, ſingings or readings, nor obſerve the ſame time of uſing them.] And what Liturgy was impoſed upon <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour, or what Biſhops or Synods, were then the makers of Lyturgies, when he himſelf made publick pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for himſelf and auditory, and for his Souldiers? <hi>Euſeb. de vit.

But the diverſity, liberty, and change of Lyturgies in the Churches under the ſame Prince, are things ſo well known, as that we may ſuppoſe any further proof of it to be needleſs. In the concluſion therefore, we humbly beſeech you, that as Antiquity and the cuſtom of the Churches in the firſt ages, is that which is moſt commonly, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently pleaded againſt us, that your miſtake of Antiquity may not be to our Coſt, or paid ſo dear for, as the loſs of our Freedom, for the ſerving of God in the work of the Miniſtery to which we are called; we beſeech you let us not be ſilenced or caſt out of the Miniſtery or Church, for not uſing the Liturgy, Croſs, Surplice, kneeling at the Sacrament, till ye have either ſhewed the world that the practice or Canons of the Catholick Church hav<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

And make not that to neceſſary as to force men to it on ſuch dreadful terms, which the ancient Churches uſed with diverſity, and indifferency of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; we beſeech you ſhew the world ſome proof, that the ancient Churches did ever uſe to force, or require Miniſters to ſubſcribe to their Liturgies, as having nothing in them contrary to the word of God, or to ſwear obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Biſhops, before you impoſe ſuch things on us, while yet you pretend to imitate Antiquity. And have but that moderation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your brethren: as in ſuffering, or at death, or judgement, you would
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94077:63"/>
moſt appear. Remember how unpleaſing the remembrance of ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences about Ceremonies was to Bp. <hi>Ridley,</hi> as towards Bp. <hi>Hooper,</hi> when they were in priſon: and how the <hi>Arrians</hi> fury made the Orthodox gladly to go to the Churches of the <hi>Novatians,</hi> and meet with them and joyn with them in prayer, and had almoſt been united with them in the bond of Concord, if the <hi>Novatians,</hi> in a ſtiffe maintaining of their old cuſtomes had not utterly refuſed it; But yet in other matters they embraced each other with ſo ſingular a benevolence and love, that they would willingly have died for each other] as <hi>Socrat,</hi> tels us <hi>Hiſt. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 30. And may we not all here ſee our duty? When <hi>Atticus</hi> was urged to deny to the <hi>Novations</hi> the Liberty of then meetings within the City, he refuſed it, becauſe they had ſuffered for the faith, in the <hi>Arrians</hi> perſecution; &amp; changed nothing in the faith, though they ſeparated from the Church: and was ſo far from violence againſt diſſenters, as that he gave large relief to them, that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from him in Religion, <hi>Socrates Hiſt. l.</hi> 7 <hi>c.</hi> 25. It was the much praiſed ſaying of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to him that asked him, Why he put none to death that wronged him. [I would I could rather make them that are dead alive] <hi>Socrates l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 22. Much more ſhould Chriſtian Bps. be enemies to cruelty who know that Charity is more eſſentiall to Chriſtianity then this, or that form of Liturgy, or Ceremonies. If you think it unſufferable that we ſhould have differences about ſuch things, remember that there will be no perfect Unity till there is perfect Charity, and ſanctity; and that deſtroying one another, and conſequently deſtroying Charity, is an unhappy way to Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And that Unity is to be held in things neceſſary, &amp; Liberty in things unneceſſary, and Charity in both: remember that it was in a far greater difference, where <hi>Conſtantine</hi> perſwadeth the Chriſtians to mutuall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance by the example of the Philoſophers, that ſuffered differences in abundance of their opinions, <hi>Euſeb. de vita Conſtant. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 67. And that <hi>Valens</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> was made more moderate, and abated his perſecution of the Orthodox by the Oration of <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> who bid him not wonder at the diſſentions of Chriſtians; for they were ſmall if compared with the multitude &amp; cloud of opinions that are among the heathen Philoſophers, as being more then 300. And that God will by his diverſity of opinions manifeſt his glory and make men the more reverence him, who is ſo hardly known] <hi>Socrat. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 27. Thoſe that diſſent from you in theſe colerable Caſes cannot change their own Opinions; But you can, if you will, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear hurting of your brethren. Do that which you can do; rather then urge them by unſutable means to that which they cannot do. Theſe are not matters ſufficient to juſtify contention, &amp; uncharitable uſage of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. When many of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> faction petitioned the good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Jovianus</hi> to depoſe thoſe that affirmed the ſon to be unlike the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

and to put their party in their places, he gave them no anſwer but this [I hate contention; and I love and honor them that are addicted to concord] <hi>Socrat. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 21. [Then, ſaith <hi>Euſeb Hiſt. l</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 1. did the Lord obſcure the daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> and caſt down the glory of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. When thoſe that ſeemed our Paſtors, rejecting the rule of godlineſs, were inflamed among themſelves with mutual contentions, &amp; drove on only thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, threatnings, emulations, mutual hatred and enmity, &amp; the like, Tyrants proſecuted their Ambitions]. We thought it no impertinent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion here to take this occaſion again to crave your exerciſe of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Charity, and our enjoyment of the ancient Liberty, inſtead of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the anciently free Liturgy, and Ceremonies, and that by impropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable penalties; And if yet we cannot prevaile with you, we ſhall ſtill beg for peace of the God of peace, where we have better hopes to be heard and ſhall hold on in ſeeking it, how ill ſoever our endeavours may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted or ſucceed. And as the good man wept, <hi>Socrat. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 18. when he ſaw a woman pompouſly adorned, becauſe he was not ſo carefull to pleaſe God, as ſhe was to allure men: ſo we ſhall confeſs we ought to weep, that we cannot be more Charitable, &amp; laborious in building up the Church in holineſs and peace, then others are by uncharitable courſes, to afflict it. And it ſhal be our hope that whether by their labours, or their ſufferings, God will ſerve and honor himſelf, by thoſe many faithful ſervants of his, whom he hath called into his work, and whoſe cauſe we plead, and that however they are uſed they ſhal not be unuſeful to the ends of their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As <hi>Theodoret</hi> obſerves <hi>Hiſt l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 30. that in a Calamitous time, [the Moderator of the Univerſe raiſed up ſuch guides as were ſufficient, in ſo great a fluctuation, and oppoſed the valour of the Leaders, to the greatneſs of the enemies incurſion, &amp; gave the beſt remedies in the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt times of Peſtilence.] ſo that the baniſhed Paſtors did from the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the earth corroborate their own, and refute the adverſaries by their writings] And for ourſelves, as we were truly deſirous to do our parts to preſerve your reputation with the flocks, in order to the ſucceſs of your Government for their good, and never envied you, even that worldly honour or revenew, which yet ſome have thought unſutable to the ſimplicity and employment of Chriſts Miniſters: ſo if you will neither ſuffer us quietly to ſerve God or conſcionably to ſerve you, we ſhal be the leſs ſollicitous for that part of our task, from which you have power to diſcharge us. And as <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaid to <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour that would have him pray for the life of his Son [If thou wilt receive the true faith, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Churches to concord, thy ſon ſhal live, which when he refuſed, he ſaid [The will of God then be done with thy Son,] ſo we ſay to you: If you will put on Charity, and promote your brethrens and the Churches

peace, God will honour you, and good men will honour you, and your calling will have advantage by it. But if you will do contrary, the Will of the Lord be done with your honours. But know that them that honour him, he will honour, and thoſe that deſpiſe him ſhall be lightly eſteemed: and that by the courſe of uncharitable violence, which we deprecate, you will moſt deeply wound the Cauſe of your Preheminence, even more than its adverſaries could have done. And if it be the will of God, that ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at home where we have ſerved him, muſt be our Lot, we doubt not but he will furniſh us with ſtrength, and patience, and we ſhall remember ſuch enſamples as <hi>Ruffin</hi> recordeth, <hi>Hiſt. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3.

Who ever called them ſo? And if by the Church you mean the Miniſter, and by preſenting, you mean baptizing them, then any Heathen's child that a Miniſter can catch up and baptize ſhall be ſaved: which if it could be proved, would perſwade us to go hunt for children in <hi>Turkie, Tartary,</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> and ſecretly baptize them in a habit, that ſhould not make us known. But there is more of fancy then charity in this; and Chriſt never invited any to him, but the children of the promiſe to be thus preſented and baptized.</p>

If we have not here neither, a judgment of diſcretion, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our own actions, What do we with reaſon? Why are we truſted in the Office? and, Whoſe judgment muſt we follow? The Biſhop cannot have leiſure to become the Judge whether this man be penitent. It muſt then be the Miniſter, or the man himſelf; And muſt we abſolve every man that ſaith he repenteth? Then we muſt believe an incredible profeſſion, which is againſt reaſon: Some are known Infidels, and in their health profeſs that they believe not the Scripture to be true, and make a mock at Jeſus Chriſt; and perhaps, in a ſickneſs, that they apprehend no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in, will ſend for the Miniſter in ſcorn, to ſay [I repent] and force him to abſolve them, that they may deride him, and the Goſpel. Some of us have known too many of thoſe that have for twenty, or thirty years been common drunkards, ſeldom ſober a week together, and ſtill ſay when they came to themſelves, that they were ſorry for it, and did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly repent; and as they ſaid in health, ſo they ſaid in ſickneſs, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with in a few daies or weeks after they were laſt drunk: muſt we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all theſe? Some dye with a manifeſt hatred of an Holy Life, reviling at thoſe that are carefull to pleaſe God; yet ſaying, they hate them not as holy, but becauſe they are all Hypocrites, or the like: And yet will ſay, they repent of their ſins. Some forbear not their accuſtomed ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and curſing while they profeſs repentance. Some make no reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the wrong which they ſay they repent of: And muſt we take all theſe for truly penitent? If not; the Miniſter muſt judge. What you mean by your ſaying, (Our Churches direction is according to the 13th Canon of the venerable Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> both here and in the next that follows) we know not: the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice</hi> you cannot mean (its Can. being uncertain) and the 13th is of no ſuch ſenſe.

This ſhews they then took not up with every word of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penitence as true repentance, but what it is to your purpoſe we know not, nor is here any other Can. in that Council for you: The 11th Can. is ſufficiently againſt you. The lapſed that truly repented, were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main among the penitent for three years; and ſeaven years more, if they were <hi>fideles, &amp;c.

                     <hi>Reply.</hi> It is a Controverſy among the Learnedſt Expoſitors, how much of that of <hi>John</hi> 20. was proper to the Apoſtles, and ſuch others as were then to have the ſpirit in an extraordinary manner, who did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin effectively by remitting the puniſhment of it, by caſting out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, healing the ſick, &amp;c. according to that of <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 14, 15. Is any ſick among you, let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray for him, and anoint him with Oyl, in the name of the Lord; And the prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up; and if he have committed ſins, they ſhall be forgiven him. If beſides this remitting them effectively, the reſt be no other then a Miniſterial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing them forgiven by God according to his Covenant in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, then you cannot plead the phraſe of a Text, which reſpecteth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of Remiſſion then we pretend to: But muſt phraſe it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of the thing, and the ſenſe of other Scriptures alſo that fullier open it; There are three waies of pardoning, 1. By grant or Guift, (whether by a general Act of pardon, or a particular.) 2. By ſentence. 3. By execution; that is, preventing, or taking off, the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: The firſt of theſe is done already by God in the Goſpel. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, God doth principally, and his Miniſters inſtrumentally as his Meſſengers: The third (the taking off the penalty) they can do no otherwiſe in the Caſe before us, then by praying that God will take
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94077:80"/>
it off, and uſing his ordinary means. So that it is moſt evident, that this Abſolution that Miniſters are to perform, can be no other then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the penitent Believer to be abſolved by God according to his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: And if there be no other, ſhould we not ſpeak as intelligibly as we can? Indeed there is more in abſolving the excommunicate; for then the Church both judiciouſly, and executively, remitteth the penalty of excommunication (to which alſo the Text <hi>John</hi> 20. may have much reſpect) but the penalty of damnation can be no otherwiſe remitted by us, then as is expreſſed. And indeed the thing is of ſuch exceeding weight, that it behoveth us to deal as intelligibly and openly in it, as we can. And therefore we admire that you ſhould ſay (the Condition needs not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, being always neceſſarily underſtood) by neceſſarily do you mean, <hi>neceſſitate naturali, &amp; irreſiſtibili?</hi> ſo that all the wicked men in the world cannot chuſe but underſtand us, to ſpeak conditionally? Surely this is none of your meaning; if it were, it were far from truth: Or do you mean not <hi>de neceſſitate vel actitudine eventus,</hi> but <hi>de debito ex obligatione?</hi> no doubt but it is neceſſary as a duty, and alſo <hi>ad finem</hi> as a means: And therefore it is, that we deſire it may be expreſſed. And doubtleſs you think not that all men do their duties, and underſtand all that they ought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: no not in this particular. If you mean that all ſick men may be rationally ſuppoſed to underſtand it; this can never be believed by us that are acquainted perſonally (and have been) with ſo many of whom it is not true. How many think the Miniſter's Abſolution, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will ſerve turn, with their unſound hypocritical repentance? how eaſily is that underſtood abſolutely, or as bad, while they take you to take it for granted, that they have the Condition, which is abſolutely expreſſed.</p>

But why muſt we give the Sacrament to thoſe that have lived in groſs ignorance, Infidelity, and prophaneneſs, and never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted credibly, that they repent? You ſay that (whoſoever deſireth the Sacrament, according to the Rubrick, muſt in charity be preſumed to be penitent.) But where hath God commanded or approved ſo blind &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an act as this, under the name of Charity? the ordinary obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94077:81"/>
of our lives, is not to be confuted by mens Aſſertions: we know by ſad experience, that there's abundance of the worſt of men among us, that are deſirous to receive this Sacrament when they are ſick, that give no credible evidence of true repentance; but ſome in the ignorance, &amp; deceit of their hearts; &amp; ſome as conſcious of their impiety, for which they ſeek any ſhifting remedy to quiet their Conſciences, for the time, are much more eager for this Sacrament in their ſickneſs, then many better and more penitent perſons. And muſt we judge all theſe penitent, and give them the Sacrament as ſuch? we muſt needs profeſſe that we think this Courſe would not be the leaſt effectual ſervice unto Satan, to deceive poor ſinners, and keep them from knowing their miſery, and ſeeking aright after the true remedy in time. Pardon us, while we lay together the parts of your Doctrine, as we underſtand it here delivered; and leave it to your Conſideration, what a Church, and what a Miniſtry it would make. 1. All Infants of any Parents in the world that we can baptize, are undoubtedly regenerate, and in a ſtate of life, and ſhall be ſaved, if they ſo die. 2. The Holy Ghoſt, and Forgiveneſſe of ſin, being then given them; it is charitably preſumed that they have not totally loſt this, notwithſtanding the frailties and ſlips of their Child-hood; and ſo when they can ſay the Catechiſm, they are to be confirmed. 3. Being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, they are to be admitted to the Lords Supper. 4. All that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and others, thrice a year muſt receive the Lords Supper (though unfit.) 5. The Miniſter muſt abſolve all the ſick, that ſay they repent: (if we underſtand you) for we ſuppoſe you allow not the Miniſter to be Judge. 6. This Abſolution muſt be abſolutely expreſſely (I abſolve thee from all thy ſins) without the Condition (if thou repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.) 7. Whoſoever deſireth the Communion in his ſickneſs, muſt in charity be preſumed to be penitent, and fit to receive. 8. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt not have power to forbear ſuch Baptizing, Abſolving, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Communion as aforeſaid (we now omit what's ſaid of the dead at Burial.) And if this be not the ready way to hinder thouſands, from the neceſſary knowledge of their unrenewed hearts, and lives, and from true repentance, and from valuing Chriſt as the Remedy, and from making a neceſſary preparation for death, and alſo the way to lay by abundance of faithful conſcionable Miniſters, that dare not take ſuch a deceiving dangerous Courſe; we muſt confeſs our ſelves much miſtaken in the nature of mans corruption, and miſery, and the uſe of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for his recovery.</p>

But ſuppoſe we cannot be infallibly certain, that the man is damned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is poſſible that he may repent, though he never did expreſs it: will you therefore take him for a brother whoſe ſoul is taken to God in mercy? You are not ſure that an excommunicate perſon, or an Heathen, doth not truly repent after he is ſpeechleſs: But will you therefore ſay, that all ſuch die thus happily? This is a moſt deluſory Principle. The Church judgeth not of things undiſcovered: <hi>Non eſſe &amp; non apparere,</hi> are all one as to our Judgment; we conclude not peremptorily, becauſe we pretend not here to infallibility. As we are not ſure that any man is truly penitent, that we give the Sacrament to; ſo we are not ſure that any man dieth impenitently. But yet we muſt uſe thoſe as penitent, that ſeem ſo to reaſon, judging by ordinary means, and ſo muſt we judge thoſe as impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, that have declared their ſin, and never declared their repentance. It ſeems by you, that you will form your Liturgy, ſo as to ſay, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is ſaved, that you are not ſure is damned, though he ſhew you no repentance; and ſo the Church ſhall ſay, that all things are, that are but poſſible, if they conceit that Charity requireth it. But if the living by this be kept from Converſion, and flattered into Hell, will they there call it Charity, that brought them thither?
