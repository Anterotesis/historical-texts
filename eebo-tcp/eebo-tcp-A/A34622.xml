            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

find themſelves inſenſibly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for want of ſeaſonable Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, that would eaſily have ſet them right, and amongſt others that may prove exceeding uſeful, you are preſented with one by a Learned Gentleman, ſometimes a <hi>Conſul</hi> for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> who made it his Buſineſs, for <hi>Sixteen</hi> Years, to viſit all the Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Places in <hi>Europe;</hi> and has given ſuch an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them in all Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Particulars, that no Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt r an has, as yet, come up with him in an even line, but are behind by many degrees; laying a perpetual obligation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the Countryes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for being ſo faithfully particularized: <hi>England</hi> indeed
<pb facs="tcp:57761:4"/>
is but lightly touched on, yet ſo as many things of weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are in this Book revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as it were, from O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blivion, and Tranſactions of former Reigns impartially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
            <p>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces owe much to this <hi>Ingenious Pen,</hi> which has lively drawn every thing, that is Rare, and Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, in their Laws, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, raiſing Taxes, Shipping, their Bank, <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, Frugality, Wars, and Trade in moſt parts of the known World; with many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Deliverances that Common-Wealth has, in late years, been Bleſſed with from the Inſults and Tyranny of <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57761:4"/>
&amp;c. And by what Pollicies they have defeated their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and Enriched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>The ſame, or to the like purpoſe, in this Book is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in <hi>Denmark, Sweed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> and the principal Towns of the <hi>German</hi> Empire, <hi>Italy,</hi> and other Places, with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Remarks on <hi>France,</hi> and the Affairs of that Kingdom, all of it being Interwoven with many Curious Relations of divers Strange Things, where a Digreſſion is any ways propper, or that they may fall in ſmoothly, without infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much on the Patience of the Reader; it being in the

            <p>This Famous Piece was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten indeed in <hi>Holland,</hi> but now comes over ſpeaking <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> that this Nation might not be ignorant of ſo laboured a Work, the Remarking of which in ſo many ſundry Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without borrowing, or that but a very little, from any Hiſtorians, that had lightly touched on them before, muſt, beyond all per adventure, require,
<pb facs="tcp:57761:5"/>
as well as it did a large time, great Coſt and Induſtry, and indeed the Authors ſtile and method ſpeaks him no leſs than a man fitly qualified for ſuch an undertaking, not leaving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing unpried into, that is propper to be a link in the Chain of his Diſcourſe; for though the Volumn boaſts not of largeneſs in the number of Sheets, yet in what it treats on, it is very Copious, a great deal of ſenſe being comprized in few words, which is the proppereſt way of Writing, and moſt pleaſing to the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>

            <head>Some Neceſſarie REMARKS for ſuch as Entend to TRAVEL Thro the Province of HOLLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S they that confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie have not the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to ſee and obſerve Rarities in other parts of the world: ſo ſuch as goe into forrain places, rather wander at Random then travel, who hane not the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie to Commit to memorie or writing ſuch things they meet with, both for thier own and others Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as may Demonſtrate the fruits of their travels.</p>
            <p>I Confeſſe all Travellers are not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57761:8"/>
of alike Temper: Some delight themſelves in contemplation of the curioſities of <hi>Arts,</hi> ſom are taken with the varieties of the works of nature, others ſpeculate with a kind of Reverence the decays and ruins of <hi>Antiquitie,</hi> others ſtudiouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves with the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of <hi>Modern tymes,</hi> others with thee <hi>Gouvernment</hi> and <hi>Politie,</hi> other ſpeculate the ſtrange cuſtoms and faſhion of the places they paſſe thro; To be ſhort everie one labors to entertain the reader with thoſe objects and rarities of forain parts, his <hi>Genius</hi> and inclination is moſt affected with.</p>
            <p>As to my ſelf, although during the ſpace of 16 yeaves travel, I might have inlarged, according to the curioſitie and opportunitie I have had in the rehearſal of many rare and exquiſite things verie obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: yet my chiefe aime was to make ſuch remarks, as might moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the common good of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

ſociety and civil life, in taking notice of the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> of the ſeveral <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> where I have been, viz. The <hi>

               </gap>on to do ſome good to my own countrie. Expect not <hi>Reader</hi> alike punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to all the forementioned pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe very many things which I might have obſerved, are much agreeing, and ſo may be referred, to what ſhall be ſpoken of the <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> which, for reaſons I ſhall by and by hint at, is the Chief End I aimed at in this treatiſe.</p>
            <p>We will begin then in the firſt place with the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> and Dominions of the <hi>States General</hi> which for ſome years
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57761:9"/>
hath been in a declining condition, and their forces exceedingly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kned, by reaſon of that fatal War it managed againſt <hi>England, France</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Munſter,</hi> that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick body</hi> was ſo tottered and torn, as did threaten its utter and total ruine.</p>
            <p>But as bodies whisher <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>Politick,</hi> after that a violent fit hath ſore ſhaken, diſſipated and exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted their ſpirits, may recover vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and look lively again, if ſo be radical conſtitution and natural temper be not wholly changed and depraved: even ſo This <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> hath viſibly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſtrength again and probably may attain to its former force and <hi>Luſtre,</hi> except ſome depravation in its vital humours ſhould ſtill keep it languiſhing, and obſtruct its perfect cure.</p>
            <p>We will therefore make ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57761:9"/>
as to the defects and faylings (obſerved not onely by me but alſo by others) which that famous <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> hath of late yeares bin guiltie of: which I ſhal doe not out of any malice or diſigne of reflection, the intention of writing this treatiſe being ſimplie to inſert thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults, which the wiſeſt of Authors have alwayes Judged neceſſarie not onely for the reformation of this, but of all <hi>ſtates</hi> whatſoever.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> hath worthily bin the wonder of all Europe during this laſt age, and perhaps not to be paralled in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of former tymes: for if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how many yeares it was aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the then moſt <hi>Potent Prince</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> who aſpired to no les then the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Empire,</hi> and that how formidable ſoever he were, yet they not onely maintained their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but with uninterrupted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie and ſuccesfulneſſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their trade, and ſpread their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57761:10"/>
conqueſts in all the foure parts of the world.</p>

               <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf though moſt famous and victorious, yet could not, as is believed, in ſo ſhort a time do, what by this <hi>Commonwealth</hi> hath bin effected. In <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Affrica</hi> they ſoon forced the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>Portugeſes</hi> to yeeld to them moſt of their trade and poſeſſions. And tho <hi>England</hi> put in for a ſhare, yet they were a long while vigourouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to this hour have enough to do, to keep what they have gotten: ſo that in leſſe then an hundred years this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> by their induſtrie and art in trading, are becom ſo exceſſive rich and potent that they began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and would needs be Arbitraters to their neighbourning <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> and encroach upon their <hi>Territories</hi> and <hi>Dominions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This drew upon them that fatal war before mentioned, by which they were ſorely weakned and brought
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57761:10"/>
ſo low, that except God by a more then ordiharie <hi>Providence</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and appeared for them, they had certainly bin ruinated and never able to recover themſelves again, however their pride hereby was much abated: And as Luxurie and laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes are the ſad effects of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as wel as Pride, ſo ſuch vices in a <hi>bodie Politick</hi> and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, as do corrupt the radical hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, by abating the vigour of the Vital parts, doe inſenſible tend to the conſumption and decay of the whole.</p>
            <p>That this Commonwealth hath much recovered its ſtrength, may clearly appeare, if we conſider what great things they have effected, ſince the little time they have enjoyed peace: They have in leſſe then 7 yeares built about 40 gallant ſhips of war; They have laid out vaſt ſums of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in refortifying <hi>Narden, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht, Breda,</hi> the <hi>Grave</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places: They have payd
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57761:11"/>
vaſt ſums of money to their Allies for their auxiliarie troopes, as alſo 200000 pound ſterling to the King of England to Enjoy their peace with him. And beſides all this their Encreaſe in Riches and power may be gueſt at, by the many ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſes built within theſe 5 years in Amſterdam, Rotterdam and other places; to all which we may ad, to what exceſſive hight the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indie</hi> Companie are riſen, and the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations from the Sates are ſo eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as to ſecuritie, that they Can get as much money as they pleaſe at 2 <hi>Per cent:</hi> not to ſpeak, of the Exceeding encreaſe of their ſubjects, occaſioned by the <hi>French Kings</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie againſt the diſtreſſed <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> in <hi>France, Alſace</hi> and other parts of his <hi>Conqueſts,</hi> neither wil we ſpeak of other ſignes of the encreaſe of this <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> as not Judging it convenient to commit them to paper, but wil now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

            <p>The <hi>Brill</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> is the Uſual place where the <hi>Packet</hi> and Kings <hi>pleaſure boats</hi> bring on ſuch as come for to ſee the United Provinces: here be ſure to furniſh your ſelf wel with money. From hence you take a boat to <hi>Maſeland Sluce</hi> or <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> which if you goe in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie with others, wil only coſt you 5 ſtivers: but if you take one for your ſelf, wil coſt 25. ſtivers for <hi>Maſeland Sluce,</hi> and a <hi>Ducaton</hi> to <hi>Rotterdam.</hi> The Fifth part of which goes to the <hi>States</hi> for a tax, they call <hi>Paſſagie Gelt:</hi> and the other 4 parts are for the boat-Men or Shippers, who alſo out of their gaines muſt Pay a <hi>tax</hi> to the <hi>States,</hi> ſo that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation you pay a fift pennie to the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57761:12"/>
               <hi>States</hi> for your travelling either in boats by water, or in waggons by land.</p>
            <p>As you paſſe by <hi>Maſeland Sluce</hi> you'l ſee a verie faire fiſhing village, to which belong near two hundred <hi>Herring Buiſſes,</hi> but if you goe by the way of <hi>Rotterdam</hi> you ſail by two old Townes Called <hi>Flardin</hi> and <hi>Schiedam:</hi> yet let me adviſe you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you depart from the <hi>Bril,</hi> to take a ſerious view of it, as beeing the citie which in <hi>Queen Eliſabeths</hi> time was one of the <hi>Cautionarie Townes</hi> pawned to <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Brill</hi> had a voyce among the <hi>States,</hi> but by reaſon <hi>Rotterdam</hi> hath got away their Trade, by which having loſt its former luſtre, is now become afiſhing town onely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rotterdam</hi> is the ſecond Citie for trade in <hi>Holland</hi> and by ſome is caled <hi>little London,</hi> as having vaſt traffick with <hi>England,</hi> in ſo much that many of the citiſens ſpeak good Engliſh. There are in this citie two
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57761:12"/>
conſiderable Churches of Engliſh and Scotch: and how great a trade they drive with the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Englands</hi> ſubjects is evident, for in the yeare 1674 at the opening of the waters after a great froſt, there departed out of <hi>Rotterdam</hi> 300 Sail of Engleſh, Scotch and Iriſh Ships at once with an Eaſterly wind: And if a reaſon ſhould be demanded how it coms to paſſe, that ſo many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Ships ſhould frequently com to that haven? It is caſilie anſwered, becauſe they can ordinarily Load and unload, and make returns to England from <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> before a Ship can get clear from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> and the <hi>Texel:</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Engliſh Merchants find it Cheaper and more commodious for trade, that after their goods are arrived at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> to ſend their goods in boats Landward in, to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This citie is famous as beeing the place where Great <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57761:13"/>
born, whoſe Statue of Braſſe ſtands erected in the Market place; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the buldings here are not ſo ſuperb as thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam, Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> or <hi>Harlem,</hi> yet the places worth the ſeeing, are, firſt the <hi>Great Church</hi> where Several <hi>Admirals</hi> Lay State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Entombed, here you ſee their <hi>Admiraltie, Eaſt Indie,</hi> and <hi>Stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes</hi> together with that caled, <hi>hot Gemeen Lands Huis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Rotterdam</hi> you may for 5 ſtivers have a boat to bring you to Delph, but before you com thither you paſſe thro a faire village called <hi>Overſchie,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> youths are trayned up in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, as to the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> tongue, <hi>Booke keeping,</hi> &amp;c: from thence in the ſame boat you com to <hi>Delph</hi> which is famous for making of Porceline to that degree, that it much reſembles the China, but onely it is not tranſparent.</p>
            <p>In Delph is the great <hi>Magaſin</hi> of <hi>Arms</hi> for the whole <hi>Province</hi> of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57761:13"/>
               <hi>Holland:</hi> Their churches are verie large, in one of which are <hi>Tombs</hi> of the <hi>Princes of Orange, Admiral Tromp</hi> and General Morgans Ladie, and in the Cloyſter over againſt the Church you have an Inſcription in a Pillar of Braſſe, ſhewing after what manner <hi>William</hi> the 1, that famous Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was Shot to death by a miſcreant <hi>Jeſuiſt,</hi> with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Delph</hi> hath the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> voyce in the <hi>States of Holland,</hi> and ſends its Deputies unto the Colledge of the <hi>States General,</hi> and to all other col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> They have alſo a Chamber in the <hi>Eaſt-Indie Companie,</hi> as ſhal be more largely ſpoken to, when we ſhal com to treat of the State of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Delph</hi> you may by boat be brought to the <hi>Hague</hi> for 2 Stivers and an halfe: Which is accounted the faireſt Village in the world, both for Pompous buildings and the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57761:14"/>
thereof; Here the <hi>Princes of Orange</hi> hold their Reſidence: as alſo the <hi>States General</hi> and the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of State,</hi> Here you have the <hi>Courts of Juſtice, Chancerie,</hi> and other <hi>Courts of Law.</hi> Here you ſee that <hi>Great Hall,</hi> in which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hundreds of coulers are hung up in <hi>Trophie,</hi> taken from the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, Spaniard</hi> and other <hi>Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates</hi> with whom they have waged war. There <hi>Councel Chambers</hi> are admired by all that ſee them. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faire <hi>Libraries</hi> they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to particular men. The <hi>Princes Pallace</hi> is a moſt ſuperb building, And there are many coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Gardins adjoyning to the <hi>Hague,</hi> together with that to the <hi>Princes houſe</hi> in the <hi>Woad,</hi> in which houſe are in a large Hall the moſt rare and coſtly Pictures of Europe, there alſo are thoſe magnificent and unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gardins of the Heer <hi>Bentham,</hi> of <hi>Ameſland</hi> and others. I might here ſpeak of the ſplendor of the <hi>Prince</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57761:14"/>
of <hi>Orange</hi> his <hi>Court,</hi> of his noble virtues and valour, of the moſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and Beautiful Princeſſe his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al confort, but I dare not, leaſt I ſhould infinitely fal ſhort of what ought to be, and which others have alreadie don before me: and therfore leaving the <hi>Hague,</hi> I ſhal onely tel you that from thence you may for 7 Stivers have a boat to bring you to <hi>Leyden. Leyden</hi> is a faire and great citie, and the Univerſitie is verie famous, beeing frequented by 1000 of Students from all parts, as <hi>Hungarie, Poland, Germanie,</hi> yea from the <hi>Ottomans Empire</hi> it ſelf, who pretend to be grecians, beſides the Engliſh, Scots and Iriſh, who this years were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to be above 80.</p>
            <p>The moſt remarkable things here to be ſeen, I ſhal ſummarilie ſet down: As the place called the <hi>Bergh,</hi> formerly a <hi>Caſtle</hi> belonging to the Prince of <hi>Liege</hi> in <hi>Flanders:</hi> The <hi>Stathowſe,</hi> the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitie</hi> Schooles,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57761:15"/>
ſpecially that of the <hi>Anatomie,</hi> which excels all the <hi>Anatomie</hi> Schooles in the world, a Book of the rarities whereof you may have for 6 Stivers, their <hi>Phyſick Garden,</hi> and the Profeſſors <hi>Cloſet</hi> are al raviſhing in rare Curioſities. But as to their <hi>Colledges,</hi> they are but two and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſmall, not ro be compared with the ſmalleſt <hi>Hals</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they any endowments, their maintenance being onely from the charitable collections of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> neyther are any Students to remain longer there, then til they attain the degree of <hi>Batchelers</hi> of <hi>Art:</hi> One of the Curators beeing demaunded by me, why ſo rich a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> as <hi>Holland</hi> is, did not build and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow <hi>Colledges</hi> after the manner of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> anſwered they had not ſo many able and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick ſpirited men as are in <hi>England,</hi> and to deal plainly with you, ſaid he, had we ſuch <hi>Colledges,</hi> our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57761:15"/>
               <hi>Burgemaſters</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> would fil them with their own and their friends ſons, who by leading a lazie and idle life would never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com capable to ſerve the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and therefore he judged it much better to put them to Penſion in Burgers howſes, leaveing them to the care of the Profeſſors, who are verie diligent in keeping the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents at their exerciſes, both at Publick lectures and in their private howſes alſo, where they cauſe them Punctually at their appointed houres to come to their examinations and lectures, beſides thoſe they have in Publick. Thier churches are rare, ſo are the walks round the citie, and the fortifications verie pleaſing to behold. Here you have the <hi>River Rhine</hi> running through the citie and falling into it from <hi>Catwyckop Zee. Leyden</hi> is verie famous in hiſtorie, for the long Siege it held out againſt the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> From hence for twelve ſtivers and an half you are brought
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57761:16"/>
to <hi>Harlem</hi> by water, being twelve Engliſh miles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harlem</hi> is famous in that <hi>Coſtor</hi> one of their Burgers, firſt invented the <hi>Art of Printing.</hi> This <hi>Coſtor</hi> beeing ſuſpected to be a Conjurer, was fain to flee from <hi>Harlem</hi> to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne in <hi>Germany,</hi> and there Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his Invention, having in <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> onely found out the way of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on one ſide of the Paper. The firſt book he ever printed is kept in the <hi>Stathouſe,</hi> for thoſe that are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to ſee it. Here is one of the faireſt and largeſt Churches of the 17 Provinces, in the wals whereof there remain to this day ſticking <hi>canon Bullets,</hi> ſhot by the Spaniards du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Siege thereof. In this Church are three <hi>Organs,</hi> as alſo the model of the three Ships, that ſayled from <hi>Harlem</hi> to. <hi>Damiater,</hi> ſeaſing the Caſtle in which the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> was kept priſoner, and brought him away to <hi>Holland:</hi> In the <hi>Tower</hi> of this Church hang two
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57761:16"/>
ſilver bels which they alſo brought from thence, and now ring them everie night at nine a clock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harlem</hi> is renowned for making the fineſt linnen cloth, Tyfinies Dammasks and ſilk Stufs; alſo Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Tapes; They have Mils by which they can weave fortie and 50 Pieces at a time, they make the fineſt white thread and Tapes for lace in the whole world, there <hi>Blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries</hi> ſurpas al other whatſoever, their waters whitening cloath better then any in the ſeventeen Provinces: They have a moſt pleaſant grove like a little <hi>Wood,</hi> divided into Walks where on Sondays and holly dayes the Citiſens of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and other places come to take their pleaſure. <hi>Harlem</hi> is the ſecond citie of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and ſends in <hi>Deputies</hi> unto all the <hi>Colledges</hi> of the <hi>Gouvernment.</hi> From hence you have a paſſage by boat to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> for ſix ſtivers, but when you are come half way you muſt ſtep out of one boat to goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57761:17"/>
another, where you ſee a Stately <hi>Pallace,</hi> where the Lords, called <hi>Dykgraves</hi> ſit, Everie one of theſe Lords hath his <hi>Apartment</hi> when he coms for the concerns of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dykes, and bancks: here are alſo 2 large <hi>Sluces</hi> having gates to let in or out water from the <hi>Harlemmer Meer.</hi> Near this place about Ano: 1672 a part of the Seabanck was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by a ſtrong Northweſt wind, drowning all the land betwixt <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> and <hi>Harlem,</hi> which coſt an incredible vaſt ſum to have it repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. They ſunck in this breach 400 ſmal veſſels fild with earth and ſtones for a foundation to rebuild the wal upon, and by unſpeakable induſtrie and charges at laſt repaired the Banck.</p>
            <p>I come now to ſpeak of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> which having bin the place of my abode for ſeveral yeares, I ſhal give a more large and punctual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof then I doe of other places; It is eſteemed by Intelligent men the ſecond citie in the world for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57761:17"/>
trade, and not inferiour to any in wealth. Certainly <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is one of the beautifulleſt cities in the world, their buildings are large, their ſtreets for the moſt part plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly planted with trees &amp; paved ſo neatly, as is to be found no where els in any other Countrie, ſave in ſome of the 17 Provinces. And although, as I have alreadie ſaid, <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> may Juſtly be taken for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third citie after <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> yet it hath neither <hi>Court nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitie,</hi> as they have. And now in treating of all the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and virtues of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I ſhal not hyperboliſe, or flatter: for before I have don you ſhal ſee, I ſhal alſo faithfully declaime againſt the evils, miſtakes and vices in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſtands upon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Morgans</hi> of Land, encompaſſed with a verie ſtrong wal and <hi>Baſtions</hi> moſt pleaſant to behold, with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie large <hi>Burgwal</hi> or <hi>Gracht</hi> as they cal it, for the defence of three parts

of the citie, the fourth being ſecured by the ſea or <hi>Ty.</hi> There are 13 Churches in this citie for thoſe of the reformed religion (called dutch <hi>Presbiterians)</hi> to meet and worſhip in, with two <hi>Frencb,</hi> one <hi>Highdutch</hi> and one Engliſh, all <hi>Presbiterian</hi> Churches, who onely are alowed <hi>Bels,</hi> and whoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> are maintaynd by the <hi>Magiſtrate.</hi> All theſe Churches or congregations make up onely a third part of the Inhabitants of the citie: The <hi>Papiſts</hi> who have eightie five howſes or Chappels to meet in for their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, make another third part, and have a long ſquare of howſes for their Nuns tolive in, who are not ſhut up in Cloyſters, as in Papiſts countries they are wont to doe, but may goe in and out at their pleaſure, yea and marrie alſo if they grow wearie of a <hi>Nunniſh</hi> life: Theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Papiſts have no bels al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, beeing lookt upon as conventicles, and are many times

            <p>The <hi>Jewes</hi> who are verie conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the trade of this citie have two <hi>Synagogues,</hi> one whereof is the Largeſt in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and as ſome ſay in the world, ſure I am, it far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, thoſe in <hi>Rome, venice,</hi> and all other places where I have bin: Within the <hi>Court yard</hi> where their <hi>Synagogue</hi> ſtands, they have ſeveral

Roomes or ſchooles, where their children are taught Hebrew, and verie carefully, to the ſhame of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians negligence, brought up and inſtruckted in the Jewiſh principles.</p>

               <hi>Amſterdam</hi> for the wiſe <hi>Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> it hath produced, is ſaid to be a ſecond <hi>Athens:</hi> others make it the <hi>Storehowſe</hi> or Magaſin of <hi>Europe,</hi> for that it hath ſuch great ſtore of Corne, wherewith it furniſhes many other nations. And ſecondly for the exceeding great <hi>Magaſin</hi> of Spices, which in antient times the <hi>Venetians</hi> brought by land, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> but now is don by the <hi>Eaſt-Indie</hi> Companie which not onely ſupplyes <hi>Europe</hi> therewith, but many places in the Indies alſo. Thirdly it hath incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable ſtore of al manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for war, In ſo much that <hi>England</hi> and divers other nations ſend to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to buy <hi>Arms, Bufcoats, Belts, Match &amp;c:</hi> yea here are ſeveral <hi>Shopkeepers</hi> who can
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57761:20"/>
deliver <hi>Armes</hi> for 4000 or 5000 men, and at a cheaper rate then can be got any where elſe, and this they can doe by reaſon of their great Induſtry in the Ingroſſing moſt of the Iron workes on the <hi>Rhine</hi> and other Rivers which run into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Forthly <hi>Amſterdam</hi> hath more ſtore of ſawed and prepared Tymber for ſhipping then can be found in any one Nation in the world, and this is the reaſon why her Neighbour town <hi>Sardam</hi> is made capable of Building ſhips 20 per cent cheaper then they can doe in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France:</hi> So that both <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> do many times buy them in <hi>Holland:</hi> as lately the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> bought 10 Capital Ships of the two Brothers the <hi>Melts</hi> Merchants in this citie.

            <p>Sixtly <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi> where the <hi>French King</hi> bought his Marble for <hi>Verſellis Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre,</hi> and other of his <hi>Palaces</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> There are ſuch Vaſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſins</hi> in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> that a man would think, that ſees them, there were Quaries of <hi>Marble</hi> neare the City Gates. Seaventhly <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> hath the moſt conſiderable <hi>Bank</hi> that now is in the whole World; I have compared the <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> with that of <hi>Genua</hi> and both their <hi>Banks</hi> write not of ſo much money in two dayes as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> doth in one: further I have compared the <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> with <hi>Hamburg</hi> and find both thoſe <hi>Banks</hi> fall very much ſhort with the bank of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> There are many other particulars I could name, as Arguments to prove the great Riches &amp; Trade of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> as thoſe vaſt Quantities of Wynes, &amp; Brandewynes they ſell in the

I will not ſpeake much of her Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but only that they are in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral large and well built: In one of them the <hi>States</hi> have Spared no coſt to exceed the whole world in 3 things (Viz) an Organ with ſets of Pipes that counterfit a Corus of Voyces, it hath 52 whole ſtops beſides halfe ſtops, &amp; hath 2 rowes of Keyes for the feet, and three rowes of Keyes for the Hands; I have had people of Quality to heare it play, who could not believe but that there were men or Women above ſinging in the Organ, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57761:22"/>
they were convinced by goeing up into the Organ Roome. The ſecond is ſuch a large Carved Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet &amp; Canapie as cannot be found elſewhere in the world; The third is a Screene of braſle.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Stathouſe</hi> in this Citty is a wonderfull ſuperb Building, on the uppermoſt part of which is a large <hi>Magazin</hi> of <hi>Armes.</hi> The <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Statues</hi> that ſtand on top of the <hi>Stathouſe</hi> are very large &amp; peeces Exellently caſt, Eſpetially that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Atlas,</hi> who hath a <hi>Globe</hi> of the world on his back that will hold 30 Barels of water, for me to ſpeake of the ſeveral rarityes of <hi>Pictures,</hi> Carved works &amp; marble in this Stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, &amp; of the <hi>Globes Celeſtiall &amp; Terreſtriall</hi> that are on the floor of the <hi>great Hall,</hi> would make a Booke of it ſelfe; I therefore will ſpeake of their <hi>Almeshouſes</hi> &amp; of the Government of the poore, of their Priſons &amp; houſes of Correction. This Citty is ſaid to have 20000
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57761:22"/>
poore Every day at Bed &amp; board. The Almeshouſes are many &amp; look more like <hi>Princes Palaces</hi> then Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings for poore people; Firſt there are houſes for poor <hi>Ouldmen &amp; Women,</hi> then a large ſquare <hi>Palace</hi> for 300 Widdowes, then there are <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> for Boyes &amp; Girles, for Burgers Children &amp; for ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Children, or thoſe cald <hi>Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> all theſe boyes &amp; girles have Every ſonday &amp; other dayes of Worſhip 2 doites given them by the Fathers of theſe Houſes, the which the Children put into the Deacons ſack when they gather for the Poore in the Churches; Then there is an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> for fooles, &amp; a <hi>Bedlam:</hi> There are Houſes where Common Beggers &amp; Gameſters &amp; frequenters of <hi>Taphouſes</hi> are Kept hard at work: There is alſo a Houſe called the Raſphouſe where petty Theeues &amp; ſuch as ſlaſh one another with Knives, ſuch as beg with cheating deviſes, women with fained

great Bellyes, men pretending to have been taken by the Turk, others that pretend wrack at ſea, &amp; ſuch as beg with a Clapper or a Bell, as if they could not ſpeake or heare, ſuch as theſe are kept hard at work, Raſping Every day 50 pounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 2 of them, or Elſe are beaten with a Bulls Piſſel, &amp; if yet thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel &amp; wont work, they are ſet in a Tub where if they doe not pump the water will ſwell over their heads; Then there is a Houſe where whores are Kept to worke, as alſo diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient Children who live Idle &amp; take no courſe to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, likewiſe Women commonly drinking themſelves drunck, and ſcolds; Altheſe ſorts of <hi>Hoſpitals &amp; Almeshouſes</hi> are Stately Buildings richly adorned with Pictures &amp; their Lodgings very neat &amp; cleane.

Theſe Children are permitted to travel in any of the <hi>Treckſcuts</hi> freely without money; Theſe Hoſpitals are Governed by Men &amp; women, as are of an unſpotted life &amp; repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be rich, devout &amp; pious, it is very obſervable that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Governe their Women Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals better then the men do theirs yea it is a General obſervation in this Country, that where the Women have the direction of the purſe &amp; Trade, the husband ſeldom prove Bankrupts, it being the propertie of a true borne Hollands-wife preſently after marriage to apply her ſelfe wholly to ber Buſineſs; but I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſay any more of the Duch

Houswives, for feare of diſpleaſing our Engliſh Dames, not ſo much addicted, at leaſt not ſo Generally bred up to Induſtry; but to returne to the Acts of Charitie of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> the which is ſo Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary that they ſurpas al other Cittyes in the World, for they are dayly &amp; houerly giveing to the poore, Every Houſe in <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> hath a Box hanging in a Chaine on which is written <hi>Think on the Poore,</hi> ſo that when any merchant ſels Goods they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly conclude no bargain, but more or leſs is put in the <hi>Poores Box;</hi> Theſe Boxes art Lockt up by the <hi>Deacons,</hi> who once a quarter goe round the Citty &amp; take the Money out of the Boxes. Then twice a week there are men belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Hoſpitals that goe round the Citty &amp; ring a bell at every Houſe to Know what the Maſter or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris of the Houſe will give to the Box, who Generally give not leſs

then 2 ſtivers. Then every firſt We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densday of the moneth the <hi>Deacons</hi> in their turne goe round the Citty from Houſe to Houſe to receive what every houſe Keeper will give to the Poore, Then on the week before the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is given, a <hi>Miniſter</hi> with an <hi>Elder</hi> goes round the City to every Houſe where any members of the <hi>Presbiterian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion live, &amp; there ask if any Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences be in the familie, offering their ſervice to reconcile them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoe to Inſtruct &amp; prepare ſuch as are to receive the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> At this tyme a <hi>Miniſter</hi> may be ſeen to goe into a <hi>Taphouſe</hi> or <hi>Taverne</hi> for which at another tyme he would be counted a <hi>wyne biber</hi> &amp; the worſt of <hi>Reprobates;</hi> At this tyme while theſe <hi>Miniſters &amp; Elders</hi> goe about the City on their <hi>Viſiations</hi> the people take an Occaſion to give to the Poore.

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:57761:25"/>
               <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who are here in great Numbers.

that God would preſerve <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> from being deſtroyed if it were only for the great charitie they have for the Poore, the which put the Duke out of Countenance; I will ſay no more of their Charitie, only this that they leave no ſtone unturned to bring moneyes into the Poores ſtock, they make the ſtage players pay 80000 Gilders a yeare to the Poore: thert is not a <hi>Ropedancer, puppetplayer</hi> or any of that ſort of unneceſſary <hi>Vermin</hi> which frequent faires, but pay the 3d penny to the Poore, which is carefully looked after by placeing an <hi>Almesman</hi> at the doore of the Booths, to ſee that they cheat not the Poore of their ſhare; I ſhall now in the next place ſay ſome thing of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> I meane thoſe called the <hi>States Clergie,</hi> for the <hi>States</hi> are abſolutely head of their <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; when any ſynod of Divines meet, two of the <hi>States,</hi> are alwayes preſent to heare that they debate nothing

            <p>When one dyes the friends dare not burry the Corps until it hath lain three dayes open in the Coffen, that the friends &amp; relations of the deceaſed may be ſatisfied that the party hath not been murdered or reported to be dead when alive, after 3 dayes the corps muſt be brought to the church before the Belceaſeth tolling, which is at two

            <p>The next thing I ſhall ſpeake of is the method which the <hi>States</hi> obſerve in ordering their Maritim affairs, one of the greateſt myſteryes in their Goverment; The States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally divide their <hi>Admiralty</hi> into five Courts, which they call <hi>Chambers:</hi> The firſt is <hi>Rotterdam</hi> (which is the chamber called the <hi>Maſe)</hi> which hath the <hi>Admirals</hi> Flagg.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Amſterdam</hi> which hath the <hi>Vice-Admirals</hi> Flagg, &amp; <hi>Zealand</hi> hath the <hi>reare Admiral</hi> Flagg, the other two Chambers are thoſe in

down water upon any accident of Fire, &amp; there is in their <hi>Magazins</hi> a Nurſery Roome, where a Woman keeps an Office to feed at certaine houres of the day a great number of Cats, which afterward hunt among the ſtores for Mice &amp; Ratts; This great <hi>Magazine</hi> in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> was built in the tyme of <hi>Cromwell</hi> in the ſpace of 9 moneths &amp; 14 dayes, in which tyme the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Admiraltie</hi> gave the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>drinkgelt</hi> as they call it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to work more then at an ordinary rate. At this tyme the biggeſt man of war the States had was the <hi>Amelia,</hi> in which the famous <hi>Admiral Trump</hi> was Kild, ſhee was a Ship of no more then 56 Guns, afterward made a <hi>fire Ship.</hi> But the <hi>States</hi> quickly diſcovered their want of great Shipps, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore built the ſame yeare 20 men of war, from 50 to 80 Gunns. But the great Shipps built at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had like to have proved of no

uſe, had not the ingenious <hi>Penſionaric</hi> de <hi>Wit</hi> found out a deviſe to carry them over the <hi>Pampus,</hi> betwixt thoſe they call Water Shipps;</p>
            <p>The <hi>Admiralty</hi> have an Exellent Method in ſetting out their Fleets, they neither preſſe ſoldiers nor ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, all goe Voluntarie at the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of à Drumb, each Captain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding men &amp; Proviſions for his Shipp, who after they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved orders from the Lords to the <hi>Equipagemaſter</hi> to <hi>Equipe</hi> out their Shipps, &amp; receive the Povi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of war, then the <hi>States</hi> ſend a board each Shipp a <hi>Chaplin, &amp; Check Maſter,</hi> who take care of the proviſion of war, &amp; ſee that the ſeamen have the <hi>States</hi> allowance &amp; wholeſome food, &amp; great care is taken by the <hi>Lords</hi> that both <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains &amp; Seamen</hi> receive their pay punctually for the tyme they are in the <hi>States</hi> ſervice, &amp; for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging their ſeamen there is plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred on a Board hanging by the

            <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Admiralty</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame methodes which the <hi>States General</hi> obſerve, as to their land obligations, &amp; goe throw this great charge by the good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Credit, for tho it be true that they are indebted great ſummes of money, yet they never want a ſupply, nay, Moneyes are often forced upon them by rich Merchants, who ſend in their moneys and only take the <hi>Admyral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes</hi> obligations, with which they afterward pay their Cuſtomes, when their Shipps arive, at which tyme the <hi>Admiralty</hi> allowes them Intreſt for the tyme they have had their money, &amp; this is it that makes the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltyes</hi> Obligations more valued then
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57761:29"/>
ready money, for it ſaves the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of telling, &amp; ſuch is the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the <hi>Admiralty</hi> that when they have occaſion for any Goods, the people ſtrive to furniſh them, &amp; rather take their Obligations then money, becauſe they get Intreſt; &amp; all other aſſignments upon the <hi>Admiralty</hi> are very punctually payd, &amp; without Exchequer Fees, no they are ſworne Officers who are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to receive any moneyes for fees, being contented with the ſallary, they have <hi>of the States.</hi> And their Methodes uſed at the <hi>Cuſtome Houſe</hi> for loading or unloading Shipps are very eaſy, in ſo much that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Generally have the chargeing &amp; diſchargeing the Shipps at the <hi>Cuſtome Houſe,</hi> which is a great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in the <hi>States</hi> to make Trade eaſy for the Incouragement of the Merchants; And the <hi>Admiralty</hi> are very Gratefull &amp; Generous unto their Commanders, if any of their <hi>Admiralls,</hi> or <hi>Captains</hi> are Kild at

And ſhall now in the next place ſay ſome thing of their famous Company called the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> This <hi>Company</hi> is ſaid to be a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> within a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> &amp; it is true if you conſider the Soveraigne Power &amp;

were a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> apart, I will demonſtrate it to be ſo, firſt by their power, Riches &amp; ſtrength in the <hi>Indies,</hi> ſecondly what figure they make in <hi>Europe,</hi> &amp; this verie briefly, for if I ſhould ſpeake of every particular as to their poſeſſions in the <hi>Indies,</hi> it would ſwell into many Volumes, But I will only begin with them at the <hi>Cape of de Bonne Eſperance</hi> where they have built a Royall Fort, in which they maintaine a <hi>Garriſon</hi> of ſouldiers to defend their Shipps which come there to take in freſh Water; from thence let us take a view of them in the Iland of <hi>Java</hi> where they have built a faire City called <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia</hi> &amp; fortified it with <hi>Baſtions</hi> after the Mode of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> This City is the place of Reſidence of their grand <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> called the <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Indies,</hi> he hath allowed him 6 <hi>Privie Councellers</hi> in Ordinary &amp; 2 extraordinary, Theſe governe the concernes of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

tymes the Crafty Jewes, and others have Contrived to Coine bad newes to make the Actions fall, and good newes to raiſe them, the which craft of doing at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is not taken notice of, which is much to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, in ſuch a wiſe Government as <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is, for it is a certaine trueth they many times ſpread ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous reports touching the affaires of <hi>State,</hi> which paſſe amongſt the Ignorant for truth; I ſhall now in the next place ſay ſome thing of their <hi>Pallace</hi> or Magazine in the new part of the City the which may more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called an <hi>Arſenal;</hi> It is a building ſo ſuperb that it lookes more like a Kings Pallace, then a <hi>Magazin</hi> for <hi>Merchants;</hi> I have meaſured the Ground on which this <hi>Arſenal</hi> ſtands which I find to be 2000 foot, and ſquare every way, reckoning the <hi>Motes,</hi> or <hi>Burgals,</hi> about it; I remember the Ingenious Sr. <hi>Joſeph Williamſen</hi> meaſured the two <hi>Rope-allies</hi> by telling the ſtone

It is Death for any of the States ſubjects to be Interlopers againſt this Company, nor may any of what nation ſoever that lives in any of the Companyes Territories as Burgers or ſervants, returne into Europe without leave from the Company, only thoſe called <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> may depart without askeing leave to remove; The Grand Councel of this Company is the Aſſembly of the <hi>Seventeen,</hi> which are Elected out of the ſeveral Chambers before named, that is, eight from <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and four from <hi>Zealand: Delph, Rotterdam, Horne</hi> and <hi>Enkuſen</hi> ſend one a peece, which makes ſixteen, and the five leſſer Chambers by turns choſe the ſeventeenth. In the Chamber of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> there are 20 <hi>Bewint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hebbers</hi> in ordinary, who are for life, and have 1000 Ducatones a yeare and ſpices at Chriſtmas, and their travelling charges, when they goe upon the Companyes ſervice.

            <p>There is alſo a <hi>Tax</hi> on the Bread.</p>
            <p>Then there is a <hi>Tax</hi> called the 200ſte penny, and a <hi>Tax</hi> called the 8th: then there are many Taxes in Trade, as that no man can weigh or meaſure out his owne Goods if ſould in groſſe, but the <hi>States Officers</hi> muſt doe it, Then the <hi>States</hi> have a <hi>Tax</hi> called the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding</hi> on all <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Houſes</hi> in their <hi>Dominious:</hi> Then they have a <hi>Tax</hi> on ſealdpaper, and a <hi>Tax</hi> for

Regiſtering Lands or houſes, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a <hi>Tax</hi> on <hi>Cowes, Horſes, Calues,</hi> and all ſort of <hi>Fruit.</hi> There are many other <hi>Taxes</hi> I could name, as a ſtiver for every man that goes out or into any <hi>City</hi> after the houer of ſhutting the Ports, alſo you pay for going over ſom <hi>Bridges,</hi> and paſſing thro <hi>Gates</hi> called <hi>Tolhek,</hi> a ſtiver for every perſons, but <hi>Coaches, Wagons</hi> or <hi>Horſes</hi> pay more; Theſe I have already named, you will ſay, are to many, yet I may not forget to tell you, that <hi>Milke</hi> firſt payes as <hi>Milke,</hi> and again if it be made <hi>Butter</hi> yea the <hi>Buttermilke,</hi> and <hi>whay</hi> payes a <hi>Tax</hi> likewiſe, for all which a man would think that a <hi>people</hi> that ſtand ſo much upon maintaining of their liberty ſhould <hi>Mutinie</hi> and refuſe payment. But this ſeldome happens, and if it doth the <hi>States</hi> puniſh them very ſeverely. I remember that in my tyme there was a mutinie at <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> about paying a new <hi>Tax,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:57761:42"/>

who tould Mr. Envoye Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in my preſence, that he had payd neare 4000 L. ſterlyng to the war, and yet the ſame man did Grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pay his Majeſties <hi>Conſul</hi> a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyfull fee or Conſulat money on his Ships: the reaſon whereof I once asked him, who anſwered me that the King could not raiſe a penny in England without his Parlement, and therefore much leſs, could he doe it in the <hi>States</hi> Country: Thus theſe Phanaticks had rather make bricks without ſtraw, then pay the leaſt tribut to their Naturall Princes Officer: ſhould wee in England be obliged to pay the Taxes that are here impoſed, there would be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, upon Rebellion: and yet after all that is here payd no man may bake his owne bread, or grind his owne corne, or brew his beere, nor dare any man keepe in his houſe a hand Mil, althought it be but to grind Muſtard or Coffy.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57761:43"/>
ſuch was her misfortune that the Scouts Dienaers met her and ſeized her and her bottels, and caryed her to Priſon, which coſt the Wyne Merchant 1500 Gilders, and had it not bin for the ſtrongeſt ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by us, he had bin ruined: ſo ſacred are Taxes here and muſt ſo exactly be payd. And were they not here ſo preciſe, it were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for ſo ſmal a Country to ſubſiſt: And therefore you may heare the Inhabitants generally ſay, that what they ſuffer is for their <hi>Vaderland,</hi> hence the meaneſt among them are content to pay what is layd on them, for they ſay all what is the <hi>Vaderlands</hi> is ours the men of war are theirs, the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Magazins, <hi>Bridges</hi> and every thing what is the <hi>Vaderlands.</hi> And indeed in a ſenſe it is ſo for they have this to Comfort them, that if it pleaſe God to Viſit them with Poverty, they and their Children have the publick purſe to maintaine
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57761:44"/>
them, and this is one maine reaſon why they ſo willingly pay their Taxes as they doe, for theres not a ſoule borne in the <hi>States Dominions</hi> that wants warme <hi>Cloathes</hi> and <hi>Dyet;</hi> and good lodging, if they make their caſe knowne to the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates;</hi> and for the <hi>Vagabonds</hi> that rove up and downe the ſtreets, they are either <hi>Walons</hi> or other ſtrangers as pretend to have bin ruinated by the late wars.

            </p>
            <p>I now come to ſpeake ſome thing of the three Taxes I mentioned in the former part of my remarques on <hi>Taxes,</hi> of which the firſt ought rather to be called an uſefull and publique invention, like to that of the Inſurance Office in <hi>London,</hi> then a publick Tax, ſeeing no man needs contribute to it unleſs they pleaſe, and find his profit by it, but the other may be called Taxes becauſe the ſubjects are obliged to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57761:52"/>
ſubmit to them, but then they are ſo eaſy, that what the Publick gets thereby not only leſſons Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſubſidies, which many tymes occaſions clamour, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their raritie and the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie of occaſions, they muſt needs be great.</p>
            <p>Yet it is ſufficently compenſated by the advantage and ſecuritie in the Eſtates which private perſons, who are obliged to pay it, reape thereby dayly; I am confident that if the King and Parlement thought fit to introduce ſome or all three of theſe taxes into <hi>England,</hi> the publick charge of Goverment might be defrayed with more eaſe and with leſs repining and clamour, then when it muſt be done by new and high Impoſitions, how ever our Governers are the proper Judges of that.</p>
            <p>The firſt then is an <hi>Houſe</hi> called the merchants Bank which is gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by diverſe Commiſſioners,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57761:52"/>
Clarks and Booke keepers, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a <hi>Eſſaymaſter</hi> who Judgeth of the Gould and Silver, that at any tyme is brought into the Bank un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyned, the ſecurity given for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation thereof, are the <hi>States</hi> and Magiſtrates of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> Now if you have a mind to put money into the Bank, ſuppoſe a 1000 L. leſs or more, you muſt goe to the Clarks and ask a folio for your name, and then pay in your money at three or foure per cent according as the rate of the Bank money is high or low, or you may buy it of thoſe called <hi>Cashiers</hi> or Broakers: then get the Clarks to ſet downe in the folio what you bring in, haveing done ſo you may draw this ſumme, or ſell it in what parcels you pleaſe, but then if you let your money lye ſeven yeares in the Bank, you receive no Intreſt for the ſame. If you aske where then is the advantage for the Merchants? I anſwer firſt you have your money ready at all tymes for anſwering
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57761:53"/>
bills of Exchange, and making other payments: you are at no charge for baggs or portage, at no loſs by falſe tale or bad money, in no danger of Thieves or unfaithfull ſervants, or fire, and above all you have the accounts of your caſh moſt punctually and Juſtly kept without any trouble or runing the risk of Gouldſmith or Caſhieres breaking in your Debt; for ſuch is their care that twice a yeare, or ſome tymes oftner they ſhut up the Bank for 14 dayes, and then all that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns therein muſt bring in their accounts to the Clarkes, who a few dayes after, haveing viewed the Bookes, aquaint ſuch as have brought in wrong accounts with their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, deſiring them to returne to their bookes, and rectifie their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, not telling them wherein the miſtake lyes, ſo that I have knowne Merchants, in my tyme ſent back three or foure tymes, with their wrong accounts: but if they begin
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57761:53"/>
to grow Impatient and ſay that they will ſtand to their accounts, then they pay a mulct to the Clarkes upon their Covincing them of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, either by chargeing to much upon the Bank, or forgetting or omitting what was their due. I knew two Merchants, who haveing for gott the one 750 L. and the other 220 L. in their accounts, were honeſtly rectified by the Clarkes, ſo that they ſusſtained no loſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this care of the Clarkes in keeping and Stating the accounts, the bank is obliged for five L. a yeare to ſend to every Merchant, that deſires it, their accounts every morning before Exchange tyme, of the moneyes written of by them in the Bank the day before upon any Merchants account, and what ſummes are written of by others upon their accounts: ſo that the Merchants may compare the Banks notes with their bookes and ſo ſave much of the charges of Booke kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping;

Now if it be objected that though this be an advantage to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, yet what can the Publick gaine thereby, ſeeing the Charges of paying Officers, Clarks &amp;c. muſt needs be very conſiderable? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that indeed it is a myſtery to thoſe who underſtand not the thing, but if it were once known and practiſed, the advantage of it would appeare; For among other things which might be ſaid, The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of the Citty take out of the Merchants Bank a Sufficent ſtock of money to ſupply the <hi>Lumbert,</hi> a Banck that Lends out money, and is Governed by 4 Commiſſioners cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the Magiſtrates, who ſitt in Court every day in the <hi>Lumbert,</hi> which is a large pile of Building 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Jewell &amp;c. This is a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venicence for Poore people, yea for Merchants alſo, who ſome tymes may want money to pay a bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and prevents the Cheatting and Extraordinary Extortion uſed by the Pawne brokers in <hi>England, France</hi> and other Countryes.

lewd Perſons of both ſexs meet and practiſe their villanies.

and frugall way of Liveing is now allmoſt quite out of Date in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, there is very littell to be ſeene of that ſober modeſtie in Apparell, Diet, and habitations as formerly: In ſtead of Convenient Dwellings the <hi>Hollanders</hi> now build Stately palaces, have their delightfull Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and houſes of pleaſure, keep Coaches, waggons and ſleas, have very rich furniture for their horſes with Trappings adorned with ſilver Bells, I have ſeen the Vanitie of a <hi>Vintners</hi> ſonne, who had the boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the bit and Trapping of his horſe of pure ſilver, his footman and Coachman having ſilver fringd Gloves; yea ſo much is the humour of the women altered and of their Children alſo that no Apparel can now ſerve them but the beſt and richeſt, that <hi>France</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes affoards, and their ſonns are ſo much adicted to play, that many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> are ruined by it not that <hi>England</hi> is leſſe Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant

to their husbands, that they Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no ſuch Entertainement, but upon removeing of the Diſhes and plates they found underneath printed verſes Importing that after that manner of liveing they began to thrive, &amp; had inlarged their Citty.</p>
            <p>The ſecond courſe conſiſted of Bocke de kooks, quarters of Lamb, roſted Rabits and a ſort of pudding they cal a <hi>Brother</hi> here they had Dorts and Engliſh beare with <hi>French</hi> wyne yet all this did not pleaſe the dainty Dames: but upon removing away the plates another Diſh of poetrie appeared, which acquainted them that after that modeſt and ſober way of Liveing, they might keep what they had gott, and lay up ſome thing for their Children.</p>
            <p>Then comes in the third courſe made up of all the rarities of the ſeaſon, as Patridges, Pheſeants and all ſorts of foule and Engliſh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, with plenty of Riniſh and other ſorts of wyne, to moiſten them,

this put the ladyes in a frolick and Jolly humour, but under their plates was found the uſe and Application in verſes, telling them that to feed after that manner was Voluptuous and Luxurious, and would Impaire their health and waſt their Eſtates, make them neglect their Trade, and ſo in Tyme reduce their Stately and new built flouriſhing Citty to their ould fiſhing towne againe.

with the Militia, and Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) the French became Maſters of above 40 Cittyes and Garriſons, at which tyme there was nothing to be heard of in the States Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions but confuſion and miſerie, even in the ſtrong and rich Citty of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> it ſelf, who at this tyme beheld the French Armie like a mighty Torrent comeing within ſight of the Citty, and at the ſame tyme wanting water in their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, and Burgwalls to ply their Sluces, and ſuch was the ſcarcity of Raine that a payle of freſh water was worth 6 pence; Thus heaven ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to frowne on them as well as the French Armie, by the ſhutting up as it were the Conduits of Heaven, and yet a worſe thing had like to have fallen out, for at the ſame tyme the Diviſions grew ſo high amongſt the Magiſtrates in the Stathouſe, that it was putting to the Queſtion wheather or no they ſhould not goe and meet the French King with

the Keyes of their Citty, to ſave it from fire, and Plunder, now nothing in all probabilitie could ſave this rich Citty from falling into the hands of the French, but an immediate hand from Heaven, and it had undoubtedly come to paſſe, had not providence cauſed the French to make a ſtand at <hi>Muyden,</hi> two howers from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> at what time the Valiant Roman of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Scout <hi>Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelaer</hi> like a true father of his Country oppoſed the French party in the Councell, calling out to the Burgers from the Stathouſe to take Courage and rather chooſe to dye like old Battavians with their ſwords in their hands, then tamely and Treacherouſly to yeald up their Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the mercy of the French, as ſome of the Mageſtrates were about to doe, this ſo Incouraged the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that with great Courage they mand' the walls, and heaven then aſſiſting them with a ſuden and plenty

Women and Children together, Thus he began his march with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to burne <hi>Leyden, Hague, Rotterdam, Delph</hi> and all the rich Country of <hi>Rhineland:</hi> and this he might have done in all probabilitie, for firſt the Governor of Newſluce who commanded the poſt that ſhould have ſtopt the French, Treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly delivered up the fort without firing a Gunn, and the handfull of Troopes then under General <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningsmark</hi> were ſo Inconſiderable that they joyned to the Souldiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Vin</hi> the Governer of new <hi>Sluce</hi> were not Able to make head as could oppoſe <hi>Luxenburgs</hi> Armie, and at the ſame tyme the good <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> was with the States Armie at Charle le Roy. Now was <hi>Leyden</hi> ready to meet the French with the Keyes of their Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and other Cittyes too, for they had neither fortifications nor Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to man their walls; Thus the whole Country and Cittyes of <hi>Rhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:57761:66"/>
were like to fall under the Crneltyes and Tyranny of the French, but God a ſecond tyme ſent theſe people reliefe from Heaven, firſt by giveing ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danted Courage to that great States man <hi>Penſionarie Fagel</hi> that he forced <hi>Koningsmark</hi> to Rally his Troopes together and to make a Stand neare <hi>Leyden,</hi> offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to dye at the head of them if there were occaſion, but God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him for a furder good to the Commonwealth by ſending ſuch a ſudden Thaw as was never ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for in leſs then ten howers the Ice ſo ſunk and ſuch Floods of ſnow came downe from the high lands that the French were fain to make a very diſorderly retreat, Marching up to the middel for haſt, becauſe on the Banks there could not march above four men a breſt, ſo they were conſtrained to leave behind them the greateſt part of the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they had robed from the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57761:66"/>
Country people, and the nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Duch men on their Scatſes ſo long as the Ice would beare them, did ſhoot downe the French like Ducks diving under water, ſo that it coſt <hi>Luxenburgs</hi> Armie deare, tho they had the pleaſure to burne the poore people, of which the French afterward wickedly made their boaſt.</p>
            <p>The third was as wonderfull as the two others, and although I doe not believe miracles, as doe the Papiſts, yet I ſay nothing I ever obſerved looked more like a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle then this, to wit, when the Engliſh and French Fleet lay before <hi>Scheveling</hi> with a deſigne to land, and the French ready on their March to joyne with the English and other French as ſoon as they ſhould land, at the ſame tyme the <hi>Biſshop</hi> of <hi>Munſter</hi> lyeing before <hi>Groeningen,</hi> and the French before <hi>Gorcom,</hi> ſo that now all things looked with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full face for the States, yet at this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57761:67"/>
very tyme God ſent a 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> reliefe by ſending ſuch Miſts, and wonderfull ſorts of Tydes, as ſo ſeparated the two Fleets, that the Engliſh were forced to quit <hi>Scheveling</hi> ſhore, and were driven on the ſide of the <hi>Texel</hi> Roade; from whence they were conſtrained by the ſeaſon of the yeare to retire home, and ſuch were the ſudden &amp; great ſhowers of raine that the Biſshop of Munſter was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in diſorder to raiſe his ſiege at <hi>Groeningen,</hi> and the French to quit <hi>Gorcom;</hi> I could ad many more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of the Providences of God to theſe people, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveing the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> from the many treacherous deſignes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived againſt him from his Cradel, but Moſes muſt be preſerved, to goe in and out before his people, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely never young <hi>Prince</hi> Indured ſo many fatigues as did his Highnes in his tender yeares, of which I was an eye witnes, and had his Highnes had the yeares and Experience, and

ſuch a good diſciplinde Armie (as now he hath) in the yeare 1671 when the French Entered the Country, his Highnes had given them as good a welcome as he did at Bergen. I will ſay no more of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject only this, that the peace at <hi>Nimwegen</hi> was alſo a very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing, for that not above 8 dayes before the peace was ſigned, moſt of the <hi>Plenipotentiaries</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the war would have continued another yeare; firſt becauſe the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and Duke of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> proſpered Exceedingly againſt <hi>Sweedland,</hi> and totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the propoſitions of France, and ſecondly becauſe the French King writ ſuch Bitter letters againſt the <hi>States Generall:</hi> yet 8 dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dreſt a letter unto the <hi>States</hi> in which he calles them his good friends, and old Allyes, offering them not only <hi>Maſtricht</hi> but every foot of ground they could lay claime to in the world, alſo giveing them
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57761:68"/>
new Termes, and Conditions as to their priviledges in France, by way of Trade; Neither can I forget how ſpeedilie and as ſtrangly the mighty French King did quit his Conquered Townes after the Valiant <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> took <hi>Naerden,</hi> which was the firſt ſtep to the Frenchs ruine in the States Dominions. I come now, according to promeſs in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this book, to give the reader ſome Remarkes I made in other Countries where I have been during my ſixteen years travels. To give a full account of all that might be obſerved in ſo many Countries, is not a taske for one man, nor a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for ſo ſmall a book; I ſhall onely therefore briefely take notice of ſome remarkable matters which may in ſome meaſure ſatisfie the curioſitie of my Country men who have not been in the ſaid places, and convince, if poſſible, all of them, that no Countrey that ever I was in, afords ſo great convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57761:68"/>
for the generalitie of people to live in, as the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> doth. Though I have twice made the <hi>grand tour</hi> of <hi>Germany, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and after my return back to <hi>England</hi> travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a third time through <hi>Holland</hi> as for as <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> and ſo back by <hi>Francfort</hi> to <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> yet the reader is not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect I ſhould follow a Geographicall method and order in ſpeaking of the places I have been in; that is to be lookt for in the map, and not in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels; but onely that I mention pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as I found them on my rode ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as buſines or curioſitie led mee to travel.</p>
            <p>The firſt conſiderable place I then met with, after I was out of the dominions of the <hi>States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> was <hi>Cleave</hi> the capital citie of the Province ſo called, a fair and lovely citie ſtanding upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the rivers <hi>Wall</hi> and <hi>Leck.</hi> This Province much reſembles <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

in rich ſoyl and pleaſantneſs of its rivers. The inhabitants of the Countrey would have mee beleeve that they were originally deſcended of thoſe <hi>Saxons</hi> who made a deſcent in to <hi>England,</hi> and conquered it; and to convince the truth of this, they ſhew'd mee a cloyſter ſtanding on a hill, called <hi>Eltham,</hi> from which they ſay our <hi>Eltham</hi> in Kent had its name. I was made to obſerve alſo two places ſtanding upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> neare <hi>Emmerick</hi> called <hi>Doad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and <hi>Gronewich,</hi> which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them, gave the names to <hi>Deaford</hi> and <hi>Greenwich</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> but many ſuch analogies and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes of names are to be found in other places of Germany, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in uper <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Denmark.</hi> The greateſt part of this Province of <hi>Cleave,</hi> and part of the duchy's of <hi>Julieres</hi> and <hi>Berg,</hi> and of the Provinces of <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Ravens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> belongs to the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> the reſt belonging

to the Duke of <hi>Newbourg</hi> now Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Palatine,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Cologne.</hi> The inhabitants are partly Roman Catholicks, partly Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, and partly Calviniſts, who all live promiſcuouſly and peaceably together both in city and Countrey. The citie of Cleave is the out moſt limit of the territories of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> on this ſide of Germany; from whence his Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Highneſs can travel two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dutch miles out right in his own Dominions, and never ſleep out of his own Countrey but one night in the territories of the Biſhop of <hi>Oſnabrug.</hi>

            <p>From <hi>Cleave</hi> I went to a ſmall town called <hi>Rhinberg,</hi> but a very ſtrong fortification belonging to the Elector of <hi>Cologne;</hi> which lies at two miles diſtance from the citie of <hi>Weſel</hi> that belongs to the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg.</hi> Through <hi>Diſſeldorpe</hi> ſcituated on the Rhine, and the Reſidence of the duke of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57761:71"/>
               <hi>Newbourg,</hi> I went next to <hi>Cologne</hi> a very large city, called by the Romans <hi>Colonia Agrippina,</hi> and the French <hi>Rome d' Allema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cologne</hi> is an Imperial citie and a Republick, though for ſome things it does Homage to the Elector of that name, and receives an oath from him. It is much decayed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe hundred years, having been much prieſt ridden, a miſfortune that hath undone many other great cities. The Jeſuits have had ſo great influence upon the Magiſtrats, that they prevailed with them to baniſh all Proteſtants, who remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to <hi>Hambourg</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> ſo that <hi>Cologne</hi> is become ſo diſpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, that the houſes dayly fall to ruine for want of inhabitants, and a great deal of corn and wine now grows within the walls, upon ground where houſes formerly ſtood. I dare be bold to affirm that there is twice the number of inhabitants in the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57761:71"/>
pariſh of St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the fields, then there is in <hi>Cologne;</hi> and yet it contains as many pariſh churches, monaſteries and chappels, as there are days in the year. The ſtreets are very large, and ſo are the houſes alſo, in many of which one may drive a Coach or waggon into the firſt room from the ſtreets; but the ſtreets are ſo thin of people, that one may paſs ſome of them and not meet ten men or women, unleſs it be Church men or Religious ſiſters. The moſt conſiderable inhabitants of the citie are Proteſtant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, tho but few in number, and they not allowed a Church neither, but a place called <hi>Woullin</hi> a mile without the citie: the reſt of the inhabitants who are lay men are miſerably poor. There are no leſs than 3000 Stud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

hats and cloaks in the night: but if in the Jeſuits Schools there be any rich Burgemaſters ſons who have parts, they are ſure to be ſnapt up and adopted into the ſocietie. Formerly, before the matter was otherwiſe adjuſted in the diet of <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> there have been deſigns of voteing Proteſtant Magiſtrats into the government again; but ſo ſoon as the Jeſuits come to diſcover who of the Magiſtrats were for that, they immediately preferred their ſons or daughters, and made them chanons, abbots or chanoneſſes, and ſo diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them by intereſt. It's pity to ſee a city ſo famous for traffike in former times now brought to ſo great a decay, that were it not for the trade of Rheniſh wine it would be utterly forſaken, and left wholy to the Church men. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall alarms the Magiſtrats have had by forreign deſigns upon their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and the jealouſies fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented among themſelfs, as it is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57761:72"/>
thought, by the Agents and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of France, and eſpecially the Biſhop of <hi>Straſbourg,</hi> have for ſeverall yeares kept them in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall diſquiet, and neceſſitated them to raiſe great taxes which hath not a litle contributed to the impoveriſhing of the people eſpecially the boars round about; who tho the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey they live in be one of the moſt pleaſant and fertile plains of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, yet are ſo wretchedly poor that canvas cloaths, wooden ſhoes, and ſtraw to ſleep on in the fame room with their beaſts, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt worldly happineſs that moſt of them can attain unto. The Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi> is a venerable old man, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of four great biſhopricks, viz <hi>Cologne, Liege,</hi> Munſter, and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dershime.</hi> He divides his time betwixt his devotion and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtudies, being punctuall in ſaying of maſs every morning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in his Elaboratory in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon; for he is much addicted
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57761:73"/>
to chymiſtry, and leaves the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Government to his Cozen the Biſhop of <hi>Strasbourg.</hi> To ſpeak of all the miracles of the three Kings of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and the vaſt number of ſaints who were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of England and interred there, would be but tedious and perhaps incredible to the reader, aſ well as wide of my deſigne. I ſhall therefore proceed.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Cologne</hi> I took water on the Rhine and advanced to the citie of <hi>Bon</hi> and ſo forward to <hi>Coblints</hi> the reſidence of the Elector of <hi>Trier.</hi> over againſt this city, on the other ſide of the Rhine ſtands that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable fort called <hi>Herminshine,</hi> built on a high rocky hill as high again as <hi>Windſorcaſtle,</hi> and on the north ſide of it the River Moſel falls into the Rhine, over which there is a Stately ſtone bridge. This Prince governs his ſubjects as the other Spirituall Electors doe, that is, both by temporall and ſpirituall
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57761:73"/>
authority, which in that Country is pretty abſolute. The chiefe trade of this Countrey is in wine, corn, wood and Iron.</p>
            <p>The next Countrey I came to was that of the Elector of <hi>Mayence</hi> who is likewiſe both a ſecular and Eccleſiaſticall Prince and governs his ſubjects accordingly. He is reckoned to be wholely for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the French King; who notwithſtanding of that, pretends a title to the citadel of <hi>Mayence.</hi> As I was upon my Journey to <hi>Mayence</hi> by land, I made a turn down the Rhin to viſit the famous litle city of <hi>Backrack,</hi> and ſome towns belonging to the Landgrave of Heſſen, but eſpecially <hi>Backrack,</hi> becauſe Travellers ſay it much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in its ſcituation and manner of buildings. The Burgemaſter of this city told mee that the whole Country about <hi>Backrack</hi> does not yield above 200 fouders of wine a year; And yet
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57761:74"/>
the Merchants of <hi>Dort</hi> by an art of multiplication which they have uſed ſome years, furniſh <hi>England</hi> with ſeverall thouſande of fouders. Here I ſhall take the liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a ſtrange ſtory which I found recorded in this Countrey; tho I know it to be mentioned in Hiſtory. There was a certain cruel and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Biſshop of <hi>Mayence,</hi> who in a year of great ſcarcity and famine when a great number of Poor people came to his gates begging for bread, cauſed the Poor wretches, men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children to be put into a barn, under pretext of relieving their neceſſities; but ſo ſoon as they were got in, cauſed the barn doors to be ſhut, fire ſet to it, and ſo burnt them all alive: And whil'ſt the poor wretches cried and ſhree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out for horrour and pain, the Barbarous miſcreant ſaid to thoſe that were about him, harke how the Rats and mice doe crie. But the juſt Judgement of God ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57761:74"/>
not the fact to paſs unpuniſhed; for not long after the cruel Biſhop was ſo haunted with Rats and mice, that all the guards he kept about him, could not ſecure him from them, neither at table nor in bed, At length he reſolved to flee for ſafetie into a tower that ſtood in the midle of the Rhine; but the Rats purſued him, got into his chamber and devoured him alive; ſo that the Juſtice of the Almighty made him a prey to vermine who had inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely reckoned his fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to be ſuch. The tower which I ſaw, to this day is called the Rats-tower, and the ſtory is upon record in the city of <hi>Mayence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On my Journey from thence I came to the litle village of <hi>Hockom</hi> not far diſtant, famous for our Hockomore wine, of which though the place does not produce above 150 fouders a year; yet the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions Hollanders of <hi>Dort</hi> make ſome thouſand fouders of it goe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57761:75"/>
of, in England and the Indies.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Hockom</hi> I proceeded to <hi>Francfort</hi> a pleaſant city upon the river of Maine, called formerley <hi>Teutoburgum</hi> and <hi>Helenopolis</hi> and ſince <hi>Francfort,</hi> becaus here the <hi>Franconians</hi> who came out of the Province of <hi>Franconia</hi> foarded over, wfien they went upon their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into <hi>Gallia,</hi> which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and named it <hi>France:</hi> and I thought it might very well deſerve the name of <hi>Petty-London,</hi> becauſe of its Priviledges, and the humour of the citizens. It is a Hanſiatick and Imperiall town and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the Magiſtrats being Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans which is the publick eſtabliſhed Religion; though the Cathedrall church belongs to the Roman Catholicks who alſo have ſeverall monaſteries there. The citie is populous and frequented by all ſorts of Merchants, from moſt parts of Europe, &amp; part of Aſia alſo, becaus of the two great faires that are yearely
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57761:75"/>
kept there, Many Jews live in this city, and the richeſt Merchants are Calviniſts, who are not ſuffered to have a Church in the town, but half an houres journey out of it, at a place called <hi>Bucknam,</hi> where I have told ſeventy four Coaches at a time all belonging to Merchants of the city. It was in ancient times much enriched by <hi>Charle le maigne</hi> and hath been ſince by the conſtitution of the <hi>Golden bull:</hi> amongſt other honours &amp; Priviledges its appointed to be the place of the Emperours Election, where many of the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments belonging to that Auguſt ceremonie are to be ſeen. It is ſtrongly fortified having a ſtately ſtone bridge over the Maine that joynes it to <hi>Saxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſen</hi> the quarter of the great maſter of the Toutonick order. The government is eaſy to the people, they not being taxed as other cities are, and had it not been for the Alarmes the French gave them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the laſt war, they had not been
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57761:76"/>
much troubled, but being forced to keep three or four thouſand men in conſtant pay to defend their fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, the Magiſtrats were conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to raiſe money by a tax. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that of the Emperour, they are under the protection of ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes, as of the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave of Heſſen-<hi>Caſſells,</hi> Landgrave of <hi>Armeſtadt,</hi> the Count of <hi>Solmes</hi> and the count of <hi>Hanau,</hi> who are either Lutherans or Calviniſts, amongſt whom the Late Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> was alſo one; but whether the preſent who is Roman Catholick be ſo or not, I cannot tel. This city takes great care of their poor, and in their charitie to poor travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers exceed Holland. I have ſeen a liſt of ſeaven thouſand whom they relieved in one year. Their great hoſpitall is a large court or palace, where the Engliſh Merchants for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly lived, in the time of Queen <hi>mary's</hi> perſecution of the Proteſtants, who when they were recalled by
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57761:76"/>
Queen <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> were ſo generous as to give the whole court, with all their Packhouſes and lands to the poor of the city. It was my fortune to be there in that cold Winter in the year 1683. and ſaw a ceremonie performed by the Wine coopers of the citie, who are obliged by law, that when ever the Maine lyes faſt frozen over for eight days together, to make a great Fouder fat, Hoops and Staves, and ſet it up compleat upon the Ice. It was very good diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſee ſo many hands at worke, and to obſerve the jollity and mirth of the many thouſands of ſpectators who wanted not plenty of Rheniſh wine to carouſe in.</p>
            <p>I had the curioſitie afterward to goe to the court of the Landgrave of <hi>Armeſtadt</hi> a Lutheran Prince who lives in part of the richeſt ſoyle in Germany. His Highneſs is a very courteous and obligeing Prince to Strangers, and his ſubjects are in a pretty good condition again,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57761:77"/>
though they have been great ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers by the laſt war between the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſen</hi> and this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie.</p>
            <p>From thence I went to <hi>Heidleberg</hi> a city I had been formerly in, in the life time of that wiſe tho unfortunate Prince Elector elder brother to Prince Rupert. Here I had the Honour to pay my dutifull reſpects to the Elector the ſon of that great Prince, whoſe commiſſary I had the honour to be for two years together in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam.</hi> This Prince, ſince my being there, is lately dead, and left behind him the reputation of having been a Zealous thorough paced Calviniſt, and ſo conſtant a frequenter of the church, that ſome Sundays he went thrice a day to Sermon; but never failed, if in health, to be once a day at leaſt at the garriſon-church; where he took particular notice of ſuch officers as were abſent. He was married to a moſt virtuous lady the Royall ſiſter of the King of Denmark
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57761:77"/>
and his brother Prince George. During his life time the univerſity of Heidleberg flouriſhed exceedingly, ſo that the number of ſtudents was ſo great that Chambers and lodgings in the citie were ſcarce, and <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemius</hi> was about quitting <hi>Leyden</hi> to return to his profeſſors place in <hi>Heidleberg,</hi> but how matters ſtand ſince his death, I am as yet ignorant. This Countrey is called the paradiſe of <hi>Germany</hi> for its fruitfulneſs in wine, corn, and all ſorts of fruit. I my ſelf have ſeen growing in one plain at the ſame time, vines, corn, cheſtnuts, almonds, dates, figs, cherries, beſides ſeverall other ſorts of fruit. And as the Countrey is fertile in yeelding the fruits of the Earth, ſo the people are carefull in providing ſtore room for them. This I take notice of becauſe of the prodigious Rheniſh wine fats which are to be ſeen there, amongſt which there are ſeaven, the leaſt whereof holds the quantitie of 250 barells
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57761:78"/>
of Beere as I calculated; but the large and moſt celebrated fat is that which goes by the name of the great Tun of <hi>Heidleberg,</hi> and holds 204 fouders of wine, and coſt 705 L. Sterling in buildiug, for which one may have a very good houſe built. This fat I have ſeen twice, and the firſt time was, when the Elector treated the French Ambaſſadours that came to conclude the match betwixt his daughter and <hi>Monſieur</hi> the French Kings brother, who married her after the death of our Kings ſiſter his firſt wife: at which treat there happened an adventure that I ſhall here pleaſe the Reader with. In a gallery that is over this fat the Elector cauſed a table to be placed in the midle, exactly above the bunghole of this Monſtrous veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and to be covered with a coſtly banquet of all ſorts of ſweet meats: The day before, all the wine being emptied out of this Tun into other Fats, a litle before the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57761:78"/>
with other forrein Miniſters and Perſons of qualitie mounted the ſtairs to come to the place of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; The Elector cauſed twelve drummers with as many Trumpeters, ſome Kettledrums and other muſick to be lodged in the belly of the Tun, with orders to ſtrike up upon a ſignall given, when the Elector drank the French Kings health. All being ſate down at table and merrily fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the Elector drank the health, and the ſignall was given; whereupon the muſick began to play its part with ſuch a roaring and uncouth noiſe out of that vaſt cavitie below, that the French and other Perſons of qualitie who were unacquainted with the deſigne, looking upon it to be an infernall and ominous ſound, in great aſtoniſhment began to cry out <hi>Jeſus Marie. The worlds at an end,</hi> and to ſhift every one for himſelf in ſo great diſorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that for haſte to be gone they tumbled down ſtaires one over
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57761:79"/>
another. All that the Elector could ſay to compoſe them, was either not heard or not valued, nor could any thing ſatisfie and reaſſure them, till they ſaw the Actors com marching out of their den. Had not many Perſons of qualitie and travellers ſeen this Fat as wel as my ſelf who know that what I ſay of its incredible bigneſs to be true, I ſhould be afraid the Reader might think I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon his credulitie.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Heidleberg</hi> I went to ſee that impregnable Fort or citadell of <hi>Manheim alias Fredericks-berg</hi> built by the Elector Frederick brother to Prince Rupert, a Prince of as good a head as any Germany affoarded, who though ſome have too partially Judged of him by his miſfortunes, yet by the wiſeſt of the age was acconnted the Cato of Germany. The wiſeſt and beſt-men of the world have been unfortunate, which makes ſome to be of the opinion that God in his wiſdom
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57761:79"/>
thinks fit it ſhould be ſo, leaſt otherwiſe they might attribute their proſperitie rather to the wiſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their own conduct, then his all ſeeing Providence: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, dayly experience ſeemes to evince the truth of this, ſince wee ſee knaves and fools advanced to preferment and richeſs, when men of virtue and parts die neglected and poor in the eyes of the world, though rich in the enioyment of a contented mind. But this is a digreſſion which the honour I have for the memory of that great man hath led mee into, and therefore I hope will be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Reader. In the citadel of <hi>Manheim</hi> I ſaw ſome of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of that illuſtrious familie, which without diſpute is the moſt ancient of all the Secular Electors, being elder to that of <hi>Bavaria</hi> which ſprung from one and the ſame ſtock, to wit, two Emperours of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. Many writers derive them originally from <hi>Charle le maigne,</hi> by
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57761:80"/>
the line of <hi>Pepin</hi> King of France. There have been ſeverall Emperours of that race, one King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and four Kings of <hi>Sweden,</hi> one of which was King of <hi>Norway</hi> alſo, beſides many great Generals of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in <hi>Germany, Hungary, France</hi> and other Countries. Since I can remember there vere five Proteſtant Princes heires to that Electorall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity alive; which now by their death is fallen to the Duke of <hi>Newbourg</hi> a Roman Catholick, whoſe Daughter is Empreſs of Germany and another of his Daughters maryed to the King of Portugall. Being ſo neare Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, I had the curioſitie to goe ſee what figure that famous citie now made ſince it had changed its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; for I had been thrice there before, when it flouriſhed under the Emperours protection, with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a Hauſiatick town: And Indeed I found it ſo diſfigured, that had it not been for the ſtately Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Church, and fair ſtreets and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57761:80"/>
buildings, I could ſcarcely have know'n it. In the ſtreets and Exchange which formerly were thronged with ſober rich and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Merchants, you meet with none hardly now but men in buff Coats and ſcarffs with rabbles of Soldiers their attendants. The churches I confeſs are gayer, but not ſo much frequented by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants as heretofore, ſeing the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans are thruſt into the meaneſt churches and moſt of the chiefe Merchants both Lutherans and Calviniſts removed to <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Hambourg.</hi> Within a few years, I beleeve it will be juſt ſuch another city for trade and Richeſs as <hi>Briſac</hi> is. It was formerly a rich city and well ſtockt with Merchants and wealthy inhabitants, who lived under a gentle and eaſy government; but now the Magiſtrats have litle elſe to doe in the government, but onely to take their rules and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures from a citadell and great guns,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57761:81"/>
which are Edicts that Merchants leaſt underſtand. I confeſs Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg is the leſs to be pityed that it ſo tamely became a ſlave, and put on its chains without any ſtrugling. Thoſe Magiſtrats who were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in it, are now ſenſible of their own folly, and bite their nails for anger, finding themſelves no better but rather worſe hated than the other Magiſtrats, who did what they could to hinder the reception of their new maſters the <hi>French.</hi> I quickly grew weary of being here, meeting with nothing but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of poverty, and paying exorbitant taxes; I therefore ſoon returned to my <hi>Petty - London Francfort,</hi> and from thence went to <hi>Caſſells,</hi> the chiefe reſidence of the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſen.</hi> This Prince is a Calviniſt, as moſt of his ſubjects are, very grave and Zealous in his religion: He married a Princeſs of <hi>Courland,</hi> by whom he hath an hopefull iſſue, to wit, three ſons
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57761:81"/>
and two Daughters. The late King was God father to one of his ſons, who was Chriſtened by the name of <hi>Charles.</hi> Captain <hi>William Legg</hi> Brother to the Lord <hi>Dartmouth</hi> repreſenting his Majeſtie as his Envoy. The court of this Prince does indeed reſemble a well gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned colledge, or Religious Cloyſter, in regard of its modeſtie and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie in all things, and eſpecially in the houres of devotion. He is rich in money, and entertains about nine thouſand men in conſtant pay, under the command of <hi>Count van derlipp,</hi> a brave and expert Soldier his Lieutenant Generall; but can bring many more upon occaſion into field. This familie hath been very happy both in its progenie and alliances, many wiſe Princes of both ſexes having ſprung from it; and the mother of this preſent Landgrave may be reckoned amongſt the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious women of the preſent and paſt ages. After the death of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57761:82"/>
the 5. Landgrave of Heſſen her husband, ſhe not only ſupported but advanced the war wherein he was engaged, did many ſignall actions, Enlarged her territories, and at the concluſion of the peace kept under her pay 56 Cornets of horſe in five Regiments, 166 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of foot, beſides thirteen Companies of Dragons, and 14 independent Companies, in all 249 Companies of horſe and foot; ſhe was a Princeſs extreamly obliging to ſtrangers: eſpecially virtuous and learned divines. I had the honour a good many yeares agoe to kiſſe her highneſſes hand; at which time ſhe was mighty Zealous in promoting an accommodation amongſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Religions, as the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, Lutheran and Calviniſt, but eſpecially betwixt the two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore entertained <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Duris</hi> at her court in <hi>Caſſels</hi> who wrote ſeverall pieces upon that ſubject of reconciliation, and with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57761:82"/>
lome of his friends had a conference with a learned prieſt that came from Rome to forward the project; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Doctor publiſhed his book of the <hi>Harmoney of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> which is highly eſteemed in Germany.</p>
            <p>From this Princes court I dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted my journey to <hi>Hanover,</hi> taking <hi>Lambſpring</hi> in my way, a place where there is a convent of Engliſh Monks; and there I met with a very aged worthy and harmeleſs Gentleman St. <hi>Thomas Gaſcoigue,</hi> a Perſon of more integrity and pietie then to be guilty, ſo much as in thought, of what miſcreants falſly ſwore againſt him in the licentions time of plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; the Lord Abbot and ſeverall of the Monks I had ſeen there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. This monaſtery is very obliging to all ſtrangers that travell that way, as well as to theire own Countreymen, and is highly reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the neighbouring Princes of all perſuaſions, as the Princes
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57761:83"/>
of the houſe of Lunenburg, the Landgrave of Heſſen, and Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> who as Biſhop of <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersheim</hi> is their ordinary. The town of Lambſpring is Lutheran though under the government of the Lord Abbot and his chapter, who conſtantly chooſe Lutheran Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats and Officers for the civill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and live together in that love and unitie, that as yet there hath never the leaſt debate happened amongſt them; and indeed this harmoney is now to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in moſt parts of Germany where different Religions are profeſſed. When I conſidered ſo many goodly faces both of Monks and ſtudents in that Abbey, I could not forbeare to make a ſerious reflexion on the number of the Engliſh whom I had ſeen in the colledges and Cloyſters abroad, as at <hi>Rome, Rattesbonne, Wirtzburg</hi> in <hi>Lorraine,</hi> at <hi>Liege, Louvain, Bruſſels, Dunkerk, Ghent, Paris,</hi> and other places,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57761:83"/>
beſides the ſeverall Nunneries, and withall on the loſs that both King and Kingdome ſuffered thereby, when ſo many of our natives both men and women ſhould be conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſpend their own Eſtats and the benevolence of others in a ſtrange Land, which amounts to more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney than at firſt one may imagine; and this thought, I confeſs, made me wiſh it were otherwiſe. I would not have the Reader to miſtake mee here, as if I eſpouſed, or pleaded for any particular party; No, I plead onely for the ſentiments of humanity, without which our nature degenerates into that of brutes, and for the love that every honeſt man ought to have for his Countrey. I am aſmuch a friend to the Spaniſh Inquiſition, as to the perſecuting of tender Conſcienced proteſtants, provided there be no more but Conſcience in the caſe; and I could heartily with that Papiſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants could live as lovingly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57761:84"/>
in <hi>England</hi> as they doe in <hi>Holland, Germany,</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; for give mee leave to ſay it, I love not that Religion which in ſtead of exalting, deſtroys the Principles of morality and humane ſocietie. I have met with honeſt men of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, even Turks and Jews, who in their lives and manners have far exceeded many of our Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick profeſſors at home; and when ever this happened, I could not forbeare to love the men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out embraceing there Religion, for which they themſelves are to account to their great maſter and Judge.</p>
            <p>In my progreſs towards <hi>Hanover</hi> I touched at <hi>Hildersheim</hi> a city whoſe Magiſtrates are Lutheran, though Roman Catholicks have the Cathedrall Church, and ſeverall monaſteries there. The court of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover</hi> makes another kind of figure than that of <hi>Caſſels,</hi> it being the court of a greater Prince, who is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57761:84"/>
Biſhop of <hi>Oſnaburg,</hi> duke of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick Lunenburg, Hanover</hi> &amp;c. Here I had the honour to kiſs the hands of the Princeſs Royall <hi>Sophia</hi> youngeſt ſiſter to the late Prince Rupert. Her highneſs has the character of the <hi>Merry debonnaire Princeſs</hi> of Germany, a lady of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary virtue and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and miſtriſs of the Italian, French, High and low dutch and Engliſh languages, which ſhe ſpeaks to perfection. Her husband has the title of the Gentlemen of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> a gracefull and comely Prince both a foot and on horſeback, civill to ſtrangers beyond compare, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Kind and beneficent to people in diſtreſs, and known in the world for a valiant and experienced Soldier. I had the honour to ſee his troops which without controverſie are as good men, and commanded by as expert Officers as any are in Europe: Amongſt his Officers I found brave <hi>Steel-hand Gordon</hi> Collonel of an
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57761:85"/>
Excellent Regiment of horſe, <hi>Grimes, Hamilton, Talbot</hi> and others of our Kings ſubjects. God hath bleſt the Prince with a numerous offſpring, having ſix ſons all galant Princes; of whom the two eldeſt ſignalized themſelves ſo bravely at the raiſing of the ſiege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> that as an undoubted proofe of their valour they brought three Turks home to this court priſoners. His Eldeſt ſon is married to a moſt beautifull Princeſs ſole heireſs of the duke of <hi>Lunenbourg</hi> and <hi>Zell</hi> his elder brother; as the lovely Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs his daughter is lately married to the Electorall Prince of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg. He is a gracious Prince to his people, and keeps a very ſplendid court, having in his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for the uſe of himſelf and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren no leſs than fifty two ſets of coach horſes. he himſelf is Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, but as his ſubjects are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of different perſuaſions, nay and ſome of them Jews too, ſo
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57761:85"/>
both in his court and army he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains Gentlemen of various opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Countries, as Italian ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, and Gentlemen that ſerve him, and many Calviniſt French Officers: neither is he ſo bigotted in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion but that he and his Children goe many times to Church with the Princeſs who is a Calviniſt, and joine with her in her devotion. His Countrey is good, having gold and ſilver mines in it, and his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects live well under him; as doe thoſe alſo of his brother the duke of <hi>Lunenbourg,</hi> and their Cozen the duke of <hi>Wolfembottel,</hi> which are the three Princes of the houſe of <hi>Lunenbourg;</hi> of whom it may be ſaid that they have alwayes ſtuck honeſtly to the right ſide, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended the intereſts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; ſo that no by reſpect, neither honour nor profit, could ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them, as it has with others, to make them abandon the publick concern.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:57761:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
From this Princes court I went to <hi>Zell</hi> the reſidence of the duke the elder brother of the familie. This Prince is called the mighty <hi>Nimrod</hi> becaus of the great delight he takes in horſes, dogs and hunting. He did mee the honour to let mee ſee his ſtables, wherein he keeps 370 horſes moſt of them Engliſh, or of Engliſh breed. His dogs which are alſo Engliſh, are ſo many, that with great care they are quartered in ſeverall apartments according to their Kind and qualities, there being a large office like a brewhouſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for boyling of malt and Corn for them. It is this valiant Prince who tooke <hi>Tieves</hi> from the French, and made the <hi>Mareshall de Crequi</hi> priſoner: he is extreamely obliging to ſtrangers, and hath ſeverall brave Scottiſh Officers under his pay, as Major General <hi>Erskin, Graham, Coleman, Hamilton Melvin</hi> and others. His Lieutenant General is one <hi>Chavot</hi> a Proteſtant of <hi>Alſatia</hi>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:57761:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an excellent and experienced com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; who did mee the honour to treat mee three days at his houſe, where with all his <hi>Scottish</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Officers, whom he had invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wee liberally drank to the health of our preſent King, having, as he told us, ſerved under his Majeſtie, when duke of <hi>York,</hi> both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he gained the reputation both for skill and conduct in the wars not onely from Mareſhall <hi>Turin</hi> a competent Judge, but alſo from all other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Perſons who had the honour to know him, that fame hath made better know'n in the world than the encomium which that generous Gentleman ingenuouſly gave, and which heere I ſpare to relate. I ſhall adde no more concerning this Prince, his Officers, or Countrey; but that he with the other two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the houſe of <hi>Lunenbourg Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover</hi> and <hi>Wolfenbottel,</hi> can upon occaſion bring into the field 36000
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57761:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Soldiers whom they keep in conſtant pay, and ſuch men as I never ſaw better in my life.</p>
            <p>After ſome ſtay at the Court of the duke of <hi>Zell</hi> I went to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> a famous Hanſiatick town. It is a republick and city of great trade, occaſioned partly by the Engliſh Company of Merchant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, but much more by the dutch Proteſtants who in the time of the <hi>Duke of Alba</hi> forſook the low Countries and ſeltled here, and the Proteſtants alſo who were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of <hi>Cologne</hi> and other places in Germany; who nevertheleſs are not now allowed publick Churches within the citie, but at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Altena</hi> a village belonging to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> a quarter of an houres walk diſtant from <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg.</hi> This Commonwealth is Lutheran and governed by four <hi>Burgemaſters,</hi> twenty four <hi>Radts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres,</hi> and a common Council of all the Burghers who have above
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57761:87"/>
40 ſchellings <hi>per annum</hi> free hold. The ſymbole or Motto under their Armes is, <hi>da pacem domine in diebus noſtris,</hi> and in their Standart are theſe letters S. P. Q. H. The people here grone under heavy tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and impoſitions; The State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus of continuall Alarms they have from the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> or other neighbours; and the inteſtine broiles that frequently happen here, as well as at <hi>Cologne,</hi> where the Burgemaſters are often in danger of their lives from the mutinous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile; being ſorced to maintain ſix or ſeaven thouſand men in pay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides two or three men of war to guard their havens from pirats. I ſhall not name all the wayes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing taxes which this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth uſes, becaus in moſt they imitate the methods of the <hi>States Generall</hi> as to that, which have bin mentioned before: I ſhall onely take notice of ſome peculiar cuſtomes they have, wherein they
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57761:88"/>
differ from Holland. When a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſhoe maker, or any other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizan dies, leaving a widow and Children, another of the ſame trade is not admitted to ſet up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a maſter; unleſs he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with the widow for a piece of money, or elſe marry her, or a daughter of hers with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>If any man cauſe another to be arreſted for debt or upon any other ſuit, the plaintif muſt goe along with the Officer who arreſts the party and ſtay by him untill the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner be examined by the ſheriff; ſo that if the ſheriff be not to be ſpoken with that night, the plaintiff muſt tarry with the priſoner all night, untill the ſheriff examine the matter, and ſee cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging or committing the party; but this a plaintiff may doe by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curation Notariall.</p>
            <p>If a priſoner be committed for debt, the plaintiff muſt maintain
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57761:88"/>
him in priſon according to his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: and if the party lye in priſon during the ſpace of ſix yeares, at the expiration of that time the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner is diſcharged; and if during the time of his impriſonment, the plaintif doe not punctually pay the priſoners allowance at the months end, the priſoner is ſet at liberty, and nevertheleſs the plaintiff muſt pay the Gailer the laſt months al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.</p>
            <p>This ſtate is ſevere in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice againſt thieves, murders and cheats. There is no pardon to be expected for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and a Burgemaſter himſelf if guilty cannot eſcape. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Murder is here as in <hi>Sweden,</hi> breaking malefactors on the wheele, pinching their breaſts and Arms with hot Pincers, ſpeeting them in at the fundament and out at the ſhoulder, they have alſo cruel wayes of torturing to make priſoners confeſs; And are very carefull not to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57761:89"/>
be cheated in their publick revenue, their acciſemen and collectors being puniſhed as in <hi>Holland.</hi> They take a very good courſe not to be chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their acciſe; for all the mils of the Countrey are in the hands the State; ſo that no baker nor brewer can grind his own corn, but muſt have it ground at the States mills, where they pay the acciſe. There is a Generall tax upon all houſes, and that is the Eight penny, which nevertheleſs does not excuſe them from chimney money. The States here as at <hi>Genoa</hi> in Italy are the publick vintners, of whom all people muſt buy their wine, which they buy from the Merchants, or otherwiſe import it in their own ſhips. In their ceremonies of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying and Chriſtening, they are ridiculouſly prodigall; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. If one invite a Burgema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, he muſt give him a ducat in gold, if a <hi>Raedtsheer,</hi> that is, an Alderman, a Rixdollar, to every
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57761:89"/>
Preacher, Doctor of Phyſick, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat or Secretary halfe a Rixdollar, and to every Schoolmaſter the third part of a Rixdoller. The women are the inviters to Burialls, wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and Chriſtenings, who weare an Antick Kind of a dreſs, having mitered caps as high again as the Miter of a Biſhop. The Churches here are rich in revenues, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, as Images and Stately Organs wherein they much delight. They are great lovers of Muſick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſo much that I have told 75 maſters of ſeverell ſorts of Muſick in one Church, beſides thoſe who were in the Organ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>gallery. Their Organs are extraordinarely large. I meaſured the great pipes in the Organs of St. <hi>Catharins</hi> and St. <hi>James's</hi> Churches, and found them to be 3 foot and 3 quarters in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference and 32 foot long; in each of which Organs there are two Pipes 5 foot and 8 inches round. The wealth and trade of this
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57761:90"/>
citie encreaſes dayly: They ſend one year with another 70 Ships to Greenland, and have wonderfully engroſſed that trade from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and it is beleeved that ſmall and great there are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this Commonwealth five thouſand ſayl of Ships. After <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, Genoa,</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> their bank is reckoned the chiefe in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; but in trade they are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the third in Europe, and come next to <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam. Hambourg</hi> is now become the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine of Germany and of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and northern ſeas. They give great priviledges to the Jewes, and to all ſtrangers whatſoever, Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Engliſh Company of Merchant Adventurers, whom they allow a large building, where they have a Church, and where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty governour, Secretary, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and the other Officers of the Company live, to whom they yearly make preſent of Wine,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57761:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Beere, Sheep, Salmond and Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon in their ſeaſons. And ſo much of <hi>Hambourg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Hambourg</hi> I went to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> which is alſo a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth and Imperiall town. It is a large well built city contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ten pariſh Churches; the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall dedicated to St. <hi>Peter</hi> being in length 500 foot, with two high ſpires all covered with braſs as the reſt of the Churches of that ciry are. In former times this city was the place where the deputies of all the Hanſiatick towns aſſembled, and was once ſo powerfull as to make war againſt <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and to conquer ſeverall places and Iſlands belonging to thoſe two Crowns, nay and to lend Ships to England and other Potentates, without any prejudice to their own trade, wherein they vied in all parts with their neighbours; but it is now exceedingly run into decay not onely in territories, but in wealth
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57761:91"/>
and trade alſo. And the reaſon of that was chiefely the inconſiderate zeal of their Lutheran Miniſters who perſwaded the Magiſtrates to baniſh all Roman Catholicks, Calviniſts, Jews, and all that diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them in matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, even the Engliſh Company too, who all went and ſetled in <hi>Hambourg,</hi> to the great advantage of that city and almoſt ruine of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> which hath not now above 200 Ships belonging to it, nor more territories to the State; than the city it ſelf and a ſmall part cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Termond</hi> about eight miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from it. The reſt of there ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories are now in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> by whom the burghers are ſo continually al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed, that they are quite tired out with keeping guard and paying of Taxes. The city is indeed well fortified; but the government not being able to maintain above 1500 Soldiers in pay, 400 Burghers
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57761:91"/>
in two Companies are obliged to watch every day. They have a large well built Stathouſe, and an Exchange covered, on the top whereof the globes of the world are painted. This Exchange is about fifty yards in the length, and but fifteen in breadth; over it there is a Roome where the skins of five Lions which the Burghers killed at the city gates in the year 1252 are kept ſtuft. The great market place is very large where a monumentall ſtone is to be ſeen, on which one of their Burgemaſters was beheaded for running away without fighting in a ſea engagement. The people here ſpend much time in their Churches at devotion, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts chiefely in ſinging. The women are beautifull but diſfigured with a kind of Antick dreſs; they wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cloaks like men. It is cheap living in this town; for one may hire a palace for a matter of 20 L. a year, and have proviſions at
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57761:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
very reaſonable rates: beſides the air and water is very good; the city being ſupplied with fountains of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent freſh water, which <hi>Hambourg</hi> wants; and good ground for cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerage, there being cellars here fourty or fifty foot deep.</p>
            <p>I had the curioſity to goe from <hi>Lubeck</hi> to ſee the Ancient city of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> but found it ſo ruined and decayed by the Swediſh war, that I had no encouragement to ſtay there. I therefore haſtened to <hi>Berlin</hi> the chiefe reſidence of the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> at whoſe Court I mett with a very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous French Merchant who tould me that he and divers other Merchants were deſigned to have lived in <hi>England,</hi> but were diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by a letter ſent from <hi>London,</hi> by a French man that was removeing from thence to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> for theſe following reaſon which I cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied out of his Letter; Firſt becauſe the Reformed Religion is perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57761:92"/>
in <hi>England</hi> as it is in <hi>France,</hi> the which I tould him was a great untruth, for it is apparent that they have been all along graciouſly admitted, and received into his Majeſties Dominions, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, &amp; allowed the free exerciſe of their owne forme of worſhip, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine &amp; diſcipline of the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> nor can they who converſe with the French Miniſters either in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> be Ignorant, that the chiefeſt part, if not all thoſe Miniſters are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to complye with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and it is Evident that moſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants (ſo called;) in <hi>Holland</hi> make uſe of Organs in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</p>
            <p>A ſecond thing was that both the bank of <hi>London</hi> and the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Gouldſmiths were all broak, the which I tould this Frenchman was not true altogether, for there are many able Bankers whome I named
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57761:93"/>
as <hi>Alderman Fowles, Alderman Hornbey, Alderman Duncomb, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman Founs, Mr. Thomas Cook, Mr. Rob: Vyner, Mr. Childe, Mr. Endes, Mr. Evans</hi> and others well known to the world by their ſolid dealling: neyther was the Bank (as he called the Chamber of <hi>London)</hi> broak, only it had been under the management of a bad Perſon whoſe deſigne was to bring it into diſgrace; beſides there is the <hi>Eaſt-India Company</hi> an unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſecuritie for thoſe as have money to diſpoſe of, together with another undeniable ſecuritie which is Land. Thirdly he ſaith, that in <hi>England</hi> there is no Regiſter, and therefore many frauds in purchaſes &amp; morga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which begett teadious ſuites, and renders both dangerous to truſt; Fourtly that if a man would purchaſe land he cannot, being an Alien, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Naturalized. Fiftly that in <hi>England</hi> there are ſo many plots and Confuſions in Goverment that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57761:93"/>
the Kingdome is hardly quiet twenty yeares together.</p>
            <p>Sixtly that falſe wittneſſes were ſo common in <hi>England</hi> and the crime of perjury ſo ſlightly puniſhed, that no man could be ſafe in life or Eſtate if he chanced to be in trouble. Laſtly he ſaid that the <hi>English</hi> are ſo reſtleſs and quarreleſome, that they not only foment and cheriſh Animoſities amongſt one another, but are Every foot contriving and plotting againſt their lawfull ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and the Goverment. By ſuch ſurmiſes and inſinuations as theſe the <hi>French</hi> and Germans are ſcared from truſting themſelves and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in England and therefore ſettle in <hi>Amſterdam, Hamburg</hi> and other Cittyes, where there are Banks and Regiſters; This I ſay is one cauſe why there are now to be ſeene at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſuch vaſt numbers of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> who have much inriched that Citty and raiſed the rents of the houſes 20 percent,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57761:94"/>
and the ſilkeweavers grow alſo verie rich keeping ſo many Almes Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to doe their work and having all their labour without any charge only for the teaching them their trades; which hath leſſened the revenues of the <hi>French</hi> crown, and will in tyme greately increaſe the number of the States ſubjects, and advance ther publick Incomes.</p>
            <p>To ſay the truth the inconſtancy and wantonneſſe of the <hi>English</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially of late tymes, when no other cauſe could be given for it, but to much eaſe and plenty, is not only wondered at but refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon by foreigners; yet I am morally certaine that could the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> be once againe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in love and affection as they are bound to be in duty and Intreſt, and would they be as willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their own hapines as heaven hath been kind and liberal in beſtowing the meanes of it, with a good and gratious Prince ſolicitous
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57761:94"/>
for preſerveing the ſame to them, could wee be ſo bleſt as wee have great reaſon to Expect wee may under the Auſpicious reigne of him whoſe royall Virtues are dreaded by none either at home or a broad but ſuch as are the diſturbers of publick and lawfull Authoritie.</p>
            <p>Having made this digreſſion, I return to <hi>Berlin,</hi> It is a city lately enlarged with fair ſtreets and palaces. The Magiſtrates of the place are Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, which is the publick eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Religion in all the Electors dominions; though he himſelf and his Children be Calviniſts. He is lookt upon to be ſo true to that perſuaſion, that he is reckoned the Protector of the Calviniſts; and indeed he ſollicited the Emperour very hard for a toleration of the Proteſtants in Hungary. His cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, as moſt of the Lutheran miniſters alſo, endeavour to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Engliſh in their way of preaching: and his highneſs is ſo
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57761:95"/>
much taken with Engliſh divinity, that he entertains divines for trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating Engliſh books into the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man tongue, as <hi>the whole duty of man</hi> and ſeverall others. He has a large and Srately palace at <hi>Berlin</hi> and therein a copious library enriched with many manuſcripts, medalls, and rarities of Antiquity. He may compare with moſt Princes for hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome guards, being all of them proper well bodied men, and moſt part Officers who ride in his guards of horſe. As he is know'n in the world to be a valiant and warlick Prince, ſo he maintains in pay an Army of 36000 men; beſides five or ſix thouſand horſmen, who in time of war are modelled into troopes; with which body during the late war with <hi>Sweden,</hi> his highneſs in Perſon beat the <hi>Swedes</hi> out of his Countrey. Hee keeps his forces in ſtrickt Diſcipline, obliging all the Officers, if Proteſtants, on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days and holy days to march their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57761:95"/>
Companies in order to Church, but if a ſuperiour Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer be of a contrary perſuaſion, then the next in commiſſion ſupplies his place. This cuſtome is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly obſerved by all his highneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes garriſons; whileſt he himſelf with his Children, being five ſons, two Daughters, and two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in law, goe conſtantly to the Calviniſt Church adjoyning to the Court. Amongſt other acts of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick pietie and charitie, this Prince hath eſtabliſhed and endowed ſome Religious houſes or Nunneries for Proteſtant young ladies, where they may live virtuouſly and ſpend their time in devotion as long as they pleaſe, or otherwiſe marry, if they think fit, but then they loſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Monaſtery. There is one of theſe at <hi>Herford</hi> in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia, where I was and had the honour to wait upon the Lady Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſs the Princeſs <hi>Eliſabeth,</hi> eldeſt ſiſter of the Elector Palatine and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57761:96"/>
Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> who is ſince dead. Nothwithſtanding the late wars with <hi>Sweden</hi> and that by the prevalency of <hi>France</hi> in that haſty treaty of peace concluded at <hi>Nimwegen,</hi> his Electorall Highneſs was obliged to give back what he had Juſtly taken from that crown; yet his ſubjects flouriſh in wealth and trade, his highneſs having encouraged manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of all ſorts, by inviting Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans into his dominions, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a Company of tradeing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to the Weſt-Indies, which will much advance navigation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his ſubjects. And in all humane probabilitie they are like to continue in a happy condition, ſeing by the alliances his highneſs hath made with the Proteſtant Princes of the Empire, and eſpecially the houſe of <hi>Lunenbourg,</hi> they are in no danger of being diſturbed by their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. I told you before that the Prince of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> was married to the Daughter of the duke of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57761:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Hanover,</hi> ſo that ſo long as that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance holds, the families of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg</hi> and <hi>Lunenbourg</hi> will be in a condition to caſt the ballance of the Empire; they both together being able to bring into the field 80000 as good men as any are in Europe.</p>
            <p>When I parted from <hi>Berlin</hi> I made a turn back to <hi>Lunenbourg</hi> in my way to Swedland, where I found ſeverall of my Countrey men Officers in the gariſon, who ſhew'd mee what was moſt remarkeable in the city, as the Saltworks (which bring in conſiderable ſummes of money to the duke of <hi>Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg)</hi> the Stathouſe, and Churches, in one of which I ſaw a communion table of pure ducat gold. From thence I went into the Province of of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> and at a ſmall ſea port called <hi>Termond,</hi> of which I ſpake, before, I embarked for <hi>Sweden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that hath read in the hiſtories of this laſt age the great exploits of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57761:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> and his <hi>Swedes,</hi> perhaps may have a fancy that it muſt be an excellent Countrey which hath bredſuch warriours; but if he approach it, he will ſoon find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf undeceived. Entering into <hi>Sweedland</hi> at a place called <hi>Lands<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ort,</hi> wee ſailed forwards amongſt high rocks having no other proſpect from Land but mountains till wee came to <hi>Dollers,</hi> which is about four Swediſh, that is, twenty four Engliſh miles from <hi>Stockholm,</hi> the capitall citie of the Kingdome: upon my comeing a ſhore I confeſs I was a litle ſurpriſed to ſee the poverty of the people; and the litle wooden houſes they lived in, not unlike Soldiers huts in a leaguer; but much more, when I diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red litle elſe in the Countrey but mountanous rocks and ſtanding lakes of water. The Reader will excuſe mee, I hope, if I remarke not all that I may have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in this Countrey, ſeing by
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57761:97"/>
what I have already written, he may perceive that my deſigne is rather to obſerve the manner of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants living, then to give a full deſcription of every thing that may be ſeen in the Countrey they live in. However I ſhall ſay ſomewhat of that too, having premiſed once for all that the ordinary people are wretchedly poor; yet not ſo much occaſioned by the Publick taxes, as the barrenneſs of their Countrey, and the oppreſſion of the nobles their Landlords, and immediate ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, who till the preſent King put a ſtop to their violences, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically domineered over the lives and fortunes of the poor pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants. From <hi>Dollers</hi> I took waggon to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> changing horſes three times by the way, by reaſon of the badneſs of the rode, on all hands environed with rocks, that hardly open ſo much as here and there to leave a ſhred of plain ground. At two miles diſtance upon that rode
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57761:98"/>
the citie of <hi>Stockholme</hi> looks great; becaus of the Kings palace, the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Noblemen, and ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which are ſeated upon rocks; and indeed, the whole citie and ſuburbs ſtand upon rocks, unleſs it be ſome few houſes built upon ground gained from the rivers that run throw the town. <hi>Stockholme</hi> has its name from a ſtock or logg of wood which three brothers threw into the water five miles above the city, making a vow that where ever that ſtock ſhould ſtop, they would build a caſtle to dwell in. The ſtock ſtopt at the Holme or rock where the palace of the King now ſtands; and the brothers to be as good as their word, there built their caſtle, which invited others to doe the like; ſo that in proceſs of time the other rocks or holmes were covered with buildings which at length became the capital citie of the Kingdome. It is now embelliſhed with a great many
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57761:98"/>
Stately houſes, and much emproved from what it was 400 yeares agoe, as indeed, moſt cities are; for the Stathouſe then built, is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temtible and low that in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> it would not be ſuffered to ſtand to diſgrace the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Council Chamber where the Burgemaſter and <hi>Raedt</hi> ſit, is two rooms caſt into one not above nine foot high; and the two rooms where the ſheriffs and the Erve col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (which is a Judicature like to the <hi>Doctors Commons</hi> in England) ſit are not above eight foot and a halfe high. The Kings Palace is a large ſquare of ſtone building, in ſome places very high, but an old and irregular fabrick, without a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantitie of ground about it for gardens and walks. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſurrounded with water; but ſome yeares ſince part of it was filled up to make a way from the caſtlegate down into the old town. In this Palace there are large rooms; but
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57761:99"/>
the lodgings of the King, Queen and Royall familie are three pair of ſtairs high, the rooms in the firſt and ſecond ſtory's being deſtin'd for the Senat Chamber and other courts of Judicature. The Kings library is four pair of ſtairs high, being a room about fourty ſix foot ſquare, with a cloſet adjoyning to it not half the dimenſions. When I conſidered the appartments and furniture of this Court, I began to think that the French Author wrote truth, who in his Remarks upon Swedland ſayes, that when Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> reſigned the Crown to <hi>Carolus Guſtaphus</hi> the father of this preſent King, ſhe diſpoſed of the beſt of the furniture of the Court, and gave away a large ſhare of the Crown lands to her favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites; in ſo much that the King conſidering the poor condition ſhe had left the Kingdome in, and ſeeing the Court ſo meanely furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ſaid that had he know'n be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he accepted the Crown, what
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57761:99"/>
then he did, he would have taken other meaſures.</p>
            <p>There are many other Stately pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces in <hi>Stockholme</hi> belonging to the nobilitie; but many of them for want of repairs, and not being inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted run to ruine; ſeverall of the nobles who lived in them formerly, having loſt the eſtates that maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their ancient ſplendour, as wee ſhall ſee hereafter, being retired unto a Countrey life. There are alſo ſome other magnificent ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures begun, but not finiſhed, as that Stately building intended for a Parliament houſe for the nobles, and two or three Churches: but what I moſt wonder at is the vault wherein the late King lies buried, is not as yet covered but with boards, for it is to he obſerved that the Kings of <hi>Sweeden</hi> have no tombs and monuments as in England and other Countries; but are put into copper coffins with inſcriptions on them, and placed one by another in vaults
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57761:100"/>
adjoyning to the Gray Friers Church. Theſe vaults are about Eight in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, having turets over them with vains of Copper gilt, carved into the ciphers of the ſeverall Kings who give them their names by being the firſt that are interred in them. The vault of the late King is not yet finiſhed, no more then the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks above mentioned, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be imputed to the late troubles of <hi>Swedland.</hi> The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the inhabitants of <hi>Stockholme</hi> are alſo much decreaſed within theſe few yeares, partly by reaſon of the removal of the Court of Admiraltie and the Kings Ships from that citie to <hi>Charles-crown,</hi> a new haven lately made about 200 Engliſh miles from thence, which hath draw'n many families belonging to the fleet and Admiralitie from <hi>Stockholme</hi> to live there: and partly becaus many of the nobilitie, gentry and thoſe that depended on them, are, as I ſaid before, withdraw'n from <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:57761:100"/>
to a retired life in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Nevertheleſs the ordinary ſort of Bourghers who ſtill remain are extreamly poor; ſeing the women are fain to worke like horſes, drawing carts, and as labourers in England, ſerving maſons and bricklayers with ſtone, bricks and mortar, and unloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding veſſells that bring thoſe mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials; ſome of the poor creatures in the ſummertime toyling in their ſmocks without either ſhoes or ſtockings. They performe alſo the part of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen, and for a ſmall matter will row paſſengers 40 miles or more if they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>The Court here is very thin and ſilent, the King living frugally &amp; ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome dining in publick. He eats commonly with <hi>the two Queens</hi> his mother and conſort, who is a virtuous Princeſs ſiſter to the King of Denmark. She is the mother of five Children, three ſons and two daughters, with whom ſhe ſpends moſt of her time in retirement. The
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57761:101"/>
King is a goodly Prince whom God hath bleſſed and endowed with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments far beyond what might have been expected from his education, wherein he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly abuſed, being taught litle more than his mother tongue. He is gracious, Juſt and valiant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant at his devotion, and utterly averſe from all kind of debauchery, and the unfaſhionable vanities of other courts in playes, and danceing.</p>
            <p>His Sports are hunting and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeing of his guards, and he rarely appeares publickly or gives audience to ſtrangers, which is imputed to his ſenſe of the neglect of his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. He is a Prince that hath had a very hard beginning in the world, which hath many times proved fortunate to great men; and indeed, if wee conſider all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his early miſfortunes, how he was ſlighted and neglected by his nobles who would hardly vouchſaſe to pay him a viſit when he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57761:101"/>
was among them in the Countrey, or to doe him homage for the lands they held of the Crown; and how by the Pernicious councels of the French and the weakeneſs or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of his governours he was miſled into a war that almoſt coſt him his Crown, having loſt the beſt of his territories in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Schonen,</hi> and moſt of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both by ſea and land: If I ſay, theſe things be conſidered, it will probably appeare that hardly any Prince before him hath in a ſhorter time or more fully ſetled the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and prerogative of the Crown, then he hath done in <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> for which he ſtands no wayes obliged to France, as he was for the reſtauration of what he loſt during the war. He is now as abſolute as the French King, and makes Edicts which have the force of Laws with out the concurrence of the Eſtates of the Kingdome. He hath erected two Iudicatures the one called the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57761:102"/>
colledge of Reduction, and the other of inſpections; the firſt of which hath put his Majeſty in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion again of all lands alienated from the Crown, and the other called to account all perſons even the heires and executors of thoſe who had cheated the Crown, and made them <hi>refound</hi> what they or their predeceſlors had appropriated to their own uſe of the Publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue. Theſe two neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, as they have reduced many great families to a pinch, who formerly lived ſplendidly upon the Crown lands and revenues, and obliged them to live at home upon their ancient and private Patrimonie in the Countrey, which is one great cauſe that the Court of <hi>Sweden</hi> is at preſent ſo unfrequented; ſo have they enabled his Majeſtie, without burdening of his ſubjects, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Charges of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to maintain 64000 men in pay. The truth is his other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57761:102"/>

There are ſeverall other ſilly cuſtomes in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57761:103"/>
               <hi>Swedland</hi> that diſcourages men from tradeing there; as if any ſtranger die there, a third of his Eſtate muſt goe to the city or town where he traded. No forreigne Merchant in <hi>Stockholm</hi> can travell into any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where there is a faire without a paſsport: and at preſent ſeing there is no treaty of trade betwixt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> though the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh bring as conſiderable a trade to that Kingdome, as any other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey whatſoever, yet they are very unkindly uſed by the Officers of the cuſtome houſe; whereas the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and other cities have new and greater Priviledges allowed them. Nor would I Counſel an Engliſhman to goe to law with a Swediſh Burgher in <hi>Sweden,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he be a Whiggiſh Scot who hath got his freedome in <hi>Stockholme,</hi> for thoſe are a kind of skrapers, whom I have obſerved to be more invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate againſt the <hi>English</hi> then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Sweeds.</p>

Of all the Swediſh army of 64000 men, the King keeps but 12 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of 200 men a peece, with ſome few horſe guards in <hi>Stockholme,</hi> who are not upon duty as ſentinels at the Court gates, as at the Courts of other Princes. The reſt are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed into quarters and garriſons upon the fronteers which are ſo far diſtant in that large compaſs of land which his territories take up, that it would require a hard and tedious worck to bring them together to a generall muſter. They are however kept under very ſtrick diſcipline, and thoſe that lye neare often viewed by the King. They have od ſorts of puniſhments for the Souldiers and Officers of all degrees: for example if a Serjeant or Corporall be drunk or negligent on duty, they are put into armour, and with three muskets tied under each arm, made to walke two hours before the Court of guard: yet for all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of diſcipline uſed againſt the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57761:104"/>
Soldiers, they commit many abuſes in the night time, robbing and ſometimes killing men upon the ſtreets in <hi>Stockholme,</hi> where they have no lights nor guards as in <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhaguen.</hi> Informer times there have been at one time thirty five Collonels beſides Generall Officers in the Swediſh Army all the ſubjects of the King of great Britain, but at preſent there are few or none, unleſs it be the ſons of ſome Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Officers deceaſed; nor did I ever ſee an Engliſhman in the Kings guards horſe or foot but one, and the ſon of <hi>Sr. Eduard</hi> wood, who hath ſince quitted the ſervice. The King hath exceedingly won the hearts of the common people, not onely by exempting them from the tyrannical Juriſdiction of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and gentry, who formerly would by their own private authority pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and put to death the peaſants at their pleaſure; which makes the Countries very willing to quarter the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57761:104"/>
Kings Soldiers, but by his exactneſs in puniſhing duels, murder and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries. Perjury is death here alſo as in Holland: which makes the Magiſtrates in ſome ports of this Kings territories enjoyne ſtrange kinds of oaths to deter men from being forſworn. As for inſtance, in ſome places, the witneſs is ſet, with a ſtaff in his hand, upon ſome peeble ſtones and charcoale, where he is to imprecate and pray, that if what he ſweareth be not true, his land may become as barren as thoſe ſtones, and his ſubſtance be conſumed to aſhes like the coals he ſtands on, which as ſoon as he ſteps down are ſet on fire. This manner of ſwearing ſo terrifies the people, that they commonly tremble when they come to take their oath.</p>
            <p>The Religion of the dominions of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> as of thoſe of the King of Denmark, and of other Princes and ſtates whom wee
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57761:105"/>
have named is Lutheran; who are more rigid to Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks and Calviniſts than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtanrs of Germany. There is no tolleration allowed here to Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt miniſters; and they take an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall courſe to keep the Countrey clear of prieſts and Jeſuits, by guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them whether they be young or old. In commemoration of the great loſſes and deſolation inſtained in the late war, the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſtrictly keep four faſting days in the months of <hi>April, May, June</hi> and <hi>July;</hi> on which days all men are prohibited by Authority to kindle fire in their houſes, or to eat till after Evening ſervice is don, which in the winter time could not be endured. They delight much in ſinging in their Churches, which they conſtantly performe twice every day, morning and evening. In their maryings, Chriſtenings and buryings they are ſo prodigally extravagant, that if all three happen in one yeare to a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57761:105"/>
man of a competent eſtate, it is enough to breake him, The clergy of <hi>Sweden</hi> are neither ſo rich nor learned as thoſe of Germany, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both the opportunities of ſtudy, and of converſing with learned men, that thoſe of other Countreys en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; though there be ſome learned men amongſt them. A Biſhoprick in <hi>Sweden</hi> is no great benefice, if compared with ſome Perſonages in England; for the Archbiſhop and Metropolitan hath not above 400 L. <hi>per ann.</hi> and ſome of the reſt are not worth above 150 or 200 L. a yeare. The inferiour Clergy are not ſo regular in their lives and converſation in the Countries di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Stockholme,</hi> as they are neare the court, and the reaſon is, partly becaus they entertain tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers that paſs the Countrey, there being no Ins in moſt places for the accommodation of perſons of any qualitie, and ſo are obliged to drink with their gueſts: and partly becaus
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57761:106"/>
at buryings and Chriſtenings, where there is commonly high drinking, the Pape or Parſon is maſter of the Ceremonies; And here give mee leave, to tell a ſhort ſtory of one of them. A Pape comeing to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten a Child in a Church, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Scottiſh man to be Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was ſo tranſported either with Zeal or his cups, that when he came to exorciſe the Child which is a rite uſed in their Office of Adminiſtring that Sacrament, He neglected the forme preſcribed by the liturgie, and in an extemporary prayer begg'd that the devill might depart out of the Child, and enter into that Scottiſh Heretick; for ſo they call the Presbyterians of that nation. The prayer of the Pape ſo incenſed the Scot that he vowed revenge, and watched the Pape with a good cudgell next day as he croſſed the Church yard, where he beat him and left him all in blood lying on the ground and crying out murder.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57761:106"/>
For this fact the Scot was had before the Juſtice, who asking him how he durſt be ſo bold as to lay his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane hands upon the man of God, He, who knew very well what uſe to make of the devill he had got, foaming at the mouth and cunningly acting the demoniack, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that the Pape might thank himſelf for what he had met with; for ſince he had conjured the devill into him he ſpared no body, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wife nor Children, nor would he ſpare the Juſtice himſelf, and with that ſell a mangling and tearing the Magiſtrat, that he was fain to betake himſelf to his heeles, crying out <hi>O! the devill, ſave mee;</hi> and ſo the Scot marched home no man daring to lay hold on him, for fear of being torn to peeces by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. But the Juſtice recollecting himſelf ſent for the Pape, told him that the Scot was a cunning rogue, and bid him goe home, get a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for his head and be ſilent; leaſt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57761:107"/>
if the matter came to the Biſhops ears, he might be cenſured for goeing againſt the rubrick of the liturgie.</p>
            <p>The famous Univerſitie where their Clergy are bred is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſall</hi> eight Swediſh miles from <hi>Stockholme.</hi> There are commonly 150 or 200 Students there, but no endowed colledges as in other Counrries. The library is ſo meane and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible that the libraries of many Grammar Schools and of privat men in England or Holland are far better ſtored with books then it is. Upon viewing of it, and that of the Kings Palace, I called to mind the ſaying of a French man, upon the like occaſion; That <hi>Swedland</hi> came behind <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> in the knowledge of men and things at leaſt 800 yeares; yet ſome <hi>Swedes</hi> have been ſo conceited of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of their Countrey, as to bragg that Paradice was ſeated in <hi>Sweden,</hi> that the Countrey was
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57761:107"/>
turned into ſuch heaps of rocks for the rebellion of our firſt parents, and that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> in a Countrey three <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi> miles diſtant from <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſall.</hi> A French man ſtanding by and hearing this Romantick ſtory, as I was told, fitted him with the like, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that when the world was made in ſix days, at the end of the creation all the Rubbiſh that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained was throw'n together into a corner, which made up <hi>Sweden</hi> and Norway. And indeed the French ſeeme to have no great like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Countrey, what ever kindneſs they may have for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for a French Ambaſſadour, as an author of that Countrey relates, being by order of Queen Chriſtina treated in a Countrey houſe 4 Swediſh miles from <hi>Stockholme,</hi> and upon the rode goeing and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meing, with all the varieties and pleaſures that the Countrey could affoard, on purpoſe to make him
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57761:108"/>
have a good opinion of the ſame; made anſwere to the Queen (who asked him upon his return what he thought of <hi>Sweden)</hi> that were he maſter of the whole Countrey, he would preſently ſell it &amp; buy a farme in France or England; which, under favour, I think was a litle tart and ſawcy.</p>
            <p>Having ſtayed a conſiderable time in Swedland, and moſt part at <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme,</hi> I ſet out from thence to goe to <hi>Elſenbourg</hi> by land, and went a litle out of my way to ſee a ſmall city called <hi>Eubrone</hi> famous for a coat of Arms which it got in this manner. A certain Maſculine Queen of <hi>Denmark</hi> who had conquered a great part of <hi>Sweden,</hi> comeing to this city, asked the Magiſtrates, what was the Arms of their city; who having told her that they had none, ſhe plucked up her coats and ſquatting upon the Snow, bid them take the marke ſhe left there for their Arms: It's pity ſhe did not give them
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57761:108"/>
a ſuitable motto to it alſo. What that figure is called in blazonerie I know not, but to this day the city uſes it in their Armes, and for marking their commodities. This Queen came purpoſely into <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> to pay a viſit to a brave woman that oppoſed a King of <hi>Swedland,</hi> who in a time of famine would have put to death all the men and women in his Countrey above ſixty years of age. The Countrey all the way I travelled in <hi>Swedland</hi> is much of the ſame qualitie of the land about <hi>Stockholme,</hi> untill I came neare the Province of <hi>Schonen</hi> which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſtore houſe and Kitchin of <hi>Sweden,</hi> where the Countrey is far better. It was formerly very dangerous to travell in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Schonen,</hi> becaus of the Snaphances who were a kind of bloody robbers, now utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the King; ſo that it is ſafe enough travelling there. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into <hi>Schonen</hi> I ſaw twenty nine
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57761:109"/>
of theſe rogues upon wheeles, and elſewhere in the Countrey, ten and twenty at ſeverall places. The King uſed great ſeveritie in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; ſome he cauſed to be broken upon the wheele, others ſpceted in at the fundament and out at the ſhoulders, many had the fleſh pinched off of there breaſts, and ſo were faſtened to ſtakes till they died, and others again had their noſes and both hands cut off, and being ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a hot Iron were let goe to acquaint their camerades how they had been ſerved. The King is very ſevere againſt Highway-men and duellers. In above a hundred miles travelling, wee found not a houſe where there was either French wine or brandie, which made mee tell a <hi>Swede</hi> of our Company who was travelling to Denmark, that I would undertake to ſhew any man 500 houſes wherein a traveller might have wine and other good accommodation in the ſpace of an

All that remains to be done then, is to conclude this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe with an obvious and popular remark, that thoſe Countries where cities are greateſt and moſt frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by voluntary inhabitants, are alwayes the beſt to live in; and by comparing the city of <hi>London</hi> with all other cities of Europe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating by the ſurveys I have made (which I think will hardly be contradicted or confuted,) that of all the capitall cities of Europe it is the biggeſt and moſt populous, &amp; ſo prove conſequentially that England, for the generality of people, is the beſt Countrey in the world eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for its natives to live in. Now this being an obſervation, (for what I know) not hitherto made
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57761:117"/>
good by induction and inſtance, (as I intend to doe it) I hope it will pleaſe the Reader as much, as if I gave him a particular account of other Countreys and governments, and leave it to his own reflexion to State the compariſon.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>London</hi> within the walls cannot vie for bigneſs with many cities of Europe; yet take the city and ſuburbs together, according as it hath been ſurveyed by <hi>Mr. Morgan,</hi> in breadth from <hi>St. Georges</hi> Church in Southwarke to Shore ditch, and in length from Limehouſe to petty France in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> and it is in a vaſt proportion larger in compaſs of ground and number of houſes then any city whatſoever in Europe. This I shall demonſtrate firſt by compare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with ſome cities of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and then with the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable cities of the other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Europe, which I ſhall ſet down in an alphabeticall order with
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57761:117"/>
the number of the houſes they ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally contain.</p>
            <p>When <hi>London</hi> and ſuburbs was ſurveyed ſome years agoe by <hi>Mr. Morgan,</hi> there were reckoned to be in it 84000 houſes beſides hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, Almeshouſes, and other buildings that payed no chimney money to the King: Now if thoſe were added, and the vaſt number of new houſes that have been built ſince that ſurvey, upon modeſt computation <hi>London</hi> may be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to countain 100000 houſes; I know the <hi>French</hi> doe vapour and would perſwade the world that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> is much bigger then <hi>London.</hi> And the <hi>Hollanders</hi> will ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>London</hi> hath more <hi>Houſes</hi> then the 18 <hi>Cittyes</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> that have voyces in the States, for ſay they <hi>Amſterdam</hi> Stands upon a 1000 <hi>Morgens</hi> land, and <hi>London</hi> Stands but upon 1800; To both which I anſwer, that it is very true that <hi>Paris</hi> takes up a great ſpot of ground,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57761:118"/>
but then you muſt conſider, that in <hi>Paris</hi> there are ſeverall hundreds of <hi>Monaſteries, Churches, Coledges,</hi> and <hi>Cloyſters,</hi> ſome of them haveing large <hi>Gardens,</hi> and that in <hi>Paris</hi> there are 7500 <hi>Palaces</hi> and <hi>Ports</hi> for <hi>Coaches,</hi> which have likewiſe great <hi>Gardens,</hi> whereas <hi>London</hi> is very thick built, and in the <hi>Citty</hi> the <hi>Houſes</hi> have ſcarce a Yard big enough to ſett a <hi>Pump,</hi> or <hi>Houſe</hi> of conveniency in; but the weekely bills of <hi>Mortality</hi> will decide this <hi>Queſtion</hi> and plainely give it to <hi>London,</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Mons: la Cour,</hi> and Sir. <hi>William Pette</hi> in his laſt <hi>Eſſayes</hi> dedicated lately to our King, makeing it appeare that <hi>London</hi> is bigger then <hi>Paris, Rhoan,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell</hi> altogether; and as for <hi>Amfler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> I doe appeale to all knowing men that have ſeen it, that although it be true that it Stands upon 1000 <hi>Morgens Land;</hi> yet there is not above 400 <hi>Morgens</hi> built, and this I prove thus, that the large <hi>Gardens,</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:57761:118"/>
on the <hi>Heeregraft, Kyſersgraft,</hi> and <hi>Princegraft,</hi> and the <hi>Burgwalls</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> take up more then a third part of the <hi>Citty,</hi> then reckon the <hi>Baſtions,</hi> and the ſpace of <hi>Ground</hi> betweene the <hi>Wall,</hi> and the <hi>Houſes,</hi> and all the <hi>Ground</hi> unbuilt from the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tricks-Port,</hi> to the <hi>Weſoper-Port, Muyer-Port,</hi> and ſo to the <hi>Seaſide,</hi> and you will find it to be near 300 <hi>Morgens land:</hi> There are 2 <hi>Parishes</hi> in the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> viz <hi>Stepney,</hi> and <hi>St. Martins</hi> in the feilds, (the later being ſo big that the laſt Parlement divided it into 4 <hi>Parishes,)</hi> either of them have more <hi>Houſes</hi> then <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> or <hi>Harlem,</hi> and there are ſeverall other great <hi>Parishes</hi> as <hi>St. Margrets - Weſtminſter, St. Giles</hi> in the feilds, <hi>Toolyes,</hi> and <hi>St. Mary Overs,</hi> the which if they ſtood apart in the Country would make great <hi>Cittyes,</hi> wee reckon in <hi>London</hi> and the <hi>Suburbs</hi> thereof to be at leaſt 130 <hi>Parishes,</hi> which containe
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57761:119"/>
100000 <hi>Houſes,</hi> now if you reckon 8 <hi>perſons</hi> to everie houſe then there are neare 800000 ſoules in <hi>London,</hi> but there are ſome that ſay there is a million of ſoules in it; I ſhall now ſet downe the <hi>Cittyes Alphabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically</hi> and their number of <hi>Houſes</hi> as they were given to me not only from the <hi>Surveyours</hi> and <hi>Citty Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters,</hi> but from the <hi>Bookes</hi> of the <hi>Herthmoney,</hi> and bookes of the <hi>Verpoundings,</hi> where ſuch <hi>Taxes</hi> are payd; and firſt I ſhall begin with the 18 <hi>Cittyes</hi> that have Voyces in the <hi>States</hi> of Holland.</p>
