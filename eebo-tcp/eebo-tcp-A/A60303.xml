            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ortitude is one of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven morall vertues, of which there bee three sorts, there is Fortitude or Valour, which consists of rashnesse, which is to run wilfully upon danger, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no possibility to be a conqueror.</p>
            <p>Then there is an inforced Valour, which is, when a man must either kill or be killed.</p>
            <p>Lastly, there is a temperate Valour, those men which are indued with this sort of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, will neither give occasion to make abuse, neither will they take abuse, but are ready at all points to defend their King, Country and their owne persons, which is the onely true Valour; the other two sorts, though tearmed so, yet are not, but rather seeme to proceed from the loynes of cowardise; for to be truly valiant, is to be truly venturous, for as I said
<pb facs="tcp:94566:3"/>
before, that Fortitude is a vertue, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue comes goodnesse, wherefore conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be vailiant, is to be good.</p>
            <p>Then let all admire the goodnesse of that most honourable Knight Sir <hi>Kenelme Digby,</hi> which proceeded from his Valour, as I shall now declare.</p>
            <p>It is scarce unknowne to any how that he was exiled from his native soile England, which made him oftentimes thus to cry out,</p>
            <p>
               <q>Hei mihi quod Domino non licet ire meo</q>, woe is me, because it is unlawfull for me to see my Master (his King:) he kept his residence nigh to the Court of France, where hee was not lesse respected for the report of his former valour, then for the present affability and curtesie which he shewed to all men; <q>Omni so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> sapienti patria est</q>, to a wise man every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is to him as his owne native Country; but as the quietest of men sometimes have occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for strife, so did it fall out with this worthy Knight.</p>
            <p>It was his chance to bee envited by a Lord of France to dine with him, whither he went accompained with those servants he had; very merry they all were for a certaine space, at l<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ngth they fell to drinking of healths to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Kings, as to the King of France, the King of Spaine, the King of Portugall, and divers others, but in the conclusion, the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:94566:3"/>
which <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>nvited Sir <hi>Kenelme Digby</hi> to dinner, presumptuously beganne a health to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants coward in the world, directing the cup unto Sir <hi>Kenelme,</hi> who asked the Lord so soone as he had drunke whom that was hee did so tearme, hee bid him pledge the health and he should know, which he did; then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the French Lord, I meant your King of England, at which the good Knight see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med very much discontent, knowing in what nature his Soveraigne was wronged, yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wisely did hee seeme to passe it by untill dinner being ended, then did hee desire the same Lord the next day to come and dine with him, who promised him upon his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that he would.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Titan</hi> being in his greatest pompe, unto Sir <hi>Kenelmes</hi> lodging this Lord came, who had entertainement befitting his place, neither did Sir <hi>Kenelme</hi> seeme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the former daies discontent, but was very frolicke and merry, and in the midst of dinner time desired them all to be bare for he would beginne a health to the bravest King in the world; the French Lord asked whom that was, Sir <hi>Kenelme</hi> made answer that when it had gone about he should know; well, about it went, and then Sir <hi>Kenelme</hi> said that it was the health of the bravest King in the world, which is the King of England my roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb facs="tcp:94566:4"/>
Master, for although my body bee ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished from him, yet is my heart loyally linckt: the French Lord at those words see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to laugh, repeating the same words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, then was Sir <hi>Kenelme</hi> throughly moved in the behalfe of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne King <hi>Charles,</hi> whereupon he whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Lord in the eare, telling of him how that twice he had reviled the best King in the world in the hearing of mee which am his faithfull subject, wherefore for satisfaction, I require a single combate of you, where either you shall pay your life for your sawcinesse, or I will sacrifice mine in the behalfe of my King: The French Lord being of a resolute spirit, condescended to fight, the place was appointed, dinner being ended, they both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from table and privately went together, being in field, off they pluckt their doublets, and out they drew their weapons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mars</hi> would have bashfull beene to have seene himselfe by Noble <hi>Digby</hi> there excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, long worke with the contemptible French Lord, he would not make, for feare lest any should lye in ambush and so he might hazard his owne life, wherefore in foure bouts hee ranne his rapier into the French Lords brest till it came out of his throate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which so soone as he had done, away hee fled to the Court of France, and made all
<pb facs="tcp:94566:4"/>
knowne to the King thereof, who said the proudest Lord in France should not dare to revile his brother King.</p>
            <p>A guard was pesently chosen to conduct Sir <hi>Kenelme</hi> unto Flanders, which they did, where he tooke shipping for England, where he now is, where in peace and quietnesse may he still remaine.</p>
            <p>As for the French Lord hee was paid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his desert, and may all bee so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded which shall dare to revile the Lords anointed, who suffers by other Nations, for the clemency hee hath shewne to his owne Nation, <q>Sed beati sunt pacifici</q>, but blessed is the peace maker; good King for thy patience in this world there are Crownes of immortall glory laid in store for thee in the world to come, there shall not traitors dare to shew their faces, nor shall perplexity proceed from the great care of ruling of a Kingdome, in the meane while may more such Noble <hi>Digbies</hi> encrease, to rebuke all cursing <hi>Achitophels,</hi> and reviling <hi>Rabshakey's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let God arise and then shall the enemies of our gracious King bee sure to bee scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
