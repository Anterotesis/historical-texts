            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Have many thanks to give you for the Book you pleased to send me, called <hi>The Popish Royal Favorite;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your advice (which I value in a high degree) I put Pen to Paper, and somthing you may see I have don (though in a poor Pamphleting way) to clear my self of those aspersions that are cast upon me therin.

Adde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that besides this long pressure and languishment of twenty three Moneths close restraint (the sense wherof, I find hath much stupified my spirits) it pleased God to visit me lately with a dangerous fit of sicknes, a high burning Feaver, with the

new Disease, whereof my <hi>Body</hi> as well as my <hi>Mind,</hi> is yet somwhat crazy: So that (take all afflictions together) I may truly say, I have passed the <hi>Ordeal,</hi> the fiery Tryal. But it hath pleased God to reprieve me to see better days I hope; for out of this fatal black <hi>Cloud,</hi> which now oresets this poor <hi>Island,</hi> I hope ther will break a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sun-shine of peace and firm happines: To effect which, had I a <hi>Jury,</hi> a <hi>Grand-Jury</hi> of lives, I would sacrifice them all, and triumph in the oblation.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am a free-born <hi>Subject</hi> of the Realm of <hi>England;</hi> whereby I claim as my native Inheritance, an undoubted right, propriety, and portion in the Laws of the Land: And this distinguisheth me from a <hi>Slave.</hi> I claim also an interest and common right in the High National Court of <hi>Parlement,</hi> and in the Power, the Priviledges and Jurisdiction thereof, which I put in equal ballance with the <hi>Laws,</hi> in regard it is the <hi>Fountain whence they spring:</hi> And this I hold also to be a principal part of my Birth-right; which great Councel I honour, respect, value, and love in as high a degree as can be; as being the <hi>Bulwark of our Liberties, the main boundary and bank which keep us from slavery, from the inundations of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Rule, and unbounded Will-government.</hi> And I hold my self obliged in a tye of indispensable obedience to conform and submit my self to whatsoever shall be transacted, concluded, and constituted by its authority in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State;</hi> whether it be by making, enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, altering, diminishing, disanulling, repealing, or reviving of any Law, Statute, Act, or Ordinance whatsoever, either touching matters Ecclesiastical,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109114:4"/>
Civil, Common, Capital, Criminal, Martial, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritine, Municipal, or any other; of all, which, the transcendent and uncontrolable Jurisdiction of that Court is capable to take cognizance.</p>
               <p>Amongst the three things which the <hi>Athenian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thank'd the gods for, one was, That he was born a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and not a <hi>Barbarian.</hi> For such was the vanity of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and after them of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the flourish of their Monarchy, to arrogate all civility to themselves, and to term all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Barbarians:</hi> So I may say to have cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, that I was born a vassal to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> that I was born under so well moulded and tempered a Government, which endows the subject with such Liberties and Infranchisements that bear up his natural courage, and keep him still in heart; such Liberties that fence and secure him eternally from the gripes and tallons of <hi>Tyranny:</hi> And all this may be imputed to the Authority and Wisdom of this High Court of <hi>Parlement,</hi> wherin ther is such a rare co-ordination of power (though the Soverainty remain still entire, and untransferable in the person of the Prince) ther is, I say, such a wholsom mixture 'twixt <hi>Monarchy, Optimacy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy;</hi> 'twixt Prince, Peers, and Communalty, during the time of consultation, that of so many distinct parts, by a rare co-operation and unanimity, they make but one <hi>Body Politic,</hi> (like that Sheaf of Arrows in the Emblem) one entire concentrical peece; and the results of their deliberations, but as so many harmonious diapasons arising from different strings. And what greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity and happines can ther be to a peeple, then to be liable to no Laws but what they make themselves? To be subject to no Contribution, Assessement, or any pecuniary levy whatsoever, but what they Vote, and voluntarily yeeld unto themselves? For in this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109114:4"/>
compacted <hi>Politic Body,</hi> there be all degrees of peeple represented; both the Mechanick, Tradesman, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and Yeoman, have their inclusive Vote, as well as the Gentry, in the persons of their Trustees, their Knights and Burgesses, in passing of all things. Nor is this Soverain Surintendent Councel an Epitome of this Kingdom onely, but it may be said to have a representation of the whole Universe; as I heard a fluent well-worded <hi>Knight</hi> deliver the last <hi>Parlement,</hi> who compared the beautiful composure of that High Court, to the great Work of God, the World it self: The King to the Sun, the Nobles to the fixed Stars, the Itinerant Judges and other Officers (that go upon Messages 'twixt both Houses) to the Planets; the Clergy to the Element of fire; the Commons, to the solid <hi>Body</hi> of Earth, and the rest of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And to pursue this comparison a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as the heavenly Bodies, when three of them meet in <hi>Conjunction,</hi> do use to produce som admirable effects in the Elementary World: So when these <hi>three States</hi> convene and assemble in one solemn great <hi>Junto,</hi> som notable and extraordinary things are brought forth, tending to the welfare of the whole Kingdom, our <hi>Microcosm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE that is never so little versed in the Annales of this Isle, will find that it hath bin her fate to be four times <hi>conquered.</hi> I exclude the <hi>Scot;</hi> for the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of his Countrey, and the quality of the Clime hath bin such an advantage and security to him, that neither the <hi>Roman Eagles</hi> would flie thither, for fear of Freezing their Wings; nor any other Nation at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the work.</p>
               <p>These so many Conquests must needs bring with them many tumblings and tossings, many disturbances and changes in Government; yet I have observed,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109114:5"/>
that notwithstanding these tumblings, it retained still the form of a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and somthing there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes that had an Analogy with the great Assembly the <hi>Parlement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first Conquest I find was made by <hi>Claudius Caefar;</hi> at which time (as som well observe) the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Ensignes</hi> and the <hi>Standard of Christ</hi> came in toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is well known what Laws the <hi>Roman</hi> had; He had his <hi>Comitia,</hi> which bore a resemblance with our Convention in <hi>Parlement;</hi> the place of their meeting was called <hi>Praetorium,</hi> and the Laws which they enacted, <hi>Plebescita.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Saxon</hi> Conquest succeeded next, which were the <hi>English,</hi> ther being no name in <hi>Welsh</hi> or <hi>Irish</hi> for an <hi>Englishman,</hi> but <hi>Saxon,</hi> to this day. They governed by <hi>Parlement,</hi> though it were under other names; as <hi>Michel Sinoth, Michel Gemote,</hi> and <hi>Witenage Mote.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are Records above a thousand yeers old, of these <hi>Parlements,</hi> in the Raigns of King <hi>Ina, Offa, Ethelbert,</hi> and the rest of the seven Kings during the <hi>Heptarchy.</hi> The <hi>British</hi> Kings also, who retain'd a great while som part of the Isle unconquered, gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and made Laws by a kind of <hi>Parlementary</hi> way; witnes the famous Laws of Prince <hi>Howel,</hi> called <hi>Howel Dha,</hi> (the good Prince <hi>Howel)</hi> wherof ther are yet extant som Welsh Records. <hi>Parlements</hi> were also used after the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> by King <hi>Kenulphus, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phred,</hi> and others; witnes that renowned <hi>Parlement</hi> held at <hi>Grately</hi> by King <hi>Athelstan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Conquest was by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and they govern'd also by such general Assemblies, (as they do to this day) witnes that great and so much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated <hi>Parlement</hi> held by that mighty Monarch <hi>Canu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who was King of <hi>England, Denmark, Norway,</hi> and Mher Regions 150 yeers before the compiling of <hi>otagna Charta;</hi> and this the learned in the Laws do
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109114:5"/>
hold to be one of the special'st, and most authentic peeces of Antiquity we have extant. <hi>Edward</hi> the Consessor made all his Laws thus, (and he was a great <hi>Legis-lator)</hi> which the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquerour (who liking none of his sons, made God Almighty his heir, bequeathing unto him this Island for a Legacy) did ratifie and establish, and digested them into one entire methodical Systeme, which being violated by <hi>Rusus,</hi> (who came to such a disastrous end, as to be shot to death in lieu of a <hi>Buck</hi> for his sacriledges) were restor'd by <hi>Henry</hi> the first, and so they continued in force till King <hi>John,</hi> whose raign is renowned for first confirming <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the foundation of our Liberties ever since: Which may be compar'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Outlandish Graffs set upon one English stock, or to a Posie of sundry fragrant Flowers;</hi> for the choicest of the <hi>British,</hi> the <hi>Roman, Saxon, Danish,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Laws, being cull'd and pick'd out, and gathered as it were into one bundle, out of them the foresaid <hi>grand Charter</hi> was extracted: And the establishment of this great Charter was the work of a <hi>Parlement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor are the Laws of <hi>this Island</hi> onely, and the freedom of the Subject conserved by <hi>Parlement,</hi> but all the best policed Countreys of <hi>Europ</hi> have the like.

in full <hi>Parlement,</hi> because the Countrey was unpassable, the enemy having made such firm invasions up and down through the very bowels of the Kingdom; that power which formerly was inherent in the <hi>Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Assembly,</hi> of making Laws, of assessing the Subject with Taxes, subsidiary levies, and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, was transmitted to the <hi>King</hi> during the War; which continuing many yeers, that intrusted power by length of time grew as it were habitual in him, and could never after be re-assumed and taken from him; so that ever since, his <hi>Edicts</hi> countervail <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parlement.</hi> And that which made the busines more feasable for the <hi>King,</hi> was, that the burthen fell most upon the Communalty (the Clergy and Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity not feeling the weight of it) who were willing to see the <hi>Peasan</hi> pull'd down a little, because not many yeers before in that notable Rebellion, call'd <hi>La Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querie de Beauvoisin,</hi> which was suppressed by <hi>Charls the wise,</hi> the common peeple put themselves boldly in Arms against the Nobility and Gentry, to lessen their power. Add hereunto as an advantage to the work, that the next succeeding King <hi>Lewis the eleventh,</hi> was a close cunning Prince, and could well tell how to play his game, and draw water to his own Mill; For amongst all the rest, he was said to be the first that put the Kings of <hi>France, Hors de page,</hi> out of their mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or from being <hi>Pages</hi> any more, though thereby he brought the poor <hi>Peasans</hi> to be worse then <hi>Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quays.</hi>

               <p>With the fall, or at least the discontinuance of that usual <hi>Parliamentary Assembly</hi> of the <hi>three States,</hi> the liberty of the <hi>French</hi> Nation utterly fell; the poor <hi>Roturier</hi> and Vineyard-man, with the rest of the Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manry, being reduced ever since to such an abject <hi>

hath an advantage hereby one way, to <hi>monarchize</hi> more absolutely, and never to want money, but to <hi>ballast his Purse</hi> when he will: so ther is another mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience ariseth to him and his whole Kingdom another way; for this illegal peeling of the poor <hi>Peasan</hi> hath so dejected him, and cowed his native courage so much by the sense of poverty <hi>(which brings along with it a narrownes of soul)</hi> that he is little useful for the War: which puts the <hi>French</hi> King to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations mercenary to him, to fill up his <hi>Infantry:</hi> Insomuch, that the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> may be not unfitly compared to a body that hath all its blood drawn up into the Arms, Brest and Back, and scarce any left from the Girdle downwards, to cherish and bear up the lower parts, and keep them from star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
               <p>All this seriously considered, ther cannot be a more proper and pregnant example then this of our <hi>next Neighbours,</hi> to prove how infinitely necessary the <hi>Parlement</hi> is, to assert, to prop up, and preserve the Publike Liberty, and National Rights of a peeple, with the incolumity and welfare of a Countrey.</p>
               <p>Nor doth the <hi>Subject</hi> onely reap benefit thus by <hi>Parlement,</hi> but the <hi>Prince</hi> (if it be well consider'd) hath equal advantage thereby; It rendereth him a King of <hi>free</hi> and <hi>able</hi> men, which is far more glorious then to be a King of <hi>Slaves, Beggars,</hi> and <hi>Bankrupts;</hi> Men that by their freedom, and competency of wealth, are kept still in heart to do him service against any forrain force. And it is a true maxime in all States, that 'tis lesse danger and dishonour for the Prince to be poor, then his peeple: Rich Subjects can make their King rich when they please; if he gain their hearts, he will quickly get their purses: <hi>Parlement</hi> encreaseth love and good intelligence 'twixt him and his peeple; it acquaints him with the reality of things,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109114:7"/>
and with the true state and diseases of his Kingdom; it brings him to the knowledg of his better sort of Subjects, and of their abilities, which he may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy accordingly upon all occasions; it provides for his Royal Issve, payes his debts, finds means to fill his Coffers: And it is no ill observation. The <hi>Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary-moneys</hi> (the <hi>great Aid)</hi> have prospered best with the Kings of <hi>England;</hi> it exceedingly raiseth his repute abroad, and enableth him to keep his <hi>foes in fear, his Subjects in awe, his Neighbours and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in security,</hi> the three main things which go to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize a Prince, and render him glorious. In sum, it is the <hi>Parlement</hi> that supports, and bears up the honour of his Crown, and settles his Throne in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is the chief end of all their consultations: For whosoever is entrusted to be a Member of this High Court, carrieth with him a double capacity; he sits there as a <hi>Pairiot,</hi> and as a <hi>Subject:</hi> As he is the one, the Countrey is his object, his duty being to vindicate the Publike Liberty, to make wholsom Laws, to put his hand to the pump, and stop the leaks of the great vessel of the State: to pry into and punish corruption and oppression, to improve and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance trade, to have the grievances of the place he serves for redressed, and cast about how to find som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may tend to the advantage of it.</p>
               <p>But he must not forget that he sits there also as a <hi>Subject,</hi> and according to that capacity, he must apply himself to do his <hi>Soveraigns</hi> busines, to provide not onely for his <hi>publike,</hi> but his <hi>personal</hi> wants; to bear up the lustre and glory of his <hi>Court;</hi> to consider what occasions of extraordinary expences he may have, by encrease of Royal Issue, or maintenance of any of them abroad; to enable him to vindicate any affront or indignity that might be offered to his Person, Crown, or Dignity, by any <hi>forrain</hi> State or Kingdom;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109114:7"/>
to consult what may enlarge his <hi>honour, contentment</hi> and <hi>pleasure.</hi> And as the <hi>French Tacitus (Comines)</hi> hath it, the <hi>English</hi> Nation was used to be more forward and zealous in this particular then any other, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that ancient elequent speech of a great <hi>Lawyer, Domus Regis vigilia defendit omnium, otium illius labor omnium, deliciae illius industria omnium, vacatio illius oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupatio omnium, salus illius periculum omnium, honor illius objectum omnium.</hi> Every one should stand Centinel to defend the Kings Houses, his <hi>safety</hi> should be the <hi>danger</hi> of all, his <hi>pleasures</hi> the <hi>industry</hi> of all, his <hi>ease</hi> should be the <hi>labour</hi> of all, his <hi>honour</hi> the <hi>object</hi> of all.</p>
               <p>Out of these premisses this conclusion may be easily deduced, that, <hi>The principal Fountain whence the King derives his happines and safety, is his Parlement:</hi> It is that great Conduit-Pipe which conveighs unto him his peeples bounty and gratitude; the truest Looking-Glasse wherin he discerns their loves; now <hi>the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects love hath bin alwayes accounted the prime Cittadel of a Prince.</hi> In his <hi>Parlement</hi> he appears as the Sun in the Meridian, in the altitude of his glory, <hi>in his highest State Royal,</hi> as the Law tels us.</p>
               <p>Therfore whosoever is avers or disaffected to this Soveraign Law-making Court, cannot have his heart well planted within him: He can be neither good <hi>Subject,</hi> nor good <hi>Patriot;</hi> and therfore unworthy to breathe <hi>English</hi> air, or have any benefit, advantage, or protection from the Laws.</p>

               <p>BY that which hath been spoken, <hi>which is the language of my heart,</hi> I hope no indifferent judicious Reader will doubt of the cordial affection, of the high respects and due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I bear to <hi>Parlement,</hi> as being the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somest constitution (and don by the highest and happiest reach of policy) that ever was established in this <hi>Island,</hi> to perpetuate the happines therof: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I must tell that <hi>Gentleman</hi> who was Author of a Book entituled <hi>The Popish Royal Favorite,</hi> (lately Printed and exposed to the world) that he offers me very hard measure; nay, he doth me apparant wrong, to terme me therein <hi>No frend to Parlement, and a Malignant;</hi> A character, which as I <hi>deserve</hi> it not, so I <hi>disdain</hi> it.</p>
               <p>For the first part of his charge, I would have him know, that I am as much a <hi>frend, and as real an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate humble servant and votary</hi> to the <hi>Parlement,</hi> as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he can be, and will live and die with these affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about me: And I could wish, that he were Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of my thoughts a while; or if I may take the boldnes to apply that comparison His late Majestie used in a famous speech to one of his <hi>Parlements,</hi> I could wish there were a Crystal Window in my Brest, through which the world might espie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions and palpitations of my heart; then would he be certified of the sincerity of this Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For the second part of his charge, to be a <hi>Malignant,</hi> I must confesse to have som <hi>Malignity</hi> that lurks within
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109114:8"/>
me, much against my will; but it is no <hi>malignity</hi> of <hi>mind,</hi> it is amongst the <hi>humours,</hi> not in my <hi>intellectuals.</hi> And I beleeve, there is no natural man, let him have his <hi>humours</hi> never so well ballanced, but hath som of this <hi>malignity</hi> raigning within him; For as long as we are composed of the four <hi>Elements,</hi> whence these <hi>humours</hi> are derived, and with whom they symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize in qualities; which <hi>Elements</hi> the Philosophers hold to be in a restlesse contention amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (and the Stoick thought that the world subsisted by this innatemutual strife) as long, I say, as the four <hi>humours,</hi> in imitation of their principles (the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)</hi> are in perpetual reluctancy and combate for praedominancy, ther must be some <hi>malignity</hi> lodg'd within us, as adusted choler, and the like; wherof I had late experience in a dangerous fit of sicknes it pleased God to lay upon me, which the Physitians told me proceeded from the <hi>malignant</hi> hypocondria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal effects of <hi>melancholy;</hi> having been so long in this <hi>Saturnine</hi> black condition of close imprisonment, and buried a live between the Wals of this fatal <hi>Fleet.</hi> These kinds of <hi>malignities,</hi> I confesse are very rife in me, and they are not onely incident, but connatural to every man according to his complexion: And were it not for this incessant strugling and enmity amongst the <hi>humours</hi> for mastery, which produceth such <hi>malignant</hi> effects in us, our souls would be loth ever to depart from our bodies, or to abandon this mansion of clay.</p>
               <p>Now what <hi>malignity</hi> my <hi>Accuser</hi> means, I know not; if he means <hi>malignity</hi> of <hi>spirit,</hi> as som antipathy or ill impression upon the mind, arising from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection, hatred, or rancor, with a desire of som de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive revenge, he is mightily deceiv'd in me; I <hi>maligne</hi> or hate no Creature that ever God made, but the <hi>Devil,</hi> who is the Author of all <hi>malignity;</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109114:9"/>
therefore is most commonly called in French <hi>le Malin Asprit</hi> the <hi>malignant spirit.</hi> Every night before I go to bed, I have the grace, I thank God for it, to forgive all the world, and not to harbour, or let roost in my bosom the least <hi>malignant</hi> thought; yet none can deny, but the aspersions which this my <hi>Accuser</hi> casts upon me, were enough to make me a <hi>malignant</hi> towards him; yet it could never have the power to do it: For I have prevail'd with my self to forgive him this his wrong censure of me, issuing rather from his <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi> of me, then from <hi>malice;</hi> for we never min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled speech, or saw one another in our lives, to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance: which makes me wonder the more, that a Professor of the <hi>Law,</hi> as he is, should pronounce such a positive sentence against me so slightly. But me thinks I over-hear him say, That the precedent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Parlement</hi> is involv'd in generals, and the Tropique Axiome tels us, that <hi>Dolus versatur in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versalibus,</hi> there is double dealing in universals: His meaning is, that I am no friend to this present <hi>Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (though he speaks in the plural number <hi>Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)</hi> and consequently, he concludes me a <hi>Malignant;</hi> Therin, I must tell him also, that I am traduc'd, and I am confident it will be never prov'd against me, from any <hi>actions, words,</hi> or <hi>letters</hi> (though divers of mine have bin intercepted) or any other misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, though som things are father'd upon me which never drop'd from my Quill. Alas, how unworthy and uncapable am I to censure the proceedings of that great <hi>Senate,</hi> that high <hi>Synedrion,</hi> wherin the wisdom of the whole State is epitomized? It were a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption in me, of the highest nature that could be: It is enough for me to pray for the prosperous successe of their consultations: And as I hold it my <hi>duty,</hi> so I have good <hi>reason</hi> so to do, in regard I am to have my share in the happines; And could the utmost of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109114:9"/>
my poor endeavours, by any ministerial humble office (and somtimes the meanest <hi>Boat-swain</hi> may help to preserve the Ship from sinking) be so happy, as to contribute any thing to advance that great work (which I am in despair to do, while I am thus under <hi>hatches</hi> in this <hi>Fleet)</hi> I would esteem it the greatest honour that possibly could befal me, as I hold it now to be my greatest disaster, to have faln so heavily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an affliction of this nature, and to be made a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to <hi>publike fame,</hi> then which ther is no other proof, nor <hi>that</hi> yet urg'd against me, or any thing else produc'd after so long, so long captivity, which hath brought me to such a low ebbe, and put me so far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the course of my poor fortunes, and indeed more then half undon me. For although my whole life (since I was left to my self to <hi>swim,</hi> as they say, <hi>without bladders)</hi> has bin nothing else but a continued succession of crosses, and that there are but few red letters found (God wot) in the Almanack of my Age, (for which I account not my self a whit the less <hi>happy;)</hi> yet this crosse has carried with it a greater weight; it hath bin of a larger extent, longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and lighted heavier upon me then any other; and as I have <hi>present parience</hi> to bear it, so I hope for <hi>subsequent grace</hi> to make use of it accordingly, that my old Motto may be still confirmed, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>HE produceth my attestation for som passages in <hi>Spain,</hi> at His Majesties being there, and he quotes me right, which obligeth me to him: And I hope all his quotations, wherin he is so extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily copious and elaborate in all his works, are so; yet I must tell him, that those interchangeable Letters which passed between His Majesty and the <hi>Pope,</hi> which were originally couch'd in <hi>Latine,</hi> the language wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109114:10"/>
all Nations treat with <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Empire</hi> with all the Prinees therof; those Letters, I say, are adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated in many places, which I impute not to him, but to the <hi>French Chronicler,</hi> from whom he took them in trust. The truth of that busines is this: The world knows ther was a tedious treaty of an Alliance 'twixt the Infanta <hi>Dona Maria</hi> (who now is <hi>Empresse)</hi> and His Mijesty, which in regard of the slow affected pace of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> lasted about ten yeers, as that in <hi>Henry</hi> the sevenths time, 'twixt Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> and (afterwards) Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> was spun out above <hi>seven:</hi> To quicken, or rather to <hi>consummate</hi> the work, His Majesty made that adventurous journey through the whole Continent of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Spain;</hi> which voyage, though ther was a great deal of gallantry in it (whereof all posterity will ring, until it turn at last to a <hi>Romance)</hi> yet it prov'd the bane of the busines, which 'tis not the arrand of so poor a Pamphlet as this to unfold. His Majesty being ther arriv'd, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant common peeple cryed out, the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> came thither to make himself a <hi>Christian.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> writ to the <hi>Inquisitor General,</hi> and others, to use all industry they could to reduce him to the <hi>Roman</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; And one of <hi>Olivares</hi> first complements to him, was, <hi>That he doubted not but that. His Highnes came thither to change His Religion:</hi> Wherunto he made a short answer, <hi>That He came not thither for a Religion, but for a Wife.</hi> Ther were extraordinary processions made, and other artifices us'd by protraction of things to make him stay ther of purpose till the Spring fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, to work upon him the better: And the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi> her self desir'd him (which was esteem'd the greatest favour he received from her all the while) to visit the <hi>Nun of Carion;</hi> hoping that the said Nun, who was so much cryed up for miracles, might have wrought one upon him; but her art failed her, nor
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109114:10"/>
was His Highnesse so weak a subject to work upon, according to His late Majesties speech to Doctor <hi>Mawe</hi> and <hi>Wren,</hi> who when they came to kisse his hands, before they went to <hi>Spain</hi> to attend the Prince their Master, <hi>He wished them to have a care of Buckin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham; as touching his Son</hi> Charls, <hi>he apprehended no fear at all of him; for he knew him to be so well grounded a</hi> Protestant, <hi>that nothing could shake him in his Religion.</hi> The <hi>Arabian</hi> Proverb is, That the Sun never soiles in his passage, though his Beams reverberate never so strongly, and dwell never so long upon the Myry lake of <hi>Maeotis,</hi> the black Turf'd Moors of <hi>Holland,</hi> the Aguish Woose of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> or any other place, be it never so dirty. Though <hi>Spain</hi> be a hot Country, yet one may passe and repasse through the very Center of it, and never be Sun-burnt, if he carry with him a <hi>Bongrace,</hi> and such a one His Majesty had.</p>
               <p>Well, after His Majesties arrival to <hi>Madrid,</hi> the treaty of Marriage went on still, (though he told them at his first coming, that he came not thither like an <hi>Ambassadour,</hi> to treat of Marriage; but as a <hi>Prince,</hi> to fetch home a Wife;) and in regard they were of different Religions, it could not be done without a dispensation from the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> would grant none, unless som Capitulations were stipulated in favour of the Romish Catholikes in <hi>England,</hi> (the same in substance were agreed on with <hi>France.)</hi> Well, when the dispensation came, which was negotiated solely by the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Ministers; because His Majesty would have as little to do as might be with <hi>Rome,</hi> Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth, who died a little after, sent His Majesty a Letter, which was delivered by the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> wherof an answer was sent a while after: Which Letters were imprinted and exposed to the view of the world, because His Mijesty would not have peeple whisper, that the busines was carried in a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109114:11"/>
clandestine manner. And truely besides this, I do not know of any Letter, or Message, or Complement, that ever pass'd 'twixt His Majesty and the Pope, afore or after; som addresses peradventure might be made to the Cardinals, to whom the drawing of those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial dispatches was referred, to quicken the work; but this was onely by way of civil negotiation.</p>
               <p>Now touching that Responsory Letter from His Majesty, it was no other then a Complement in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest interpretation, and such formalities passe 'twixt the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and the great <hi>Turk,</hi> and divers Heathen Princes. The <hi>Pope</hi> writ first, and no man can deny, but by all moral rules, and in common humane civility. His Majesty was, bound to answer it, specially considering how punctual they are in those Countries to correspond in this kind, how exact they are in repairing visits, and the performance of such Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies: And had this compliance bin omitted, it might have made very ill impressions, as the posture of things stood then; for it had prejudiced the great work in hand, I mean, the <hi>Match,</hi> which was then in the heat and height of agitation: His Majesties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was there engag'd, and so it was no time to give the least offence. They that are never so little vers'd in busines abroad, do know that ther must be addresses, compliances, and formalities of this nature (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb, <hi>That one must somtimes light a candle to the Devil)</hi> us'd in the carriage of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State, as this great busines was, wheron the eyes of all Christendom were so greedily fix'd: A busines which was like to bring with it such an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall good, as the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the quenching of those hideous fires in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the establishing of a peace through all the Christian World.</p>
               <p>I hope none will take offence, that in this particular
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109114:11"/>
which comes within the compas of my knowledg, being upon the Stage when this Scene was acted, I do this right to the <hi>King</hi> my Master, in displaying the <hi>Truth,</hi> and putting her forth in her own colours, a rare thing in these dayes.</p>
               <p>TOuching the <hi>Vocal Forest,</hi> an Allegorical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, that goes abroad under my name, a good while before the beginning of this <hi>Parlement,</hi> which this <hi>Gentleman</hi> cites (and that very faithfully) I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand there be som that mutter at certain passages therin, by putting ill glosses upon the Text, and taking with the <hi>left</hi> hand what I offer with the <hi>right:</hi> (Nor is it a wonder for Trees which lie open, and stand exposed to all weathers, to be nipt) But I desire this favour, which in <hi>common</hi> justice, I am sure in the Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> cannot be denied me, it being the priviledg of evry Author, and a received maxime through the World, <hi>Cujus est condere, ejus est interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari;</hi> I say, I crave this favour, to have leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound my own Text, and I doubt not then but to rectifie any one in his opinion of me, and that in lieu of the <hi>Plums which I give him from those Trees, he will not throw the stones at me.</hi>

               <p>Moreover, I desire those that are over critical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers of that Peece, to know, that as in Divinity it is a rule, <hi>Scriptura parabolica non est argumentativa;</hi> so it is in all other kind of knowledg. <hi>Parables</hi> (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that Discourse is composed) <hi>though pressed never so hard, prove nothing.</hi> Ther is another <hi>Rule</hi> also, That <hi>Parables</hi> must be gently used, like a Nurses Brest; which if you presse too hard, you shall have <hi>blood</hi> in stead of <hi>milk.</hi>

So he makes this humble protest unto all the World, that though the designe of that Discourse was partly <hi>Satyrical</hi> (which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture induc'd the Author to shrowd it of purpose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shadows of <hi>Trees;</hi> and wher should Satyres be, but amongst Trees?) yet it never entred into his imagination to let fall from him the least thing that might give any offence to the High and Honourable Court of <hi>Parlement,</hi> wherof he had the honor to be once a Member, and hopes he may be thought worthy again: And were he guilty of such an offence, or <hi>piacle</hi> rather, he thinks he should never forgive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, though he were appointed his own Judge. If ther occur any passage therin, that may admit a hard construction, let the Reader observe, That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth not positively assert, or passe a judgment on any thing in that Discourse which consists principally of concise, cursory narrations of the choisest Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and Criticisms of State, according as the pulse of time did beat then: And matters of State, as all other sublunary things, are subject to alterations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies and change, which makes the opinions and minds of men vary accordingly; not one amongst twenty is the same man to day as he was four yeers ago, in point of judgment, which turns and alters according to the circumstance and successe of things: And it is a true saving, wherof we find common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, <hi>Posterior dies est prioris Magister.</hi> The day following is the former dayes Schoolmaster. Ther's another Aphorism, <hi>The wisdom of one day is soolishnes to another,</hi> and 'twill be so as long as ther is a man left in the World.</p>

I will conclude with this modest request to that <hi>Gentleman of the long Robe;</hi> That having unpassion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately perus'd what I have written in this small <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> in penning wherof my <hi>conscience</hi> guided my <hi>quill</hi> all along as well as my <hi>hand,</hi> he would please to be so charitable and just, as to revers that harsh sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon me, <hi>To be no Frend to Parlements, and a Malignant.</hi>
