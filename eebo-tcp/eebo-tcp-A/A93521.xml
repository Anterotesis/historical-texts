         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>Some Reaſons tenderly offered to the Serious Conſideration of the Commiſſioners, for Executing the Poll Act; why ſuch Perſons ſhould not be Rated</hi> 20 s. <hi>as Preachers, or Teachers, who do not receive any Profits, or Salaries for ſuch their Preaching or Teaching.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. BEcauſe in the beginning of the Act, It is ſaid, That all Perſons and Bodies Politick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> having Eſtates Perſonal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore it doth appear, the Parliament did not intend they ſhould pay that had no Income or Eſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Parliament hath thorough the whole Act ſeem'd to have a tender Care that none ſhould be rated to this Tax, but ſuch as by their own Eſtates, or by the Profits of their Places, were Enabled to pay; of the Reality of which, the Act it ſelf giveth ſeveral Inſtances; As for Example, in <hi>page</hi> 15. Every Man of the Degree of a Doctor, is rated 5 <hi>l.</hi> but in <hi>pag.</hi> 16. it is provided, That if any Doctor of Law or Divinity, hath not ſome Promotion, Benefice or Preferment, he ſhall not be rated for his Degree or Title. Again, in <hi>pag.</hi> 14. Every Gentleman is rated 20 s. but in the ſame page, it is Provided, That any Gentleman that hath not 300 <hi>l.</hi> Eſtate, ſhall not be ſo rated.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It being Enacted, That Every Clergy-man who has an Eccleſiaſtical Benefice worth 50 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> or more, at Improved Value, ſhould be Aſſeſſed 20 <hi>s.</hi> It appears not Coherent therewith, that any Preacher or Teacher in any Meeting-houſe, that hath no Beneſice, Salary, Gain, or Contribution for Preaching, ſhould be Aſſeſſed 20 <hi>s.</hi> or any Sum on that Account. And there are ſuch Preachers who have a Conſciencious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Chriſt's Command, and his Miniſters Example, to Preach the Goſpel freely, as they have freely received, and to keep the Goſpel without Charge, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 9. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 9. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. And therefore it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not Equal or Juſt, to Impoſe upon ſuch in that Caſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It being provided in the ſaid Act, that no Perſon by Vertue thereof, ſhall be doubly (or in two Capacities) charged; It reaſonably follows, That if any Perſon be legally charged as a Gentleman, he ought not to be alſo charged as a Preacher, or Teacher, more eſpecially, when he has no Profit or Gain for his Preaching.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And, whereas it is Alledged by ſome, That the Words, <hi>Every Preacher, or Teacher, in any Meeting-houſe whatſoever,</hi> doth not mention any other Qualification than <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Teaching</hi> to make them liable; We coneive thoſe Words, being but a part of the ſame Paragraph, where Benefices of 50 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, is required to make the Preachers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> liable.</p>
            <p>The ſame Reaſon runs along thorough the whole Paragraph, being Conjunctive, and takes hold of Preachers and Teachers in Meeting-houſes, who do reap by Contribution, or otherwiſe, 50 <hi>l.</hi> a Year; which very Words were expreſſed in the former Poll Act, and not of ſuch Preachers or Teachers, as receive nothing for the ſame: For it were againſt Reaſon and Equity, to ſtretch the Words of that Paragraph againſt the Tenor of the Act; for a Miniſter, who hath between 40 and 50 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> is excuſed by the Act, much more reaſon for a Miniſter, or Preacher that receiveth nothing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To Impoſe a Tax of 20 <hi>s.</hi> upon ſuch as Preach or Teach in Meeting-houſes freely, only for their Preaching or Teaching, appears Contradictory to the Liberty granted and confirm'd to them in the Act of the late Parliament, to Exempt them from Penalties on that Account.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Upon the ſerious and juſt Conſideration of the Reaſons propoſed, it is humbly hoped, that the Commiſſioners and Aſſeſſors, will not inſiſt upon, or extend the Letter of the Law, contrary to the Reaſon and Equity thereof, againſt poor Men, or Women, or others, meerly as Preachers or Teachers, who reap no Gain thereby; ſeeing that 'tis a Rule and Maxim well known, That Equity and Juſtice ought to be had regard to, in the Adminiſtration of all Laws, and in many Caſes, to be preferred to the Words or Letter of the Law, as appears in that Ancient and Approved Treatiſe of <hi>Doctor</hi> and <hi>Student,</hi> Chap. 16. Treating of Equity, <hi>pag.</hi> 27, 28. Where its ſaid, <hi>To follow the Words of the Law, were in ſome Caſes against Juſtice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore in ſome Caſes,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>It is neceſſary to leave the Words of the Law, and to follow what Reaſon and Juſtice requireth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
