         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Humbly Confeſs, It is a great Preſumption in Me, to Offer any thing to a Perſon of ſo Great Majeſty and Judgment; but the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance I have of Your excellent Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb facs="tcp:97870:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to favour the Meanest Thing from a good Intention (beſides the Greatneſs of Your <hi>Charity</hi> towards many of my <hi>Relations)</hi> gives me this Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I am confident of Your <hi>Highneſſes</hi> readineſs to promote the Peace of All People; which makes me conclude, That whatever is tending thereunto, will be graciouſly Accepted.</p>
            <p>One of Your Deceaſed Servants hath often told me of Your <hi>Highneſſes</hi> Zeal to God, and to Your Country; which nothing here below can ſufficiently Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite; therefore I doubt not, but the Almighty will give You the Fruits of Peace, which can only anſwer ſo much Piety and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible, but there must be Diverſity of Opinions ſo long as the World endures; Mens Diſpoſitions being
<pb facs="tcp:97870:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
generally as various as their Tempers and Complexions; but methinks this ſhould not cauſe Difference in Affection, which is the only thing that gives Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to our needleſs Quarrels and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Scruples: To prevent which, it muſt be the Work of <hi>Heaven</hi> only.</p>
            <p>And ſo far as it may be lawful for me to Judge. I think there can be No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more proper than to conſider, how agreeable the Conſtitution of Our Church is to the Commands of GOD; which all must of Neceſſity comply with, if they would but lay aſide all Paſſion and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, which hath all along given Birth and Growth to our Diviſions. And it is ſad to think, That our Gall-leſs Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould by this means he Entituled to ſo much War and Bloodſhed.</p>
            <p>It is a Bleſſed Thing to be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Peace, and the leaſt Hopes of
<pb facs="tcp:97870:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
promoting it is very pleaſing to the Minds of all Good Men; and I am ſure Your <hi>Highneſs</hi> will to the uttermost Encourage it, having always the Fruits of it in Your own Breaſt.</p>

            <head>A SHORT VINDICATION OF THE <hi>Church of England.</hi>
ENDEAVOURING To Prevent all Future Quarrels and Diſcontents.</head>
            <p>GOD Almighty (thô Man by his <hi>Diſobedience</hi> had pull'd off the Seal of the Indenture which he had made with him) was pleaſed to renew his Covenant for the Salvation of loſt Mankind: He was pleaſed alſo to give forth a Commiſſion to certain Elected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to proclaim unto him the grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Divine Love, and his Gracious Goodneſs; namely, What it is he hath
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97870:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
done for them, in and by his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and withal to aſſure Mankind, (that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Seed of <hi>Adam)</hi> that the Merits of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Blood are ſufficient, thrô Grace, to effect their Reconciliation with their offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God: And that they believing the Power of his Reſurrection, and committing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, by ſubmitting to the Motions of his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and by Faith, placing their Affiance upon his gracious <hi>Promiſes,</hi> may obtain an Eternal Inheritance among the Bleſſed, thrô the merciful Mediation and Merits of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince theſe Holy Men (whom God had thus Commiſſioned) are fallen aſleep, the vigilant and watchful Enemy of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>Satan,</hi> hath prevailed by his ſly and deceitful Subtilties, not only to bring in a Counter-Doctrine, and to commit High-Treaſon againſt the Royalty, Love, Goodneſs and Sovereignty of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> by alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, changing, and contradicting his Goſpel-Proclamation, to the great obſcuring and diſhonoring of his Name, and grand Prejudice of the Sons of Men; but alſo hath employed many to pretend unto their Brethren, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97870:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they have a more Seraphical Underſtanding, and a greater inſight into the Word of God, than the Apoſtolical Doctrine holds forth, making the World believe, that Religion is nothing elſe but a Politick Engine; and the Precepts of the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to be nothing elſe but Human Arts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> not Men inſpir'd by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but States-Men employ'd to make theſe Conſtitutions to take effect in the World.</p>
            <p>But not only this did the Satanical Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties of the <hi>Devil</hi> effect, but alſo he induc'd many to neglect the Fundamental Principles of Religion; to ſpend their whole time about Diſcipline, Ceremonies, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Points: And in this their fierce and eager purſuit, the Spirit of Error not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be content with thoſe Rules, and that clear Light, which ſo brightly ſhines, and is ſo eminently refulgent in the Word of God; They are led by their own fooliſh Fancies, daily creating in them diverſity of new Opinions; and ſo falling into Sects and Schiſms, and by their Diviſions and Mental Reſervations, they preſerve not the Unity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97870:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> but, like ſo many diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Members ſeparating themſelves from their Body, they become monſtrous in the Profeſſion of their Religion, breaking the bond of <hi>Peaceable Love,</hi> and falling off from the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> as if it were no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of their <hi>Creed;</hi> and being in love with their Inventions and New Opinions, they contend for them as <hi>Fundamental Tenets:</hi> And not only ſo, But malign and uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably Aſperſe thoſe that diſſent from them therein, tho never ſo Conſcientious and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, as if they Profeſſed not the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> yea, ſerved not the ſame <hi>GOD,</hi> nor believed in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus by their diſſatisfy'd Curioſities, by their groundleſs and pragmatical Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about Religion, they pretend (without Legal Authority or Approved Reaſons) to induce a Reformation into our Church.

and Actions of thoſe who are the Ruling part thereof, and the only lawful Magiſtrates, do Cavil oftentimes about the leaſt neceſſary Points of Religion and Divine Worſhip; and forget to Honour God for the glorious Nativity and Incarnation of his Son; for the Merits of his Death, and the Power and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his Reſurrection, whereby they are brought (by a lively <hi>Hope)</hi> to be juſtified by the Righteouſneſs and perfect Obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Court of Heaven, and are at laſt Capacitated thrô the Merits of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Mediation, to be reconcil'd to God, and conſequently to obtain Everlaſting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>They forget to praiſe God, for the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Offices of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, For ſending him to be our <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Mediator;</hi> that by the Sacrifice of his Blood, and by the only Merit and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the ſame our <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> Divine Juſtice might be ſatisfy'd, and Man (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Tranſgreſſions and Contra-Walkings to his Divine Ordinances) might be preſented at Peace before God; he accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Righteouſneſs of his Son, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97870:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſabling his own Juſtice from making any further Demands.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For ſending his Son to be our <hi>Prophet,</hi> to Inſtruct his Church, by revealing unto it the Way and Means of Salvation; in communicating unto the Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that Grace and Redemption which he hath purchaſed for them from his Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17. in declaring the whole Will of his Heavenly Father unto them. Whence we may learn, That it is a groſs and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Error in Men, to think that our Saviour Chriſt hath not delivered all things pertaining to the neceſſary Inſtruction and Government of the Church, but left them to the Traditions and Intentions of Men: And that we may reſt abundantly ſatisfy'd with that Doctrine which he hath commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto us, let us leave off all <hi>Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Diſputings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then again; As in the time of Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Diſputing we omit the Honour of God, ſo alſo we neglect our indiſpenſable Duties: We make no progreſs nor profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in our Duty; God's Services are left undone, his Will unfulfill'd, his Ordinances
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97870:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
neglected, the Conditions and Promiſes of his Covenant not thought upon; but his Mercies are ſlighted, his Grace is rejected, his Goodneſs undervalu'd, and his Name ſo often in our Diſputes talkt of, that his Nature is almoſt quite forgotten.</p>
            <p>Thus whilſt we are Diſputing; whilſt we are in our Angelical Raptures, as we think them; whilſt only in our own vain and fooliſh Conceits we are carry'd like <hi>Elijah</hi> in a <hi>Fiery Chariot</hi> (in our hot Diſputings) even unto <hi>Heaven;</hi> we rather keep our ſelves diſtant from the Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and deprive our ſelves of that Mercy and Salvation, which by an humble Submiſſion, thrô Faith unto God, we might have obtain'd.</p>
            <p>Thus by our Diſputings and Cavillings about Religion, about the Way to our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> we at leaſt make no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and (I am afraid) too often miſs of our intended Journey. Which brings me to my</p>
            <p>Third Reaſon, which is, That we ſhould do things without Diſputing, becauſe no Moral Evils, relating to Eccleſiaſtical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97870:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are ſecret or unknown, among all things that concern the Intereſt, or are ſerviceable to the Cauſe of Religion, and the Service and Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>There's nothing that makes a greater Bluſtering and Hurly-burly, or gives a greater Affront to the unpeaceable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and unreaſonable Temper of thoſe who are devoid of the Spirit of Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Allegiance, than Ceremonies and Cenſures of the Church, which (how allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and conformable to right Reaſon) is eaſily prov'd and reconcil'd from the ſeveral Uſes and Ends, for which they were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and ordain'd; And,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Concerning the Ceremonies of the Church.</p>
            <p>Now that the Ceremonies of the Church are things in themſelves meerly Indifferent, and ſo no direct part of Worſhip, is a Truth acknowledg'd and declar'd, ſince that they are only Eccleſiaſtical and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Conſtitutions. And the Doctrine of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and of the <hi>Homilies</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Eccleſiaſtical Ceremonies) expreſly declareth, That they are for a godly Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97870:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Order, which may be chang'd and alter'd, and therefore are not to be accounted equal with God's Law, which is altogether unalterable.</p>
            <p>And again, our Articles aſſert, That our Church hath Authority to change and aboliſh Ceremonies ordain'd by Human Authority, that all things thereby may tend to Edification: All which ſhews, that there is no Holineſs plac'd in them, and that they are in themſelves no direct part of Divine Worſhip. Yet the obſervation of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Ceremonies, thô things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves meerly indifferent, and left only to the Determination and Appointment of the Church, ſo far as they make for Order and Decency, may render our Services more acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>Thus in our Religious Adorations, all comly and reverend Geſtures, as Kneeling, Standing, Lifting up our Hands and Eyes, Silence in the Service of God, and ſuch like Decent Rites, which are not determined particularly as neceſſary Duties; yet, as they include a Reverence of God and his Ordinances, as they are an obedient Reſpect
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97870:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to that Command, That <hi>all things be done in Decency and Order:</hi> Laſtly, As they include a ſubjection to the only Lawful Magiſtrate, and a deſire of the Churches Peace, are things which may be highly ſerviceable to the Cauſe of GOD's Glory, and the Honour of his Religion: Whence we may obſerve, That all irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and unbeſeeming Geſtures; all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Ceremonies and Rites of Religion, repugnant to the Word of God, or not warrantable by the general grounds thereof; ſuch as are not for Order, Decency, or Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in general; that all Will-worſhip, whereby we make any thing a part of God's Service, which is not commanded by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or has Epiſcopal Authority in it, thô it has never ſo great a ſhew of Godlineſs in it, yet in that it leaneth to Man's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is altogether forbidden and unlawful, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thô theſe External Rites and Ceremonies be never ſo good and innocent in their own Nature (as being neither owned as our neceſſary Duties, or uſed as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> uſe them, namely, as operative Means
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97870:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to convey Grace to our Souls in and by themſelves alone;) yet the admitting or introducing too many, would be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Cauſe of Chriſtian Religion; as by cauſing us rather to attend thoſe Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Rites, than to mind our Spiritual Duties; and by carrying our Affections from that inward and Spiritual Worſhip and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which alone God is glorified, and our Souls Eternally ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That no Power is to be admitted in the Church, to preſcribe any other Forms of Worſhip repugnant to God's Word, or contrary to good Order and Decency.</p>
            <p>Since therefore theſe Eccleſiaſtical Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, thô things in themſelves altogether Indifferent, yet (as for matter of uſe) are allowable, in that they make for Decency, Order, and Edification; and in that thereby the Mind is better holden in the thing affected, and better holpen and furniſh'd in Inward Worſhip, when the Mind and Body are both joyn'd together in the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. Exerciſe and Adoration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:97870:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If then, I ſay, to uſe them be a thing not contrary to right Reaſon, and thereby we do no Diſ-ſervice to the Cauſe of Religion or Divine Service; then conſequently to uſe and obſerve them is a thing morally good. Which being granted, it neceſſarily follows, That not to ſubmit to the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Church; not to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with the Members thereof, by a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to him who is the only lawful and Supreme Magiſtrate; not to conform to Epiſcopal Conſtitutions, or (if neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth) to Actions of General Synods or Counſels, which make or tend to Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, Order, and Edification, conſequently is a thing Morally Evil, and does as naturally appear to be Evil, as the contrary appears to be good: For, if <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> be Moral Vertues, it neceſſarily follows from the Suggeſtions of Natural Reaſon, that the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Nonconformity</hi> are Moral Vices. Therefore avoid Cavillings, for there needs no Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſince that no Moral Evils (relating to Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions) are ſecret or unknown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:97870:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But I ſhall now paſs from the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church to the Cenſures thereof.</p>
            <p>That Cenſures (as they are Judgments of the Church for ratification of the Threats of the Goſpel againſt the Abuſes thereof) are indiſpenſably neceſſary, and therefore good and convenient, as doth moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Their uſe is this, That as Magiſtrates (by the Laws of the Commonwealth) do exerciſe their Juſtice, by inflicting and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing Puniſhments to the Offenders, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the Crime: So the Spiritual Cenſures are are neceſſary to the Church, both to help the Godly, and reſtrain and extirminate out of it the Profane and Irreligious Party, as the Penal Laws of the Magiſtrate in the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>But then their neceſſity does farther appear, ſince in the Church of God there are of all ſorts, both Holy and Unholy, Obedient and Diſobedient, it is impoſſible (without Correction) to preſerve good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therein; eſpecially to reſtrain the Sons
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97870:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Diſobedience from Offending or Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derng their Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>From whence we may learn, That they who upon this Pretence, <hi>viz.</hi> That God forceth no man to come unto him, to ſerve or Worſhip him; therefore if they will retain Communion with the Members of the Church; If they will ſubmit to the Conſtitutions and Determinations of it; If they will Aſſemble and Meet together, to invoke and call upon God's Name, to condole and publickly confeſs their Sins and Infirmities with them, to ask and beg Forgiveneſs at the hands of God; or, in a word, to ſerve and worſhip God, or do any Religious Act, they may, if they pleaſe or will; but ſo to do, they are not oblig'd, forc'd, or compell'd.</p>
            <p>I ſay, That they who upon this Pretence contemn, and think the Cenſures of the Church uſeleſs and unprofitable, or things not warrantable from God's Word; but only Acts and Conſtitutions of Men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ambitious of exerciſing Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and therefore by them they are no whit debarr'd, (thô nevertheleſs, whom
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97870:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Church ſeparateth from the Outward Seals, they are alſo depriv'd of the Inward Graces;) I ſay, That theſe Men are ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unreaſonable, like them in the <hi>20th</hi> of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that refuſe to bear the <hi>Yoke</hi> of Government, and to have a <hi>Sword</hi> in the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>But furthermore, There are many among us, who affecting or aſpiring to the Celeſtial Supremacy, always endeavour either to induce a Reformation into Our Church, or elſe to inſtitute a new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and this they would fain do, by pretending, that they (and none elſe) are the true Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> ſufficiently wiſe to be their own Prieſts, to Teach and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter themſelves; fitter to Inſtruct, than to Learn; to Teach, than be Taught; to Govern, than to be Governed; and thus they go merrily on in their fooliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits; and being poſſeſs'd with the Spirit of Diſquiet, they ſeek to gratifie their Envy, by procuring and cauſing the Juriſdiction of the Clergy to be Voted and Cried<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down, and the power of the truly lawful
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97870:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Miniſters of God to be Reviled, that they themſelves might be exempted from Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Obedience, and ſo become Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>And this they do by Courting the People, and pleading the Cauſe of a Godly Party; and telling them, that their Prieſts take too much upon them, in ſtudying for fooliſh and uſeleſs Ceremonies, ſtrange and unneceſſary Cenſures for them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are all Holy, yea, very Holy every one of them. And who do you think theſe Men are? Why, theſe are they who are only Zealous and Devout, the ſeeming Godly Party: And yet a People ſo ſilly, that when they come to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, they are ſure to be ſufficiently Baffled, and to have themſelves and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſufficiently expos'd to Contempt; and upon all manner of Attacks, either wounded with a ſecret Diſlike of their own Religion; or elſe oblige themſelves to a ſtupid and bruitiſh Wilfulneſs and Obſtinacy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:97870:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
'Tis from hence we hear of ſo many, ſo often, and ſo eaſily ſeduc'd; and that is the time, <hi>viz.</hi> when Men fall off from the Rational Way, and ſink into Blind and Ignorant Devotion; from whence we may date moſt of our great Ills of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and privy Conſpiracy. In a word; From whence even all thoſe Devout Fooleries, which ſo much incumber'd the World, had their firſt Riſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſince that Eccleſiaſtical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures (as appears from what hath been ſaid) are warrantable, and alſo of indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Neceſſity, for the Good and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be diſpens'd and born <hi>without Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and Diſputings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Do things without <hi>Diſputing, Becauſe the Tradition of the Scriptures is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and therefore the Truth of them is ſo too;</hi> wherefore there needs no Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Contention about their Doctrine, or the Truth of their Information. There are many Men in the World, who by their Prophane Diſcourſe, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97870:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
call Wit, would fain Hector all Religion out of the World, by deriding all Attempts which tend to its Rational Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>And this they do by making the World believe, That Religion is nothing but the Fear of ſome inviſible Power, feigned in the Minds of ſome fearful Fooliſhly devout Men; and that the <hi>Bible</hi> is of no force as a Law Divine, but only there where it is made to be ſo by Laws Civil and Political. But that the Authority of the <hi>Scripture</hi> is altogether Divine and Infallible, and the Matter therein the immediate Inſpiration of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> I ſhall (to take away all Cavilling and Diſputing) ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and demonſtrate by theſe following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Now the Authority of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> muſt either depend upon the Authority of the Church, or elſe God muſt be the Author of them; but the Authority of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> can no way depend upon the Authority of the <hi>Church;</hi> becauſe to believe the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is a work of Faith, but the <hi>Church</hi> cann't infuſe Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:97870:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Again, Any Authority which the <hi>Church</hi> hath, muſt be proved by the <hi>Scripture;</hi> therefore the <hi>Scriptures</hi> depend not upon the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that God is the Author of them, and that the Truth of them is unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and infallible, we may eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd from theſe Reaſons:</p>
            <p>Firſt, From the Doctrine of them; The Myſtery of the Incarnation of the <hi>Son of GOD,</hi> his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, after his Death and Paſſion; the Union of his Divine and Human Nature into one <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel;</hi> Three Perſons and Subſiſtences in One <hi>GOD,</hi> and <hi>GOD</hi> to become <hi>Man,</hi> are things that the finite Capacity of Man cann't reach, being far beyond the narrow Sphere of his Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From the Matter about which they Treat; They promiſe Eternal Life to the Faithful and Obedient, and Eternal Woe to the Diſobedient; They preſcribe Laws for the Thoughts, which none but God can pierce; They require <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but prefer <hi>Obedience;</hi> They enjoyn <hi>Faſting,</hi> but 'tis from Sin; They forbid <hi>Luſting,</hi> and <hi>Coveting;</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:97870:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which Exactions and Prohibitions are not to be found in Human Laws, but only in his who ſearches the Heart, <hi>GOD Almighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, From the continuation of the Wonderful Prophecies, foretelling things to come (ſo long Marked out before) with their Circumſtances; not doubtful (like the Oracles of the Heathen,) but ſuch as had in all their Times certain Performances; and therefore unto what may we attribute them, but the Inſpiration of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt?</hi> Thus was the <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed to <hi>Adam</hi> Four Thouſand years before he was born. Thus was the Rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Calling of the <hi>Gentils,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> foretold; all things coming to paſs aright, without any failing or miſtake; the fulfilling of which Promiſes cann't be aſcribed to any, but the Infinite <hi>GOD,</hi> who graſps all Seaſons and Times, and with the ſame infinite Eye, beholds all things preſent, paſt, and to come.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, From the quality and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pen-men and Writers of them; ſome of whom were never train'd up in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97870:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Schools of Men; and yet in their Writings ſhew that depth of Wiſdom, which the moſt Learned Philoſophers could never attain unto: And then the Matter of the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> being altogether of the Heavenly Doctrine, and ſavouring nothing of Worldly and Earthly Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but every where condemning the ſame, declaring the <hi>GOD</hi> of Heaven to be the Inſpirer thereof.</p>
            <p>Whence alſo farther (to avoid all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Queſtioning and Doubting, or rather of Cavilling and Diſputing) we may learn by the way, That ſince the <hi>Scriptures</hi> do receive indiſpenſably their Authority, not from the <hi>Church,</hi> but from the only perfect and True <hi>GOD,</hi> that thereupon being themſelves holy, perfect, and true, as he is, are alſo ſufficient for the knowledge of Chriſtian Religion; that they do moſt plentifully contain all Doctrines neceſſary to Salvation: Whence it followeth, we need no unwritten Verities; no Traditions, no Inventions of Men, no Canons of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, no Sentences of Fathers; much leſs the Decrees of <hi>Popes,</hi> to ſupply any ſuppoſed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97870:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
defects therein, or to give us more perfect Directions in the Worſhip of <hi>GOD,</hi> or in the Way of Life, than are expreſs'd in <hi>Canonical Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may alſo learn from hence, That the Authority of the <hi>Scripture</hi> being Infallible, the Rule thereof is indiſpenſably true and ſufficient to make us wiſe unto Salvation; and conſequently, that there is to be learned out of it a Rule both of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> for our Inſtruction, by the ordinary Means of Reading and Praying, to which <hi>GOD</hi> promiſes the aſſiſtance of his Grace, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>If any of you lack Wiſdom, let him ask it of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given him;</hi> for the <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> which is the <hi>Word of GOD</hi> is given unto us by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> both to defend our Faith, and overcome all our Spiritual Adverſaries, <hi>viz.</hi> together with all <hi>falſe Prophets, Hereticks, Schiſmaticks,</hi> and ſuch like, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 17. Therefore the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the immediate Inſpiration of the Spirit of Truth, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> are not to be canvas'd up and down, or any way (as we pleaſe) alter'd; their nature being as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97870:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unchangeable as their Author; therefore leave off reaſoning, and <hi>do all things without Diſputing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Fifthly</hi> and Laſtly, <hi>Avoid all Strife out of the Example of our Saviour Chriſt.</hi> Our Saviour had the Spirit of Godly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in him; His Carriage was always Civil and Urban, Humble and Candid, Quiet and Peaceable toward his Church; he was ſo far from the Spirit of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity and Contention, of Moroſity and Diſobedience, that he rather condeſcended unto and comply'd with any National Terms, than ſought to work Diſturbance and Faction, Separation and Diviſion among his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us ſtand to the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of Wiſer Men than our Selves; Let us ſtand to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and Actions of our <hi>Biſhops,</hi> the only Lawful Magiſtrates; Let us ſtill retain Communion with the Church, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof; that by Peaceable Living, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Converſation, the Honour of <hi>GOD</hi>'s Name, the Cauſe of his Religion,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97870:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Intereſt of his Service and Worſhip may be promoted and advanced.</p>
            <p>In a word, Let us joyn with the Apoſtle, and <hi>do all things without Murmurings and Diſputings, that we may be blameleſs and pure, the Sons of God without rebuke, in the midſt of a naughty and crooked Generation; that at laſt we may enjoy the Fruits of Peace and Obedience,</hi> viz. <hi>Eternal Life and Glory; thrô the Merits and Mediation of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Amen.</p>
