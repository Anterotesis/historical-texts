         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7284:6"/>
out of the ſucceſſe of theſe two: which wee
will now examine apart with all equitye and
cleereneſſe, and waigh, whither there bee any
ſuch reaſon, to deſiſt from the proſecution
thereof, in rectified iudgement; or to fall ſo
lowe in our reſolutions, and opinions of it, as
rumor and ignorance doth pretend wee doe,
or haue cauſe to doe.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Diſcouerie,</hi> Captaine <hi>Argoll</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
our Commiſſion vnder our Seale, with
inſtruction (to auoide all danger of quarrell
with the Subiects of the King of <hi>Spaine)</hi> not
to touch vpon any of his Dominions actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
poſſeſſed, or rightly entituled vnto, and
to ſhape his courſe free from the roade of
Pyrotts, that hang vpon all ſtreights and
skirts of lands; and to attempt a direct and
cleare paſſage, by leauing the Canaries to
the Eaſt, and from thence, to runne in a
ſtreight Weſterne Courſe, or ſome point
neere there-vnto. And ſo to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the Windes and Currents
which haue affrighted all vnder-takers by the
North. By which diſcouery, there would
growe to vs much ſecuritie, and eaſe,
and all occaſion of offence remooued, and
wee ſhould husband and ſaue a moyetie of
the charge in victuall and freight, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7284:6"/>
was expended, and loſt in the South erne
paſſage.</p>
            <p>To theſe endes hee ſett ſayle from Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth
the fift day of <hi>May;</hi> and ſhaping his
courſe South-ſouth-weſt to the height of
thirty degrees, leauing the Canaries a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
leagues to the Eaſt, hee found the
windes large, and ſo tooke his courſe direct
Weſt, &amp; did neuer turne nearer the South: &amp;
beeing in the longitude of the Barmudos hee
found the winde a little ſcant vppon him, yet
ſo, that on the thirteenth of <hi>Iuly</hi> he recouered
our harbor: and in tryall found no currant,
nor any thing elſe which ſhould deter vs from
this way.</p>
            <p>Hee made his iourney in nine weekes, and
of that, was becalmed fourteene dayes: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
hee hath diuers times ſince his returne
publikely auowed, and vndertaken to make
this paſſage within ſeauen weekes: and that
the windes in all this courſe, are as variable, as
at other places, and no apparant inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
in the way.</p>
            <p>So that the maine <hi>end</hi> of this aduiſe hath
ſucceeded almoſt beyond our hopes; The
<hi>ſecond</hi> for fiſhing, proued ſo plentifull, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of Sturgion,<note place="margin">He that went for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe dyed in the way.</note> of which ſort hee could haue
loaded many ſhips, if he had had, ſome man of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7284:7"/>
ſkill to pickell and prepare it for keeping,
whereof he brought ſufficient teſtimony both
of the fleſh and Caueary, that no diſcreet man
will queſtion the truth of it, ſo it appeares
cleerely that from hence there can bee deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
no cauſe to ſuſſpect or deſiſt from our
firſt endes, but ſo contrary, that in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
both our <hi>purpoſes</hi> and <hi>waies</hi> were happy
and ſucceſſefull euen to our deſires. But from
this Ship ariſeth a rumor of the neceſſity and
diſtreſſe our people were found in, for
want of victuall: of which, though the noiſe
haue exceeded the truth, yet we doe confeſſe
a great part of it; But can lay aſide the cauſe
and fault from the deſſigne, truely and home
vpon the miſgouernment of the Comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders,
by diſſention and ambition among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and vpon the Idleneſſe and beſtiall
ſlouth, of the common ſort, who were actiue
in nothing but adhearing to factions and
parts, euen to their owne ruine, like men
almoſt deſperate of all ſupply, ſo conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and guilty they were to them-ſelues
of their owne demerit, and laſineſſe. But
ſo ſoone as Captaine <hi>Argoll</hi> arriued among
them, whoſe preſence and example gaue
new aſſurance of our cares, and new life to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7284:7"/>
their indeauours, by fiſhing onely in few
daies, they were all recouered, growne
hearty, able, and ready to vndertake euery ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
So that if it bee conſidered that without
induſtry no land is ſufficient to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants:
and that the trade to which they truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
betrayed them to looſe the opportunity
of ſeed-time, and ſo to ruſt and weare out
them-ſelues: for the Naturals withdrew from
all commerce and trafficke with them, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
making a war vpon them, which they
felt not, who durſt no other-way appeare an
enemye: And they beeing at diuiſion among
themſelues, and without warrant from hence,
could not reſolue to inforce that, which might
haue preſerued them, and which in ſuch a
neceſſity is moſt lawfull to doe, euery thing
returning from ciuill Propryety to Naturall,
and Primary Community: Laſtly if it bee
remembred, that this Extremitie in which
they were now relieued, (which is as happy
in the preſage of Gods future bleſſing as in his
preſent prouidence and mercy) was but an
effect of that, we did fore-ſee in the firſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
and for which the forme was
chaunged, and the new in proiect, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot bee obiected as any iuſt excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the ſucceſſe of this, but a conſequent
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7284:8"/>
Conſidered, and digeſted in the former: It
is then I ſay <hi>euident,</hi> that in al the progreſſe of
this <hi>diſcouery,</hi> or any <hi>thing accidentall to it,</hi>
there cannot bee rack'd nor preſſed out any
confeſſion, either of error in the <hi>ends,</hi> or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriadges
in the <hi>waies</hi> vnto them.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> of a <hi>gouernment,</hi> ſuch
as ſhould meete with all the reuealed incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences;
wee gaue our Commiſſion to an
able &amp; worthy Gentleman, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi>
whome we did nominat and appoint <hi>ſole</hi> and
<hi>abſolute Gouernor</hi> of that Colony, vnder diuers
limitations, &amp; inſtructions expreſſed in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
and with him wee ſent Sir <hi>George Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
Admirall, and Captaine <hi>Newport</hi> Vice-Admirall
of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and diuers other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of rancke and quality, in ſeauen <hi>ſhippes,</hi>
and two <hi>pinnaces,</hi> with ſeuerall Commiſſions
ſealed, ſucceſſiuely to take place one after
another, conſidering the mortality, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of humaine life, and theſe to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
into ſeuerall ſhips.</p>
            <p>Our fleete weighed anchor from <hi>Falmouth</hi>
the eight of <hi>Iune,</hi> the winde beeing fayre, they
ſhaped a courſe for the <hi>height</hi> of the <hi>Canaries;</hi>
within few dayes ſayle, the <hi>Gouernor</hi> calling a
<hi>Councel</hi> of al the <hi>Captaines, Maiſters</hi> and <hi>Pilots,</hi>
it was reſolued, they ſhould runne ſoutherly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7284:8"/>
vnto the <hi>Tropicque,</hi> and from thence beare
away <hi>Weſt:</hi> (which error will take vpp all the
obiections of ſickneſſe, the ſun being then in
it, was the cauſe of all the infection, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
of our men) At this conſultation, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
an inſtruction vnder ſeale, to euery
Maiſter, with a prouiſion what courſe ſhould
bee taken, if the fleete were ſeperated; which
was that if the windes ſcanted, or were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
or that any loſt <hi>ſight</hi> of the Admirall,
they ſhould ſteere away for the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi>
and make the <hi>Baruada</hi> an Iland to the North
of <hi>Dominico,</hi> and there to haue their <hi>Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,</hi>
and to ſtay ſeauen daies one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>In this height and reſolution, ſhort of the
<hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> 150. leagues, on S. <hi>Iames</hi> day a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
tempeſt ouer-took them, and laſted in
extremity 48. houres, which ſcattered the
whole fleete, and wherein ſome of them
ſpent their maſts, and others were much
diſtreſſed: Within three daies foure of the
fleete mette in conſort, and hearing no
newes of their Admirall, and the windes
returning large for <hi>Virginia,</hi> and they wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
and beaten, it was reſolued among
them, to beare right away for our <hi>Bay,</hi>
and to decline their commiſſion, which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7284:9"/>
within fewe dayes they made, and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the <hi>Kings Riuer,</hi> on the eleuenth of
<hi>Auguſt:</hi> In this paſſage, foureteene degrees
to the South-ward of <hi>Virginia,</hi> ran no cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
with them, which ſhould hinder or
make difficult that in Propoſition by the
North-weſt. Within ſixe dayes after came
in one, and within fiue, another of our fleete,
the Maiſters of both hauing fallen vpon the
ſame Councell, by the opportunity of the
winde, not to ſeeke the <hi>Baruada,</hi> but to ſteere
away for our <hi>Harbor,</hi> which doubtleſſe the
Admirall him-ſelfe did not obſerue, but obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his owne directions, and is the true or
probable cauſe of his beeing caſt ſo farre into
ſuſpition; where perhapps bound in with
winde, perhaps enforced to ſtay the Maſting
or mending of ſome what in his ſhip, torne or
loſt in this tempeſt, wee doubt not, but by the
mercy of God hee is ſafe, with the Pinnace
which attended him, and ſhall both, or are by
this time arriued at our Colony.</p>
            <p>Not long after theſe, another of our ſmall
Pinnaces, yet alſo vnaccounted for, recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Riuer alone; and now ſeauen of our
Fleete beeing in, they landed in health neere
foure hundred perſons; who beeing put a
ſhore <hi>without</hi> their <hi>Gouernor,</hi> or any order
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7284:9"/>
from him, (all the Commiſſioners and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
perſons beeing aboord him,) no man
would acknowledge a ſuperior: nor could
from this headleſſe and vnbrideled multitude,
bee any thing expected, but diſorder and ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ott,
nor any councell preuent, or fore-ſee, the
ſucceſſe of theſe wayes.</p>
            <p>Now if wee compare the diſaſters of this
<hi>ſupply,</hi> with the <hi>maine ends,</hi> it will appeare
they haue weakened none of them, but that
they ſtill remaine ſafe and feaſable, for any
thing ariſeth in obiection out of them. For
that theſe accidents and contingencies, were
euer to bee expected, and a reſolution was to
bee put on at firſt, armed againſt the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of them. Who can auoid the hand of God,
or diſpute with him? Is hee fitt to vnder-take
any great action, whoſe courage is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and diſſolued with one ſtorme? Who
knows, whither he that diſpoſed of our hearts
to ſo good beginnings, bee now pleaſed to
trye our conſtancie and perſeuerance, and to
diſcerne betweene the ends of our deſires,
whither <hi>Pyety</hi> or <hi>Couetouſneſſe</hi> carryed vs
ſwifter? For if the <hi>first</hi> were the <hi>principall
ſcope,</hi> hence ariſeth nothing to infirme
or make that impoſſible: But as it falleth out
in buſineſſe of greateſt conſequence, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7284:10"/>
the nobleſt ends, vpon which wee are
moſt intenſe, are furtheſt remooued from the
firſt ſtepps made vnto them, and muſt by leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
and meaner bee approched; ſo <hi>Plantation</hi>
of <hi>religion</hi> beeing the <hi>maine</hi> and <hi>cheefe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi>
admitts many things of leſſe and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
conſequence of neceſſity to bee done
before it: for an error or miſcarriage in one
of which, to deſiſt or ſtaggar, were to betray
our <hi>principall end</hi> cowardly and faintly, and
to drawe vpon our ſelues iuſt ſcorne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</p>
            <p>Whither we ſhall diſcourſe out of reaſon,
or example; that euery action hath Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
difficulties, to the greatneſſe thereof,
ſuch as muſt neceſſarily bee admitted from
the firſt conception, and ſuch as euen in the
paſſage, dignifie both the actors and the
worke, if with prudence they fore-ſee all
the hazards, and with Patence and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
meete and encounter them. It muſt ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bee confeſſed, that it was folly from the
<hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>first ſtepp,</hi> not to haue beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for ſuch as theſe; or that it is none
now, not to quitt it, for them, but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
of all to ſay, who would haue expected
this? If wee caſt our eye vpon the <hi>Spaniſh
Conqueſt</hi> of the <hi>Indyes,</hi> how aboundant their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7284:10"/>
ſtories are of Fleets, Battailes, &amp; Armies loſt:
eighteene vpon the attempt of <hi>Guiana,</hi> and
more then ſeuentie in both the <hi>Indies,</hi> and
yet with how indefatigable induſtrye, and
proſperous fate, they haue purſued and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
all theſe, their many Armies main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in <hi>Europe,</hi> can witneſſe, with too la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
an experience.</p>
            <p>If wee compare the <hi>beginnings,</hi> they were
meaner then ours, and ſubiect to all the ſame,
and much more vncertainty, If the <hi>Religion,</hi>
which ſhall crowne the ſucceſſe, it admitts no
Controuerſie nor Compariſon, among thoſe,
to whome we write: if the <hi>Commodities,</hi> they,
which wee haue in aſſurance and knowledge,
are of more neceſſity, and thoſe in hope equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rich and aboundant.</p>
            <p>But to come home to our purpoſe: that
which ſeemes to diſharten or ſhake our firſt
grounds in this ſuppyle; ariſeth from two
principall ſources, of which, one was cauſe of
the other; Firſt, the <hi>Tempest:</hi> and can any man
expect an anſwer for that? next, the <hi>abſence</hi> of
the <hi>Gouernour,</hi> an effect of the former, for
the loſſe of him is in ſuſpence, and much
reaſon of his ſafetye againſt ſome doubt;
and the hand of GOD reacheth all the
Earth. Now if <hi>theſe two onely</hi> bee the maine

croſſes, which ſtaggar the feaſableneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider

on theſe, as the <hi>miſgouernment of our men, their
Idleneſſe, their want, and the empty returne of
out fleet,</hi> wherein if wee <hi>recouer</hi> and <hi>correct the
Cauſe,</hi> we <hi>vanquiſh</hi> al things <hi>conſequent</hi> vnto it,
and yet in <hi>apparance,</hi> if with theſe wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the aduantages which we haue gotten, in
the <hi>Shortneſſe</hi> and <hi>ſecurity</hi> of the <hi>paſsadge,</hi> in the
<hi>intelligence</hi> of ſome of our Nation planted by
Sir <hi>Water Raleigh</hi> (yet a liue) within fifty mile
of our fort, who can open the wombe and

(though diſcoulered and ſoftned by fire, for
want of skill in the Naturalls to peirce them)
was found in great aboundance in the houſe
of their ſepultures.</p>
            <p>If wee conſider I ſay, and compare theſe

certainties and truthes, as leſſe endes to

vs, before euery equall and reſolued
heart, they will vaniſh and become ſmoake
and ayre, and not only keep vpright, but raiſe
our ſpirits and affections, and reconcile our
reaſons to our deſires.</p>
            <p>If any obiect the difficulty of keeping
that wee ſhall poſſeſſe; if this diſcourſe could
admit a diſputation of it, it ſhould eaſilye
appeare, that our confidence againſt any
enemy, is built vppon ſolid and ſubſtantiall
reaſon: And to giue ſome taſte thereof;
Our enemies muſt bee eyther the Natiues, or
Strangers; Againſt the firſt the war would be
as eaſie as the argument. For the ſecond; a
few men may diſpute the poſſeſſion of any
place wherin they are fortified, where the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
is ſo much a ſtranger, as that hee muſt
diſcouer and fight at once: vpon al diſ-aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of Streights, Foords, and Woods; and
where hee can neuer march with horſe, nor
with ordinance without them; nor can abide
to ſtay many months, when all his releefe
muſt bee had from his ſhipps, which cannot
long ſupply a number competent to beſiege:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7284:12"/>
Neither is it poſſible to blocke vs vp, by
planting betweene vs and the Sea, the Riuers
beeinge ſo broad, and ſo many out-lets from
them into the Bay. Beſides the protection and
priuiledge of Subiects to ſo <hi>Potent</hi> a <hi>King,</hi>
whome any wiſe eſtate wilbe wary to affront
or prouoke.</p>
            <p>Wee doubt not, but by examination of
what is ſaid, our firſt ends are yet ſafe, and
the waies vnto them in no ſort ſo difficult, as
ſhould more affright and deter vs now, then
at the firſt meditation of them. But if theſe
bee not ſufficient to ſatiſſie, and encourage,
euery honeſt affection we will not ſo deſiſt, but
vrge the neceſſity of a preſent ſupply, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
the defects, and miſaduentures of the
