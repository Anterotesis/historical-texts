            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Soveraignty of the Kings of

            <p>IF <hi>Monarchy</hi> hath been by God himself,
and the experience of above 5000 years
and the longest Ages of the World ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
(as it hath) to have been the best and
most desirable form of Government.</p>
            <p>And the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> as it hath
been, for more than 1000 years a well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
<hi>Monarchy,</hi> and the Sword and Power
thereof was given to our Kings only by
God that ruleth the Hearts of them.</p>
            <p>The means thereunto which should be
the Power of Punishment and Reward,
can no way permit, that they should
be without the Liberty and Prerogative of
Pardoning, which was no Stranger in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
long before the Conquest, in the Reign
of King <hi>Athelstane,</hi> who did thereby free
the Nation from four-footed Wolves by

ordaining Pardons to such Out-laws as
would help to free themselves and others
from such villanous Neighbours, the Laws
of <hi>Canutus</hi> also making it a great part of
their business to injoyn a moderation in
punishments <hi>ad divinam clementiam tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata</hi>

regni sub cujus protectione &amp; pace degunt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si,</hi>
to be without it; when amongst his Laws
which the People of <hi>England</hi> held so sacred
as they did hide them under his <hi>Shrine,</hi>
and afterwards <hi>precibus &amp; fletibus</hi> obtained
of the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> that they should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and procured the observation of
them especially to be inserted in the <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-Oaths</hi>

caused the Pardon and Discharges to be

            <p>And howsoever he was shortly after upon
his return into <hi>England,</hi> taken by the Earl
of <hi>Warwick</hi> and beheaded without Process
or Judgment at Law, yet he and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100066:4"/>
thought themselves not to be in any
safety, until they had by two Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the seventh year of that Kings Reign
obtained a Pardon, <hi>Ne quis occasionetur pro

of pardoning, being always so annexed
to the King and his Crown and Dignity.</p>

petitioning the King, that no Officer
of the Kings, or any man, high or low, that
was impeached by them, should enjoy his
Place or be of the Kings Council.</p>
            <p>The King only answered, he would do
as he pleased.</p>
            <p>With which they were so well satisfied;<note place="margin">Rot. part. 51 <hi>E.</hi> 3.</note>
as the next year after, in Parliament, upon
better consideration, they petitioned him, that
<hi>Richard Lyons, John Pechie,</hi> and <hi>Alice Pierce,</hi>
whom they had largely accused and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
guilty, might be pardoned.</p>
            <p>And that King was so unwilling to bereave
himself of that one especial Flower in his
Crown; as in a Grant or Commission made in
the same year to <hi>James Botiller</hi> Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi>
of the Office of <hi>Chief Justiciar</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him power under the Seal of that
Kingdom to pardon all Trespasses Felonies,<note place="margin">Rot. Claus. 51 <hi>E.</hi> 3.</note>
Murders, Treasons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he did especially
except and reserve to himself the power of

Parliament that Mercy and Grace belongeth
to Him and his Royal Estate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reserved it to himself, and would that
no man entitle himself thereunto.</p>
            <p>And many have been since granted by
our succeeding Kings in Parliament, at the
request of the Commons (the People of
<hi>England</hi> in Worldly and Civil Affairs as

whom else to apply themselves for it.)</p>
            <p>So as no fraud or indirect dealings being
made use of in the obtaining of a Pardon,
it ought not to be shaken or invalidated,
whether it were before a Charge or Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Parliament or after, or where there
is no Charge or Indictment antecedent.</p>
            <p>The Pardon of the King to <hi>Richard Lyons</hi>
at the request of the <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi>

            <p>And Pardons before Indictments or prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
have not been rejected for that they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100066:6"/>
did anticipate any troubles which might
afterwards happen.</p>
            <p>For so was the <hi>Earl of Shrewsbury's</hi> in the
Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for fear of being
troubled by his ill willers for a sudden raising
of men without a warrant to suppress an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of Rebels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lionell Cranfeild</hi> Earl of <hi>Middlesex</hi> Lord
Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> being about the 18<hi>th</hi>
year of King <hi>James,</hi> accused by the Lords &amp;
Commons in Parliament, for great offences
and misdemeanours fined by the King in
Parliament to be displaced, pay 50000 <hi>l.</hi>
and never more to sit in Parliament, was in
the 2<hi>d</hi> year of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Martyr, upon his Submission to the King
and payment of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> only, pardoned of
all Crimes, Offences and Misdemeanors
whatsoever any Sentence, Act, or Order of
Parliament, or the said Sentence to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>For whether the accusation be for Treason
wherein the King is immediately and most
especially concerned, or for lesser Offences
where the people may have some concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but nothing near so much or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to that of the Kings being the supreme
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100066:7"/>
Magistrate, the King may certainly pardon
and in many pardons as of Outlaries, Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> there have been conditions annexed.
<hi>Ita quod stent recto si quis versus eos loqui vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luerit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the <hi>Lord Keeper Coventry</hi>'s in the Reign
of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Martyr</hi> to prevent any
dangerous questions, touching the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Fines and other Proceedings in
Chancery, sued out his Pardon.</p>
            <p>The many Acts of oblivion, or general
pardon; granted by many of our Kings and
Princes, to the great comfort and quiet of
their Subjects, but great diminution of the
Crown revenue did not make them guilty,
that afterwards protected themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
from unjust and malicious adversaries.</p>
            <p>And where there is not such a clause it is
always implyed by Law in particular mens
cases, and until the Sovereignty can be
found by Law to be in the people, neither
the King or his people (who by their Oaths
of Allegiance and Supremacy are to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
unto him) are to be deprived of
his <hi>haute et basse Justice,</hi> and are not to be
locked up or restrained by any Petition,
Charge or Surmise which is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100066:7"/>
infallible, or a truth, before it be
proved to the King and his Council of Peers
in Parliament, and our Kings that gave the
Lords of Manors, Powers of <hi>Soke</hi> and <hi>Sake,
Infangtheif,</hi> and <hi>Outfangtheif</hi> in their Court
Barons, and sometimes as large as <hi>Fossarum
&amp; Furcarum,</hi> and the incident Power of
Pardons and Remissions of Fine and Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which many do at this day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
contradiction of their other Tenants
enjoy, should not be bereaved of as much
liberty in their primitive and supream
Estates as they gave them in their deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
            <p>And though there have been revocations
of Patents during pleasure, of Protections and
Presentations, and Revocations of Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<hi>quibusdam certis de causis,</hi> yet never was
there any Revocation of any Pardons gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
where the King was not abused or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the granting thereof.</p>
            <p>For in Letters Patents for other matters
Reversals were not to be accounted legal,
where they were not upon just causes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon Writs of <hi>Scire facias</hi> issuing out
of the Chancery, and one of the Articles for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100066:8"/>
the deposing of King <hi>Richard</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> being
that he revoked some of his Pardons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>recep's</hi> of Patents of Pardon, or other
things were ordained so to signifie the time
when they were first brought to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,
as to prevent controversies concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
priority or delays, made use of in the
Sealing of them to the detriment of those
that first obtained them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the various forms in the drawing or
passing of Pardons as long ago</hi> His testibus,
<hi>afterwards</hi> per manum <hi>of the Chancellour or</hi>

<hi>and true meaning thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And need not certainly be pleaded in
any subordinate Court of Justice without
an occasion or to purchase then allowance
who are not to controul such an Act of their
Sovereign.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Manwaring</hi> in the fourth or sixth
Year of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
being grievously fined by both Houses of
Parliament, and made incapable of any
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100066:8"/>
place or Imployment; was afterwards par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
and made Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> with a
<hi>non obstante</hi> of any order or Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</p>
            <p>So they that would have Attainders
pass by Bill or Act of Parliament to make
that to be Treason which by the Law
and antient and reasonable Customs of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
was never so before to be believed or
adjudged, or to Accumulate Trespasses and
Misdemeanors to make that a Treason
which singly could never be so, either in
truth, Law, right, reason or Justice.</p>
            <p>May be pleased to admit and take into
their serious consideration, that Arguments
<hi>a posse ad esse,</hi> or <hi>ab uno ad plures,</hi> are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
usual or allowable, and that such a
way of proceeding will be as much against
the Rules of Law, Honour, and Justice as of
Equity and good Conscience.</p>
            <p>And may be likewise very prejudicial to
the very ancient and honourable <hi>House</hi> of
<hi>Peers</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> for these and many
more to be added Reasons, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For former Ages knew no Bills of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> after an Acquittal
or Judgment in the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Peers,</hi> until that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100066:9"/>
unhappy one in the latter end of the Reign
of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> which for the
unusalness thereof had a special <hi>Proviso</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
That it should not hereafter be drawn
into Examples or made use of a Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>And proved to be so fatally mischievous
to that blessed King himself, and His three
Kingdoms of <hi>England; Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
as he bewailed in his excellent Soliloquies,
and at his Death, his consenting to such
an Act, and charged His Majesty that now
is, never to make Himself or His People, to
be partakers of any more such Mischief
procuring State-Errors.</p>
            <p>The House of Commons if they will be
Accusers, wherein they may be often mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
when they take it from others, and
have no power to examine upon Oath,
wild and envious Informations, and at the
same time a part of the Parliament, subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
to the King, will in such an Act of
Attainder be both Judge and Party, which
all the Laws in the World could never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to be just.</p>
            <p>And such a course, if suffered, must needs
be derogatory and prejudicial to the Rights
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100066:9"/>
and Priviledges, and Judicative Power of
the Peers in Parliament, unparallelled, and
unpresidented, when any Judgments given
by them, shall by such a Bill of Attainder,
like a Writ of Error, or as an Appeal from
them to the House of Commons, be en<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
or quite altered by an Act of Attainder
framed by the House of Commons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they which shall be freed or absolved by
their Peers, or by that Honourable and more
wise Assembly, shall by such a <hi>back</hi> or <hi>by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blow</hi>
be condemned, or if only Fined by the
House of Peers, may be made to forfeit their
Lives, Estates and Posterities by the House of
Commons; or if condemned in the Upper
House, be absolved in the Lower, who shall
thereby grow to be so formidable as none
of the Peerage, or Kings Privy-Council
shall dare to displease them, and where the
<hi>dernier Ressort,</hi> or Appeal, was before and
ought ever to be to the King in His House
of Peers, or without, will thus be lodged in
the House of Commons, and of little avail
will the Liberty of our Nobility be to be
tryed by their own Peers, when it shall be
<hi>contre caeur,</hi> and under the Control of the
House of Commons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:100066:10"/>
Or that the Commons disclaiming, as
they ought, any power or Cognisance in
the matters of War and Peace, should by
a Bill of Attainder make themselves to be
Judges and Parties against a Peer, both of
the Kings Privy Council and Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
in Parliament, touching Matters of that
Nature.</p>
            <p>For if the <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
after their own Impeachments of a <hi>Peer</hi>
or <hi>Commoner,</hi> Petitioned the King to pardon
the very Persons which they had Accused,
as they did in the Cases of <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>John
Pechie,</hi> in the 51 year of the Reign of King
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third, whom they had fiercely
accused in <hi>Parliament</hi> but the year before,
the Objection that a <hi>Pardon</hi> ought not to
be a Bar against an Impeachment might
have had more force than it is like to have.</p>
            <p>Neither would it or did it discourage the
exhibiting any for the future, no more than
it did the many after Impeachments, which
were made by the <hi>Commons</hi> in several <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi>
and Kings Reigns, whereupon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
severe enough ensued; For if the
very many Indictments and Informations
at every Assizes and Quarter-Sessions in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100066:10"/>
Counties, and in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> at
<hi>Westminster,</hi> in the Term time, ever since
the Usurpation and Reign of King <hi>Stephen,</hi>
and the <hi>Pardons</hi> granted shall be exactly
searched and numbred, the foot of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
will plainly demonstrate, that the
<hi>Pardons</hi> for Criminal Offences have not
been above or so many as one in every hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
or a much smaller and inconsiderable
number, either in or before the first or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
instance, before Tryal or after, and the
<hi>Pardons</hi> granted by our Kings, so few and
seldom, as it ought to be confest, that that
Regal Power only proper for Kings, the
Vicegerents of God Almighty, not of the
People, hath been modestly and moderately
used, and that the multitude of Indictments
and Informations, and few Pardons now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in every year, will be no good Witnesses
of such a causelesly feared discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And it will not be so easily proved, as it
is fancied that there ever was by our Laws
or reasonable Customs any Institution to
preserve the Government by restraining
the Prince, against whom and no other the
Contempt and Injury is immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100066:11"/>
from pardoning offences against
Him, and in Him against the People to
whose charge they are by God intrusted.</p>
            <p>Or that there was any such institution
(which would be worth the seeing if it
could be found or heard of) that it was the
Chief, or that without it consequently the
Government it self would be destroyed.</p>
            <p>To prove which groundless Institution
the Author of those Reasons is necessitated
(without resorting as he supposeth to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Antiquities) to vouch to Warranty the
Declaration of that excellent Prince, King
<hi>Charles</hi> the First of Blessed Memory, made
in that behalf (when there was no Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
or Question in agitation or debate
touching the power of pardoning) in his
Answer to the nineteen Propositions of
both <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> wherein stating
the several parts of this well regulated Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
he saith, the King, the House of Lords,
and the House of Commons, have each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Priviledges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein amongst those which belong
to the King, he reckons the power of pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if the Framer of those Reasons might
have been fair and candid, and added the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100066:11"/>
Words immediately following, <hi>viz.</hi> And
some more of the like kind are placed in
the King.</p>
            <p>And this kind of excellently tempered
<hi>Monarchy,</hi> having the power to preserve
that Authority, without which it would be
disabled to protect the Laws in their Force,
and the Subjects in their Peace, Liberties,
and Properties, ought to have drawn unto
Him such a respect and reverence from the
Nobility and Great Ones, as might hinder the
Ills of Division and Faction; and cause such
a Fear and Respect from the People as may
hinder Tumults and Violence.</p>
            <p>But the design being laid and devised to
tack and piece together such parcels of His
said late Majesties Answer, as might make
most for the advantage of the Undertaker
to take the Power of Pardoning from the
Prince, and lodge it in the People, and do
what they can to create a Soveraignty or
Superiority in them, which cannot consist
with his antient Monarchy, and the Laws
and reasonable Customs of the Kingdom,
the Records, Annals and Histories, Reason,
Common Sense and understanding thereof,
the long and very long approved usages
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100066:12"/>
of the Nation, and Oaths of Allegiance and
Supremacy of those that would now not
only deny but be above it.</p>
            <p>And would make the King, by some
scattered or distorted parts of that Answer,
mangled and torn from the whole context
and purpose of it, to give away those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Rights of his Crown, for which,
and the preservation of the Liberties of His
People, he died a <hi>Martyr;</hi> the Author and
his Party endeavouring all they can to
translate the Assent of the <hi>Commons</hi> required
in the levying of Money into that of the
power of pardoning, and jumbling the
Words and Sense of that Royal Answer, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and puts together others of their
own to fortifie and make out their unjust
purposes, omitting every thing that might
be understood against them, or give any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
thereunto.</p>
            <p>And with this resolution the Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
to do as well as he can, and saith:</p>
            <p>After the enumeration of which, and
other His Prerogatives, His said Majesty
adds thus; Again (as if it related to the
matter of pardoning which it doth not at
all, but only and properly to the levying of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100066:12"/>
Money,<note place="margin">Exact Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances, Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, Printed by Order of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 24. <hi>March,</hi> 1642.</note> wherein that Misinterpreter can
afford to leave out His said Majesties Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis
<hi>(which is the Sinews as well of Peace as
War)</hi> that the Prince may not make use of
this high and perpetual Power to the hurt
of those for whose good he hath it, and
make use of the Name of Publick Necessity
(which clearly evidenceth that his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
thereby only intended that part of his
Answer to relate to the levying of Money)
for the gain of his private Favorites and
Followers to the detriment of his People.</p>
            <p>Whither being come, our Man of Art
or putter of his Matters together, finds
some words which will not at all serve his
turn inclosed in a Royal Parenthesis of his
late Majesty, <hi>viz. (An excellent Conserver of
Liberty, but never intended for any share in
Government, or the choosing of them that
should govern)</hi> but looked like a deep and
dangerous Ditch which might <hi>Sowse him
over head and ears,</hi> if not drown him and
spoil all his inventions, and therefore well
bethinks himself, retires a little, begins at
An excellent Conserver of Liberty, makes
that plural, adds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is not in the
Original, fetches his <hi>seeze</hi> and leaps quite
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100066:13"/>
over all the rest of the Parenthesis, as being
a <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> dangerous words and of
evil consequence, and having got over go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on until he came to some just and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
expostulations of his late Majesty,
and then as if he had been in some <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>
Fens and Marshes, is again enforced to
leap until he come to, Therefore the Power
legally placed in both Houses, is more than
sufficient to prevent and restrain the Power
of Tyranny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But not liking the subsequent words of
his late Majesty,</hi> viz. And without the Power
which is now asked from Vs, we shall not be able
to discharge that Trust which is the end of
Monarchy, since that would be a total subversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Fundamental Laws, and that excellent
Constitution of this Kingdom, which hath made
this Nation for many years both famous and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
to a great degree of envy, <hi>is glad to take
his leave with an,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and meddle no more
with such Edge-Tools, wherewith that
Royal Answer was abundantly furnished.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But looks back and betakes himself to an
Argument framed out of some Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
or Feverish Fears and Jealousies, that
until the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have right
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100066:13"/>
done unto them against that <hi>Plea of Pardon,</hi>
they may justly apprehend that the whole
Justice of the Kingdom in the Case of the
<hi>five Lords,</hi> may be obstructed and defeated
by Pardons of a like nature.</p>
            <p>As if the pardoning of one must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
amount to many, or all, in offences
of a different nature committed at several
times by several persons (which is yet to be
learned) and the Justice of the Nation
which hath been safe and flourished for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages, notwithstanding some necessary
Pardons granted by our Princes, can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
or defeated in a well constituted
Government under our Kings and Laws;
so it may everlastingly be wondred upon
what such jealousies should now be founded,
or by what Law or Reason to be satisfied,
if it shall thus be suffered to run wild or
mad.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Canutus</hi> in his Laws ordained that
there should be in all Punishments a <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata
misericordia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ll.</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nusi.</note> and that there should be
a <hi>misericordia in judicio exhibenda,</hi> which all
our Laws, as well those in the <hi>Saxon</hi> and
<hi>Danish</hi> times as since, have ever intended,
and it was wont to be a parcel of good
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100066:14"/>
Divinity that <hi>Gods Mercy is over all his Works,</hi>
who not seldom qualifies and abates the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of his Justice.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Trissilian</hi> Chief Justice, and <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi>
Major of <hi>London,</hi> were by Judgment of
the Parliament of the Eleventh of King
<hi>Richard</hi> the second, Hanged and Executed,
the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> banished, some others
not so much punished, and many of their
Complices pardoned, the people that did not
know how soon they might want Pardons
for themselves, did not afflict themselves
or their Sovereign with Complaints and
Murmurings that all were not Hanged and
put to the extremities of Punishment; nor
was <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> one of the
fierce Appellants in that Matter, vexed at the
pardoning of others,<note place="margin">Rot parl. 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2.</note> when he in a Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Storm of State was within ten
years after glad to make use of a Pardon for
himself.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> pardoned Sir <hi>Walter Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> Sir <hi>Griffin Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
with many others then guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the Earl of <hi>Somerset</hi> and his Lady,
for the Murder of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi>
without any commotion in the Brains of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100066:14"/>
the rest of his Subjects, some of whom
were much disturbed that he after caused
Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> to be executed for a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
offence upon the Score of the former,
not at all pardoned, but reprieved or only
respited.</p>
            <p>And therefore whilest we cry out and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>quantum mutantur tempora,</hi> may seek and
never find what ever was or can be any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
cause or consequence that the <hi>five
Lords</hi> accused of High Treason, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of killing the King, will be sure to
have a Pardon, if that the Pardon of the
Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> whose design must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by all men rather to preserve him,
shall be allowed.</p>
            <p>Nor doth an Impeachment of the House

of the Body Politick be equally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their Estates or concernments by the
vain imaginations, causless fears, and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and bugbears of other seditious or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Mens own making.</p>
            <p>And to men that have not yet proceeded
so far in the School of <hi>Revelation</hi> as to be
sure of the Spirit of Prophesie, it may prove
a matter of ill consequence that the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality
of the People should have occasion
ministred and continued to them to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
of utmost dangers from the
Crown, from whence they of right expect
Protection.</p>
            <p>And a Wonder next a Miracle, from
whence the Premisses to such a trembling
and timorous conclusion can be fetched, or
how a People, whose valiant and wiser Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100066:15"/>
were never heretofore scared with
such <hi>panick fears,</hi> nor wont to be affrighted
with such <hi>Phantasmes,</hi> should now suspect
they can have no Protection from the
Crown, when some of them do at the same
time labour all they can to hinder it.</p>
            <p>Or how it should happen in the long
Rebellious Parliament that after Mr. <hi>Chalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
a Linnen Draper of <hi>London,</hi> was hanged
for Plotting a Surprize of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
and reducing it to the Kings obedience,
honest Mr. <hi>Abbot</hi> the Scrivener should be
pardoned without any such discontent and
murmuring of the People, or that <hi>Oliver
Cromwell</hi> should not be debarred of his
Power of Pardoning in his <hi>Instrument of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
and be allowed to Pardon the
Lord <hi>Mordant</hi> for a supposed Treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his usurped Authority; and our King
deriving his Authority, legally vested in
Him and His Royal Ancestors, for more
than one thousand years before, may not
adventure to do it without the utter undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ruine of his Subjects in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
Lives and Estates, by His pardoning
of some Capital Offenders: Or why it
should not be as lawful and convenient for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100066:16"/>
the King to grant Pardons to some other
Men, as to Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> or Mr. <hi>Bedlow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When no Histories <hi>Jewish, Pagan</hi> or
<hi>Christian,</hi> can shew us a People Petitioning
their Kings, that they would not Pardon,
when all are not like to be Saints or Faultless,
and it will ever be better to leave it to the
Hearts of Kings, and God that directs them,
than to believe Tyranny to be a Blessing,
and Petition for it.</p>
            <p>And the most exact search that can be
made, when it findeth the Commons peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
in Parliament to the King or House
of Peers, that they may be present at some
Tryals there, upon their Impeachments,
cannot meet with any one President where
they ever desired, or were granted such a
reasonless Request, pursued and set on by
other Mens Designs to have one Mans Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
had before another, and by strugling and
wrestling for it, expose the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to an utter destruction.</p>
            <p>And therefore in those their fond impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
might do well to tarry until they
can find some Reason why the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
may not Vote or Sit as Judges or Peers
in Parliament, in the Case of the <hi>five-Lords,</hi>
as well as of the Earl of <hi>Danby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:100066:16"/>
Or any President that it is or hath been
according to Parliamentary proceedings to
have any such Vote or Request made by
the Commons in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Who neither were or should be so om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
in the opinion of <hi>Hobart</hi> and <hi>Hutton</hi>
and other the learned Judges of <hi>England,</hi> as to
make a Punishment before a Law, or Laws
with a Retrospect, which God himself did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
allow, but should rather believe that Laws
enacted contrary to the <hi>Laws of God</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi>
or that no Aids or Help are to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the King <hi>pro bono publico,</hi> or that
there should be no Customs or Prescription,
or that the King should be governed by His
People, would be so far from gaining an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to such Laws or Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as to render them, to be <hi>ipso facto</hi>
null and of none effect.</p>
            <p>When the King hath been as careful to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute
Justice as his Mercy, without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to his Laws and well-inform'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
hath sometimes perswaded him to
Pardon, to do Justice, or to cause it to be
done in a legal and due manner, and is so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
to the Office and Power of a
King, so annext, appendant and a part of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100066:17"/>
it, as none but His Delegates are to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
or put any limits thereunto, and
if it should not be so solely inherent in Him
would be either in abeyance or no
where.</p>
            <p>For the House of Commons are neither
a Judicature or sworn to do Justice,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prins</hi> Animad. upon <hi>Cokes</hi> 4 Instit.</note> and if
they were, would be both Judges and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the Lords Spiritual and Temporal
are not as to particular proceedings sworn
but meerly consultive; So as Justice can vest
in none but the King, who is by his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-Oath
only sworn to do it, if His
Right of Inheritance and greater Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
than any of His Subjects, did not
abundantly ingage and prompt Him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
and is therefore so every way, and
at all times obliged to do Justice and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
the Lives, Estates, Peace and Liberty
of His Subjects, as he is with all conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
speed and hast to Try or bring to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a Subject accused of Treason by the
Houses of Lords and Commons, both or
either of them in His Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi>
before the Justices thereof, or by special
Commission by a Lord High Steward in
or without the time of Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:100066:17"/>
And the King may acquit (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth
to a Remission or Pardon) by a
more Supreme Authority than any of His
Judges (some particular Cases wherein Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
are, or may be brought, only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
do ordinarily by an authority derived
from no other, not to be debarred by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities,
or possibilities, or by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
not always to be foreseen or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</p>
            <p>For a Man pardoned for Man-slaughter,
may be so unhappy as in the like manner af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to be the death of five or ten more;
20000. Rebells pardoned at a time as in the
Insurrections of <hi>Wat Tyler, Jack Cade, &amp;c.</hi> may
be guilty of the like Offence, twenty or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years after: The Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi>
that hath an allowance of Tolls and Profits
to take a care of the City and wholsomness
of Food, might be, as they are, too much
careless and undo them in their Health and
well being.</p>
            <p>The Judges may as those in the Reign of
King <hi>Edward</hi> the First, and <hi>Thorp</hi> in the
Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, be guilty
of Misdemeanours, yet that is not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave
us of that good which better Men
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100066:18"/>
may do us in their administration of Justice,
our Kings have granted Priviledges, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Cities and Towns not to pay Subsidies,
and granted Pardons as their Mercies and
right reason inclined them, in the course
of their several Reigns for many Ages last
past, yet have not acquitted or left unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
all the Offenders ever since, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a greater likelyhood that they would
not be so easie in pardoning, where they
were to gain so much by Attainders, Fines
and Forfeitures.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>panick</hi> &amp; vain Fears, such as
<hi>in constantem virum cadere non possunt,</hi> should
not be permitted to affright our better to
be imployed Imaginations, unless we had
a mind to be as wise as a small and pleasant
Courtier of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths who
would never endure to pass in a Boat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>London</hi>-Bridge lest it should fall upon
his Head, because it might once happen to
do so.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Magna Charta</hi>'s and all our Laws
which ordain <hi>no man to be condemned or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
without Tryal by his Peers,</hi> do allow it
where it is by Confession, Outlawry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and no Verdict.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:100066:18"/>
Did never think it fit that Publick Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
such as Treason should tarry, where
Justice may as well be done otherwise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any precise Formalities to be used
therein.</p>
            <p>For although it may be best done by the
advice of the Kings greatest Council the
<hi>Parliament,</hi> there is no Law or reasonable
Custom of <hi>England</hi> either by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or without, that restrains the King
to do it only in the time of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Returns, Law-Days and Terms
appointed and fixt, have ever given place
to our Kings Commissions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner,</hi>
Inquiries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon special and emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
occasions.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding it will be always
adviseable that Kings should be assisted by
their greatest Council, when it may be
had yet there is no Law or Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
extant, or any right reason or consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
to bind Him from making use of
His ordinary Council in a Case of great
and importunate necessity for the Tryal of
Peers by their Peers, before a <hi>Lord High Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
attended by the Kings learned Judges
of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:100066:19"/>
For Cases of Treason, Felony and Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
being excepted out of Parliament, first
and last granted and indulged Priviledges by
our and their Kings and Princes, there can
be no solid Reason or cogent Argument to
perswade any man that the King cannot
for the preservation of Himself and His
People, in the absence or interval of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
punish and try Offenders in Cases of
Treason, without which there can be no
Justice, Protection or Government, if the
Power of the King and Supreme Magistrate
shall be tyed up by such, or the like as may
happen, Obstructions.</p>
            <p>So until the Honourable House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
can produce some or any Law, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
Pact, Concession, Liberty or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to Sit and Counsel the King, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will or no, as long as any of their
Petitions remain unanswered (which they
never yet could or can) (those grand Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures
and Figments of the <hi>Modus te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendi
Parliamenta</hi> and the supposed <hi>Mirror
of Justice,</hi> being as they ought to be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
when the Parliament Records will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that many Petitions have, for want of
time (most of the ancient Parliaments not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100066:19"/>
expending much of it) been adjourned to
be determined in other Courts, as in the
Case of <hi>Staunton</hi> in 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and days have
been limited to the Commons for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
of their Petitions; the Petitions of
the <hi>Corbers</hi> depended all the Reigns of King
<hi>Edward</hi> the First and Second, until the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
year of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, which was
about sixty six years, and divers Petitions not
dispatched, have in the Reign of King <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
the Second, been by the King referred
to the <hi>Chancellor</hi> and sometimes with a
direction to call to his assistance the <hi>Justices</hi>
and the <hi>Kings Serjeants</hi> at <hi>Law,</hi> and the
Commons themselves have at other times
prayed <hi>to have their Petitions determined by
the Councel of the King</hi> or by the <hi>Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor.</hi>
And there will be reason to believe
that in Cases of urgent necessity for publick
safety, the King is &amp; ought to be at liberty to
try &amp; punish great and dangerous Offenders
without His Great Council of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Petitions in <hi>Parliament</hi> touching the
pardoning of <hi>Richard Lyons, John Peachie,
Alice Peirce, &amp;c.</hi> and a long process of

practice, that the giving any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

and that such Bills as passed in either
or both Houses, and had no Royal Assent
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100066:21"/>
unto them, must at the next Assembly
begin again; for every Session of Parliament
is in Law (where any Bill hath gained
the Royal Assent, or any Record upon a
Writ of Error brought in the House of
Peers hath been certified) is and hath been
accompted to have been a Session.</p>
            <p>And although some of this later quarrelling
Age have Espoused an Opinion, too much
insisted upon, that an Impeachment brought
by the House of Commons against any one
makes the supposed Offence, until it be
Tryed, unpardonable.</p>
            <p>A Reason whereof is undertaken to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
because that in all Ages it hath been
an undoubted Right of the Commons to
Impeach before the Lords any Subject for
Treason or any Crime whatsoever.</p>
            <p>And the Reason of that Reason is (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be) because great Offences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of in Parliament, are most effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
determined in Parliament.</p>
            <p>Wherein they that are of that Opinion
may be intreated to take into their more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
consideration;</p>
            <p>That there neither is, nor ever was, any House
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100066:22"/>
or Members of Commons in Parliament,
before the Imprisonment of King <hi>H.</hi> 3. by
a Rebellious part of his Subjects, in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ninth year of his Reign, or any kind of
fair or just evidence for it.</p>
            <p>Factious designing and fond conjectures
being not amongst good Patriots, or the
Sons of Wisdom ever accompted to be a
sufficient, or any evidence.</p>
            <p>Nor was the House of Lords from its first
and more ancient original, intituled under
their King to a Judicative Power to their
Kings, in common or ordinary Affairs, but
in <hi>arduis,</hi> and not in all things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but in <hi>quibusdam,</hi> as the King should
propose and desire their advice, concerning
the Kingdom and Church, in matters of
Treason or publick concernments, and did
understand themselves, and that high and
honourable Court, to be so much forbid by
Law, ancient usage and custom to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
with petty or small Crimes or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as our Kings have ever since the sixth
year of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the first,<note place="margin">Rot. parl. 7 E. 1.</note>
ordained some part of the Honourable
House of Peers, to be Receivers and Tryers
of Petitions of the Members of the House
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100066:22"/>
of Commons themselves and others, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the King, to admit what they found
could have no remedy in the ordinary
Courts of Justice, and reject such as were
properly elsewhere to be determined, with
an Indorsement of <hi>non est Petitio Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which may well be believed to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
much of its reason and ground from a
Law made by King <hi>Canutus</hi> who began his
Reign about the year of our Lord,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ll.</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuti, 16.</note> 1016. <hi>Nemo

            </p>
            <p>For certainly, if it should be otherwise,
the reason and foundation of that highest
Court would not be as it hath been hitherto,
always understood to be with a Cognisance
only <hi>de quibusdam arduis,</hi> matters of a very
high nature concerning the King and the
Church.</p>
            <p>But it must have silenced all other Courts
and Jurisdictions, and have been a continual
Parliament, a <hi>Goal-delivery</hi> or an intermedler
in Matters as low as Court <hi>Leets,</hi> or Baron
and County Courts, and a <hi>Pye-Powder Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the words of any Crime whatsoever
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100066:23"/>
do not properly signifie great Offences, and
that all great Offences do concern the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
is without a Key to unlock the Secret
not at all intelligible, when it was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
or made to be a Court for common
or ordinary Criminals.</p>
            <p>For the House of Commons were never
wont to take more upon them than to be
Petitioners and Assenters unto such things
as the King by the advice of His Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and Temporal should ordain, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
and endeavour to perform them.</p>
            <p>And an Impeachment of the House of
Commons cannot be said to be in the
Name, or on the behalf of all the People
of <hi>England,</hi> for that they never did or can
represent the one half of them, and if they
will be pleased to examine the Writs and
Commissions granted by our Kings for their
Election, and the purpose of the Peoples E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of them to be their Representatives,
Substitutes or Procurators, it will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to accuse Criminals, for that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the King himself and His Laws,
care of Justice and the Publick; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People had their Inferiour Courts and
Grand Juries, Assises and Goal-Deliveries to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100066:23"/>
dispatch such Affairs without immediately
troubling Him or His Parliament, and the
tenour and purpose of their Commissions
and Elections to Parliament, is no more
than <hi>ad faciendum &amp; consentiendum iis</hi> to
obey and perform such things as the King,
by the advice of His Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, should in Parliament ordain.</p>
            <p>For although where the Wife or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of a Man murdered shall bring an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
the King is debarred from giving a
Pardon,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ll.</hi> Inae, 6</note> because by our <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws derived
from the Laws of God, they are not to be
disturbed in that satisfaction which they
ought to have by the loss or death of the
Man murdered.</p>
            <p>Yet the publick Justice will not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
without the party offending be Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and brought to Judgment for it, if the
party that hath right to Appeal should sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease
or be bought off, so as an Appeal may
be brought after or before the King hath
Indicted, and an <hi>auter foitz acquit</hi> in the one
case will not prejudice in the other, and
where the Matter of Fact comes to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
fully proved, and the Appeal of a
Wife or Children of a Bastard called <hi>filius
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100066:24"/>
populi, quia nullius filius,</hi> where only the
King is Heir, cannot vacate or supersede an
Indictment of the Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither is an Appeal upon a Crime or in
criminal Matters, in the first instance to be
at all pursued in Parliament, by the Statute
made in the First year of the Reign of King</hi>
H. 4. <hi>the words whereof are,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 H. 4. <hi>ca.</hi> 14.</note> Item for many great
inconveniencies and mischiefs that often have
happened by many Appeals made within the
Realm of <hi>England (to the great afflictions
and calamities of the Nation, as it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
happened by the</hi> Lancastrian <hi>Plots
and Designs in that mischievous Appeal
in</hi> Anno 11 <hi>of King</hi> Richard <hi>the Second)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this time; <hi>It is ordained and stablished
from henceforth,</hi> That all the Appeals to be
made of things done out of the Realm, shall be
tryed and determined before the Constable and
Marshal of <hi>England</hi> for the time being; And
moreover it is accorded and assented, That no
Appeals be from henceforth made, or in any wise
pursued in Parliament in any time to come.</p>
            <p>And therefore that allegation that the
House of Peers cannot reject the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Commons, because that Suit
or Complaint of the Commons can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100066:24"/>
no where else, will want a better
foundation (an Impeachment of the House
of Commons, in the Name of all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being no other than an Appeal to the
King in Parliament.)</p>
            <p>And the Suit of such as might be Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
in another place (being there expresly
prohibited) cannot be supposed to be the
concern or interest of all the People deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
or requiring satisfaction, or especially
provided for by Law to have satisfaction,
unless it could by any probability or
soundness of Judgment be concluded
that all the People of <hi>England,</hi> besides
Wives, Children or near Kindred and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
(the necessity of publick Justice
and deterring Examples) are or should be
concerned in such a never to be fancied
Appeal of the People. And it will be very
hard to prove that one or a few are all the
People of <hi>England,</hi> or if they could be so
imagined, are to be more concerned than
the King, who is sworn to do Justice, unless
they would claim and prove a Sovereignty
and to be sworn to do Justice, which
though they had once by a villanous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
attacked, until <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100066:25"/>
               <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> cheated them of it; for God
would never allow them any such power or
priviledge, or any Title to the Jesuits Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which some of our Protestant Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
their modern Proselites, have learned of
them, that the King although he be <hi>singulis
major,</hi> is <hi>minor universis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is no denial of Justice in the
House of Peers to deny the receiving of an
Impeachment from the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
when they cannot understand any
just cause or reason to receive it, and the
Records, Rolls, Petitions and Orders of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
will inform those that will be at
the pains to be rightly and truly directed
by them, that Petitions in Parliament have
been adjourned, modified or denied; and that
in the Common or Inferior Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
Writs and Process may sometimes be
denied, superseded or altered according to
the Rules of Justice, or the circumstances
thereof. And our Records can witness, that
Plaintiffs have petitioned Courts of Justice
<hi>recedere a brevi &amp; impetrare aliud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it cannot be said that the King doth
<hi>denegare Justitiam,</hi> when he would bind
them unto their ancient, legal, well experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100066:25"/>
forms of seeking it in the pursuing
their Rights and Remedies, and hinders
them in nothing but seeking to hurt others
and destroy themselves.</p>
            <p>For Justice no otherwise denied should
not be termed Arbitrary, until there can be
some solid reason, proof or evidence for
it.</p>
            <p>When it is rather to be believed, that if
the Factious Vulgar Rabble might have
their Wills, they would never be content
or leave their <hi>fooling</hi> until they may obtain
an unbounded liberty of tumbling and tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Government into as many several
Forms and Methods, as there be days in
the year, and no smaller variety of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>And they must be little conversant with
our Records, that have not understood that
the Commons have many times received
just denials to their Petitions, and that some
have not seldom wanted the foundations of
Reason or Justice.</p>
            <p>That many of their Petitions have adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Concerns and Interests of others, that
were either Strangers unto them, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of some of the grand Nobility who
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100066:26"/>
thought them as necessary to their purposes
as Wind, Tide, and Sails are to the speed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Ship into the Port or Landing-places
of their Designs.</p>
            <p>For upon their exhibiting in a Parliament
in the 28 year of the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Sixth,<note place="margin">Rot. parl. 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. n. 16, 17.</note> abundance of Articles of High
Treason, and Misdemeanours, against <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
de la Poole,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk;</hi> one
whereof was that he had sold the Realm of
<hi>England</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King, who was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to invade it.</p>
            <p>When they did require the King and
House of Lords that the Duke (whom not
long before they had recommended to the
King to be rewarded for special services)
might be committed Prisoner to the <hi>Tower</hi> of
<hi>London,</hi> the Lords and Justices upon consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thought it not reasonable unless some
special Matter was objected against him.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the said Duke not putting
himself upon his Peerage, but with prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of his innocency, only submitting
himself to the Kings mercy, who acquitting
him from the Treason and many of the
Misdemeanours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for some or them by
the advice of the Lords, only banished him
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100066:26"/>
for five years. And that thereupon when
the Viscount <hi>Beaumont</hi> in the behalf of the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal required that
it might be Inrolled that the Judgment was
by the Kings own Rule, &amp; not by their Assent,
and that neither they nor their Heirs should
by this Example be barred of their Peerage.</p>
            <p>No Protestation appears to have been
made by any of the Lords Spiritual or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
for or on the behalf of the Commons.</p>
            <p>Or by the Commons for themselves.</p>
            <p>So as a different manner of doing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
can neither truly or rationally be said
to be an absolute denial of Justice, and was
never believed to be so by the Predecessors of
the House of Commons in Parliament in our
former Kings Reigns, when some hundreds
of their Petitions in Parliament have been
answered by, There is a Law already provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
or let the old Law stand, or the King will
provide a convenable or fitting remedy.</p>
            <p>And is not likely if it were, as it is not to
be, any Arbitrary Power, or any temptation
or inducement thereunto, to produce any
Rule or incouragement to the exercise of
an Arbitrary Power in the Inferiour Courts,
when there is none so weak in his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100066:27"/>
but may understand that different
Courts have several Boundaries, Methods
and Forms of Proceedings, and that the
Kings extraordinary great Court and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
in His House of Peers although very just
and unarbitrary in their procedures, is so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ready to succour the Complaints of
People, as it never willingly makes it self
to be the cause of it.</p>
            <p>And cannot misrepresent the House of
Peers to the King and his People, in the
Case of Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> or any others,
when that honourable Assembly takes so
much care as it doth to repress Arbitrary
Power, and doth all it can to protect the
whole Nation from it, and many of the
House of Commons Impeachments have
been disallowed by the King and his House
of Peers in Parliament without any ground
or cause of fear of Arbitrary Power, which
can no where be so mischievously placed,
as in the <hi>giddy multitude</hi> whose Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
would be worse than the <hi>Ostracisme</hi>
at <hi>Athens,</hi> and so often overturn and tire
all the wise men and good men in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as there would be none but such as
deserve not to be so stiled, to manage the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100066:27"/>
Affairs of the Government, subordinate to
their King and Sovereign.</p>
            <p>To all which may be added, if the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Presidents cited to assert the Kings
Power of Pardoning aswell after an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment

And may be accompanied by the Case of
<hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> in the 22 year of the
Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second,<note place="margin">22 <hi>R.</hi> 2. In the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Records in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish said to be done by Sir <hi>Robert Cotton.</hi>
               </note> being Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
by the Lords Appellant, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
the King, that such persons Appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that were under Arrest, might come to
their Tryal, it was commanded to <hi>Ralph,</hi>
Lord <hi>Nevil,</hi> Constable of the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
to bring forth the said <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of
<hi>Arundel,</hi> then in his custody, whom the said
Constable brought into the Parliament, at
which time the Lords Appellants came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in their proper Persons. To the which
Earl the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> (who was then
hatching the Treason which afterwards in
Storms of State and Blood came to effect
against the King) by the Kings Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Assent of the Lords declared the
whole circumstances; after the reading and
declaring whereof the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> who
in <hi>Anno</hi> 11 of that Kings Reign, had been
one of the Appellants, together with <hi>Henry</hi>
Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> son of the said Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi>
and afterwards the usurping King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth against <hi>Robert de Vere,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> and Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and
some other Ministers of State, under King
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100066:29"/>
               <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, alledged that he had
one Pardon granted in the Eleventh year
of the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second,
and another Pardon granted but six years
before that present time. And prays that
they might be allowed.</p>
            <p>To which the Duke answered, that for
as much as they were unlawfully made, the
present Parliament had revoked them.</p>
            <p>And the said Earl therefore was willed
to say further for himself at his peril; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
Sir <hi>Walter Clopton,</hi> Chief Justice, by
the Kings Commandment declared to the
said Earl, that if he said no other thing, the
Law would adjudge him guilty of all the
Actions against him.</p>
            <p>The which Earl notwithstanding would
say no other thing, but required allowance
of his Pardons.</p>
            <p>And thereupon the Lords Appellant in
their proper Persons, desired that Judgment
might be given against the said Earl as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict
of the Treason aforesaid.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> by
the Assent of the King, Bishops and Lords,
adjudged the said Earl to be Convict of all
the Articles aforesaid, and thereby a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100066:29"/>
to the King and Realm, and that he
should be hanged, drawn and quartered,
and forfeit all his Lands in Fee or Fee-tail,
as he had the nineteenth day of <hi>September,</hi>
in the tenth year of the Kings Reign, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with all his Goods and Chattels. But
for that the said Earl was come of noble
Blood and House, the King pardoned the
hanging, drawing and quartering, and
granted that he should be beheaded; which
was done accordingly.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Anno 1 Hen.</hi> 4. the Commons do
pray the reversal of that Judgment given
against him,<note place="margin">Rot. parl. 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. n. 109. 111.</note> and restoration of <hi>Thomas</hi> the

            </p>
            <p>Unto which the King answered, he hath
shewed favour to <hi>Thomas</hi> now Earl, and to
others, as doth appear.</p>
            <p>The Commons do notwithstanding
pray, that the Records touching the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance

And it is more than a little probable
that the Prelates, Counts and Barons in that
Honourable House of Peers in Parliament,
did well understand that the King was a
fit, and the only person to Petition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
for that Pardon, Discharge or Dismissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
amounting to a Pardon, and did not

13,</hi> 14. and it hath not been ill said, that
<hi>Justitia semper mitiorem sequitur partem,</hi> for
it is known that a Judge since his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
happy Restoration, who were he now
living, would wish he had made a greater
pause than he did in a Case near <hi>Brod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-Hills,</hi>
in the County of <hi>Worcester</hi> or
<hi>Glocester,</hi> where a Mother and a Son were,
upon a seeming full evidence, Hanged for
the Murther of a Father, who afterwards

            <p>And Posterity by the remembrance of
Matters and Transactions in Times past,
may bewail the Fate of some Ministers of
State, who have been ruined by being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the Fury of the People, (who did
not know how or for what they accuse
them) and left to the never to be found
Piety or Wisdom of a Giddy, Incensed and
Inconsiderate accusing Multitude, and Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on the reasonless or little Wit of one
another.</p>
            <p>And consider how necessary it had been
for the pious good Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> in
the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth to
have had his Pardon, when at his Tryal
neither his Judges, nor the prevalency of
the faction that would have rather his
Room than his Company, nor himself
could remember to put him in mind to
demand the benefit of his Clergy.</p>
            <p>Or how far it would have gone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100066:35"/>
the prevention of that ever to be
wailed National Blood-shedding miseries
and devastions, which followed the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
<hi>Laud,</hi> if their Innocencies had but
demanded and made use of his late Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Pardon.</p>
            <p>Or what reason can be found why a
Pardon after an Impeachment of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Person by an House of Commons
in Parliament, or an House of Peers joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or consenting therewith, should not
be as valid and effectual in Law, Reason
and good Conscience.</p>
            <p>As the very many General Pardons and
