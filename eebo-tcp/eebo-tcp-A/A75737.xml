         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Firſt therefore I intend to relate unto you, what a point or prick is,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152809:4"/>
and afterward a Line both right and crooked, and ſuch ſorts thereof as are appertinent unto the operations and uſe of this Scale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Punctum,</hi> or a point, is the beginning of things, or a prick ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed indiviſible, void of length, breadth, and depth: as in the Figure following is noted by the point, or prick A.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Linea,</hi> or a Line, is a ſuppoſed length, or a thing extending it ſelf in length, not having breadth nor thickneſs, as is ſet forth unto you by the Line BAD.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parallela,</hi> or a Parallel Line, is a line drawn by the ſide of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther line, in ſuch ſort that they may be equidiſtant in all places. And of ſuch parallels, two only belong unto this work of the plain Scale, that is to ſay, the right lined Parallel, and the circular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.</p>
               <p>Right lined Parallels are two right lines equidiſtant one from another, which being drawn forth infinitely, would never touch or meet one another, as you may ſee in the Figure, where the line H I is Parallel unto the line CE, and the line GF is Parallel unto them both.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:152809:4"/>
A circular Parallel is a circle drawn either within or without another circle upon the ſame center, as you may plainly ſee by the two circles BCDE, and XVYW. Theſe circles are both drawn upon the center A, and therefore are parallel the one unto the other. There is another kind of Parallel alſo, which is called a Serpentine Parallel, but becauſe it is not belonging unto the uſe of this Scale, I will omit it, and ſo proceed unto the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perpendiculum,</hi> or a Perpendicular is a line raiſed from, or let fall upon, another line, making equal Angles on both ſides, as you may ſee declared in the figure, where in the line AC is perpendicular un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the line BAD, making equal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngles in the point A.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diameter circuli,</hi> or the Diameter of a Circle, is a right line drawn thorow the center of any circle, in ſuch ſort that it may divide the circle into two equal parts, as you may ſee the line BAD is the Diameter of the circle BCDE, becauſe it paſſeth thorow the center A, and the two ends thereof do divide the circle into two equal parts, in the two extreams B and D, making the ſemicircle BCD equal unto the ſemicircle DEB.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Semidiameter circuli,</hi> or the ſemidiameter of a circle is half of the Diameter, and is contained betwixt the center, and the one ſide of the circle, as the line AD is the Semidiameter of the circle BCDE. This Semidiameter contains 60 degrees of the line of Chords, which we ſometimes call the Radius.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Semicirculus,</hi> or a Semicircle, is the one half of a circle, drawn upon his Diameter, and is contained upon the Superficies, or Surface, of the Diameter, as the Semicircle BCD which is half of the circle BCDE, and is contained above the Diameter BAD.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quadrans circuli,</hi> is the fourth part of a circle, and is contained betwixt the Semidiameter of the circle, and a line drawn Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, unto the Diameter of the ſame circle, from the Center thereof, dividing the Semicircle into two equal parts, of the which parts, the one is the Quadrant, or fourth part of the ſame circle. As for example, the Diameter of the circle BCDE is the line BAD, dividing the circle into two equal parts: then from the center A raiſe the Perpendicular AC, dividing the Semicircle likewiſe into two equal parts; ſo is ABC, or ACD, the Quadrant of the circle BCDE, which was deſired.</p>

So that as you are ſhort of the latitude you reckoned for 3 leagues or 9 min. you are alſo ſhort of your way you reckoned 3 leagues ½, and two leagues leſs in your departure from the Meridian.

                  <p>FIrſt it is to be underſtood, that by the ſwift motion of the firſt Mover, the Moon and all the reſt of the Stars and Planets, are turned about the World in four and twenty hours, upon which ſwift motion of the Moon, the daily motions of the Sea, do depend, which motion of the Sea falleth not out alwaies at one hour, the reaſon thereof is, becauſe of the ſwift motion of the Moon in regard ſhe goeth almoſt thirteen degrees in four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hours, and the Sun moveth ſcarce one degree, which gives every day twelve degrees, that the Moon cometh ſlower to any point in the Heaven than the Sun: which twelve degrees makes fourty eight minutes of time for the difference of every full Sea, according unto the middle motion of the Moon, which difference is here ſet down in this Table for every day of the Moons age. Therefore if you would know the full Sea at any place in the World, firſt you muſt know at what hour it is full Sea at the new or full Moon; which hours and minutes keep in mind, then ſeek the age of the Moon as is before taught, and with the number of her age enter this Table, under the Title of the Moons age, and having found her age in the Table, againſt it you ſhall find the hours and minutes which are to be added unto the time that the Moon maketh full Sea in any place, and the whole number of hours and minutes is the time that the Moon maketh full Sea in that place upon the day deſired. As for example, I deſire to know the full Sea at <hi>London</hi> Bridge upon the 13 of <hi>July</hi> 1624. the age of the Moon being found as before, is eight daies, then in the Table I find eight daies, and againſt it 6 hours, and 24 minutes, which being added unto 3 hours, the full Sea upon the change day gives 9 a clock 24 minutes for the time at the full Sea upon the 13 day of <hi>July</hi> 1624.</p>
