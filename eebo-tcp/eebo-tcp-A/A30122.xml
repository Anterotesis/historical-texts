            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have written to thee now about
the <hi>Barren Fig-tree,</hi> or how it
will fare with the <hi>Fruitless Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor</hi>
that standeth in the <hi>Vineyard</hi>
of God.</p>
            <p>Of what Complexion thou art, I
cannot certainly divine, but the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
tells thee, that the <hi>Cumber-ground</hi>
must be cut down.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Cumber-ground</hi> Professor, is
not only a provocation to <hi>God,</hi> a
stumbling-block to the <hi>World,</hi> and a
blemish to <hi>Religion,</hi> but a snare to
his own Soul also. Though his <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi>
mount up to the Heavens, and
<pb facs="tcp:46065:3"/>
his <hi>Head</hi> reach unto the <hi>Clouds,</hi> yet
he shall perish for ever, like his own
dung, they that have seen him, shall
say, Where is he? <hi>Job</hi> 20. 6.</p>
            <p>Now they count it pleasure to riot
in the day-time, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 13,</hi> 14. but
what will they do when the <hi>Ax</hi> is fetcht
out?</p>
            <p>The Tree whose Fruit withereth, is
reckoned a Tree without Fruit, a Tree
<hi>twice</hi> dead, one that must be pluck'd
up by the Roots, <hi>Jude</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>O thou <hi>Cumber-ground,</hi> God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
Fruit, God will come seeking
Fruit shortly.</p>
            <p>My Exhortation therefore is to
Professors, that they look to it, that
they take heed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Barren Fig-tree</hi> in the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi>
and the <hi>Bramble</hi> in the <hi>Wood,</hi>
are both prepared for the <hi>Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Profession is not a <hi>Covert</hi> to hide
from the Eye of God; nor will it pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate
the revengeful Threatning of his
Justice, he will command to cut it
down shortly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46065:3"/>
The <hi>Church</hi> and a <hi>Profession,</hi> are
the best of places for the <hi>Upright,</hi>
but the worst in the World for the
<hi>Cumber-ground:</hi> He must be cast,
as profane, out of the <hi>Mount of God;</hi>
Cast, I say, over the Wall of the
<hi>Vineyard,</hi> there to wither; thence to
be gathered and burned. <hi>It had been
better for them that they had not
known the Way of Righteousness,</hi>
2 Pet. 2. 21. And yet if they had
not, they had been damned; but it is
better to go to Hell without, than in,
or from under a Profession: <hi>These
shall receive greater Damnation,</hi>
Luke 20. 47.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou be a</hi> Professor, <hi>read and
tremble; If thou be</hi> Profane, <hi>do so
likewise.</hi> For if the righteous scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be saved, where shall the Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Sinners appear? Cumber-ground,
<hi>Take heed of the</hi> Ax; Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Fig-tree, <hi>beware of the Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will keep thee no longer out of
the <hi>Book; Christ Jesus,</hi> the Dresser
<pb facs="tcp:46065:4"/>
of the <hi>Vine-yard,</hi> take care of thee,
dig about thee, and dung thee, that
thou maist bear <hi>Fruit:</hi> That when the
Lord of the <hi>Vineyard</hi> cometh with
his <hi>Ax</hi> to seek for <hi>Fruit,</hi> or pronounce
the Sentence of Damnation on the
<hi>Barren Fig-tree,</hi> thou mayest escape
that judgment. The <hi>Cumber-ground</hi>

to the <hi>Fire.</hi>

Grace be with all them that love

            <head>The Barren Fig-tree:
OR,
The Doom and Downfal of
the fruitless Professor.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Luke 13. 6, 7, 8, 9.</bibl>
               <q>A certain Man had a Fig-tree planted
in his Vineyard, and he came and
sought Fruit thereon, and found
none. Then said he to the Dresser
of his Vineyard, Behold, these three
Years I come seeking Fruit on this
Fig-tree, and find none: cut it
down, why cumbereth it the ground?
And he answering, said, Lord, let
it alone this Year also, until I shall
dig about it, and dung it: and if
it bear Fruit, well: and if not,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46065:5"/>
then after that thou shalt cut it
down.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AT the beginning of this Chapter
we read, how some of the <hi>Jews</hi>
came to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to tell him
of the cruelty of <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi>
in mingling the Blood of the <hi>Galileans</hi>
with their Sacrifices. An heathenish and
prodigious Act: for therein he shewed,
not only his Malice against the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Nation, but also against their Worship,
and consequently their God. An Action,
I say, not only Heathenish, but prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
also; for the Lord <hi>Jesus paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
upon this Fact of his, teacheth the
<hi>Jews,</hi> that without Repentance, <hi>they should
all Likewise perish. Likewise,</hi> that is, by
the Hand and Rage of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
Neither should they be more able
to avoid the Stroke, than were those
<hi>eighteen upon whom the Tower of</hi> Siloam
<hi>fell, and slew them,</hi> Luke 19. 42, 43, 44.
The fulfilling of which Prophecy, for
their hardness of Heart, and Impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
was in the days of <hi>Titus</hi> Son of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasian,</hi>
about forty Years after the Death
of Christ. Then, I say, were these
<hi>Jews,</hi> and their City both, environed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46065:5"/>
round on every side, wherein both they
and it, to amazement, were miserably
overthrown. God gave them Sword,
and Famine, Pestilence, and Blood, for
their outrage against the Son of his Love:
So <hi>Wrath came on them to the uttermost,</hi>
1 Thess. 2. 16.</p>
            <p>Now to prevent their old and foolish
<hi>Salvo,</hi> which they always had in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against such <hi>Prophecies</hi> and Denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations
of Judgment, the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi>
presents them with this <hi>Parable,</hi> in which
he <hi>emphatically</hi> shews them, that their
cry of being the <hi>Temple of the Lord,</hi> and
of their being the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
&amp;c. and their being the Church of God,
would not stand them in any stead. As
who should say, It may be you think to
help your selves against this my <hi>Prophecy,</hi>
of your utter and unavoidable over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
by the Interest which you have
in your outward Priviledges: <hi>But all
these will fail you;</hi> for what think you,
<hi>A certain Man had a</hi> Fig-tree <hi>planted in
his Vineyard, and he came and sought Fruit
thereon, and found none.</hi> This is your
Case, The <hi>Jewish</hi> Land is God's Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
I know it; and I know also, that
<hi>you are the Fig-trees.</hi> But behold, there
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46065:6"/>
wanteth the main thing, <hi>Fruit;</hi> for the
sake, and in expectation of which, he set
this Vineyard with Trees. Now, seeing
the <hi>Fruit</hi> is not found amongst you; the
Fruit, I say, for the sake of which he
did at first plant this Vineyard; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
but that in Justice he command
to cut you down, <hi>as those that cumber the
Ground,</hi> that he may plant himself ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Vineyard. <hi>Then said he to the Dresser
of his Vineyard, Behold, these</hi> three <hi>Years
I come seeking Fruit on this Fig-tree, and
find none; cut it down, why cumbreth it the
Ground?</hi> This therefore must be your End,
altho you are planted in the Garden of
God, for the barrenness and unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your Hearts and Lives, you must
be cut off, yea, rooted up, and cast out
of the Vineyard.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Parables</hi> there are <hi>two Things</hi> to be
taken notice of, and to be enquired into
of them that read.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Metaphors</hi> made use of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Doctrine, or <hi>Mysteries</hi>
couched under such <hi>Metaphors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Metaphors</hi> in this <hi>Parable</hi> are;
(1.) A certain Man. (2.) A Vineyard.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46065:6"/>
(3.) A Fig-tree, barren or fruitless.
(4.) A Dresser. (5.) Three Years.
(6.) Digging and Dunging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or Mystery, couched
under these words, is to shew us, <hi>What
is like to become of a fruitless</hi> or <hi>formal
Professor.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>1. By the <hi>Man</hi> in the <hi>Parable,</hi> (Luk.
15. 11.) is meant <hi>God the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> (Isa. 5. 7.) his
<hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. By the <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> a <hi>Professor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. By the Dresser, <hi>the Lord Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>By the</hi> Fig-tree's <hi>barrenness,</hi> the
Professor's fruitlesness.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>By the</hi> three <hi>Years,</hi> the Patience of
God, that for a time he extendeth to barren
Professors.</p>
            <p>7. This calling to the Dresser of the
Vineyard <hi>to cut it down,</hi> is to shew, <hi>the
outcries of Justice against fruitless Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. <hi>The</hi> Dresser'<hi>s interceding, is to
shew,</hi> how the Lord Jesus steps in, and
takes hold of the Head of his Father's Ax,

How unwilling he is that ever a barren Fig-tree,
should yet be barren, and perish.</p>

of it, is to shew <hi>his willingness to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
Gospel-helps to this barren Professor,</hi> if
happily he may be fruitful.</p>
            <p>11. The Supposition that the <hi>Fig-tree</hi>

that when Christ Jesus hath done all,
<hi>There are some Professors will abide barren
and fruitless.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. The Determination upon this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,

as here you see is a <hi>Tree,</hi> a fruitless
Tree, a fruitless <hi>Fig-tree</hi> in the Vineyard.
Fruit is not <hi>so easily</hi> brought forth, as a
Profession is <hi>got into;</hi> 'tis easy for a
Man to cloath himself with a fair show
in the flesh, to word it, and say, Be
thou warmed and filled with the best.
'Tis no hard thing to do these with
other things; but to be <hi>fruitful,</hi> to bring
forth <hi>fruit to God,</hi> this doth not <hi>every</hi>
tree; No not every <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> that stands
in the Vineyard <hi>of God.</hi> Them words
also, <hi>Joh. 15. 2. [Every branch in me that
beareth not fruit, he taketh away,]</hi> assert
the same thing. There are branches in
Christ, in Christ's Body mystical, (which
is his Church, his Vineyard) that bear
not Fruit, wherefore the Hand of
God is to take them away. <hi>I looked for
Grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes,</hi>
Isa. 5. 4. that is, no fruit at all that
was acceptable with God. Again, <hi>Hos.
10. 1. Israel is an empty Vine, he bringeth
forth fruit unto himself,</hi> none to God;
he is without Fruit to God. All these,
with many more, shew us the truth of
the Observation, and that God's Church
<pb facs="tcp:46065:8"/>
may be cumbered with fruitless Fig-trees,
with barren Professors.</p>

Virgins also went forth of the World
with the other, had Lamps, and Light,
and were awakened with the other;
yea, had boldness to go forth when the
midnight Cry was made with the other;
and thought that they could have looked
Christ in the Face, when he sat upon the
Throne of Judgment with the other;
and <hi>yet</hi> but <hi>foolish,</hi> but <hi>barren</hi> Fig-trees,
but fruitless Professors: <hi>Mat. 7. 22, 23.
Many,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>will say unto me in
that day, this and that,</hi> and will also talk
of many wonderful Works; yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
he finds nothing in them, but the
<hi>Fruits</hi> of Unrighteousness: they were
altogether barren and fruitless Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Had a Fig-tree [planted].</head>
               <p>This word <hi>[planted]</hi> doth also reach
far; it supposeth one taken out of its
natural Soil, or removed from the place
it grew in once; one that seemed to be
called, awakened; and not only so, but by
strong hand carried <hi>from the World</hi> to
the Church; <hi>from Nature,</hi> to Grace;
<hi>from Sin,</hi> to Godliness. Psal. 80. 8. <hi>Thou
broughtest a Vine out of</hi> Egypt; <hi>thou didst
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46065:9"/>
cast out the Heathen and plant it.</hi> Of some
of the Branches of this Vine, were there
unfruitful Professors.</p>
               <p>It must be concluded therefore, That
this Professor (that remaineth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
fruitless) is, as to the view and
judgment of the Church, rightly brought
in thither; to wit, by Confession of
Faith, of Sin, <hi>and a shew of Repentance</hi>
and Regeneration, (thus false Brethren
creep in unawares). All these things
this word, <hi>Planted,</hi> intimateth; yea,
further, that the Church is satisfied with
them, consents they should abide in the
Garden, and counteth them sound as the
rest. But before God, in the sight of
God, they are graceless Professors, <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
and fruitless Fig-trees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it is one thing to be <hi>IN the
Church,</hi> or in a Profession; and another
to be <hi>OF the Church,</hi> and to belong to
that Kingdom, that is prepared for the
Saint, that is so indeed. Otherwise, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

God; or to make profession of, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that the name of God should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon him?</p>
               <p>For the Man that maketh a Profession

God upon himself,</hi> and is called and recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
now, (how fruitless soever before
God, or Men) the Man that hath to do
with God, the Man that God owneth,
and will stand for. This Man, I say, by
his Profession suggesteth this to all that
know him, to be such a Professor. Men
meerly natural, I mean, Men that have
not got the <hi>devilish</hi> art of Hypocrisie, are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46065:10"/>
afraid to think of doing thus. <hi>And of
the rest durst no Man join himself to them,
but the people magnified them.</hi> Act. 5. 13.
And indeed it displeaseth God, <hi>They
have brought,</hi> saith he, <hi>Men uncircumcised
into my Sanctuary.</hi> And again, <hi>(Isa. 1.
12.) When you come to appear before me,
who hath required this at your hand, to
tread my Courts? saith God.</hi> They have
therefore learnt this boldness of none in
the visible World, they only took it of
the Devil; for he, and he only (with
these his Disciples) attempt to present
themselves in the Church before God.

These climbed up <hi>Some</hi> other way.
There are <hi>many</hi> ways to get into the
Church of God, and Profession of his
Name, besides, and without an entring
by the door.</p>
               <p>1. There is the way of <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling,</hi>
and at <hi>this gap</hi> the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>
got in; Josh. 9. 3, 4, &amp;c.</p>

Tobiah</hi> the enemy of God got in; Nehem.

               <p>3. There is sometimes <hi>negligence,</hi> and
too much uncircumspectness in the whole
Church, thus the Uncircumcised got in;
Ezek. 44. 7, 9.</p>
               <p>4. Sometimes again, let the Church
be <hi>never so circumspect,</hi> yet <hi>these</hi> have so
much help from the Devil, that <hi>they</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
them all, <hi>and so get in.</hi> These are
of that sort of Thieves that <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of; <hi>false Brethren brought in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares,</hi>
Gal. 2. 3, 4. <hi>Jude</hi> also cries out
of these, <hi>Certain Men crept in unawares,</hi>
Jude 4. <hi>Crept in!</hi> What, were they so
lowly! A voluntary humility, <hi>(Col. 2.
22, 23.)</hi> a neglecting of the Body, not
in any humor. Oh, how seemingly self-denying
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46065:12"/>
are some of these creeping things,
that yet are to be held, (as we shall
know them) an abomination to <hi>Israel,
Lev. 11. 43,</hi> 44.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But in a great House, there are not only
Vessels of Gold, and of Silver, but also of
Wood, and of Earth; and some to Honour,
and some to Dishonour; 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 20. By
these words the Apostle seems to take it
for granted, that as there <hi>hath</hi> been, so
there still <hi>will</hi> be, these kind of Fig-trees,
<hi>these</hi> barren Professors in the house, when
all Men have done what they can; <hi>Even
as in a great house there, are always Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
to Dishonour,</hi> as well as those to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

So then there must be <hi>wooden</hi> Professors in
the Garden of God, there must be <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,

but that methinks is the biting word,
<hi>and some to Dishonour. That</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
is dreadful, <hi>(Rom. 9. 21, 22.)</hi> but
<hi>this</hi> seems to go beyond it; <hi>That</hi> speaks

<hi>this</hi> of such and such in particular. <hi>That</hi>
speaks of their hardening but in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

                  <hi>Barren Fig-tree,</hi> thou art not licensed
by thy Profession, nor by the Lord of
the Vineyard, to bear <hi>these</hi> Clusters of
<hi>Gomorrah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> neither shall the <hi>Vineyard,</hi>
nor thy being <hi>crowded</hi> among the <hi>Trees
there, shelter</hi> thee from the sight of the
Eye of God. Many make Religion their
<hi>Cloak,</hi> and Christ their <hi>Stalking-horse,</hi>
and by that means cover themselves, and
hide their own wickedness from Men:
<hi>But God seeth their Hearts,</hi> hath his print
upon the heels of their feet, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
all their goings: and at last, when
their iniquity is found to be hateful,
He will either smite them with hardness
of Heart, and so leave them, or awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
them to bring forth fruit. Fruit he
looks for, seeks and expects, <hi>barren Fig-Tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:46065:15"/>
But what! Come into the Presence of
God to sin. What, Come into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God <hi>to hide thy Sin,</hi> Alas Man!
The Church is God's Garden, and Christ
Jesus is the great Apostle and High-Priest
of our Profession. What come into
the House that is called by my Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
into the place where mine Honour dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth!
<hi>Psal.</hi> 26. 8. where mine Eyes and
Heart are continually! 1 <hi>King. 9. 3.</hi>
What, come there to sin, to hide thy
Sin, to cloak thy Sin! His <hi>Plants</hi> are an
<hi>Orchard</hi> with <hi>pleasant Fruits,</hi> Song 4. 13,
14, 15. And <hi>every</hi> time he goeth into his
Garden, it is to see the Fruits of the
Valley; and to see if the Vine flourish,
and if the Pomegranates bud.</p>
               <p>Yea, saith he, <hi>He came seeking Fruit on
This Fig-tree.</hi> The Church is the place
of God's Delight; where he ever desires
to be, there he is night and day. He is
there to seek for Fruit; to seek for Fruit
of all, and every Tree in the Garden.
Wherefore assure thy self, O fruitless
one, that thy wayes must needs be open
before the Eyes of the Lord. <hi>One black
sheep</hi> is soon espied, although in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with many; <hi>that</hi> is taken with the
first cast of the eye; its different colour
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46065:15"/>
still betrays it. I say, therefore a Church
and a Profession are not places where the
workers of Iniquity may hide themselves
from God, that seeks for Fruit; <hi>My Vine-yard,</hi>
saith God, <hi>which is mine, is before
me,</hi> Song. 8. 12.</p>

3. 10.</p>
               <p>1. There is a Fruit among Professors
that withers, and so never comes to be
ripe, a Fruit that is <hi>smitten</hi> in the <hi>growth,</hi>
and comes not to <hi>maturity,</hi> and this is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46065:16"/>
reckoned <hi>no Fruit.</hi> This Fruit those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
bear, that have <hi>many</hi> fair <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi>
or blossoms: That make <hi>many</hi>
fair <hi>offers</hi> of Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
that begin to pray, to resolve,
and to break off their Sins by Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but stop at those beginnings, and
bring no <hi>Fruit</hi> forth <hi>to perfection.</hi> This
Man's Fruit is withered, wrinkled, smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Fruit, and is in effect <hi>no Fruit at
all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. There is an <hi>hasty</hi> Fruit, such as is
the <hi>Corn upon the House top,</hi> Psal. 129. or
that which springs up on the <hi>Dunghil,</hi>
that runs up <hi>suddenly,</hi> violently, with
<hi>great stalks,</hi> and big <hi>shew,</hi> and yet at <hi>last</hi>
proves <hi>empty</hi> of Kernel. <hi>This</hi> Fruit is to
be found in those Professors, that on a
sudden are so awakened, so convinced,
and so affected with their Condition,
that they shake the whole Family, the
End-ship, the whole Town. <hi>For a while</hi>
they cry hastily, vehemently, dolefully,
mournfully, and yet all is but a Pang, an
Agony, a Fit, they bring not forth Fruit
with Patience. These are called those
hasty Fruits, <hi>that shall be as a fading flower,</hi>
Isa. 28. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:46065:16"/>
3. There is a Fruit that is <hi>vile, and
ill-tasted,</hi> Jer. 24. how long soever it be
in growing; the Root is dried, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
convey a sufficiency of Sap to the
Branches to ripen the Fruit. These are
the Fruit of such Professors, whose Heart
is estranged from Communion with the
Holy Ghost, whose Fruit groweth <hi>from
themselves,</hi> from their Parts, Gifts,
strength of Wit, natural or moral Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
These, notwithstanding they
bring forth Fruit, are called <hi>empty Vines;</hi>
such as bring not forth Fruit to God.</p>
               <p>Their Root is dried up, they shall bear no
Fruit; yea, though they bring forth, yet
will I slay even the beloved Fruit of their
Womb, <hi>Hos.</hi> 9. 16.</p>
               <p>4. There is a Fruit that is <hi>Wild; I
looked for Grapes, and it brought forth</hi>
Wild <hi>Grapes,</hi> Isa. 5. 4. I observe, That
as there are <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Herbs</hi> that are
<hi>wholly</hi> right, and noble, sit <hi>indeed</hi> for
the Vineyard: So there are also their
<hi>Semblance,</hi> but <hi>wild;</hi> not right, but ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble.
There is the <hi>Grape,</hi> and the <hi>wild
Grape;</hi> the <hi>Vine,</hi> and the <hi>wild-Vine;</hi> the
<hi>Rose,</hi> and <hi>canker-Rose; Flowers,</hi> and <hi>wild-Flowers;</hi>
the <hi>Apple,</hi> and the <hi>wild-Apple,</hi>
which we call the <hi>Crab.</hi> Now Fruit
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46065:17"/>
from these <hi>wild</hi> things, however they
may please the <hi>Children</hi> to play with,
yet the <hi>Prudent</hi> and <hi>Grave</hi> count them of
little or no value. There are also in
the World a Generation of Professors,
that notwithstanding their Profession, are
wild by Nature; yea, such as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cut <hi>out,</hi> or <hi>off,</hi> from the <hi>wild Olive-tree,</hi>
nor never yet planted into the good
<hi>Olive-tree.</hi> Now these can bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
forth but <hi>wild Olive-berries,</hi> they
cannot bring forth Fruit <hi>unto God.</hi> Such
are all those that have lightly taken up a
Profession, and crept into the Vineyard
without a new-birth, and the blessing of
Regeneration.</p>
               <p>5. There is also untimely Fruit; <hi>Even
as a Fig-tree casteth her untimely Figs,</hi> Rev.
6. 13. Fruit out of Season, and so no
Fruit to God's liking.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>two</hi> sorts of Professors sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to bring forth untimely Fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> They that bring forth [Fruit]
<hi>too soon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They that bring forth
[Fruit] <hi>too late.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:46065:17"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> They that bring forth <hi>too soon.</hi>
They are such as at <hi>present</hi> receive the
Word with <hi>Joy;</hi> and <hi>anon,</hi> before they
have Root downwards, they thrust forth
upwards; but having <hi>not root,</hi> when the
<hi>Sun</hi> ariseth they are <hi>smitten,</hi> and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
die without Fruit. These Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
are those light and inconsiderate
Ones, that think nothing but Peace will
attend the Gospel; and so anon rejoice
at the Tidings, without foreseeing the
Evil: Wherefore when the Evil comes,
being unarmed, and so not able to stand
any longer, they die, and are withered,
and bring forth no Fruit. <hi>He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Seed into stony places, the same
is he that heareth the Word, and anon with
joy receiveth it: yet hath he not root in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but dureth for a while; for when Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation
or Persecution ariseth because of
the Word, by and by they are offended,</hi> Mat.
13. 20, 21. There is in <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of some, <hi>Whose glorius Beauty
shall be a fading Flower,</hi> Isa. 28. 4. because
it is Fruit <hi>before Summer.</hi> Both these are
untimely Fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They also bring forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
Fruit, that stay <hi>till the Season is
over.</hi> God will have <hi>his</hi> Fruit in <hi>His</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:46065:18"/>
Season; I say, he will receive them of
such Men as shall render them to him in
<hi>Their</hi> Seasons, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 41. The missing
of the <hi>season</hi> is dangerous, staying till
the Door is shut is dangerous, <hi>Mat. 25.
10,</hi> 11. Many there be that come not
till the Flood of God's Anger is raised,
and too deep for them to wade through;
<hi>Surely in the Floods of great Waters, they
shall not come nigh unto him,</hi> Psal. 32. 6.
Esau'<hi>s [afterward]</hi> is fearful: <hi>For ye
know how that afterward when he would
have inherited the Blessing, he was rejected;
for he found no place of Repentance, though
he sought it carefully with tears,</hi> Heb. 12.
16, 17.</p>
               <p>So the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> they brought
to God the Fruits of Obedience too late;
their <hi>Lo, we be here,</hi> (Numb. 14. 40, 41,
42) came too late; Their, <hi>We will go
up</hi> (vers. 21, 22, 23.) came too late.
The Lord had sworn, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 10. &amp;
27. 3. before, <hi>that they should not possess
the Land.</hi> All these are such as bring
forth <hi>untimely</hi> Fruit, <hi>Heb. 12. 17. Luk. 13.
25, 26,</hi> 27. It is the hard hap of the
Reprobate to do all things too late; to
be sensible of his want of Grace too late;
to be sorry for Sin too late; to seek Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46065:18"/>
too late; to ask for Mercy, and
to desire to go to Glory, too late.</p>
               <p>1. Thus you see that Fruit <hi>smitten</hi> in
the growth, that <hi>withereth,</hi> and that comes
not to maturity, <hi>is no Fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That <hi>hasty</hi> Fruit, such as the <hi>Corn
upon the House top,</hi> Psal. 129. 6. withereth
also afore it groweth up, <hi>and is no Fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That the Fruit that is <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>ill</hi>
tasted, <hi>is no Fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. That <hi>wild</hi> Fruit, <hi>wild</hi> grapes, Rev. 6.
<hi>are no Fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. That <hi>untimely</hi> Fruit, such as comes
<hi>to soon,</hi> or that comes <hi>too late;</hi> such as
come not in <hi>their</hi> Season, <hi>are no Fruit.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>And he came and sought Fruit thereon,
and found none.]</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nothing will do but Fruit:</hi> Mat. 21.
34. He looked for Grapes; when the time
of Fruit drew near, he sent his Servants to
the husbandmen that they might receive the
Fruit of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what Fruit doth God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Good Fruit. <hi>Every tree that bringeth
not forth Good Fruit, is hewn do on,</hi> Mat. 7. 19.
Now before the Fruit can be good the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46065:19"/>
Tree must be good, for good Fruit makes
not a good Tree, <hi>but a good Tree bringeth
forth good Fruit; Do Men gather Grapes of
Thorns, or Figs of Thistles?</hi> A Man must be
good, else he can bring forth no good
Fruit; he must have righteousness im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
that he may stand good in God's
sight from the curse of his Law. He
must have a Principle of Righteousness
in his Soul, else how should he bring forth
good Fruits; and hence it is, that a
Christians fruits are called, <hi>Gal. 5. 22, 23.
The fruits of the Spirit, the fruits of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
which are by Jesus Christ,</hi> Phil.
1. 11. The Fruits of the Spirit, therefore
the Spirit must be there: the Fruits of
Righteousness, therefore righteousness
must <hi>first</hi> be there; but to particularize
in a few things briefly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> God expecteth Fruit that will
answer, and be worthy of the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which thou feignest thy self to
have. Every one in a Profession, and
that hath crouded into the Vineyard,
pretendeth to <hi>Repentance;</hi> now of every
such Soul, God expecteth that the <hi>Fruits</hi>
of Repentance be found to attend them.
Mat. 3. 8. <hi>Bring forth Fruits therefore
meet for Repentance,</hi> or answerable to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46065:19"/>
thy profession of the Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
<hi>Barren Fig-tree,</hi> seeing thou
art a Professor, and art got into the
Vineyard: thou standest before the Lord
of the Vineyard, as one of the Trees of
the Garden: Wherefore He looketh for
<hi>Fruit</hi> from <hi>thee,</hi> as from the <hi>rest</hi> of the
<hi>Trees</hi> in the Vineyard; <hi>Fruits,</hi> I say, and
<hi>such</hi> as may declare thee in Heart and
Life, one that hath made sound Profession
of Repentance. By thy Profession thou
hast said, <hi>I am sensible of the evil of Sin:</hi>
Now then, live such a Life, <hi>as</hi> declares
that thou art sensible of the Evil of Sin.
By thy Profession thou hast said, <hi>I am
sorry for my Sin:</hi> Why then, live such
a life as may declare <hi>This Sorrow.</hi> By
thy Profession thou hast said, <hi>I am asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of my Sin,</hi> Psal. 38. 18. yea, but live
such a Life, that Men by that may <hi>see
thy shame for Sin,</hi> Jer. 31. 19. By thy
Profession thou sayest, <hi>I have turned from,
left off, and am become an enemy to every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of evil,</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 22. Ah! but
doth thy Life and Conversation declare
thee to be such an one? <hi>Take heed, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Fig-tree, lest thy Life should give thy
Profession the lye.</hi> I say again, Take heed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46065:20"/>
for God himself will come for Fruit;
<hi>And he sought Fruit thereon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have some Professors, that are
only Saints before Men, <hi>when they are
abroad;</hi> but are Devils and Vipers at
<hi>home;</hi> Saints by Profession, but Devils
by Practice; Saints in Word, but Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in Heart and Life. These Men may
have the Profession, but they want the
<hi>Fruits that become Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barren Fig-tree!</hi> Can it be imagined
that those that <hi>paint</hi> themselves, did ever
repent of their <hi>Pride?</hi> or that those
that <hi>pursue</hi> this World, did ever repent
of their <hi>Covetousness?</hi> or that those that
walk with <hi>wanton eyes,</hi> did ever repent
of their <hi>fleshly Lusts?</hi> Where, <hi>barren Fig-tree,</hi>
is the Fruit of these Peoples Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
Nay, do they not rather declare
to the World, <hi>that they have repented of
their Profession?</hi> Their fruits look as if
they had. Their <hi>Pride</hi> saith, they have
repented of their <hi>Humility:</hi> Their <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness</hi>
declareth, that they are weary
of <hi>depending upon God;</hi> and doth not thy
<hi>wanton</hi> actions declare, that thou <hi>abhorrest
Chastity?</hi> Where is thy <hi>Fruit, Barren
Fig-tree?</hi> Repentance is not only a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and a shame for, but <hi>a turning from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46065:20"/>
Sin to God,</hi> Heb. 6. it is called <hi>Repentance
from dead works.</hi> Hast thou that Godly
Sorrow that worketh <hi>Repentance to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
never to be repented of?</hi> 2 Cor. 7.
10, 11. How dost thou shew thy careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and clearing of thy self; thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
against Sin; thy fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending;
thy vehement desire to walk
with God; thy zeal for his Name, and
Glory in the World; and what revenge
hast thou in thy Heart against every
thought of Disobedience?</p>
               <p>But where is the Fruit of this Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
Where is thy Watching, thy
Fasting, thy Praying against the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Corruption? Where is thy Self-abhorrence;
thy blushing before God,
for the Sin that is yet behind? Where is
thy tenderness of the Name of God and
his Waies? Where is thy Self-denial
and Contentment? How dost thou shew
before <hi>Men</hi> the truth of thy <hi>turning to
God? Hast thou renounced the hidden things
of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness?</hi>
2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. 4. 2. Canst thou commend thy

               <p>Secondly, <hi>God expecteth Fruits that

that he hath <hi>the</hi> Faith, the Faith <hi>most

conformity unto Him, to his Sorrows

of <hi>Israel,</hi> that are the barren and
fruitless Professors, his Lot will fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Head of <hi>Achan,</hi> though he be
hid among <hi>six hundred thousand</hi> Men.
<hi>And he brought his Houshold, Man by Man,
and</hi> Achan, <hi>the Son of</hi> Carmi, <hi>the Son of</hi>
Zabdi, <hi>the Son of</hi> Zerah, <hi>of the Tribe of</hi>
Judah, <hi>was taken,</hi> Josh. 7. 17, 18. <hi>This</hi>
is the <hi>Achan, this</hi> is the Fig-tree, <hi>this</hi> is
the barren Professor.</p>
               <p>There is a Man hath an <hi>hundred Trees</hi>
in his vineyard, and at the time of the
Season, he walketh into his Vineyard to
see how the Trees flourish; and as he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46065:28"/>
goes, and views, and pries, and observes
how they are hanged with Fruit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
he comes to one where he findeth
naught but Leaves. Now he makes a
stand, looks upon it again and again, he
looks also here and there, above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
and if after all this seeking, <hi>he
finds nothing but Leaves thereon;</hi> Then he
begins to cast in his mind, how he may
know this Tree next Year, what stands
next it, or how far 'tis off the Hedg;
but if there be nothing there that may
be as a Mark to know it by; then he
takes his <hi>Hook,</hi> and giveth it a private
mark, <hi>(And, the Lord set a Mark upon</hi>
Cain, <hi>Gen. 4.)</hi> saying, Go thy ways,
fruitless Fig-tree, <hi>Thou hast spent this Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet doth he not cut it down, I will
try it another Year; may be this was
not a <hi>hitting</hi> Season. Therefore he
comes again <hi>next</hi> Year to see if now it
have Fruit; but as he found it <hi>before,</hi> so
he finds it <hi>now, barren, barren,</hi> every Year
<hi>barren;</hi> he looks again, <hi>but finds no Fruit.</hi>
Now he begins to have <hi>second</hi> thoughts:
How! neither hit last Year, nor this.
Surely the Barrenness is not in the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
sure the fault is in the Tree. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46065:28"/>
ever I will spare it this Year also, but
will give it a second Mark: And it may
be, <hi>he toucheth it with a hot Iron,</hi> because
he begins to be angry.</p>
               <p>Well, at the third Season he comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
for Fruit, but the third Year is like
the first and second, <hi>no Fruit yet; it only
cumbereth the Ground.</hi> What now must
be done with this Fig-tree? Why, <hi>The
Lord will lop its Boughs with terror;</hi> yea,
the Thickets of those Professors <hi>with
Iron. I have waited,</hi> saith God, <hi>these
three Years,</hi> I have missed of Fruit <hi>these
three Years:</hi> It hath been a cumber-Ground
<hi>these three Years, cut it down.</hi>
Precept hath been upon Precept, and
Line upon Line, one Year after another,
for <hi>these three Years,</hi> but no Fruit can be
seen, I find none, fetch out the Ax; I
am sure <hi>this</hi> is the Fig-tree, I know it
from the first Year, <hi>Barrenness</hi> was its
sign then, <hi>barrenness</hi> is its sign now, make
it fit for the Fire. <hi>Behold, the Ax is laid
to the Root of the Trees; every Tree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is
hewen down, and cast into the Fire,</hi> Matth.
3. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe,</hi> my Brethren, <hi>God's Heart
cannot stand towards a barren Fig-tree.</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:46065:29"/>
You know thus it is with your selves:
If you have a Tree in your Orchard, or
Vineyard, that doth <hi>only cumber the
Ground,</hi> you cannot look upon that Tree
with pleasure, with complacency, and
delight: No, if you do but go by it, if
you do but cast your Eye upon it; yea,
if you do but think of that Tree, you
threaten it in your Heart, saying, <hi>I will
hew thee down shortly; I will to the Fire
with thee shortly.</hi> And it is in vain for
any to think of perswading of you to
shew favour to the <hi>barren Fig-tree;</hi> and
if they should perswade, your Answer
is irresistible, <hi>It yields me no profit,</hi> it takes
up room, and doth no good, a better
may grow in its room;</p>

               <p>Thus when the godly among the <hi>Jews
(Jer. 14. 17.)</hi> made Prayers, that rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
<hi>Israel</hi> might not be cast out of the
Vineyard, what saith the Answer of
God? Jer. 15. 1. <hi>Though</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel

What a Resolution is here, <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Samuel</hi> could do almost any thing with
God in Prayer. How many times did
<hi>Moses</hi> by Prayer turn away God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

how many times did he by Prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>Israel,</hi> when in the Wilderness,
(Psal. 106. 23.) from the Anger and
Wrath of God? <hi>Samuel</hi> is reckoned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
this way, yea so excellent, that
when <hi>Israel</hi> had done that fearful thing,
as to reject the Lord, and chuse them
another King, <hi>(1 Sam. 12.)</hi> he prayed,
and the Lord spared, and forgave them:
But yet neither <hi>Moses</hi> nor <hi>Samuel can save
a barren Fig-tree.</hi> No though <hi>Moses</hi> and

if it was a <hi>Thorn,</hi> or a <hi>Bramble,</hi>

Well, but mark the answer of God;
Ezek. 15. 2, 3. <hi>Son of Man, what is the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46065:30"/>
Vine-Tree, more than any Tree, or than a
Branch that is among the Trees of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest?
shall Wood be taken thereof to do any

unless the betterment lieth in the

if they bring not forth Fruit,</hi> yea good
Fruit, they are fit for nothing at all, but
to be cut down, and prepared for the
fire; and so the Prophet goes on, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
it is cast into the fire for fuel: if it

<hi>So was the</hi> Fig-tree <hi>mentioned in
the</hi> Text; <hi>But what answer hath God
prepared for these</hi> Objections? <hi>Why,
Ver. 6,</hi> 7. Thus saith the Lord God, As the

which I have given to the fire for fuel; so
will I give the Inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
And I will set my face against them, they

               <p>There be <hi>two</hi> manner of cuttings
down;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> When a Man is cast out of the
Vineyard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When a Man is cast out of
the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> When a Man is cast out of the
Vineyard. And that is done <hi>two</hi> ways.</p>
               <p>1. By an immediate hand of God.</p>
               <p>2. By the Churches due execution of the
Laws and Censures which Christ for that
purpose hath left with his Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> God cuts down the Barren Fig-tree
<hi>by an immediate Hand,</hi> smiting his
Roots, blasting his branches, and so
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46065:31"/>
takes him away from among his people.
<hi>Every Branch,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>that beareth
not Fruit in me, He</hi> (my Father) <hi>taketh
away,</hi> Joh. 15. 2. He taketh him out of
the Church, He taketh him away from
the Godly. There are <hi>two</hi> things by
which God taketh the <hi>barren</hi> Professor
from among the Children of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Strong Delusions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Open Prophaneness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> By strong Delusions, such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
the Soul with damnable Doctrines,
that swerve from Faith and Godliness;
Isa. 66. 3, 4. <hi>They have chose their own
Ways,</hi> saith God, <hi>and their Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
in their Abominations; I also will
chuse their Delusions, and will bring their
Fears upon them.</hi> I will smite them with
blindness, and hardness of Heart, and
failing of Eyes; and will also suffer the
Tempter to tempt and effect his hellish
Designs upon them; 2 Thess. 2. 10, 11,
12. <hi>God will send them strong Delusions,
that they may believe a Lie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they
all may be damned who believe not the
Truth, but had pleasure in Vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sometimes God takes away
a <hi>barren</hi> Professor by open Profaneness.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46065:32"/>
There is one hath taken up a Profession
of that <hi>worthy Name, the Lord Jesus
Christ;</hi> but this Profession is but a Cloak,
he secretly practiseth Wickedness: He
is a Glutton, a Drunkard, or Covetous,
or Unclean. Well, saith God, I will
loose the Reins of this Professor, I will
give him up <hi>to his vile Affections,</hi> I will
loose the Reins of his Lusts before him,
he shall be entangled with his beastly
Lusts, he shall be overcome of ungodly
Company. Thus they that turn aside
to their own crooked ways, <hi>Psal. 125.
5. The Lord shall lead them forth with the
workers of Iniquity.</hi> This is God's Hand
immediately; God is now dealing with
this Man himself. <hi>Barren Fig-tree,</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
Thou art crouded into a Profession,
art got among the Godly, and there art
a scandal to the Holy and Glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
but withal so cunning, that like
the Sons of <hi>Zerviah,</hi> thou art too hard
for the Church; She knows not how to
deal with thee. Well, saith God, I will
deal with that Man my self: Ezek. 14.
7, 8. <hi>I will answer that Man by my self</hi>
he that sets up his Idols in his Heart, and
puts the Stumbling-block of his Iniquity
before his Face, and yet comes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46065:32"/>
before me; <hi>I will set my Face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that Man, and will make him a Sign
and a Proverb; and I will cut him off from
the midst of my People; and ye shall know
that I am the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, <hi>secondly,</hi> God doth sometimes
cut down the <hi>barren Fig-tree</hi> by the
Church, by the Churches due execution
of the Laws and Censures, which Christ
for that purpose hath left with his
Church. This is the meaning of that in
<hi>Mat. 18. 1 Cor.</hi> 5. and that in 1 <hi>Tim.
1.</hi> 20. upon which now I shall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large.
But which way soever God deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with thee, <hi>O thou barren Fig-tree,</hi>
whether by himself immediatly, or by
his Church, it amounts to one and the
same. For if timely Repentance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
not, <hi>The end of that Soul is damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
They are blasted, and withered,
and gathered by Men, God's Enemies;
and at last being cast into the Fire,
<hi>burning must be their end. That which
beareth Briars and Thorns, is nigh unto
cursing, whose end is to be burned,</hi> Heb.
6. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And again, sometimes by</hi> cut it down,
<hi>God means, cast it out of the World:
Thus he</hi> cut <hi>down</hi> Nadab <hi>and</hi> Abihu,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46065:33"/>
                  <hi>when</hi> he burned them up with Fire from
Heaven, <hi>Numb. 16. 31, 32, 33. Thus
he</hi> cut down <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi>
when he made the Earth to swallow
them up. <hi>Thus he</hi> cut <hi>down</hi> Saul, 1 <hi>Sam.
31.</hi> 4. when he gave him up to fall upon
the edg of his own Sword, and died. <hi>Thus
he</hi> cut down <hi>Ananias</hi> with <hi>Saphira</hi> his
Wife, when he struck them down dead in
the midst of the Congregation, <hi>Acts 5.
5. 10. I might here also Discourse of</hi>
Absolom, Ahithophel <hi>and</hi> Judas, <hi>who
were</hi> all three hanged: <hi>The</hi> first <hi>by God's
revenging Hand, the</hi> other <hi>were given
up of God to be their own Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
These were barren and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable</hi>
Fig-trees, <hi>such as God took no
pleasure in, therefore he commanded,</hi>
to cut them down. <hi>The</hi> Psalmist <hi>saith,</hi>
Psal. 58. 9. He shall take them away as
with a Whirl-wind, both living, and in his
Wrath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barren Fig-tree,</hi> hearken; God calls
for the Ax, his Sword, bring it hither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <head>Why cumbereth it the Ground.]</head>
               <p>By these words the Lord suggesteth
Reasons of his Displeasure against the
Barren Fig-tree; <hi>It cumbereth the Ground.</hi>
The Holy Ghost doth not only take an
Argument from its <hi>barrenness,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a <hi>Cumber-ground, Therefore</hi> cut
it down; wherefore it must needs be a
provocation.</p>
               <p>1. Because, as much as in him lieth,
he disappointeth the Design of God in
planting his Vineyard; <hi>I looked that it
should bring forth Fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It hath also abused his Patience, his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> suffering, <hi>his three Years, Patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. It hath also abused his Labour, his
Pains, his Care, and providence of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and Preservation: for he hedges
his Vineyard, and walls it about. <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-ground,
all these things thou abusest.</hi>
He waters his Vineyard, and looks to it
Night and Day, but all these things thou
hast abused.</p>
               <p>Further. There are other Reasons of
God's Displeasure; As,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> A <hi>Cumber-ground</hi> is a very mock
and reproach to Religion, a mock and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46065:34"/>
reproach to the Ways of God, to the
People of God, to the Word of God,
and to the Name of Religion. It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of all Hands, that <hi>all the Trees</hi>
in the Garden of God should be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
<hi>God</hi> expects Fruit, the <hi>Church</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
Fruit, the <hi>World,</hi> even the <hi>World</hi>
conclude that Professors <hi>should be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in good Works;</hi> I say, the very <hi>World</hi>
expecteth that Professors should be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than themselves: But, <hi>barren Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi>
thou disappointest all: Nay, Hast
thou not learned <hi>the wicked Ones</hi> thy
Ways? Hast thou not learn'd them to
be more wicked by thy Example, (but
that's by the by): <hi>Barren Fig-tree,</hi>
Thou hast disappointed others, and <hi>must
be disappointed thy self. Cut it down, why
cumbereth it the Ground?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Barren Fig-tree</hi> takes up
the room where a better Tree might stand
<hi>I say, it takes up the room, it keeps, so
long as it stands where it doth, a fruitful
Tree out of that place, and therefore it
must</hi> be cut down. Barren Fig-tree, <hi>Dost
thou hear? Because the</hi> Jews <hi>stood fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in the Vineyard; Therefore, said
God,</hi> Mat. 21. 33-41. The Kingdom of
Heaven shall be taken from you, and shall
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46065:34"/>
be given to a Nation that shall render him
their Fruits in their Season. <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>for
their barrenness were</hi> cut down, <hi>and more
fruitful People put in their room. As</hi>
Samuel <hi>also said to barren</hi> Saul, 1 <hi>Sam.
15.</hi> 28. The Lord hath rent the Kingdom

that is better than thou; <hi>the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable

               <p>

kept out of the Vineyard of God; for
thy sake have the People stumbled at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
By thy Life have they been kept

Thou hast been also a means of harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others, and of quenching, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
weak beginnings. Well, <hi>Barren Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree!
look to thy self,</hi> (thou wilt not go

Cumber the Ground, nor always hinder

<hi>two</hi> things, as Causes of the want
of Fruit in a <hi>barren Fig-tree,</hi> and <hi>two</hi>
things he supposeth as a Remedy.</p>
               <p>The things that are a cause of want of
Fruit, are,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>'Tis Earth-bound;</hi> Lord, the Fig-tree
is <hi>Earth-bound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. A want of warmer Means, of fatter
Means.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>And then to supply it with
Dung; to dig about it, and dung it.
Lord, let it alone this Year also, until I
shall dig about it.</hi> I doubt it is too much
ground-bound, <hi>The Love of this World,
and the deceitfulness of Riches</hi> (Luke
14.) lie too close to the Roots of the
Heart of this Professor. The love of
Riches, the Love of Honours, the
Love of Pleasures, are the Thorns that
choak the Word; 1 Joh. 2. 15, 16. <hi>For
all that is in the World, the Lusts of the
Flesh, the Lusts of the Eyes, and the Pride
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46065:37"/>
of Life, are not of the Father, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to God);</hi> how then (where these
things bind up the Heart) can there be
Fruit brought forth to God? <hi>Barren Fig-tree,</hi>
see how the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> by these
very words, suggesteth the cause of thy
fruitlesness of Soul. The things of this
World <hi>lie too close to thy Heart;</hi> the Earth
with its things have <hi>bound up thy Roots.
Thou art an Earth-bound Soul, thou art wrapt
up in thick Clay. If any Man love the
World, the Love of the Father is not in him:</hi>
how then can he be fruitful in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard?
This kept <hi>Judas</hi> from the Fruit
of caring for the poor, <hi>Joh. 12.</hi> 6. This
kept <hi>Demas</hi> from the Fruit of <hi>Self-denial,</hi>
2 Tim. 4. 10. And this kept <hi>Ananias</hi> and
<hi>Saphirah</hi> his Wife, from the goodly Fruit
of Sincerity and Truth, <hi>Act. 5. 5,</hi> 10. What
shall I say, <hi>These are foolish and hurtful
Lusts, which drown Men in Destruction
and Perdition; for the love of Mony is the
root of all Evil,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 9, 10. How
then can good Fruit grow from such a
Root, the Root of all Evil; <hi>Which while
some covet after, they have erred from the
Faith, and pierced themselves through with
many Sorrows.</hi> It is an evil Root, nay
it is the Root of all Evil: how the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Vanities of this World, bring forth

               <p>Lord, I will loose his Roots, <hi>I will
dig up this Earth,</hi> I will lay his Roots
bare; my Hand shall be upon him by
Sickness, by Disappointments, by cross
Providences; I will dig about him until
he stands shaking and tottering, until he
be ready to fall; then, if ever, he will
seek to take faster hold. Thus, I say,
deals the Lord Jesus oft-times with the
barren Professor; <hi>he diggeth about him,</hi>
he smiteth <hi>one</hi> blow at his Heart, <hi>another</hi>
blow at his Lusts, a <hi>third</hi> at his Pleasures,
a <hi>fourth</hi> at his Comforts, <hi>another</hi> at his
Self-conceitedness; thus he diggeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him: This is the way to <hi>take</hi> bad

Roots from the Earth. <hi>Barren Fig-tree,</hi>

               <p>As the Earth, by binding the Roots
too closely, may hinder the Tree's being
fruitful; so the want of better Means
may be also a Cause thereof. And this
is more than intimated by the Dresser of

From this brief pass through this <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
you have these <hi>two</hi> general Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations;</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That even then when the Justice
of God cries out,</hi> I cannot endure to wait
on this barren Professor any longer: <hi>Then
Jesus Christ intercedes for a</hi> little more
<hi>Patience, and a</hi> little more <hi>striving with
this Professor, if possible he may make
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46065:42"/>
him a fruitful Professor.</hi> Lord, let it alone
this Year also, until I shall dig about it and
dung it, and if it bear Fruit, well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are some Professors
whose Day of Grace will end with, <hi>cut
it down,</hi> with Judgment; when Christ,
by his means, hath been used for their
Salvation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>First</hi> of these <hi>Observations</hi> I shall
pass, and not meddle at all therewith;
But shall briefly speak to the <hi>Second,</hi> to
wit,</p>
               <p>That there are some Professors, whose
Day of Grace will end with, <hi>cut it down,</hi>
with Judgmeut, when Christ by his means
hath been used for their Salvation.</p>
               <p>This the Apostle sheweth in that <hi>third</hi>
Chapter of his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi>
where he tells us, that the People of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> after a <hi>forty Years patience,</hi> and
endeavour to do them good by the means
appointed for that purpose, their end
was to be <hi>cut down,</hi> or excluded the Land
of Promise, for their final incredulity,
<hi>So we see they could not enter in, because of
Vnbelief.</hi> Wherefore saith he, <hi>I was
grieved with that generation, and said, they
do always err in their Hearts, and they
have not known my ways: So I sware in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46065:42"/>
my Wrath, they shall not enter into my Rest.</hi>
As who should say, I would they should
have entred in, and for that purpose I
brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> led them
through the Sea, and taught them in the
Wilderness, but they did not answer my
Work nor Designs in that Matter;
wherefore, they shall not, I sware they
shall not; <hi>I swore in my Wrath they should
not enter into my Rest:</hi> Here is cutting
down with Judgment. So again, <hi>Chap.
4.</hi> he saith, <hi>As I have sworn in my Wrath,</hi>
if <hi>they shall enter into my Rest, although
the Works were finished from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World,</hi> Heb. 4. 2, 3, 4. This
word [if] is the same with [they shall
not] in the Chapter before. And where
he saith, <hi>Although the Works were finished
from the Foundation of the World.</hi> He
giveth us to understand, that what prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
soever are made for the Salvation
of Sinners, and of how long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
soever they are, yet the God-tempting,
God-provoking, and fruitless
Professor is like to go without a share
therein; <hi>although the Works were finish'd
from the Foundation of the World.</hi> Jude
5, 6. <hi>I will therefore put you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
though ye once knew this, how that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46065:43"/>
the Lord having saved the People out of
the Land of</hi> Egypt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>afterwards destroyed
them that believed not. And the Angels
that kept not their first Estate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but left their
own Habitation, he hath reserved in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Chains under Darkness, unto the
Judgment of the great Day.</hi> Here is an
Instance to purpose, an Instance of Men
and Angels: Men saved out of the Land
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in their Journey towards
<hi>Canaan,</hi> the Type of Heaven [cut
down] Angels created and placed in
the Heavens in great Estate and Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
yet both these, because unfruitful
to God in their places, were <hi>cut down,</hi>
the Men destroyed by God, (for so saith
the Text) and the Angels reserved in
everlasting Chains under Darkness, <hi>to
the Judgment of the great Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, in my handling of this Point, I
shall discourse of the <hi>cutting down,</hi> or the
Judgment here denounced, as it respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the doing of it by God's Hand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
and that too, with respect to
his <hi>casting them out of the World;</hi> and
not as it respecteth an Act of the
Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as to this cutting
down, or Judgment, it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that it <hi>cannot be before the Day of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46065:43"/>
Grace be past with the Fig-tree.</hi> But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Observation, <hi>There be
some Professors whose Day of Grace will
end, with cut it down;</hi> and according to
the words of the Text, <hi>Then [after that]
thou shalt cut it down. After that,</hi> that is,
after all my Attempts and Endeavours
to make it fruitful, after I have left it,
given it over, done with it, and have
resolved to bestow no more Days of
Grace, Opportunities of Grace, and
Means of Grace upon it; then, <hi>after
that,</hi> thou shalt cut it down.</p>
               <p>Besides, the <hi>giving up</hi> of the <hi>Fig-tree,</hi>
is before the Execution. Execution is
not always presently upon the Sentence
given; for <hi>after that</hi> a convenient Time
is thought on, and then is <hi>cutting down:</hi>
And so it is here in the Text. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
that he shall perish, is gathered
from its continuing fruitless quite
through the last Year, from its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
fruitless at the end of all Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours:
But <hi>cutting down</hi> is not yet, for
that comes with an after-word; <hi>Then
after that thou shalt cut it down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, that I may orderly proceed
with the Observation, I must lay down
these two Propositions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:46065:44"/>
Prop. 1. That the Day of Grace ends
with some Men <hi>before God takes them
out of this World. And,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. The Death, or <hi>cutting down</hi>
of such Men, will be dreadful. For this
<hi>cut it down,</hi> when it is understood in the
largest sense, (as here indeed it ought)
it sheweth, not only the Wrath of God
against a Man's Life in this World, but
his Wrath against him Body and Soul.
And is as much as to say, cut him off
from all the Priviledges and Benefits
that come by Grace, both in this World,
and that which is to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to proceed,</hi> The Day of Grace ends
with some Men, before God taketh them out
of this World.</p>
               <p>I shall give you some Instances of this;
and so go on to the last Proposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I shall instance, <hi>Cain; Cain</hi> was
a Professor, <hi>(Gen. 4. 3.)</hi> a Sacrificer, a
Worshipper of God; yea, the first Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper
that we read of after the Fall;
but his Grapes were wild Ones, <hi>Gen. 4.
5, 8. his Works were Evil,</hi> he did not do
what he did, from true Gospel-motives;
therefore God disallowed his Work: at
this his Countenance falls: Wherefore he
envies his Brother, disputes him, takes
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46065:44"/>
his opportunity and kills him. Now in
that day that he did this Act, were the
Heavens closed up against him, and that
himself did smartingly and fearfully feel,
when God made inquisition for the
Blood of <hi>Abel; And now cursed</hi> (said
God) <hi>shalt thou be from the Earth, which
hath opened her Mouth to receive thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Blood from thy Hand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen. 4.
8, 11, 12, 13, 14. And</hi> Cain <hi>said, My
Punishment is greater than I can bear. Mine
Iniquity is greater than that it may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.
Behold, thou hast driven me out this
Day from the Face of the Earth, and from
thy Face shall I be hid.</hi> Now thou art
cursed, saith God. Thou hast driven
me out this Day, saith <hi>Cain,</hi> and from
thy Face shall I be hid; I shall never more
have Hope in thee, Smile from thee,
nor expect Mercy at thy Hand. Thus
therefore, <hi>Cain</hi>'s Day of Grace ended,
and the Heavens, with God's own Heart,
were shut up against him; yet after
this, he lived long, <hi>Gen. 4. 10. Cutting
down</hi> was not come yet; after this he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to marry a Wife, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. to beget
a cursed Brood, to build a City, (and
what else I know not) all which could
not be quickly done: Wherefore <hi>Cain</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:46065:45"/>
might live after the Day of Grace was
past with him, several hundred of Years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall instance <hi>Ishmael,</hi> Gen.
17. 25, 26. <hi>Ishmael</hi> was a Professor, was
brought up in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, and
was circumcised at <hi>thirteen Years of Age,</hi>
Gen. 16. 12. But he was the Son of the
<hi>Bond-woman,</hi> he brought not forth good
Fruit, he was <hi>a wild Professor:</hi> For all his
Religion, he would scoff at those that
were better than himself. Well, upon
a day his Brother <hi>Isaac</hi> was weaned, at
which time his Father made a Feast, and
rejoiced before the Lord, for that he had
given him the promised Son; <hi>at this</hi> Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael
<hi>mocked</hi> them, their Son, and godly
rejoicing. Then came the Spirit of God
upon <hi>Sarah,</hi> and she cried, <hi>Cast him out,
cast out this Bond-woman and her Son; for
the Son of this Bond-woman shall not be
Her with my Sou, with Isaac,</hi> Gen. 21.
9, 10, 11. Now <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
(Chap. 4. 29, 30, 31.) makes this cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out to be, not only a casting out of
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, but a casting out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<hi>from a Lot with the Saints in Heaven.</hi>
Also <hi>Moses</hi> giveth us a notable proof
thereof, in saying, that when he died,
<hi>he was gathered to his People,</hi> Gen. 25. 17.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46065:45"/>
his People by his Mother's side, for he
was reckoned from her, the Son of: <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ar;</hi>
the Son of the Bond-woman. Now
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he came of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Gen. 21. 9.
So that he was gathered when he died,
notwithstanding his Profession, to the
place that <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>araoh</hi> and his Host were
gathered to, who: were drowned in the
<hi>Red Sea;</hi> these were his People, and he
was of them, both by Nature and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
by persecuting as they did.
But now, <hi>When did the Day of Grace
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>
                  </hi> Observe, and I will
shew you: <hi>Ishmael</hi> was thirteen Years old
when he was circumcised<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was
<hi>Abraham</hi> ninety Years old and nine, Gen.
17. 24, 25, 26. the next Year <hi>Isaac</hi>
was born. So that <hi>Ishmael</hi> was now
<hi>fourteen</hi> Years of Age. Now when <hi>Isaac</hi>
was weaned, (suppose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> suck'd four
Years) by that account, <hi>The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Day of
Grace must be ended with</hi> Ishmael, <hi>by that
time he was eighteen Years old,</hi> Gen. 25.
12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For that day he mocked, that
day it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Cast him out;</hi> and of
that casting out; the Apostle makes
what I have said. Beware ye young
barren Professors. Now <hi>Ishmael</hi> lived
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Years after this,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46065:46"/>
in great tranquillity and honour with
Men: After this he also begat <hi>twelve</hi>
Princes, even after his Day of Grace was
past.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I shall instance <hi>Esau,</hi> Gen. 25.
27, <hi>&amp;c. Esau</hi> also was a Professor, he
was born unto <hi>Isaac,</hi> and circumcised ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the custom: But <hi>Esau</hi> was a
gamesom Professor, an Huntsman, a Man
of the Field; also he was wedded to his
Lusts, which he did also venture to keep
rather than the Birth-right. Well, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a day, when he came from hunting
and was faint, he sold his Birth-right
to <hi>Jacob</hi> his Brother. Now the Birth-right,
in those days, had the Promise
and Blessing annexed to it. Yea, they
were so entailed in this, that the one
could not go without the other, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apostle's Caution is here of
weight; Heb. 12. 16, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of his Birth-right: For there the

for then goes hence the Blessing
also.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Esau</hi> sold his Birth-right long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Death. <hi>Twenty</hi> Years after this,
<hi>Jacob</hi> was with <hi>Laban,</hi> (Gen. 31. 41. <hi>&amp;

                  </gap>old his Birth-right, and so consequently
had put himself out of the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Three</hi> things I would further note upon
these <hi>three</hi> Professors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, Cain</hi> an angry Professor, <hi>Ishmael</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> mocking one, <hi>Esau</hi> a lustful, game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
one: <hi>Three Symptomes</hi> of a barren
Professor. For he that can be angry, and
that can mock, and that can indulge his
lusts, cannot bring forth Fruit to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Day of Grace ended
with these Professors at that time when
they committed some grievous Sin;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46065:47"/>
                  <hi>Cain</hi>'s, when he killed his Brother; <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi>'s,
when he mocked at <hi>Isaac,</hi> &amp;c. and
<hi>Esau</hi> when out of love to his Lusts, he
despised, and sold his Birth-right. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,
barren Professor; <hi>Thou mayst <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
that in half a quarter of an hour, from the
evil of which thou mayst not be delivered for
ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Yet these <hi>three, after their
Day of Grace was over,</hi> lived better lives
as to outward things, than ever they
did before. Cain, <hi>after this,</hi> was Lord
of a City, Gen. 4. 17. <hi>Ishmael</hi> was <hi>after
this,</hi> father of <hi>twelve</hi> Princes, <hi>Gen. 25.
16.</hi> and <hi>Esau after this,</hi> told his Brother
<hi>I have enough, my Brother, keep that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
hast to thy self,</hi> Chap. 33. 8, 9. Ease, and
Peace, and a prosperous Life in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
is no sign of the Favour of God
to a barren and fruitless Professor; But
rather of his <hi>Wrath,</hi> that thereby he may
be capable to treasure up <hi>more</hi> Wrath
against the <hi>day of Wrath, and revelation of
the righteous Judgment of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let thus much serve for the proof the
<hi>first</hi> Proposition, namely, <hi>That the day
of Grace ends with some Men, before God
takes them out of this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:46065:47"/>
Now then, to shew you, by some
Signs, how you may know that the day
of Grace is ended, or near to ending
with the Barren Professor; <hi>And after that
thou shalt cut it down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He that hath stood it out against
God, and that hath withstood all those
means for Fruit, that God hath used for
the making of him (if it might have
been) a fruitful Tree in his Garden, he
is in this danger; and this indeed is the
<hi>sum</hi> of the <hi>Parable:</hi> The Fig-tree here
mentioned, was blessed with the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of means, had time allowed it to
receive the nourishment; but it outstood,
with-stood, overstood <hi>All, All</hi> that the
Husband-man did, <hi>All</hi> that the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresser
did.</p>

I expect Fruit, I must have Fruit,
therefore bethink thy self. At these the

Professor pauses; but these are words,
<hi>not blows,</hi> therefore off goes this Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the Heart: When God
comes the next Year, he finds him still as
he was, a <hi>barren,</hi> fruitless <hi>cumber-ground.</hi>
And now again he complains, here are
<hi>two Years gone,</hi> and <hi>no</hi> Fruit appears;
Well, I will defer mine anger for my
Namesake. <hi>Isa. 48. 9. I will defer mine
Anger for my Praise, I will refrain from
thee, that I cut thee not off</hi> (as yet.) I will
wait, I will yet wait to be Gracious.
But this helps not, this hath not the least
influence upon the barren Fig-tree, <hi>Tush,</hi>
saith he, here is <hi>no</hi> Threatning: <hi>God is
merciful,</hi> he will defer his anger, <hi>Isa. 30.

are at unawares crept into the Vineyard,
<hi>how do they turn the Grace of our God into
lasciviousness!</hi> Well, he comes the third
Year for Fruit, as he did before, but
still he finds <hi>but a barren Fig-tree; No</hi>
Fruit: now he cries out again, <hi>O thou
Dresser of my Vineyard,</hi> come hither,
here's a <hi>Fig-tree</hi> hath stood these <hi>three

Fears of everlasting damnation, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of this poor creature: And now he
begins to bethink himself, and to cry to
God for Mercy; <hi>Lord, spare me, Lord,
spare me.</hi> Nay, saith God, you have
been a Provocation to me <hi>these three
Years.</hi> How many times have you disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
me? How many seasons have
you spent in vain? How many Sermons
and other Mercies did I of my Patience
afford you? but to no purpose at all,
<hi>Take him Death.</hi> O good Lord, saith
the Sinner, Spare me but <hi>this once;</hi> Raise
me but <hi>this once.</hi> Indeed I have been a
barren Professor, and have stood to no
purpose at all in thy Vineyard: But
spare! O spare <hi>this one time,</hi> I beseech
thee, and I will be better. <hi>Away, away,</hi>
you will not. I have tried you <hi>these three
Tears</hi> already, you are nought; If I
should recover you again, you would be
us bad as you was before (and all this
talk is while Death stands by.) The
Sinner cries again, Good Lord, try me
<hi>this once,</hi> let me get up again <hi>this once,</hi>
and <hi>see</hi> if I do not mend. But will you
promise me to mend? Yes indeed, Lord,
and vow it too; I will never be so bad
again, <hi>I will be better.</hi> Well, saith God,

                  <hi>Death,</hi> let this Professor alone <hi>for this
time.</hi> I will try him a while longer, he
hath promised, he hath <hi>vowed</hi> that he
will amend his ways. It may be he will
mind to keep his Promises. <hi>Vows</hi> are
solemn things, it may be he may <hi>fear to
break his Vows:</hi> Arise from off thy Bed;
and <hi>now God laies down his Ax.</hi> At this
the poor Creature is very thankful,
praises God, and fawns upon him, shews
as if he did it heartily, and calls to
others to thank him too. He therefore
riseth as one would think, to be a new-creature
indeed. But by that he hath
put on his clothes, is come down from
his bed, and ventured into the Yard, or
Shop, and there sees how all things are
gone to <hi>Sixes</hi> and <hi>Sevens,</hi> he begins to
have <hi>second</hi> thoughts: and says to his
folks, What have you all been doing?
How are all things out of order? I am
I cannot tell what behind-hand; one
may see if a Man be but a little a to-side,
that you have neither Wisdom, nor
Prudence to order things: And now, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of seeking to spend the rest of his
time to God, <hi>he doubleth his Diligence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this World.</hi> Alas, all must not be lost,
<hi>we must have provident Care:</hi> and thus
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46065:50"/>
quite forgetting the Sorrows of Death,
the pains of Hell, the Promises and Vows
which he made to God to be better: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Judgment was not</hi> (now) <hi>speedily exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
therefore the Heart of this poor
Creature is fully set in him to do Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things proving ineffectual, <hi>God
takes hold of his</hi> Ax <hi>again,</hi> sends Death
to a Wife, to a Child, to his Cattel,
<hi>(your young Men have I slain, and taken
away your horses,</hi> Amos 4. 9, 10.) I will
blast him, cross him, disappoint him, and
cast him down, and will set my self against
him, <hi>in all that he putteth his Hand unto.</hi>
At this the poor <hi>Barren Professor</hi> cries out
again, Lord, I have sinned, spare me once
more, I beseech thee. O take not away <hi>the
desire of mine Eyes,</hi> spare my Children, bless
me in my labours, and I will mend and be
better. No, saith God, you lyed to me
last time, I will trust you <hi>in this</hi> no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and withal he tumbleth the Wife,
the Child, the Estate, into a grave.</p>
               <p>And then returns to his place, till this

his offence, <hi>Hos. 5. 14,</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>At this the poor creature is afflicted
and distressed, Rents his Cloaths, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to call the breaking of his Promise
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46065:51"/>
and Vows to mind, he mourns and
Prays, and like <hi>Ahab, a while walks soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
at the remembrance of the justness
of the hand of God upon him. And
now he renews his Promises; Lord, try
me <hi>this one time more,</hi> take off thy hand
and see; <hi>They go far that never turn.</hi>
Well, God spareth him again, sets down
his <hi>Ax</hi> again; <hi>Many times He did deliver
them, but they provoked him with their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
and were brought low for their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
Psal. 106. 43. Now they seem to
be thankful again, and are as if they
were resolved to be Godly indeed. Now
they Read, they Pray, they go to Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and seem to be serious a pretty
while, but at last they forget. Their
Lusts prick them, suitable Temptations
present themselves: wherefore they
turn to their own crooked ways again.
Psal. 78. 34, 36. <hi>When he slew them, then
they sought him, and returned early after
God, nevertheless they did flatter him with
mouth, and lyed unto him with their
tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Yet again, The Lord will not leave
this Professor, but will take up his <hi>Ax</hi>
again, and will put him under a more
heart-searching Ministry, a Ministry that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46065:51"/>
shall search him, and turn him over and
over; a Ministry that shall meet with
him, as <hi>Elijah</hi> met with <hi>Ahab,</hi> in all his
acts of Wickedness (and <hi>Now</hi> the <hi>Ax is
laid to the Roots of the Trees.)</hi> Besides,
this Minstry doth not only search the
Heart, but presenteth the Sinner with
the <hi>Golden</hi> rays of the glorious Gospel;
<hi>Now is Christ Jesus set forth evidently,</hi>
now is Grace displayed sweetly; Now,
now are the Promises broken like <hi>Boxes</hi>
of <hi>Ointment</hi> to the perfuming of the
whole room. <hi>But a as, there is yet no
Fruit on this Fig-tree.</hi> While his Heart
is searching, he wrangles; while the
glorious Grace of the Gospel is unvail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
this Professor wags and is wanton,
gathers up some <hi>scraps</hi> thereof, <hi>Tastes
the good Word of God, and the Powers of
the World to come,</hi> Jude 4. Drinketh in the
Rain that comes oft upon him, <hi>Heb. 6. 3—
7, 8. But bringeth not forth Fruit meet for
him, whose Gospel it is; takes no heed to walk
in the Law of the Lord God of Israel with all
his Heart,</hi> 2 Kin. 10. 31. but counteth
that the Glory of the Gospel consisteth
in talk and shew, and that our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
thereto, is a matter of <hi>Speculation;</hi>
that good <hi>Works</hi> lie in good <hi>Words,</hi> and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:46065:52"/>
if they can finely talk, they think they
<hi>bravely,</hi> please God. They think the
Kingdom of God consisteth only in
Word, not in Power: and thus proveth
ineffectual this <hi>Fourth</hi> Means also.</p>
               <p>5. Well, Now the <hi>Ax</hi> begins to be
heaved higher, for now indeed God is
ready to smite the Sinner, yet before he
will strike the stroak, he will try one
Way more at the last, and if that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
<hi>down goes the Fig-tree.</hi> Now this
last way is <hi>to tug and strive with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
by his Spirit.</hi> Wherefore the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lord is now come to him:
But <hi>not always to strive with Man,</hi> Gen.
6. 8. yet a while he will strive with him,
he will <hi>awaken,</hi> he will <hi>convince,</hi> he will
call to remembrance former Sins, former
Judgments, the breach of former Vows
and Promises, the mispending of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Days; he will also present perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Arguments, encouraging Promises,
dreadful Judgments, the shortness of
time to repent in; and that there is hope
if he come. Further, he will shew
him the certainty of Death, and of the
Judgment to come; yea, He will pull
and strive with this Sinner. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
the mischief now lies here, here
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46065:52"/>
is tugging and striving on both sides.
The <hi>Spirit</hi> convinces, the <hi>Man</hi> turns a
deaf Ear to God; the <hi>Spirit</hi> saith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
my Instruction and live; but the
<hi>Man</hi> pulls away his Shoulder; the <hi>Spirit</hi>
shews him whither he is going, but the
<hi>Man</hi> closeth his Eyes against it; the <hi>Spirit</hi>
offereth violence, the <hi>Man</hi> strives and
resists, <hi>They have done despite unto the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Grace,</hi> Heb. 10. 29. The Spirit
<hi>parlieth</hi> a <hi>second</hi> time, and urgeth Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of a new nature; But the Sinner
answereth, <hi>No, I have loved strangers, and
after them I will go,</hi> Amos 4. 6, 8, 9, 10,
11. At this God's Fury comes up into his
Face, now he comes out of his holy
Place, and is terrible: now He <hi>sweareth
in his Wrath, they shall never enter into his
Rest,</hi> Ezek. 24. 13. I exercised towards
you my Patience, yet you have not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto me, saith Lord. I smote you
in your Person, in your Relations, in
your Estate, yet you have not returned
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto me, saith the Lord. <hi>In thy filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is lewdness, because I have purged thee,
and thou wast not purged; thou shalt not
be purged from thy filthiness any more, till
I cause my Fury to rest npon thee. Cut it
down, why doth it cumber the ground?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:46065:53"/>
The <hi>Second Sign,</hi> That such a Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
is almost (if not quite) past Grace,
is, <hi>When God hath given him over, or lets
him alone,</hi> and suffers him to do any thing,
and that without controul, helpeth him
not either in Works of Holiness, or in
Straits and Difficulties. <hi>Ephraim is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Idols, let him alone,</hi> Hos. 4. 17. <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be to them when I depart from them. I will
laugh at their Calamities, and will mock when
their Fear cometh,</hi> Prov. 1. 24, 25, 26,
27, 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barren Fig-tree,</hi> thou hast heretofore
been digged about, and dunged, God's
Mattock hath heretofore been at thy
Roots, Gospel-dung hath heretofore been
applied to thee; thou hast heretofore
been strove with, convinced, awakened,
made to taste and see, and crie, <hi>O the
Blessedness!</hi> Thou hast heretofore been
met with under the Word; thy Heart
hath melted, thy Spirit hath fallen, thy
Soul hath trembled, and thou hast felt
something of the Power of the Gospel.
But thou hast sinned, thou hast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
the Eyes of his Glory, thy Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is found to be hateful, and now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46065:53"/>
God hath left thee, given thee up,
<hi>and lets thee alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heretofore thou wast tender, thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
startled at the temptation to
Wickedness, for thou wert taken off from
<hi>the pollutions of the World, through the
knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 20, 21, 22. but that very
<hi>Vomit</hi> that once thou wert turned from,
now thou lappest up (with the <hi>Dog</hi> in the
<hi>Proverb)</hi> again, and that very <hi>Mire</hi> that
once thou seemest to lie washed from,
<hi>in that very Mire thou now art tumbling
afresh.</hi> But to particularize, there are
<hi>three</hi> Signs of a Man's being given over
of God.</p>
               <p>1. When he is let alone in Sinning,
<hi>when the reins of his Lusts are loosed,</hi> and he
given up to them. <hi>And even as they did
not like to retain God in their knowledg, God
gave them over to a reprobate Mind, to
do those things which are not convenient;
being filled with all unrighteousness,</hi> Rom.
1. 28, 29. Seest thou a Man that
heretofore had the knowledg of God,
and that had some awe of Majesty upon
him; I say, seest thou such an one, <hi>spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himself in his own Deceivings,</hi> Rom.
1. 30, 31. turning the Grace of our
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46065:54"/>
God into Lasciviousness, and walking
after his own ungodly Lusts; his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
now of a long time lingereth not,
<hi>and his Damnation slumbereth not,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.
13. Dost thou hear, barren Professor? It
is astonishing to see, how those that
once seemed <hi>Sons of the Morning,</hi> and
were making Preparations for Eternal
Life, now at last, for the rottenness of
their Hearts, by the just Judgment of
God, to be permitted, being past feeling,
to give themselves over unto Lascivious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>to work all uncleanness with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
Eph. 4. 18, 19. A great number of
such were in the <hi>first</hi> Gospel-days; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> and <hi>John</hi>
pronounceth the heavy Judgment of God.
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude couple them with the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Angels,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. and <hi>John</hi>
forbids that prayer be made for them,
because that is happened unto them,
that hath happened to the Angels that
fell, <hi>Jude 5, 6, 7, 8. Who for forsaking their</hi>
first <hi>State, and for leaving their own Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
are reserved in Chains under ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Darkness, unto the Judgment of
the great Day. Barren Fig-tree,</hi> dost
thou hear?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> These are beyond all Mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:46065:54"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> These are beyond all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> These are beyond all hopes of
Repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> These have no Intercessor,
nor any more share in a Sacrifice for Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> For these there remains nothing
but a fearful looking for of Judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Wherefore these are the true
Fugitives and Vagabonds, that being
left of God, of Christ, of Grace, and of
the Promise, and being beyond all hope,
wander and straggle to and fro, even
as the Devil, their Associate, until their
time shall come to die, or until they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
in Battel, and perish.</p>
               <p>2. Wherefore they are let alone in
hearing. If these at any time come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Word, there is for them <hi>no</hi> God,
<hi>no</hi> savour of the means of Grace, <hi>no</hi>
stirrings of Heart, <hi>no</hi> pity for themselves,
<hi>no</hi> love to their own Salvation. Let
them look on this hand or that, there
they see such effects of the Word in
others, as produceth Signs of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and Love to God and his Christ,
<hi>These Men only have their Backs bowed down
alway,</hi> Rom. 11. 10. These Men only,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46065:55"/>
                  <hi>have the spirit of slumber, eyes that they
should not see, and ears that they should not
hear to this very day,</hi> Eccl. 8. 10. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as they go to the place of the Holy;
<hi>So they came from the place of the Holy,
and soon are forgotten in the places where
they so did.</hi> Only they reap this dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
<hi>They treasure up Wrath against the day
of Wrath, and revelation of the righteous
judgment of God,</hi> Rom. 2. 3, 4, 5. Look
to it, <hi>barren Professor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. If he be visited after the common
way of Mankind, either with Sickness,
Distress, or any kind of Calamity, still
no God appeareth, no sanctifying Hand
of God, no special Mercy is mixed with
the Affliction. But he falls sick, and
grows well, <hi>like the Beast;</hi> or is under
distress, as <hi>Saul,</hi> who when he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
by the <hi>Philistines,</hi> was forsaken
and left of God. 1 Sam. 28. 4, 5, 6. <hi>And
the</hi> Philistins <hi>gathered themselves together,
and came and pitched in</hi> Shunem; <hi>and</hi> Saul
<hi>gathered all</hi> Israel <hi>together, and thy pitched
to</hi> Gilboa: <hi>And when</hi> Saul <hi>saw the Host
of the</hi> Philistins, <hi>he was afraid, and his
Heart greatly trembled. And when</hi> Saul
<hi>enquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him
no more, neither by Dreams, nor by</hi> Urim,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46065:55"/>
                  <hi>nor by Prophets.</hi> The Lord answered him
<hi>no</hi> more, He had done with him, cast
him off, and rejected him, and left him
to stand and fall with his Sins by himself.
But of this more in the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I here forbear.</p>
               <p>4. These Men may go whither they
will, do what they will, they may range
from Opinion to Opinion, from Notion
to Notion, from <hi>Sect to Sect,</hi> but are
stedfast no where, they are left to their
own Uncertainties: they have not Grace
to establish their Hearts, and though
some of them have boasted themselves of
this Liberty, yet <hi>Jude</hi> calls them <hi>wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Stars, to whom is reserved the blackness
of darkness for ever,</hi> Jude 13. They are
left, as I told you before, to be Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and Vagabonds in the Earth, to
wander every where, but to abide no
where, until they shall descend <hi>to their
own place,</hi> (Acts 1. 5.) with <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
Men of the same fate with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Third <hi>Sign</hi> that such a Professor is
quite past Grace, is, When his heart is
grown so hard, so stony and impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that nothing will pierce it. <hi>Barren
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46065:56"/>
Fig-tree, dost thou consider?</hi> A hard and
impenitent Heart is the Curse of God.
A Heart that cannot repent, is instead
of all Plagues at once; And hence it is
that God said of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 9. 14.
when he spake of delivering him up in
the greatness of his Anger, <hi>I will at this
time,</hi> saith he, <hi>send all my Plagues upon thy
Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To some Men that have grievously
sinned under a Profession of the Gospel,
God giveth this <hi>Token</hi> of his Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
they are denied the Power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
their Heart is bound, they
cannot repent: It is impossible that they
should ever repent should they live a
<hi>thousand</hi> Years, <hi>It is impossible for those</hi>
Fall-a-ways <hi>to be renewed again unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
seeing they crucify to themselves
the Son of God afresh, aed put him to open
shame,</hi> Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. Now to have
the Heart so hardened, <hi>so judicially har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened,</hi>
this is as a bar put in by the Lord
God against the Salvation of <hi>this</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
This was the burden of <hi>Spira's</hi>
Complaint, <hi>I cannot do it: O now I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Man sees what he hath done,
what should help him, and what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46065:56"/>
of him, yet he cannot repent; he
pulled away his Shouldier before, he
stopped his Ears before, he shut up his
Eyes before, <hi>and in that very posture God left
him,</hi> and so he stands to this very Day.
I have had a fancy, that <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife,
when she was turned into a Pillar of Salt,
(Gen. 19. 26.) stood yet looking over
her Shoulder, or else with her Face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Sodom;</hi> as the Judgment caught
her, so it bound her, and left her a
Monument of God's Anger to after-Generations.</p>
               <p>We read of some that are <hi>seared with
an hot Iron,</hi> and that are <hi>past feeling,</hi> for
so seared Persons, in seared Parts are.
Their <hi>Conscience is seared,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 2.
The Conscience is the thing that must
be touched with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eeling fear and <hi>remorse,</hi>
if ever any good be done with the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
How then can any good be done
to those whose Conscience is <hi>worse than
that, that is fast asleep in sin,</hi> Eph. 4. 19. For
that Conscience that is fast asleep, may
yet be effectually awakened and saved;
but that Conscience <hi>that is seared,</hi> dried,
as it were, into a <hi>Cinder,</hi> can never have
sense, feeling, or the least regret in this
World. <hi>Barren Fig-tree, hearken, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46065:57"/>
hardening is dreadful.</hi> There is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt that hardness of Heart
that is incident to all Men, and that
which comes upon some as a signal or
special Judgment of God: and although
all kind of hardness of Heart, in some
sense, may be called a Judgment, yet
to be hardened with this <hi>second</hi> kind, is
a Judgment peculiar only to them that
perish; an hardness that is sent as a
punishment, <hi>for the abuse of Light received,
for a reward of Apostacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Judicial</hi> hardness is discovered
from that which is incident to all Men,
in these Particulars:</p>
               <p>1. It is an hardness that comes after
some great Light received; <hi>Because of
some great Sin committed against that Light,
and the Grace that gave it.</hi> Such hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had, after the Lord had
wrought wonderously before him: Such
<hi>hardness</hi> as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had, a <hi>hardness</hi>
which darkened the Heart, a <hi>hardness</hi>
which made their Minds <hi>reprobate. This
hard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ess</hi> is also the same with that the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> are cautioned to beware of, <hi>(Heb.
3.</hi> 7, &amp;c.) an <hi>hardness</hi> that is caused by
Unbelief, and a departing from the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God; and <hi>hardness</hi> compleated thro
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46065:57"/>
the deceitfulness of Sin: Such as that
in the Provocation, of whom God
sware, that they should not enter into his
<hi>Rest.</hi> 'Twas this kind of <hi>hardness</hi> also
that both <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi>
were hardened with, after they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<hi>their great Transgressions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is the <hi>greatest</hi> kind of <hi>Hardness,</hi>
and hence they are said to be <hi>Harder
than a Rock,</hi> Jer. 5. 3. or than an <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi>
Zec. 7. 13. that is, <hi>harder than
Flint.</hi> So hard that nothing can enter.</p>
               <p>3. It is an <hi>Hardness</hi> given in much
anger, and that to bind the Soul up in
an impossibility of Repentance.</p>
               <p>4. It is an <hi>Hardness</hi> therefore which
is incurable, of which a Man must die
and be damned. <hi>Barren Professor, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Fourth <hi>Sign</hi> that such a Professor is
quite past Grace, is, when he fortifies his
hard Heart against the <hi>tenour</hi> of God's
Word, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 4, &amp;c. This is called
<hi>hardening themselves against God, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Spirit against him.</hi> As thus,
When after a Profession of Faith in the
Lord Jesus, and of the Doctrine that is
according to Godliness, they shall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46065:58"/>
themselves in courses of Sin, <hi>by
promising themselves that they shall have
Life and Salvation notwithstanding. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Professor,</hi> hearken to this. This Man
is called, (Deut. 29. 18.) <hi>A Root that
beareth Gall and Wormwood, or a poisonful
Herb,</hi> such an one as is abominated of
God; yea the abhorred of his Soul. For
this Man saith, v. 19, <hi>I shall have peace,
though I walk in the imagination or stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness
of my Heart, to add drunkeness to
thirst;</hi> an opinion flat against the whole
Word of God, yea against the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God himself. Wherefore he
adds, Deut. 19. 20. <hi>Then the Anger of the
Lord, and his jealousy shall smoak against
that Man; and all the Curses that are
written in God's Book shall lie upon him, and
God shall blot out his Name from under
Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea, that Man shall not fail to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
destroyed, saith the Text,</hi> 21.
vers. The Lord shall separate that Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
evil, out of all the Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               <p>
                  <hi>He shall separate him unto Evil;</hi> He
shall give him up, he shall leave him to
his Heart; he shall separate him to <hi>that,</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:46065:58"/>
or <hi>those</hi> that will assuredly be too hard
for him.</p>
               <p>Now this Judgment is much effected,
when God hath given a Man up unto
<hi>Satan,</hi> and hath given <hi>Satan</hi> leave, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fail,</hi> to compleat his destruction. I
say, <hi>When God hath given Satan leave ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
to compleat his destruction:</hi> For all
that are delivered up unto Satan, have
not, nor do not come to this End. But
<hi>that</hi> is the Man, whom God shall <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
to Evil, and shall <hi>leave</hi> in the Hands
of <hi>Satan,</hi> to <hi>compleat,</hi> without fall, his
Destruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus he served</hi> Ahab, <hi>a Man,</hi> that
fold himself to work wickedness in the sight
of the Lord, 1 <hi>Kin. 21.</hi> 25. And the Lord
said, Who shall perswade <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he
may go up, and fall at <hi>Ramoth-Gilead?</hi>
And on said on this manner, and another
said on that manner: And there came forth
a Spirit, and stood before the Lord, and
said, I will perswade him. 1 <hi>Kin. 22. 20,
21,</hi> 22. And the Lord said unto him, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with?
And he said, I will go forth, and
be a lying Spirit in the mouth of all his
Prophets. And he said, Thou shalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him, and prevail also, go forth, and
do so. <hi>Thou shalt perswade him</hi> and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46065:59"/>
prevail, <hi>do thy Will, I leave him in thy
Hand,</hi> Go forth, and do so.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in these Judgments, the
Lord doth much concern himself for
the management thereof, because of the
Provocation wherewith they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
him. This is the Man, <hi>whose Ruine
contriveth, and bringeth to pass by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance.
I will chuse their delusions for
them; I will bring their fears upon them,</hi>
Isa. 66. 4. I will chuse their <hi>Devices,</hi> or
the Wickednesses that their Hearts are
contriving of. I even I, will cause
them to be accepted of, and delightful
to them. But who are they that must
thus be feared? Why, those among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
that have chosen <hi>their own Ways,
those whose Soul delighteth in their Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Because they received not the Love of the
Truth, that they might be saved; for this
cause God shall send them strong Delusions,
that they should believe a Lye, that they
all might be damned, who believed not the
Truth, but had pleasure in Vnrighteousness.</p>
               <p>God shall send them.] <hi>It is a great word;
Yea,</hi> God shall send them strong Delusions;
<hi>Delusions that shall do, that shall make
them believe a Lye. Why so?</hi> That
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46065:59"/>
they all might be damned, every one of them,
who believe not the Truth, but had pleasure
in Vnrighteousness. 2 <hi>Thess. 5, 10, 11,
12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is nothing more provoking to
the Lord, than for a Man to promise,
when God threatneth; for a Man to be
light of conceit, that he shall be safe;
and yet to be more wicked than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
days: This Man's Soul abhorreth
the Truth of God, no marvel therefore
if God's Soul abhorreth him: he hath
invented a way contrary to God, to
bring about his own Salvation; no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
therefore, if God invent a way to
bring about this Man's Damnation: And
seeing that these Rebels are at this point,
We shall have peace; God will see whose
Word shall stand, His or theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Fifth <hi>Sign</hi> of a Man being past Grace,
is, When he shall at <hi>this,</hi> scoff, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<hi>grin,</hi> and fret against the Lord,
secretly purposing to continue his course,
and put all to the venture, despising the
Messengers of the Lord. <hi>He that despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
Moses'<hi>s Law, died without Mercy; of
how much sorer Punishment suppose ye, shall
he be thought worthy, who hath troden
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46065:60"/>
under foot the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 10. 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore, against these Despisers</hi>
God hath set himself, <hi>and foretold, that
they</hi> shall <hi>not believe, but perish.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
ye Despisers, and wonder, and perish;
for I work a work in your days, which
ye shall in no wise believe, though a Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it unto you. <hi>Acts 13.</hi> 41.</p>

               <p>Thus far we have treated of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren

<hi>but they must miserably perish.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

turns the <hi>Barren Fig-tree</hi> over to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice

               <p>Two things are here to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>1. The Executioner, <hi>Thou,</hi> the great,
the dreadful, the eternal God. These
words therefore, as I have already said,
signify that Christ the Mediator, through
whom alone Salvation comes, and by
whom alone Execution hath been defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>Now giveth up the Soul,</hi> forbears to
speak one <hi>Syllable</hi> more for him, or to
do the least Act of Grace further, to try
for his Recovery; but delivereth him up
to that fearful Dispensation, <hi>To fall into
the hand of the living God,</hi> Heb. 10.
31.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Second</hi> to be considered, is,
<hi>The Instrument by which this Execution is
done,</hi> and that is <hi>Death,</hi> compared here
to an <hi>Ax;</hi> and forasmuch as the Tree
is not felled at one Blow, therefore the
strokes are here continued, till all the

                     </gap>g</hi> must be his
Portion, till he be cut down. <hi>After that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46065:61"/>
thou shalt cut it down.]</hi> Death, I say, is the
<hi>Ax,</hi> which God often useth, therewith
to take the <hi>Barren Fig-tree</hi> out of the
Vineyard, out of a Profession, <hi>and also
out of the World at once.</hi> But this <hi>Ax</hi> is
now new-ground, it cometh well-edged
to the Roots of this <hi>Barren Fig-tree.</hi> It
hath been whetted by Sin, by the Law,
and by a <hi>formal</hi> Profession, and therefore
must, and will make deep gashes, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the natural life, but in the Heart
and Conscience also of this Professor.
<hi>The wages of Sin is Death, the sting of
Death is Sin,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. Wherefore
Death comes not to this Man as he doth
to Saints, <hi>muzzled,</hi> or without his Sting,
but with open Mouth, in all his strength;
yea, he sends <hi>his First born,</hi> which is
guilt, <hi>to devour his strength, and to bring
him to the King of Terrors,</hi> Job 18. 13,
14.</p>
               <p>But to give you, in a few <hi>Particulars,</hi>
the manner of this Man's dying.</p>
               <p>1. Now he hath his fruitless <hi>Fruits</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguer
him round his Bed, together with
all the <hi>Bands</hi> and <hi>Legions</hi> of his other
wickedness. <hi>His own Iniquities shall take
the wicked himself, and he shall be holden in
the Cords of his Sins,</hi> Prov. 5. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:46065:61"/>
2. Now some terrible discovery of
God is made out unto him, to the
perplexing and terrifying of his guilty
Conscience, <hi>God shall cast upon him, and
not spare; and he shall be afraid of that
which is high,</hi> Job. 27. 22.</p>
               <p>3. The dark Entry he is to go thro,
will be a sore amazement to him; <hi>For
fear shall be in the way,</hi> Eccl. 12. 5. yea
Terrors will take hold on him, when he
shall see the <hi>yawning</hi> Jaws of Death to
gape upon him, and the Doors of the
Shadow of Death open to give him pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
out of the World. Now who will
meet me in this dark Entry; how shall I
pass through this dark Entry into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World!</p>
               <p>4. For by reason of Guilt, and a
shaking Conscience, <hi>His Life will hang in
continual doubt before him, and he shall be
afraid day and night,</hi> Deut. 28. 66, 67.
and shall have no assurance of his Life.</p>
               <p>5. Now also <hi>Want</hi> will come up
against him, he will come up <hi>like an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Man.</hi> This is a terrible Army to
him that is graceless in Heart, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in Life. This <hi>Want</hi> will continually
cry in thine Ears, here is a New Birth
<hi>wanting,</hi> a <hi>new</hi> Heart, and a <hi>new</hi> Spirit
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46065:62"/>
                  <hi>wanting;</hi> here is Faith <hi>wanting;</hi> here is
Love and Repentance <hi>wanting;</hi> here is
the Fear of God <hi>wanting,</hi> and a good
Conversation <hi>wanting; Thou art weighed
in the Ballance, and art found wanting.</hi>
Dan. 5. 27.</p>
               <p>6. Together with these, standeth by
<hi>the companions of Death;</hi> Death and Hell,
Death and Devils, Death and endless
Torment in the everlasting flames of
devouring Fire. <hi>When God shall come
up unto the people, he will invade them with
his Troops.</hi> Hab. 3. 16.</p>
               <p>But how will this Man die? Can
his Heart <hi>now</hi> endure, or <hi>can his Hands
be strong?</hi> Ezek. 22. 14.</p>
               <p>1. God, and Christ, and Pity <hi>have left
him:</hi> Sin against Light, against Mercy,
and the Long-suffering of God, <hi>is come
up against him;</hi> his Hope and Confidence
<hi>now lie a dying by him,</hi> and his Conscience
<hi>totters and shakes</hi> continually within him.</p>
               <p>2. Death is at his work, <hi>Cutting of him
down,</hi> hewing both Bark and Heart, both
Body and Soul assunder; The Man
groans, but Death hears him not: He
looks gastly, carefully, dejectedly; he
sighs, he sweats, he trembles, but Death
matters nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:46065:62"/>
3. Fearful <hi>Cogitations</hi> haunt him, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings,
direful apprehensions of God
terrify him. Now he hath time to
think what the loss of Heaven will be,
and what the torments of Hell will be;
now he looks no way but he is frighted.</p>
               <p>4. Now would he live, but may not;
he would live, though it were but the
life of a Bed-rid Man, but must not.
He that cuts him down, sways him, as
the Feller of Wood, <hi>sways the tottering
Tree;</hi> now this way, then that, at last
a Root breaks, an Heart-string, an Eye-string
snaps assunder.</p>
               <p>5. And now, could the Soul be <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated</hi>
or brought to nothing, how
happy would it count it self; but it sees
that may not be. Wherefore it is put
to a wonderful strait: stay in the Body
it may not, go out of the Body it dares
not. <hi>Life</hi> is going, the <hi>Blood</hi> settles in
the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Lungs</hi> being no more
able to draw Breath through the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils,
at last out goes the weary tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Soul, who is immediatly seized by
Devils, who lay lurking in every hole in
the Chamber for that very purpose:
His Friends take care of the Body, wrap
it up in the <hi>Sheet</hi> or <hi>Coffin;</hi> but the Soul is
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46065:63"/>
out of their thought and reach, going
down to the Chambers of Death.</p>
               <p>I had thought to have enlarged, but
I forbear: God, who teaches Man to
profit, bless this brief and plain Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to thy Soul, who yet standest a
Professor in the Land of the Living,
among the Trees of his Garden. <hi>Amen.</hi>

EXHORTATION
TO
PEACE and UNITY.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Ephes. 4. 3.</bibl>
               <q>Indeavouring to keep the Vnity of the
Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>BEloved, Religion is the great Bond
of humane Society; and it were
well if it self were kept within
the Bond of Unity; and that it
may so be, let us, according to the Text,
use our utmost endeavors <hi>to keep the Vnity
of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:46065:64"/>
These words contain a Counsel and a
Caution: the Counsel is, <hi>That we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Vnity of the Spirit;</hi> the Caution
is, <hi>That we do it in the Bond of Peace:</hi> as
if he should say, I would have you live in
Unity, but yet I would have you to be
careful, that you do not purchase Unity
with the breach of Charity.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore be cautioned that we
do not so press after Unity in Practice
and Opinion, as to break the Bond of
Peace and Affection.</p>
            <p>In the handling of these words, I shall
observe this method;</p>
            <p>First, I shall open the Sense of the
Text.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I shall shew wherein this
Unity and Peace consists.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I shall shew you the Fruits
and Benefits of it, together with nine
Inconveniencies and Mischiefs that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
those Churches where Unity and
Peace is wanting.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and lastly, I shall give you
twelve Directions and Motives for the
obtaining of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:46065:64"/>
First, As touching the Sense of the
Text; when we are counselled to keep
the Unity of the Spirit, we are not to
understand the Spirit of God, as perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
so considered; because the Spirit
of God in that sense, is not capable
of being divided; and so there would
be no need for us to endeavor to keep the
Unity of it.</p>
            <p>By the Unity of the Spirit then, we
are to understand, that Unity of Mind
which the Spirit of God calls for, and
requires Christians to endeavor after;
hence it is that we are exhorted, by <hi>one
Spirit, with one Mind, to strive together
for the Faith of the Gospel,</hi> Phil. 1. 27.</p>
            <p>But farther; the Apostle in these words
alludes to the state and composition of a
Natural Body, and doth thereby inform
us, that the Mystical Body of Christ
holds an Analogy with the Natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of a Man: As first, In the Natural
Body there must be a Spirit to animate it,
for the Body without the Spirit is dead,
<hi>James 2.</hi> 26. So it is in the Mystical Body
of Christ; the Apostle no sooner tells
us of that one Body, but he minds us of
that one Spirit, <hi>Eph. 4.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Body hath Joints and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46065:65"/>
Bands to unite all the parts; so hath the
Mystical Body of Christ, <hi>Col. 2.</hi> 19.
This is that Bond of Peace mentioned in
the Text, as also in the <hi>16th</hi> Verse of
the same Chapter, where the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is said to be fitly joyned together, and
compacted, by that which every Joynt
supplieth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Natural Body receives
Counsel and Nourishment from the
Head; so doth the Mystical Body of
Christ, he is their Counsellor, and him
they must hear; he is their Head, and
him they must hold; hence it is that
the Apostle complaineth, <hi>Col. 2.</hi> 19. of
some that did not hold the Head from
which the whole Body by Joynts and
Bands hath Nourishment.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Natural Body cannot
well subsist if either the Spirit be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or the Joints broken or dislocated;
the Body cannot bear a Wound or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Spirit; <hi>A broken Spirit dryeth the
Bones,</hi> Prov. 17. 22. <hi>And a wounded Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
who can bear?</hi> Prov. 18. 14. And on
the other hand, how often have the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyinting
of the Body, and the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
thereof, occasioned the expiration
of the Spirit? In like manner it fares
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46065:65"/>
with the Mystical Body of Christ, how
do divided Spirits break the Bonds of
Peace, which are the Joynts of this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
And how doth the breakings of the
Body and Church of Christ, wound the
Spirit of Christians, and oftentimes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
the Spirit and Life of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to languish, if not to expire? How
needful is it then that we endeavour <hi>the
Vnity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now come to shew you wherein this
Unity and Peace consists, and this I shall
demonstrate in five particulars.</p>
            <p>1. This Unity and Peace may consist
in the ignorance of many Truths, and
in the holding of some Errors; or else
this Duty of Peace and Unity could not
be practicable by any on this side Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
but we must now endeavour the
Unity of the Spirit, till we come to the
Unity of the Faith, and of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the Son of God, <hi>Ephes. 4.</hi> 13.
Because now (as the Apostle saith) we
know in part, and we prophesy in part,
and now we see through a Glass darkly,
1 <hi>Cor. 13.</hi> 12. And as this is true in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
so we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind it true if we descend
to particular Instances; the Disciples
seem to be ignorant of that great Truth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46065:66"/>
which they had often, and in much
plainness been taught by their Master
once and again <hi>(viz.)</hi> That his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
was not of this World, and that in
the World they should suffer, and be
persecuted; yet in the first of the <hi>Acts,
ver.</hi> 6. we read, That they asked of him
if he would at this time restore the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to <hi>Israel?</hi> thereby discovering that
Christ's Kingdom (as they thought)
should consist in his Temporal Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over <hi>Israel,</hi> which they expected
should now commence and take place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them. Again, Our Lord tells
them, that he had many things to
say (and these were many important
Truths) which they could not now bear,
<hi>John 16.</hi> 12. And that these were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Truths, appears by the 10th and
11th Verses, where he is discoursing of
<hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> and then
adds, that he had yet many things to say,
which they could not bear; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
promises the Comforter to lead
them into ALL TRUTH; which
implies, that they were yet ignorant of
many Truths, and consequently held di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Errors; and yet for all this he prays
for, and presses them to their great Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46065:66"/>
of Peace and Unity, <hi>John<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.</hi> 27. and
17. 21. To this may be added that of
<hi>Heb. 5.</hi> 11. where the Author saith, He
had many things to say of the Priestly
Office of Christ, which by reason of
their dulness, they were not capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
as also that in the 10th of the
<hi>Acts,</hi> where <hi>Peter</hi> seems to be ignorant
of that Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Gospel
was to be preached to all Nations; and
contrary hereunto, he erred in thinking
it unlawful to Preach amongst the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
I shall add two Texts more, one
is <hi>Acts</hi> 19. where we read, That those
Disciples which had been discipled and
baptized by <hi>John,</hi> were yet ignorant of
the Holy Ghost, and knew not (as the
Text tells us) whether there were any
Holy Ghost or no; though <hi>John</hi> did
teach constantly, That he that should
come after him, should baptize with the
Holy Ghost and Fire. From hence we
may easily and plainly infer, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
may be ignorant of many Truths,
by reason of weak and dull Capacities,
and other such-like Impediments, even
while those Truths are with much plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
delivered to them. Again, We
read, <hi>Heb. 5.</hi> 13. of some that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46065:67"/>
in the Word of Righteousness,
who nevertheless are call'd Babes in
Christ, and with whom Unity and Peace
is to be inviolably kept and maintained.</p>
            <p>2. As this Unity and Peace may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in the ignorance of many Truths,
and in the holding some Errors, so it
must consist with (and it cannot consist
without) the believing and practising
those things which are necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Church-Communion; and they
are, First, Believing that Christ the Son
of God died for the Sins of Men. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
That whoever believed, ought
to be baptized: The third thing essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to this Communion, is a holy and a
blameless Conversation.</p>
            <p>First, That believing that the Son of
God died for the Sins of Men, is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Salvation, I prove by these Texts,
which tell us, that he that doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
shall be damned, <hi>Mark 16. 16.
John 3. 36. Rom. 10.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>That it is also necessary to Church-Communion,
appears from <hi>Mat. 16. 16,
17, 18. Peter</hi> having confest that Christ
was the Son of the Living God, Christ
thereupon assures <hi>Peter,</hi> that upon this
Rock, <hi>viz.</hi> this Profession of Faith, or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46065:67"/>
this Christ which <hi>Peter</hi> had confest, he
would Build his Church, and the Gates
of Hell should not prevail against it. And
1 <hi>Cor. 3.</hi> 11. The Apostle having told
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> they were God's Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
presently adds, that they could not
be built upon any Foundation but upon
that which was laid, which was Jesus
Christ. All which proves, that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Society is founded upon the profession
of Christ; and not only Scripture, but
the Laws of Right-reason dictate this,
that some Rules and Orders must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for the founding all Society,
which must be consented to by all that
will be of it. Hence it comes to pass,
that to own Christ as the Lord and Head
of Christians, is essential to the founding
Christian Society.</p>
            <p>Secondly; The Scriptures have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that this Faith gives the Professors of
it a right to Baptism, as in the case of
the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. when he demanded
why he might not be baptized? <hi>Philip</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth,
<hi>That if he believed with all his
heart, he might;</hi> the Eunuch thereupon
confessing Christ, was baptized.</p>
            <p>Now that Baptism is essential to
Church-Communion, I prove from
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46065:68"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. where we shall find the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
labouring to prevent an evil use that
might be made of Spiritual Gifts, as
thereby to be puft up; and to think that
such as wanted them, were not of the
Body, or to be esteemed Members; he
thereupon resolves, that whoever did
confess Christ, and own him for his
Head, did it by the Spirit, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. though
they might not have such a visible mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of it as others had, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ought to be owned as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
as appears, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because they have called him Lord by
the Spirit, but because they have by the
guidance and direction of the same Spirit
been baptized, <hi>ver. 13. For by one Spirit
we are all baptized into one Body,</hi> &amp;c. I
need not go about to confute that Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that some of late have had of this
Text, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Baptism here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, is the Baptism of the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you have not owned and declared
that Notion as your Judgment, but on
the contrary. All of you that I have
ever conversed with, have declared it to
be understood of Baptism with Water,
by the direction of the Spirit: if so,
then it follows, that Men and Women
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46065:68"/>
are declared Members of Christ's Body
by Baptism, and cannot be by Scripture
reputed and esteemed so without it;
which farther appears from <hi>Rom. 6.</hi> 5.
where Men by Baptism are said to be
planted into the likeness of his Death;
and <hi>Col. 2.</hi> 12. We are said to be buried
with him by Baptism; all which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the consent of all Christians,
(some few in these late times excepted)
do prove that Baptism is necessary to the
initiating Persons into the Church of
Christ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Holiness of Life is essential
to Church-Communion, because it seems
to be the reason why Christ founded a
Church in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> that Men
might thereby be watched over, and
kept from falling; and that if any be
overtaken with a Fault, he that is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
might restore him.</p>
            <p>That by this means Men and Women
might be preserved without blame to the
coming of Christ, and the <hi>Grace of God
teacheth us to deny Vngodliness and Worldly
Lusts, and to live soberly and uprightly in
this present evil World,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12.
<hi>And let every one that names the Name of
the Lord, depart from Iniquity,</hi> Tim. 2. 19.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46065:69"/>
And <hi>James</hi> tells us, (speaking of the
Christian Religion) <hi>That pure Religion
and undefiled before God, is to visit the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless
and Widows in their Affliction, and
to keep our selves unspotted from the World,</hi>
James 1. 27. From all which (together
with many more Texts that might be
produced) it appears, that an unholy
and prophane Life, is inconsistant with
Christian Religion and Society. And
that Holiness is essential to Salvation and
Church-Communion; so that these three
things, Faith, Baptism, and a Holy Life,
as I said before, all Churches must agree
and unite in, as those things, which
when wanting, will destroy their being;
And let not any think, that when I say,
believing the Son of God died for the
Sins of Men, is essential to Salvation and
Church-Communion, that I hereby
would exclude all other Articles of the
Christian Creed, as not necessary, as the
belief of the Resurrection of the Dead,
and eternal Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which for
want of time, I omit to speak particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to, and the rather, because I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this great Article of believing the
Son of God died for the Sins of Men, is
comprehensive of all others, and is that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46065:69"/>
from whence all other Articles may easily
be inferred.</p>
            <p>And here I would not be mistaken, as
though I held there were nothing else
for Christians to practise, when I say
this is all that is requisite to Church-Communion;
for I very well know that
Christ requires many other things of us,
after we are Members of his Body, which
if we knowingly or maliciously refuse,
may be the cause, not only of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
but Damnation: But yet
these are such things as relate to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being,
and not to the being of Churches;
as laying on of Hands in the Primitive
Times upon Believers, by which they
did receive the Gifts of the Spirit; this
(I say) was for the increase and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Body, and not that thereby
they might become of the Body of
Christ, for that they were before: And
do not think that I believe laying on of
Hands was no Apostolical Institution,
because I say Men are not thereby made
Members of Christ's Body, or because I
say that it is not essential to Church-Communion:
Why should I be thought
to be against a Fire in the Chimney,
because I say it must not be in the Thatch
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46065:70"/>
of the House? Consider then how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
a thing it is to make every Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
(though true) the bound of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
this is that which destroys Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and by this Rule all Men must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
before they can be in Peace: For
do we not see daily, that as soon as Men
come to a clearer understanding the
Mind of God (to say the best of what
they hold) that presently all Men are
Excommunicable, if not Damnable, that
do not agree with them; do not some
believe and see, that to be Pride and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,
which others do not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(it may be) they have more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
and diligently searched into their
Duty of these things than others have<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
what then? Must all Men that have not
so large acquaintance of their Duty
herein be Excommunicated? Indeed it
were to be wished that more moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Apparel and Secular Concernments
were found among Churches; but God
forbid, that if they should come short
herein, that we should say, as one lately
said, That he could not Communicate
with such a People, because they were
proud and superfluous in their Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:46065:70"/>
Let me appeal to such, and demand
of them if there was not a time since
they believed and were baptized, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they did not believe laying on of
Hands a Duty? and did they not then
believe, and do they not still believe they
were Members of the Body of Christ?
And was not there a time when you did
not so well understand the nature and
extent of Pride and Covetousness as
now you do? And did you not then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and do you not still believe that you
were true Members of Christ, though less
perfect? Why then should you not judg
of those that differ from you herein, as
you judged of your selves when you were
as they now are? How needful then is it
for Christians to distinguish (if ever they
would be at <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity)</hi> between
those truths which are essential to Church-Communion,
and those that are not?</p>
            <p>Thirdly; <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> consists in
our making one Shoulder to practise and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut in execution the things we do know.
Phil. 3. 16. <hi>Nevertheless wherein we have
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ained, let us walk by the same Rule, let
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> mind the same things.</hi> How sad is it to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> our Zeal consume us, and our preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Time, in things doubtful and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46065:71"/>
while we are not concerned, nor
affected with the practice of those indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputable
things we all agree in? We all
know Charity to be the great Command,
and yet how few agree to practise it?
We all know they that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> labour in the
Word and Doctrine, are worthy of
double Honour; and that God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
that they which Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
should live of the Gospel; these
Duties, however others have cavil'd at
them, I know you agree in them, and
are persuaded of your Duty herein; but
where's your Zeal to practise? O how
well would it be with Churches, if they
were but half as zealous for the great
and plain, and indisputable Things, and
the more chargeable and costly Things
of Religion, as they are for Things
doubtful or less necessary, or for Things
that are no charge to them, and cos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
them nothing but the breath of Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though that may be too great a
price for the small things they purchase
with it.</p>
            <p>But further; Do we not all agree, that
Men that preach the Gospel, should do
it like Workmen that need not be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?
and yet how little is this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46065:71"/>
by many Preachers, who never
consider before they speak of what they
say, or whereof they affirm? How few
give themselves to study, that they may
be approved? How few meditate and
give themselves to these things, that
their profiting may appear to all?</p>
            <p>For the Lord's sake let us unite to
practise those things we know; and if
we would have more Talents, let us all
agree to improve those we have.</p>
            <p>See the Spirit that was among the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Professors, that knowing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
how much it concerned them in
the propagating of Christianity, to shew
forth Love to one another (that so all
might know them to be Christ's Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples)
rather than there should be any
complainings among them, they sold all
they had: Oh how zealous were these
to practice, and with one Shoulder to
do that that was upon their Hearts for
God! I might further add, how often
have we agreed in our Judgment? and
hath it not been upon our Hearts, that
this and the other Thing is good to be
done, to enlighten the dark World, and
to repair the breaches of Churches,
and to raise up those Churches that now
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46065:72"/>
lie a gasping, and among whom the Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of Religion is expiring? But what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
we more than talk of them? Do no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
most decline these things, when they
either call for their Purses, or their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to help in this and such-like Work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
as these? Let us then, in what we know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
unite, that we may put it in practice
remembring, that if we know these
things, we shall be happy if we d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly; This Unity and Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in our joyning and agreeing to pray
for, and to press after those Truths we
do not know. The Disciples in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Times, were conscious of their
Imperfections, and therefore they with
one accord continued in Prayer and
Supplications: If we were more in the
sence of our own Ignorances and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
we should carry it better to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
those that differ from us, then we
should abound more in the Spirit of
Meekness and Forbearance, that thereby
we might bring others (or be brought by
others) to the knowledg of the Truth;
this would make us go to God, and say
with <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 34. 32. <hi>That which we
know not, teach thou us.</hi> Brethren, did
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46065:72"/>
we but all agree that we were erring in
many things, we should soon agree to
go to God, and pray for more Wisdom
and Revelation of his Mind and Will
concerning us.</p>
            <p>But here's our misery, that we no
sooner receive any thing for Truth, but
we presently ascend the Chair of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
with it, as though in this we could
not err: Hence it is we are impatient of
contradiction, and become uncharitable
to those that are not of the same Mind;
but now a consciousness that we may
mistake, or that if my Brother err in
one thing, I may err in another, this
will unite us in Affection, and engage us
to press after Perfection, according to
that of the Apostle, <hi>Phil. 3. 13, 14, 15.
Brethren, I count not my self to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended:
but this one thing I do, forgetting
those things that are behind, and reaching
forth to those things which are before, I
press towards the Mark, for the prize of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>igh Calling of God in Christ Jesus. And
if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God
shall reveal even this unto you.</hi> O then
that we could but unite and agree to go
to God for one another, in confidence
that he will teach us; and that if any
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46065:73"/>
of us want Wisdom (as who of us does
not) we might agree to ask of God,
who giveth to all Men liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth
no Man. Let us, like those
people spoken of in the second of <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
say one to another, Come, let us go to
the Lord, for <hi>he will teach us of his Ways,
and we will walk in his Paths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly; This Unity and Peace main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consists in Unity of Love and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
this is the great and indispensible
Duty of all Christians, by this they are
declared Christ's Disciples: And hence
it is that Love is called the Great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
the Old Commandment, and
the New Commandment; that which
was commanded in the beginning, and
will remain to the end, yea and after the
end. 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 8. Charity never fails;
but whether there be Tongues, they shall
cease; or whether there be Knowledg, it
shall vanish away.</hi> And, <hi>verse 13. And
now abideth Faith, Hope and Charity; but
the greatest of these is Charity.</hi> And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Col. 3. 14. Above all these things put on
Charity, which is the Bond of Perfectness.</hi>
Because <hi>Charity is the end of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
1 Tim. 1. 5. Charity is therefore
called <hi>the Royal Law;</hi> and though it had a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46065:73"/>
superintendency over other Laws, and
doubtless is a Law to which other Laws
must give place, when they come in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with it; <hi>Above all things therefore
have fervent Charity among your selves,
for Charity covereth a multitude of Sins,</hi>
1 Pet. 4. 8. Let us therefore live in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Peace, and the God of Love and
Peace will be with us.</p>
            <p>That you may so do, let me remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you (in the words of a learned Man)
that the Unity of the Church, is a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Love and Affection, and not a
bare Uniformity of Practice and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Having shewn you wherein this Unity
consists, I now come to the third Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Thing propounded; and that is, to
shew you the Fruits and Benefits of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Peace; together with the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
and Inconveniences that attend
those Churches where Unity and Peace is
wanting.</p>
            <p>First, Unity and Peace is a Duty well-pleasing
to God, who is stiled the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of Peace, and not of Confusion in
all the Churches, God's Spirit rejoyceth
in the Unity of our Spirits; but on the
other hand, where Strife and Divisions
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46065:74"/>
are, there the Spirit of God is grieved.
Hence it is that the Apostle no sooner
calls upon the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> not to grieve
the Spirit of God, but he presently sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins
us a Remedy against that evil, <hi>That
they put away bitterness and evil-speaking.
And be kind one to another, and tender-hearted,
forgiving one another, even as
God for Christs sake hath forgiven them,</hi>
Eph. 4. 30, 32.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As Unity and Peace is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to God, and rejoiceth his Spirit, so
it rejoiceth the Hearts and Spirits of
God's People; Unity and Peace brings
Heaven down upon Earth among us:
Hence it is that the Apostle tells us, <hi>Rom.
4.</hi> 17. That <hi>the Kingdom of God is not
Meat and Drink, but Righteousness and
Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost.</hi> Where
Unity and Peace is, there is Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth; by this we taste the first Fruits
of that blessed Estate we shall one day
live in the fruition of; when we shall
come <hi>to the general Assembly and Church
of the First-born, whose Names are written
in Heaven, and to God the Judg of all,
and to the Spirits of just Men made perfect,</hi>
Heb. 12. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:46065:74"/>
This outward peace of the Church <hi>(as a
learned Man observes)</hi> disti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s into peace
of Conscience, and turns writings and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Controversy, into Treatises of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
and Devotion.</p>
            <p>And the Psalmist tells us, that it is not
only good, but pleasant for Brethren to
dwell together in Unity, <hi>Psal. 133.</hi> 1.
But where Unity and Peace is wanting,
there are Storms and Troubles; <hi>where
Envy and Strife is, there is confusio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and
every evil Work,</hi> Jam. 3. 16. It is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Peace of the Church that increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
our inward Joy; and the Peace of
God's House gives us occasion to eat our
meat with gladness in our own Houses,
<hi>Act. 2.</hi> 46.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Unity and Peace of the
Church makes Communion of Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable.
What is it that imbitters Church-Communion,
and makes it burdensom,
but Divisions? Have you not heard many
complain that they are weary of Church-Communion,
because of Church-Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
but now where Unity and Peace is,
there Christians long for Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> saith, that he was glad when
they said unto him, <hi>Let us go to the House
of God,</hi> Psal. 122. 1. Why was this, but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46065:75"/>
because (as the third verse tells us) <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
was a City compact together, where
the Tribes went up, the Tribes of the Lord,
to give thanks to his Name.</hi> And <hi>David</hi>
speaking of the Man that was once his
Friend, doth thereby let us know the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Peace and Unity, <hi>Psal. 55. 14.
We</hi> (saith he) <hi>took sweet counsel together,
and walked to the House of God in company.</hi>
Where Unity is strongest, Communion is
sweetest and most desirable. You see
then that Peace and Union fills the People
of God with desires after Communion:
But on the other hand, hear how <hi>David</hi>
complains, <hi>Psal. 120. Wo is me, I sojourn
in</hi> Mesech, <hi>and that I dwell in the tents of</hi>
Kedar. The Psalmist here is thought to
allude to a sort of Men that dwelt in
the deserts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> that got their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
by Contention; and therefore he
adds, <hi>ver. 6. That his Soul had long dwelt
with them that hated Peace.</hi> This was
that which made him long for the Courts
of God, and esteem one day in his
House better than a thousand; this made
his Soul even faint for the House of God,
because of the peace of it; <hi>Blessed are
they</hi> (saith he) <hi>that dwell in thy House,
they will be still praising thee.</hi> There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46065:75"/>
note of concord, as appears, <hi>Act.
2.</hi> where we read of Primitive Christians,
meeting with <hi>one accord, praising God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Where Unity and Peace is,
there many Mischiefs and Inconveniences
are prevented, which attends those People
where Peace and Unity is wanting:
And of those many that might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
I shall briefly insist upon these
nine.</p>
            <p>First, Where Unity and Peace is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
there is much precious time spent
to no purpose; How many Days are
spent, and how many fruitless Journeys
made to no profit, where the People are
not in peace? How often have many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
time (even in Seed-time and
Harvest) when they could scarce afford
it, to go to Church, and, by reason of
their Divisions, come home worse than
they went, repenting they have spent so
much precious time to so little benefit?
How sad is it to see Men spend their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
time, in which they should work
out their Salvation, by labouring, as in the
Fire, to prove an uncertain and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Proposition; and to trifle away their
time, in which they should make their
Calling and Election sure, to make sure
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46065:76"/>
of an Opinion, which when they have
done all, they are not infallibly sure
whether it be true or no, because all
things necessary to Salvation and Church-Communion
are plainly laid down in
Scripture, in which we may be infallibly
sure of the Truth of them; but for
other things that we have no plain Texts
for, but the Truth of them depends
upon our Interpretations, Here we must
be cautioned, that we do not spend much
time in imposing those upon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> others, or
venting those among others, unless we
can assume Infallibility, otherwise we
spend time upon uncertainty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
casts their Eyes abroad, and dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
open their Ears to intelligence, shall both
see, and to their sorrow hear, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Churches spend most of their time in
Jangling and Contending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about those
things, which are neither essentialy to
Salvation or Church-Communion, and
that which is worse, about such doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Questions which they are never able
to give an infallible solution of. But
now where Unity and Peace is, there, our
time is spent in praising God; and in
those great Questions, What we should
do to be saved? and how we may be more
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46065:76"/>
holy and more humble towards God, and
more charitable and more serviceable to
one another?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Where Unity and Peace is
wanting, there is evil surmizing, and
evil-speaking, to the damage and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
if not to the ruining of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<hi>Gal. 5. 14, 15. The whole Law is
fulfilled in one word, Thou shalt love thy
Neighbour as thy self: but if you bite and
devour one another, take heed you be not
consumed one of another.</hi> No sooner the
Bond of Charity is broken, which is as
a Wall about Christians, but soon they
begin to make havock and spoil of one
another; then there is raising evil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
and taking up evil Reports against
each other: Hence it is that whispering
and backbiting proceeds, and going from
House to House to blazon the Faults and
Infirmities of others; Hence it is that
we watch for the haltings of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and do inwardly rejoice at the
Miscarriages of others; saying, in our
Hearts, Ah, ah, so we would have it:
But now where Unity and Peace is, there
is Charity; and where Charity is, there
we are willing to hide the Faults, and
cover the nakedness of our Brethren;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46065:77"/>
               <hi>Charity thinketh no evil, 1 Cor. 13.</hi> 5. And
therefore it cannot surmize, neither will
it speak evil.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Where Unity and Peace is
wanting, there can be no great matters
enterprized, we cannot do much for
God, nor much for one another; when
the Devil would hinder the bringing to
pass of good in Nations and Churches,
he divides their Councils, (and as one
well observes) he divides their Heads,
that he may divide their Hands; when
<hi>Jacob</hi> had prophesied of the cruelty of
<hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> who were Brethren,
he threatens them with the consequent of
it, <hi>Gen. 49. 7. I will divide them in</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
<hi>and scatter them in Israel.</hi> The
Devil is not to learn that Maxim he hath
taught the Machavilians of the World,
<hi>divide &amp; impera,</hi> divide and rule, it is a
united force that's formidable: Hence
the Spouse in the <hi>Canticles</hi> is said to be
but one, and the only one of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Cant. 6.</hi> 9. Hereupon it is said of
her, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. That she is <hi>terrible as an
Army with Banners.</hi> What can a divided
Army do, or a disordered Army, that
have lost their Banners, or for fear or
shame thrown them away? In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46065:77"/>
what can Christians do for Christ,
and the enlarging his Dominions in the
World, in bringing Men from darkness
to light, while themselves are divided
and disordered? Peace is to Christians,
as great Rivers are to some Cities, which
(besides other Benefits and Commodities)
are natural Fortifications, by reason
whereof those places are made impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
but when, by the subtilty of an
Adversary, or the folly of the Citizens,
these Waters come to be divided into
little petty Rivulets, How soon are they
assailed and taken? Thus it fares with
Churches, when once the Devil or their
own folly divides them, they will be so
far from resisting of him, that they will
be soon subjected by him.</p>
            <p>Peace is to Churches as Walls to
Cities; nay, Unity hath defended Cities
that had no Walls; it was once demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of <hi>Ageslaus,</hi> why <hi>Lacedemon</hi> had no
Walls; he answers (pointing back to the
City) <hi>That the Concord of the Citizens was
the strength of the City.</hi> In like manner,
Christians are strong when united, then
they are more capable to resist tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to succour such as are tempted;
when Unity and Peace is among the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46065:78"/>
Churches, then are they like a Walled
Town; And when Peace is the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che's-Walls,
Salvation will be her Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us of one Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rus that had
80 Sons, whom he calls to him as he lay
upon his Death-bed, and gave them a
shea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Arrows, thereby to signify, that
if they lived in Unity, they might do
much, but if they divided, they would
come to nothing. If Christians were all
of one Piece, if they were all but one
Lump, or but one Sheaf or Bundle, how
great are the things they might do for
Christ and his People in the World,
whereas otherwise they can do little but
dishonour him, and offend his.</p>
            <p>It is reported of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> that
his strength is in his Scales, <hi>Job 41. 15,
16, 17. His Scales are his pride, shut up
together, as with a close Seal; one is so
near to another, that no Air can come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; they join together, they stick
together, they cannot be sundred.</hi> If the
Church of God were united like the
Scales of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> it would not be
every brain-sick Notion, nor angry Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
that would cause their separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:46065:78"/>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Two are better than one,</hi>
because if one fail, the other may raise
him; then surely twenty are better than
two, and an hundred are better than
twenty, for the same reason, because they
are more capable to help one another.
If ever Christians would do any thing to
raise up the fall'n Tabernacles of <hi>Jacob,</hi>
and to strengthen the weak, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the feeble, and to fetch back those
that have gone astray, it must be by
Unity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We read of the Men of</hi> Babel, <hi>Gen. 11.
6.</hi> The Lord said, Behold, the People are
one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now nothing will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
from them that they have imagined
to do.</p>
            <p>We learn by Reason what great things
may be done in worldly Atchievements
where Unity is: And shall not Reason
(assisted with the Motives of Religion)
teach us, that Unity among Christians
may enable them to enterprize greater
Things for Christ? would not this make
Satan fall from Heaven like Lightning?
For as Unity built literal <hi>Babel,</hi> it's Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that must pull down mystical <hi>Babel.</hi>
And on the other hand, where Divisions
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46065:79"/>
are, there is Confusion; by this means a
<hi>Babel</hi> hath been built in every Age. It
hath been observed by a Learned Man,
and I wish I could not say truly observed,
That there is most of <hi>Babel</hi> and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
among those that cry out most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it.</p>
            <p>Would we have a Hand to destroy
<hi>Babylon,</hi> let's have a Heart to unite one
among another.</p>
            <p>Our English Histories tell us, that after
<hi>Austin</hi> the Monk had been some time in
<hi>England,</hi> that he heard of some of the
Remains of the British Christians, which
he conven'd to a place, which <hi>Cambden</hi>
in his <hi>Britannia</hi> calls <hi>Austin's Oak;</hi> here
they met to consult about Matters of
Religion; but such was their Division,
by reason of <hi>Austin</hi>'s imposing Spirit,
that our Stories tell us, <hi>That Synod was
only famous for this, that they only met and
did Nothing.</hi> This is the mischief of
Divisions, they hinder the doing of much
good; and if Christians, that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
be ever famous for any thing, it
will be, that they have often met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and talked of this and the other
thing, but they did nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:46065:79"/>
Fourthly, Where Unity and Peace is
wanting, there the Weak are wounded,
and the Wicked are hardened: Unity
may well be compared to <hi>precious Oil,
Psal. 133.</hi> 2. It's the nature of Oil, to
heal that which is wounded, and to sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that which is hard. Those Men
that have hardened themselves against
God and his People, when they shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Unity and Peace among them, will
say, God is in them indeed. And on the
other hand, are they not ready to say,
when they see you divided, <hi>That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's
in you that you cannot agree?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Divisions, and want of Peace,
keep those out of the Church that would
come in; and cause many to go out that
are in.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Divisions of Christians (as a
Learned Man observes) are a Scandal
to the Jews, an Opprobrium to the
Gentiles, and an Inlet to Atheism and
Infidelity.</q> Insomuch that our Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
about Religion (especially as
they have been of late managed) have
made Religion it self become a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46065:80"/>
O then, how good and pleasant
a thing is it for Brethren to dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Unity! The Peace and Unity
that was among the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
drew others to them: What hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Conversion of the Jews, but the
Divisions of Christians? Must I be a
Christian, says the Jew; what Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
must I be, of what Sect must I be
of? The Jews (as one observes) glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
upon that Text in <hi>Isa. 11.</hi> 6. where
it is prophesied, <hi>That the Lion and the
Lamb shall lie down together, and that
there shall be none left to hurt nor destroy in
all God's Holy Mountain;</hi> they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
these Sayings, to signify the
Concord and Peace that shall be among
the People that shall own the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
do from hence conclude, that the <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
is not yet come, because of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and Divisions that are among
those that profess him. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith, 1 <hi>Cor. 14.</hi> 23. That if an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer
should see their Disorders, he
would say they were mad; but where
Unity and Peace is, there the Churches
are multiplyed; we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. that
when the Churches had rest, they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46065:80"/>
And, <hi>Act <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>2. 46, 47.</hi> when the
Church was serving God with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
<hi>the Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> added to them daily such
as should be saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Unity brings Men into the
Church, and Divisions keep them out.
It is reported of an Indian passing by
the House of a Christian, and hearing
them contending, being desired to turn
in, he refused, saying, <hi>Habamack</hi> dwells
there, meaning, that the Devil dwelt
there: but where Unity and Peace is,
there God is; and he that dwels in
Love, dwells in God. The Apostle
tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> That if they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
orderly, even the Unbeliever would
hereby be enforced to come and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and say, God was in them indeed.
And we read, <hi>Zech. 8.</hi> 23. of a Time
when ten Men shall take hold of a Jew,
and say, <hi>We will go with you, for we have
heard that God is with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is that Christ prays,
<hi>John 17. 21. That his Disciples might be
one, as the Father and he were one, that the
World might believe the Father sent him:</hi>
As if he should say, you may preach
me as long as you will, and to little
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46065:81"/>
purpose, if you are not at Peace and
Unity among your selves. Such was
the Unity of Christians in former days,
that the intelligent Heathen would say of
them, That though they had many Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
yet they had but one Soul: And
we read the same of them, <hi>Acts 4. 32.
That the multitude of them that believed
were of one Heart and one Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Learned <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
in his <hi>Irenicum;</hi> 
               <q>The Unity and
Peace that was then among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
made Religion amiable in the
Judgment of impartial Heathens:
Christians were then known by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity
and sweetness of their Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
by the candour and ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Spirits, by their mutual
Love, Forbearance, and Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to one another: But either this
is not the practice of Christianity,</q>
               <hi>(viz. a Duty that Christians are now bound
to observe)</hi> 
               <q>or else it is not calculated
for our Meridian, where the Spirits of
Men are of too high an elevation for
it; for if Pride and Uncharitableness,
if Divisions and Strifes, if Wrath and
Envy, if Animosities and Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46065:81"/>
were but the Marks of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
<hi>Diogenes</hi> need never light his
Lamp at noon to find out such among
us; but if a Spirit of Meekness, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness,
and Condescention; if a stoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Weaknesses and Infirmities
of one another, if pursuit after Peace,
when it flies from us, be the indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
Duties, and charactaristical Notes
of Christians, it may possibly prove a
difficult Inquest to find out such, for the
crouds of those that shelter themselves
under that glorious Name.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is the Unity and Peace of Churches
that brings others to them, and makes
Christianity amiable. What is prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
of the Church of the Jews, may in
this case be applied to the Gentile
Church, <hi>Isa. 66.</hi> 12. That when once
God extends Peace to her like a River,
the Gentiles shall come in like a flowing
Stream; then (and not till then) the
Glory of the Lord shall arise upon his
Churches, and his Glory shall be seen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them; then shall their Hearts fear
and be enlarged, because the abundance
of the Nations shall be converted to
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:46065:82"/>
Sixthly, As want of Unity and Peace
keeps those out of the Church that
would come in, so it hinder the growth
of those that are in. Jars and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Wranglings and Prejudices, eat
out the Growth, if not the Life of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
These are those Waters of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi>
that imbitter our Spirits, and quench
the Spirit of God. Unity and Peace
is said to be like the Dew of <hi>Hermon,</hi> and
as a Dew that descended upon <hi>Sion,</hi>
where the Lord commanded his Blessing,
<hi>Psal. 133.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Divisions run Religion into Briars
and Thorns, Contentio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and Parties.
Divisions are to Churches like Wars in
Countries: Where War is, the Ground
lieth waste and untill'd, none takes care
of it. It is Love that edifieth, but Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
pulleth down: Divisions are as
the North-east Wind to the Fruits,
which causeth them to dwindle away to
nothing; but when the Storms are over,
every thing begins to grow. When Men
are divided, they seldom speak the Truth
in Love; and then no marvel they grow
not up to him in all things, which is the
Head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:46065:82"/>
It is a sad presage of an approaching
Famine, (as one well observes) not of
Bread nor Water, but of hearing the
Word of God, when the thin Ears of
Corn, devour the plump full Ones;
when the lean Kine devour the fat Ones;
when our Controversies about doubtful
things, and things of less moment, eat
up our Zeal, for the more indisputable
and practical things in Religion; which
may give us cause to fear, that this will
be the Character by which our Age will
be known to Posterity, that it was the
Age that talked of Religion most, and
loved it least.</p>
            <p>Look upon those Churches where
Peace is, and there you shall find Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity:
When the Churches had rest,
they were not only multiplied, but walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Fear of the Lord, and the
Comforts of the Holy Ghost, they were
edified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is when the whole Body is
in it together, as with Joints and Bands,
that they increase with the Increase of
God.</p>
            <p>We are at a stand sometimes, why
there is so little growth among Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
why Men have been so long in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46065:83"/>
learning, and are yet so far from attaining
the knowledg of the Truth; some have
given one Reason, and some another;
some say Pride is the cause, and others
say Covetousness is the cause; I wish I
could say these were no causes: but I
observe, that when God entered his
Controversy with his People of old, he
mainly insisted upon some one Sin, as
Idolatry, and shedding Innocent Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as comprehensive of the rest; not
but that they were guilty of other Sins,
but those that were the most capital are
particularly insisted on; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
whoever would but take a review
of Churches that live in Contentions
and Divisions, may easily find that breach
of Unity and Charity is their capital
Sin, and the occasion of all other Sins.
No marvel then, that the Scripture saith,
the whole Law is fulfilled in Love; and
if so, then where Love is wanting, it
must needs follow, the whole Law is
broken. It is where Love grows cold;
that Sin abounds; and therefore the
want of Unity and Peace is the cause
of that leanness and barrenness that is
among us; it's true in Spirituals as well
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46065:83"/>
as Temporals, That Peace brings Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Seventhly; Where Unity and Peace is
wanting, our Prayers are hindered:
The Promise is, that what we shall agree
to ask, shall be given us of our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father: No marvel we pray and
pray, and yet are not answered, it is
because we are not agreed what to
have.</p>
            <p>It's reported, that the People in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonia,</hi>
coming to make Supplications
to their Idol God, some of them asked
for Rain, and others of them asked for
fair Weather: The Oracle returns them
this Answer, That they should go first
and agree among themselves: Would a
Heathen God refuse to answer such
Prayers, in which the Supplicants were
not agreed; and shall we think the True
God will answer them?</p>
            <p>We see then that Divisions hinder
our Prayers, and lay a prohibition on
our Sacrifice: If <hi>thou bring thy Gift to
the Altar,</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that thy Brother hath ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee, leave thy Gift, and go, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46065:84"/>
first be reconciled to thy Brother, and then
come and offer it:</hi> So that want of Unity
and Charity hinders even our particular
Prayers and Devotions.</p>
            <p>This hindred the Prayers and Fastings
of the People of old from finding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
<hi>Isa. 58.</hi> 3. The People ask
the Reason wherefore they: fasted, and
God did not see nor take notice of
them? He gives this Reason, because
they fasted for Strife and Debate, and
hid their Face from their own F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esh.
Again, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. the Lord saith, <hi>His
Hand was not shortned, that he could not
save; nor his Ear heavy that he could not
hear: but their Sins had separated between
their God and them.</hi> And among those
many Sins they stood chargeable with,
this was none of the least, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that
<hi>the way of Peace they had not known.</hi> You
see where Peace was wanting, Prayers
were hindred, both under the Old and
New Testament.</p>
            <p>The Sacrifice of the People in the
<hi>65th</hi> of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> that said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Stand farther
off, I am holier than thou, was as Smoke in
the Nostrils of the Lord.</hi> On the other
hand we read how acceptable those
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46065:84"/>
Prayers were that were made with one
accord, <hi>Acts 4.</hi> 24. compared with <hi>verse
31.</hi> they prayed with one accord, and
they were all of one Heart, and of one
Soul: and see the benefit of it, <hi>they
were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and
spoke the Word with all boldness:</hi> Which
was the very thing they prayed for, as
appears <hi>vers.</hi> 29. And the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
the Husband to dwell with his
Wife, that their <hi>Prayers</hi> might not be
hindred, 1 <hi>Pet. 3.</hi> 7. We see then, want
of Unity and Peace, either in Families
or Churches, is a hindrance of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>Eighthly; It is a dishonour and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
to Christ, that his Family
should be divided. When an Army falls
into Mutiny and Division, it reflects
disparagement on him that hath the
Conduct of it: In like manner the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
of Families are a dishonour to the
Heads, and those that govern them.
And if so, then how greatly do we
dishonour our Lord and Governour,
who gave his Body to be broken, to
keep his Church from breaking, who
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46065:85"/>
prayed for their Peace and Unity, and
left Peace at his departing from them
for a Legacy, even a Peace which
the World could not bestow upon
them.</p>
            <p>Ninthly; Where there is Peace and
Unity, there is a sympathy with each
other; that which is the want of one,
will be the want of all; Who is afflicted,
(saith the Apostle) and I burn not?
we should then <hi>remember them that are in
Bonds, as bound with them; and them
which suffer Adversity, as being our selves
also of the Body,</hi> Heb. 13. 3. But where
the Body is broken, or Men are not
reckoned or esteemed of the Body, no
marvel we are so little affected with
such as are afflicted: Where Divisions
are, that which is the Joy of the one, is
the Grief of another; but where Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Peace, and Charity abounds,
there we shall find Christians in Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them that mourn, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing
with them that rejoice; then they
will not envy the Prosperity of others,
nor secretly rejoice at the Miseries or
Miscarriages of any.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:46065:85"/>
Last of all; I now come to give you
Twelve Directions and Motives for the
obtaining Peace and Unity.</p>
            <p>First; If ever we would live in Peace
and Unity, we must pray for it. We are
required to seek <hi>Peace:</hi> Of whom then
can we seek it with expectation to find
it, but of him who is a God of <hi>Peace,</hi>
and hath promised to bless his People
with <hi>Peace?</hi> It is God that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to give his People one Heart, and
one Way; yet for all these things, he
will be sought unto: O then let us seek
<hi>Peace,</hi> and pray for <hi>Peace,</hi> because God
shall prosper them that love it.</p>
            <p>The Peace of Churches is that
which the Apostle prays for in all his
Epistles; in which his desire is, that
<hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> may be multiplied and
increased among them.</p>
            <p>Secondly; They that would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Peace of the Churches, must be
careful who they commit the care and
oversight of the Churches to; as, first,
(over and besides those Qualifications
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46065:86"/>
that should be in all Christians) they
that rule the Church of God, should be
Men of Counsel and Understanding;
where there is an ignorant Ministry,
there is commonly an ignorant People,
according as it was of old, <hi>Like Priest,
like People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How sad is it to see the Church of
God committed to the care of such that
pretend to be Teachers of others, that
understand not what they say, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they affirm: No marvel the Peace of
Churches is broken, when their Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
want skill to preserve their Unity,
which of all other Things is as the
Church's Walls; when they are divided,
no wonder they crumble to Attoms, if
there is no skilful Physician to heal them:
It's sad when there is no Balm in <hi>Gilead,</hi>
and when there is no Physician there.
Hence it is, that the Wounds of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
become incurable, like the Wounds
of God's People of old, either not
healed at all, or else slightly healed, and
to no purpose. May it not be said of
many Churches at this day, as God said
of the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> That <hi>he sought
for a Man among them that should stand
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46065:86"/>
in the Gap, and make up the Breach, but
he found none?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Remember what was said of old,
<hi>Mal. 2. 7. The Priest's Lips should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Knowledg; and the People should
seek the Law at his Mouth:</hi> But when this
is wanting, the People will be stumbling
and departing from God and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
therefore God complains, <hi>Hos.</hi>
4. 6. That <hi>his People were destroyed for
want of Knowledg;</hi> that is, for want of
knowing Guides; for if the Light that
is in them that teach, be Darkness, how
great is that Darkness? And if the
Blind lead the Blind, no marvel both
fall into the Ditch.</p>
            <p>How many are there that take upon
them to teach others, that had need be
taught in the beginning of Religion;
that instead of multiplying Knowledg,
multiply Words without Knowledg;
and instead of making known God's
Counsel, darken Counsel by Words
without Knowledg? The Apostle speaks
of some that did more than darken
Counsel, for they wrested the Counsel
of God; 2 Pet. 3. 16. <hi>In</hi> Paul'<hi>s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
(saith he) <hi>are some things hard to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46065:87"/>
be understood, which they that are unlearned
and unstable wrest, as they do also the other
Scriptures, to their own destruction.</hi> Some
things in the Scripture are hard to be
known, and they are made harder by
such unlearned Teachers, as utter their
own Notions by Words without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
            <p>None are more bold and adventurous
to take upon them to expound the dark
Mysteries and Sayings of the Prophets
and Revelations, and the <hi>9th</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
which I believe contains some of
those many things which in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
<hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>were hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</hi>
I say, none are more forward to
dig in these Mines, than those that can
hardly give a sound Reason for the first
Principles of Religion; and such as are
ignorant of many more weighty things,
that are easily to be seen in the Face and
Superficies of the Scripture; nothing
will serve these but swimming in the
Deeps, when they have not yet learned
to wade through the Shallows of the
Scriptures: Like the Gnosticks of old,
who thought they knew all Things,
though they knew nothing as they ought
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46065:87"/>
to know. And as those Gnosticks did
of old, so do such Teachers of late
break the Unity and Peace of Churches.
How needful then is it, that if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the Peace of Churches, that we
chuse out Men of Knowledg, who may
be able to keep them from being shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
and scattered with every Wind
of Doctrine: And who may be able
to convince and stop the Mouths of Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers?</p>
            <p>Secondly; You must not only chuse
Men of Counsel; but if you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
the Unity and Peace of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
you must chuse Men of courage
to govern them; for as there must be
Wisdom to bear with some, so there
must be Courage to correct others; as
some must be instructed meekly, so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
must be rebuked sharply, that
they may be sound in the Faith; there
must be Wisdom to rebuke some with
long-suffering, and there must be Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to suppress and stop the Mouths of
others. The Apostle tells <hi>Titus</hi> of some
whose Mouths must be stop'd, or else
they would subvert whole Houses, <hi>Tit.</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:46065:88"/>
1. 11. Where this Courage hath been
wanting, not only whole Houses, but
whole Churches have been subverted.
And <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Galatians,</hi> That <hi>when
he saw some endeavour to bring the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
into Bondage, that he did not give place
to them, no not for an hour,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal. 2.
5.</hi> If this course had been taken by the
Rulers of Churches, their Peace had not
been so often invaded by unruly and
vain Talkers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; In chusing Men to rule (if
you would endeavour to keep the Unity
of the Spirit, and the Bond of Peace
thereby) be careful you chuse Men of
peaceable Dispositions. That which
hath much annoyed the Peace of
Churches, hath been the froward and
perverse Spirits of the Rulers thereof:
<hi>Solomon</hi> therefore adviseth, That <hi>with a
furious Man we should not go, lest we learn
his Ways, and get a Snare to our Souls,</hi>
Prov. 22. 24, 25. and with the Froward
we learn frowardness. How do some
Mens words eat like a Canker; who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of lifting up their Voice like a
Trumpet, to sound a Parley for Peace,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46065:88"/>
have rather sounded an Alarum to War
and Contention. If ever we would
live in Peace, let's reverence the Feet
of them that bring the glad-Tidings of
it.</p>
            <p>O how have some Men made it their
Business to preach Contentions, and
upon their entertainment of every no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
Opinion, to preach Separation!
How hath God's Word been stretched
and torn, to furnish these Men with
Arguments to tear Churches! Have not
our Ears heard those Texts, that saith,
<hi>Come out from among them, and be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi>
&amp;c. and, <hi>withdraw from every Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that walks disorderly?</hi> I say, have
we not heard these Texts, that were
written to prevent Disorder, brought
to countenance the greatest Disorder
that ever was in the Church of God,
even Schism and Division? whereas one
of these Exhortations was written to
the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the Idol's Temple, and the
Idol's Table, in which many of them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the participation of, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their profession of the True God;
as appears 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16, 17. compared
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46065:89"/>
with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 7. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 14, 20,
22, recites. And not for some few or more
Members, who shall make themselves
both Judges and Parties, to make sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
when and as often as they please,
from the whole Congregation and
Church of God where they stood rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
for by the same Rule, and upon
the same Ground, may others start
some new Question among these new
Separatists, and become their own
Judges of the communicableness of them,
and thereupon make another separation
from these, till at last two be not left to
walk together. And for that other
Text mentioned 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 9. where
<hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the Church of <hi>Thessalonica</hi>
to <hi>withdraw themselves from every Brother
that walks disorderly;</hi> I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that any should bring this to justify
their separation, or withdrawing from
the Communion of a true (though a
disorderly) Church. For,</p>
            <p>1. Consider, that this was not writ
for a few Members to withdraw from
the Church, but for the Church to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from disorderly Members.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:46065:89"/>
2. Consider, that if any offended
Members, upon pretence of Error, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Doctrine or Practice, should by
this Text become Judges (as well as
Parties) of the Grounds and Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Separation: Then it will
follow, that half a store notorious He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
or scandalous Livers (when
they have walked so as they foresee the
Church are ready to deal with them,
and withdraw from them) shall anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
the Church, and pretend some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
against them, of which themselves
must be Judges, and so withdraw from
the Church, pretending either Heresy
or Disorder; and so condemn the
Church, to prevent the disgrace of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
condemned by the Church. How
needful then is it, that Men of peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Dispositions, and not of froward
and factious, and dividing Spirits, be
chose to rule the Church of God, for
fear lest the whole Church be lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ed
and sower'd by them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly; As there must be care used
in chusing Men to rule the Church of
God, so there must be a consideration
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46065:90"/>
had, that there are many things darkly
laid down in Scripture, this will temper
our Spirits and make us live in Peace and
Unity the more firmly in things in
which we agree; this will help us to
bear one another's Burden, and so fulfil
the Law of Christ, in as much as all
things necessary to Salvation and Church-Communion
are plainly laid down in
Scripture. And where things are more
darkly laid down, we should consider
that God intended hereby to stir up our
diligence, that thereby we might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
our Knowledg, and not our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
for it may be said of all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
of Truth we have made in the
Scriptures, as it's said of the Globe of
the Earth, that though Men have made
great Searches, and thereupon great
Discoveries, yet there is still a <hi>terra
incognita,</hi> an unknown Land; so there
is in the Scriptures, for after Men have
travelled over them, one Age after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>
yet still there is, as it were, a
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rra incognita,</hi> an unknown Tract to
put us upon farther search and enquiry,
and to keep us from censuring and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
out with those who have not yet
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46065:90"/>
made the same Discoveries; that so we
may say with the Psalmist, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon our short apprehensions of
the Mind of God, that we have seen an
end of all Perfections, but God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
are exceeding broad; and as
one observes, speaking of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that there is a Path in them lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Mind of God, which lieth
a great distance from the Thoughts and
Apprehensions of Men. And on the
other hand, in many other places, God
sits, as it were, on the Superficies, and
the Face of the Letter, where he that
runs may discern him speaking plainly,
and no Parable at all. How should the
consideration of this induce us to a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
deportment towards those that
differ.</p>
            <p>Fifthly; If we would endeavour
Peace and Unity, we must consider
how God hath tempered the Body;
that so the comely Parts should not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from the uncomely, as having no
need of them, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 22, 23, 24, 25.</hi>
There is in Christ's Body and House,
some Members and Vessels less honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46065:91"/>
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20. And therefore we
should not, as some now a-days do, po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
the more abundant disgrace, instead of
putting the more abundant honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them: Did we but consider this, we
should be covering the Weakness, and
hiding the Miscarriages of one another,
because we are all Members one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the most useless Member in
his place is useful.</p>
            <p>Sixthly; If we would live in Peace,
let us remember our Relations to God,
as Children to a Father, and to each
other as Brethren. Will not the thoughts
that we have one Father, quiet us, and
the thoughts that we are Brethren, unite
us? It was this that made <hi>Abraham</hi>
propose Terms of Peace to <hi>Lot,</hi> Gen.
13. <hi>Let there be no Strife</hi> (saith he) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, for we are Brethren.</hi> And we
read of <hi>Moses,</hi> in <hi>Acts 7.</hi> 26. using this
Argument, to reconcile those that strove
together, and to set them at one again;
<hi>Sirs,</hi> saith he, <hi>you are Brethren, why do
ye wrong one another?</hi> A deep sense of this
Relation, that we are Brethren, wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
keep us from dividing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:46065:91"/>
Seventhly; If we would preserve Peace,
let us mind the Gifts, and Graces, and
Vertues that are in each other; let these
be more in our eye, than their Failings
and Imperfections. When the Apostle
exhorted the <hi>Philippians</hi> to Peace, as a
means hereunto, that so the Peace of
God might rule in their Hearts, he tells
them, <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> 8. that <hi>if there were any
Vertue, or any Praise, they should think of
these things.</hi> While we are always talking
and blazoning the Faults of one another,
and spreading their Infirmities, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
we are so little in Peace, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for as Charity covereth a multitude
of Sins, so Malice covereth a multitude
of Vertues, and makes us deal by one
another, as the Heathen Persecutors
dealt with Christians, <hi>(viz.)</hi> put them
in Bears Skins, that they might the
more readily become a Prey to those
Dogs that were designed to devour
them.</p>
            <p>Eighthly; If we would keep Unity
and Peace, let us lay aside provoking
and dividing Language, and forgive
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46065:92"/>
those that use them. Remember that
old Saying, <hi>Evil Words corrupt good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
When Men think to carry all afore
them, with speaking uncharitably and
disgracefully of their Brethren, or their
Opinions; may not such be answered,
as <hi>Job</hi> answered his unfriendly Visitants,
<hi>Job 6. 25. How forcible are right Words?
but what do your Arguings reprove?</hi> How
healing are words fitly spoken? <hi>A word
in season, how good is it?</hi> If we would
seek Peace, let us cloath all our Treaties
for Peace with acceptable words; and
where one word may better accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
than another, let that be used to
express Persons or Things by; and let
us not, as some do, call the different
Practices of our Brethren, Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and their different Opinions, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Devils, and the Doctrine of
<hi>Balaam,</hi> who taught Fornication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
unless we can plainly, and in express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Terms prove it so; such Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
as this hath strangely divided our
Spirits, and hardened our Hearts one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:46065:92"/>
Ninthly; If we would live in Peace,
let us make the best constructions of one
another's Words and Actions. Charity
judgeth the best, and it thinks no evil;
if Words and Actions may be construed
to a good sence, let us never put a bad
construction upon them: How much
hath the Peace of Christians been broken
by an uncharitable Interpretation of
Words and Actions? as some lay to the
charge of others, that which they never
said; so by straining Mens Words,
others lay to their charge, that they
never thought.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Be willing to hear, and
learn, and obey those that God by his
Providence hath set over you; this is a
great means to preserve the Unity and
Peace of Churches: but when Men (yea,
and sometimes Women) shall usurp Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and think themselves wiser than
their Teachers, no wonder if these
People run into Contentions and Parties,
when any shall say they are not free to
hear those whom the Church thinks fit
to speak to them: This is the first step
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46065:93"/>
to Schism, and is usually attended, if
not timely prevented, with a sinful Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly; If you would keep the
Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of
Peace, be mindful, that the God, whom
you serve, is a God of <hi>Peace,</hi> and your
Saviour is a Prince of Peace, and that
his Ways are Ways of Pleasantness,
and all his Paths are Peace; and that
Christ was sent into the World, to give
Light to them that sit in Darkness, and
in the shadow of Death, and to guide
our Feet in the Way of Peace.</p>
            <p>Twefthly; Consider the oneness of
Spirit that is among the Enemies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
though they differ about other
things, yet to persecute Religion, and
extirpate Religion out of the earth, here
they will agree; the Devils in the Air,
and the Devils in the Earth, all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
in Hell, and in the World, make
one at this turn. Shall the Devil's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
be united, and shall Christ's be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided?
Shall the Devils make one shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to drive on the design of damning
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46065:93"/>
Men, and shall not Christians unite to
carry on the great Design of saving of
them? Shall the Papists agree and unite
to carry on their Interest, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the multitudes of Orders, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and Differences there are among
them, and shall not those that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Reformed Churches, unite, to
carry on the common Interest of Christ
in the World, notwithstanding some
petty and disputable Differences that are
among them? <hi>Quarrels about Religion</hi> (as
one observes) <hi>were Sins not named among
the Gentiles.</hi> What a shame is it then,
for Christians to abound in them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
considering the nature of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, and what large provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the Author of it hath made, to keep
the Professors of it in Peace? Insomuch
(as one well observes) <hi>It is next to a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
that ever any</hi> (especially the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of it) <hi>should fall out about it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirteenthly; Consider and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her,
That the Judge stands at the door;
let this moderate our Spirits, that the
Lord is at hand. What a sad account will
they have to make when he comes, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46065:94"/>
shall be found to smite their Fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and to make the way to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
more narrow than ever he made
it? Let me close all in the words of that
great Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 11. Finally, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
farewel; be perfect, be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
be of one mind, live in peace, and
the God of love and peace shall be with
you.</hi>

            <p>REader, I thought good to advertise
thee, that I have delivered this to
thy Hand, in the same Order and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
in which it was preached, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in the same words, without any
diminishings, or considerable Enlargings,
unless it be in the thirteen last Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
upon some of which I have made
some enlargements, which I could not
then do for want of time; but the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of every one of them was then
laid down in the same particular order
as here thou hast them; and now I
have done, I make no other account
(to use the words of a moderate Man
upon the like Occasion) but it will fall
out with me, as doth commonly with
him that parts a Fray, both Parties
may perhaps drive at me for wishing
them no worse than peace: My ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the publique Tranquillity of the
