         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:61693:3"/>
to present to your Lordship this
Piece, now called to be made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic

your acceptance and protection of
what I tender in acknowledgment
of my Duty and Service. The Part
formerly printed, and what is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

at your Honour's Feet, having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
allowance from your Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Family to be made public, and
most of it practised among them,
for the special use of those Noble
Persons, who are now gone from us;
and for whose memory I could not
transcribe with dry eyes. What
their Loss vvas to the Public, is
vvell known, and no less lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and so great to me, that I can

            <p>The Right Honourable, your

greater Favour than I do pretend

to deserve. Your Right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Mother was seldom ill at home
or abroad, without commanding
my attendance: The same have the
Right Honourable your Brothers and
your Lordship done. By whom
scarce any thing was taken without
my thoughts, from the most eminent
Physicians, till they became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with their Bodies. In all
which Services it pleased God, I so
ordered my self, that I have had
from your Physicians, not only thanks
but commendation. Which I have
always looked on as proceeding more
from the Favour of your Honour's
Family, than my Deserts.</p>
            <p>These Obligations under which I
lie, have given your Lordship the
trouble of this Dedication, and this
poor Piece, which I here present with
my hearty and humble Prayers for all
and each of your Honourable Family,
<pb facs="tcp:61693:4"/>
that they may receive the greatest of
God's Favours here, and the full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O you it is that I now address
my self, to give you some small
account of what is added in
this Impression. To the <hi>Select
Observations on English
Bodies,</hi> you have an hundred
<hi>Counsels and Advices,</hi> by very eminent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
on several Honourable Persons, and
others of no inferior Rank and Repute in this
and other Counties. The Honourable Family
which I have attended, and do still, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
commanded me, as to receive all Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
so to see them made up in several places
<pb facs="tcp:61693:5"/>
where I have attended, both to see them taken,
and to observe their Success. Their favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
allowance I have for what is done. Their
Honours, when Physicians were with them,
were always ready to engage them to be helpful
to their sick Neighbours; the Advices for such
being for most part entrusted in my hands. I
hope what is made publick can be no wrong to
any of those Physicians, having for their Pains,
Prescriptions, and Directions, received gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Pay and noble Entertainment. If there
necessarily occur any thing concerning those
living, I humbly beg their Pardon, and if I
had not feared giving offence, I had named
them as well as those dead: But this is not all,
for as I have a due rememembrance of those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased,
(whose freeness I always found in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
to me what they kept private from
most) so I give hearty thanks to those living,
who have been like minded, and by whose Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
I have received no small advantage.
Something there is intermixed, and something
also in the Close, of <hi>Dr. Stubbs</hi>'s, whose Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Openness I cannot but remember. He
was not a Person greedy of Gain. Not many
months before he died, he said to me, <q>We must
study all ways possible to find out and appoint
Medicines of cheap rate, and effectual; for
Money is scarce, and Country-People poor:</q>
               <pb facs="tcp:61693:5"/>
To which I answered, That it had been, and
should be my constant Course as long as I lived.
I have heard it was said by one, over whom none
is supreme in these Nations, (whom God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and continue here, and crown with Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in Glory hereafter) That if <hi>Dr. Stubbs</hi>
had but some of <hi>Saturn</hi> to poize his <hi>Mercurial</hi>
Brain, he would make a good Statesman. And
not a few famous Practitioners have said the
like of him, as a Physician. But he is gone,
and I cannot but say, Seldom comes a better.
But to pass this, I hope my Service in this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
will be civilly accepted, which is all,
save to crave leave to subscribe my self always a
Friend to the Friendly, and an Enemy to
none of Mankind.</p>

                  <p>THE Countess of <hi>Northampton,</hi> aged 44.
on <hi>March</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> 1622. as she was
walking in her Bed-chamber, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
fell into a swoon, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sense or motion for half an hour; she fell with
her face on the frame of a Table, which caused a
Wound with contusion, whence arose Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as also a great and troublesom Flux of Rheum,
which distilling from her eyes, excoriated the
whole face with exulcerations; the habit of her
Body was Scorbutick and Cacochymick: her resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
then was at <hi>Ludlow-Castle:</hi> To whom being
called, I cured perfectly, by God's assistance, with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61693:17"/>
the following Medicines. She was purged with
the following, ℞ <hi>Sena</hi> ℥j. <hi>Agarick</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iij. <hi>Rubarb</hi>

was strained through an Ippocras bag, six or seven times,
and sweetned with half a pound of Sugar.</hi> Dose ℥v.
twice a day, <hi>viz.</hi> in the morning fasting, and at
four a clock in the afternoon. This gave five or
six stools a day without gripings, it was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
four days. Her face was anointed with <hi>white
Ointment camphorated,</hi> which cured it in four days.
The Body being not sufficiently emptied, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Pills were used, ℞ <hi>Pil. Ruffin. &amp; Succin.
Crato.</hi> of each equal parts; of <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i, were made seven
Pills, three of which she took when she went to
bed, the next day she had six or seven stools. But
this was observable, that instead of swallowing the
Pills, she chewed them, and so let them down,
saying she could not swallow them, though never
so little; withal, that she thought it the best way.
She took of these twice a week. Those days she
took not the Pills, I administred the following:
℞ <hi>Elect. Chalyb, Crat. mixed with the salts of Scurvy-grass,
Wormwood and Coral.</hi> In her Broth was
boiled these Scorbutick Herbs, viz. <hi>Scurvy-grass,
Water-Cresses,</hi> and <hi>Brook-lime.</hi> After all, she took
this Scorbutick Beer, ℞ <hi>Scurvy-grass</hi> M iv. <hi>Water-cresses,
Brook-lime, each</hi> M ii. <hi>Wormwood, Fumitory,
and Germander, each</hi> M. j. <hi>Roots of Fennel, Borage,

℥i. <hi>Flowers of Borag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Buglosse, Rosemary, each</hi> p ii.
<hi>Boyl them all in five gallons of Beer, till one be wasted.
After having the following Ingredients in a bag,</hi> viz.
<hi>Sarsaparilla, Calamus aromaticus, Cinnamon, Mace,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61693:17"/>
Seeds of Anis and Fennel, each</hi> ℥ss. <hi>Juniper-berries</hi>
℥viii. <hi>Let them be infused in the hot liquor, well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
till it be cold, after put it up, hanging the bag in
it.</hi> After fifteen days she drank of it, using no
other; this she drank in <hi>April.</hi> Till it was ready, she
took the following; ℞ <hi>Sarsaparila</hi> ℥ii. <hi>Guaicum</hi>
℥i. <hi>Sassafras roots</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ii. <hi>Slice aud bruise them, after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
them in</hi> 
                     <abbr>lb</abbr>xv. <hi>of Spring-water for twelve hours.

                     <hi>be wasted; after take
it from the fire, adding presently of Cinnamon bruised</hi>
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i. <hi>after let it pass through an Hippocras bag.</hi> Dose
℥vi. taken hot, being in bed, composing the Body
to sweat gently; cover the Head and Neck with
hot linnen clothes: after sweating, the sweat was
rubbed of gently with fine dry warm linnen. An
ordinary Drink was made of the second Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was used in those days she did not
sweat, with which was taken the juice of Scurvy-grass
rightly prepared, six spoonfuls in one
Draught; in her Broths was used the Salt of the
same. By the blessing of the Almighty, she was
by these Remedies perfectly cured, beyond the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of her Lord and Friends.</p>

aged about 36, very handsom, was
afflicted with a most grievous Disease, and bitter
Symptoms, for above two years; and although
many expert Physicians did lend their help, yet
there was no Profit, yea rather all was more bitter
and grievous. She could scarce swallow or breath,
she felt something hard in her Throat to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a Dove's Egg, so that she could scarce
swallow either Meat or Drink. This was caused
from Wind; for she felt it move, and in its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it was sometimes more and less painful. The
tumor of the Almonds was not great, from a
Rheum which distilled from the Head, which
vexed her most in the night. Her Illness and Pain
hindred her Sleep, and she feared she should be
choaked; yet her Head was afflicted with a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
numness, and an incredible proneness to sleep;
her Body was so also afflicted, by which she could
scarce walk, and natural Action was deprived;
hence there were a long time of Symptoms. By in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
her Hands would be livid, not without
coldness; the Thighs tumified, and a <hi>Scorbutick
Dropsy</hi> broke forth; all these being caused from
the Spleen, Liver, and suppression of the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.

age of 28, which was 1617, <hi>July</hi> 1. fell into
a burning malign continual Feaver, with great
Pain of the Head, most vehement Heat, Pain
in the Stomach; the Body all over, especially the
Arms, was full of spots; the Urine was red and
little. It was then called the <hi>New Feaver,</hi> it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
many, I was called the third day of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion.
The Stomach being stuffed and burdened
with ill humors, as I perceived, I advised the
following Vomit: ℞ <hi>Emetick Infusion</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ix. This
gave twelve Vomits without any great trouble.
The day before she had (unknown to me) drunk
much Milk to quench her thirst, by reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Vomit at first drew forth a wonderful
quantity of curdled Milk, so that she was almost
choaked, after came Choler mixed with Phlegm,
afterward burnt Melancholy. She had also six
Stools Phlegmy, mixed with green Choler and
much Serosities. Her vomiting ending in three
hours, I gave a Pill of <hi>Laudan. Paracelsi</hi> gr. vii.
(sure he mistook her, for four is a good Dose) after
which she slept four hours, the Pain of her Head
ceasing. Then to me unknown her Servant gave
her a draught of Whey, which being drunk, she
presently had three Vomits of black Stuff without
any trouble, and two such like Stools, and was
cruelly afflicted with the Hiccough, to allay which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61693:50"/>
I gave Claret wine burnt with Aromatick, which
succeeded; she was quieter the rest of the Night,
but did not sleep well. In the morning I gave
Chicken-broth, made with appropriate Herbs,
and so for four hours she rested. At the end of that
time I gave a draught of the Decoction of
Hartshorn hot. On Munday morning having some
evacuation, I appointed the same Decoct, should be
given cold. She was miserably afflicted with <hi>Pustles,</hi>
with great heat of the Tongue and Throat, that

Fever, and that continual, Pain in the Loins,
small bleeding at the Nose, Pain of the Head,
with small Delirium, was cured as followeth:
First, I appointed her to bleed four or five ounces,

<hi>Spirit of Vitriol, as much as made it sharp.</hi> To the
Soals of her Feet were applied Radishes beaten with
Salt, and besprinkled with Rose-vinegar, which
was renewed every fourth hour. For the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Tongue, was used the following
Gargarism: ℞ <hi>Spring water</hi>

<hi>with Salt make a Clyster.</hi> The <hi>20th</hi> day of <hi>June</hi>
she vomited a Worm with Melancholy matter.
Then I gave of the following Electuary the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity

seventh month of her Child-bearing, fell into a
Bastard Tertain, as also a filthy yellow Jaundice,
Torment of the Belly and Head, and Pain of the
Back, being aged about 26, desiring my advice,
being not willing to purge, I prescribed as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:
℞ <hi>the Flowers of Marygolds and Rosemary,
each</hi> p. i. <hi>Carduus benedictus</hi> p. ss. <hi>Flowers and leaves

retarded two hours; it beginning, she took the
other half, which freed her from her shaking,
then her Jaundice appeared in her Water manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
after sweat broke forth, the next Fit was less.
In the heat of the Fever and sweat, she took the
Decoction of <hi>Harts-horn,</hi> with Juyce of Limons,
of which she drank liberally, in which Decoction
she would not admit Rose-water. On her quiet
day she took every third hour the quantity of a

The <hi>22th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> before her Fit, she had five

less by six hours. The <hi>23th</hi> day, by five in the

                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Jackson,</hi> (Wife to Mr. <hi>Jackson</hi> Jun.) aged
about 24, being not well purged after birth,
fell suddenly into a grievous Delirium, no other
Disease preceding; she was most angry with those
that formerly she most loved, yet her talk was very
religious. By intervals there was a Fever acute,
which made me fear a Frenzy. By reason of much
business I could not have time to visit her, yet
there was a happy success by the following Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions:

after without Pain, she had five stools. She took
it again. The <hi>22th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> there were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

the Delirium was not wholly removed. The 23

being purged, and let blood, from it she fell into a
Bastard Tertian, pernicious, with a yellow Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,

                  <p>THou, O Lord, which hast the power of Life

the very jaws of Death to former health; for
which I praise thy Name, O most merciful God,
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying thee
to give me a most thankful Heart for this great
favour, for which I have cause to admire thee.
About the <hi>57th</hi> year of my age, <hi>August</hi> 27. 1632.
to <hi>Septemb.</hi> 29. I was much debilitated with an
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61693:91"/>
                     <hi>immoderate Flux of the Hemorrhoids;</hi> yet daily was
I constrained to go to several places to Patients.
By riding, a hardness being contracted, the Flux
was stayed for fourteen days. After I fell into
a most cruel torture of my Teeth, and then into
a deadly burning Fever, which then raged very
much, killing almost all that it did infect, for
which I used the following method, which by the
help of God succeeded. First, I purged thus:
℞ <hi>Rubarb infused</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i. (surely it was infused in some
proper water, suppose ℥iii.) <hi>Syrup. Diaserios</hi> ℥i.
<hi>Elect. è Succ. Ros.</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>iii. This gave four stools.
After I used the <hi>Decoction of Harts-horn,</hi> and so
the Disease was almost cast out by Urine, it flowed
very much for four days space; so that I was not
only much maciated, but also weakned, so
that I could not move my self in my Bed without
help. I also had <hi>Convulsion of the Mouth and Eyes.</hi>
Then was a Pigeon cut open alive, and applied
to my feet, to draw down the Vapours; for I
was often afflicted with a light Delirium. Then
my Wife sent for two Physicians. I had used a

prescribed the following Electuary, of which I
swallowed the quantity of a Nutmeg twice a day.

restlessness; or if it were much, yet it was by

                  <p>MR. <hi>John Trap,</hi> (Minister, for his piety and

year of his age, of a melancholy temper, and by

and pain of the Spleen, with some Scorbutic
Symptoms, <hi>viz.</hi> difficulty of breathing after
gentle motion of the Body, beating of the Heart,
with fainting at the rising of the Vapours, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61693:104"/>
became a little better when they were dispersed.
He had a gentle Erratic Fever, so that he was
much amaciated; after he had done preaching on
the Sabbath, he could scarce speak; his Urine
changed often, his Pulse was mutable and unequal,
and he languished much. Some ordinary Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
were used, but not succeeding, he desired
my help and counsel, which was readily perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by me in prescribing the following, by which
he was restored from the very jaws of Death, both
safely, quickly, and pleasantly. <hi>March</hi> 11. 1635.

again, in which he said the greatest hope of his

used it for eight days, purging every fourth day.
But being much troubled with bitterness of his
Mouth, I gave him <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>v of our <hi>Emetic Infusion,</hi>

The Foil being run into his left Eye, it presently

all the afternoon with vomiting. There was

of new Milk, and six spoonfuls of Sugar.</hi> As soon
as it had done working, he bled ℥viij from the

<hi>Chamomel, Violet leaves, and Smallage, each</hi> M i.
The next morning he took <hi>Manna</hi> ℥ii. <hi>Syrup of
Roses three spoonfuls,</hi> in a pint of Whey, several
times, till all was drunk up. That morning was
appointed two Leeches to be applied behind the
Ear, and as many to the Temples, to prevent
the growing Film. And then was applied this
Pultess: <hi>Take leaves of Hyssop, beat them in a Mortar,
like a Conserve, after put to it a little warm Water,
and a little washed Butter, and a little prepared Tutty,</hi>
and so applied to the Eye affected. To the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brow
was applied <hi>Empl. ad Hern.</hi> spread upon
Taffaty Ribbon, about an inch broad, and two or
three inches long. After this the Eye mended,
but seemed lesser than the other, and he had about
it somewhat an obtuse pain, whereupon for fear
that some bruised blood might remain, he had four
Leeches applied to the Temple-Veins on the same
side; and the next Pultess was applied at night
for a week together: <hi>Take Flowers of Broom, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

Physician. He makes incision in the Side, when
any Apostume is broke in the Cavity of the Breast,
either from a Pleurisy, or the Lungs, which oft
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61693:137"/>
happens (without any preceding Inflammation)
to many People who never complained of any
Disease of the Lungs, nor ever suspected them
to be unsound, till on a sudden they are almost
choaked with the matter in the breaking of it.
And in these Cases when they spit a great deal of
purulent matter, if at the same time they feel any
pricking pain in their Sides, whereby he guesseth
it to be in the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> he first applies
a Plaster to the very place to help to break it, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of <hi>Galb. Ammoniac.</hi> &amp;c. By this Course in five
days he suppurated, and broke a hole in one
Mr. <hi>Thornton</hi> in <hi>Northampton-shire,</hi> so that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
came out very well, and in short time his
Cough, and spitting of Corruption ceased; and
when it began to cease running, he made it an Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
by putting in Pease, and kept it open a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a year, till it healed of it self, and the
Gentleman is in health and strong at this time.
But if he could not suppurate it with a Plaster, then
he makes Issues where there is any pain or prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
felt, and in a week the Impostume comes to
find a vent, and so comes out in great quantity, and
very stinking, and presently their Coughing and
spitting ceaseth. By this means he recovered
Mrs. <hi>Mildmay,</hi> and a Baker, after the Apostume
had lain in the Breast almost a month, and had
spit a great quantity of stinking corrupted matter;

every Change and Full of the Moon, give of the
Julep and Pouder four or five grains morning and
night, four or five days together. At the same
time let the Nurse which suckles it, take night and
morning a draught of Posset-drink, wherein boil

quantity, and repeat it every eighth hour, and
give it Spirit of Harts-horn twice in twenty four
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61693:151"/>
hours one or two drops. At the first appearance
of any Fit, raise a Blister in his Neck, and whilst
he continues indisposed give him a Clyster every
day, and all that time let the Nurse be kept to a
Diet of Gruel, Panado, and thin Broth, boil in
them a bundle of sweet Herbs, <hi>viz. Rosemary,
Time, Winter-Savory, and sweet Marjorum.</hi> Let
the following bag be worn about the Childs Neck,
and worn constantly, so that it may lie on the
mouth of the Stomach. <hi>Take Elk-claw, roots of

               </p>
               <p>Other Directions for the same Child. Let a
Nurse be got that hath new Milk, and let the
Child suck her three or four days. If you see him
still subject to Fits, and to be heavy and oppressed
in the Spirits, apply a Leech to each Jugular
Vein, take away an ounce of blood from each side,
be careful to stop it presently, for it will be apt to
bleed very much. Apply the following Cataplasm
to the Feet, renew it morning and night, lay them
on warm: <hi>Take Rue</hi> M iiii. <hi>Misletoe if to be
had</hi> M ss. <hi>stamp them very well in a Mortar, add to it
Bay-salt</hi> Mss. <hi>and as much Soap as a Pullets egg, and
Oil of Scorpions so much as to malax it.</hi> If the
Child should be free from his Fits, leave off the
Pouder and Julep, but continue the Spirit of
Harts-horn, giving with it night and morning
three spoonfuls of the distilled Water following;
yet every Change and Full of the Moon give the
other Medicines. Give his Medicines a prety
distance from his sucking, and especially give him
before and presently after his sleeping. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled
Water, <hi>Take a pint and half of Snails in their

loath his Medicines, leave them off for a while,
and take only the Pouder and Julep, new and

the distilled Water morning and night, six or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

as much of the next Pouder as will lie on a shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

advised it in such Cases, with so good success, that
I cannot but now recommend it: But then I
would not have much (not above three or four
ounces) taken away at first, as being much safer,
and effectual to take a little at first, and to repeat,
than to take too much at once. The repetition
of bleeding may be after a week, sooner or later,
as you shall see occasion from the recurring, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
or encrease of the Pains, or other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.
As to the other two Indications, take of
the next Pouder ℈i. in a poched Egg, or with a
little Broth, or other supping, once every day,
during the Pains, either in the morning, or at
night, which may most please, or be agreeable.

of Sallet Oyl,</hi> and gave it him, holding an
Orange to his Nose, that he vomited it not up; the

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Cooke,</hi> I should have been much troubled
at my Lord's illness in the operation of the Pill, did
I not confidently hope that his Lordship will be
much the better for it. For besides that 'tis a good
opening Pill (in the general) both of Liver and
Spleen. 'Tis particularly proper for my Lord to
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:61693:181"/>
open the stoppages of his Liver, and to carry off
the surcharge of the matter, which must be done
gently and gradually. Therefore though I cannot
but heartily commend the use of the <hi>Pill</hi> to his
Lordship, yet it must be so ordered as to have it
work not too much, by making the Pill not above
half so big, or less as you shall see reason. You
know that a copious evacuation of matter, though
peccant, in some bodies will cause great disorder
for the present, and sometimes occasion an <hi>Ague<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
therefore the Pill must be proportioned according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and I hope it will be so, as that my Lord may
be encouraged to use it sometimes. And Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi>
because I know that the opening <hi>Apozem</hi> will be
much more effectual with the assistance of such a
Pill, than without it, therefore I desire you to see
that all the ingredients be in, and good, chiefly
the <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> which is oft base and sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated;
besides they are apt to leave it out, as
thinking that the white <hi>Tartar</hi> may only serve.

            <head>DIRECTIONS
For such as drink the
Bath-Water.
Collected by H. S.</head>
            <head type="sub">Revised and approved by Sir Alexander
Frasier, principal Physician to his
Majesty.</head>
            <p>THere being many unthought of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
and many unexpected
Accidents, which frequently befall such
as resort unto, and make use of the hot
Baths in <hi>Europe,</hi> by way of drinking them medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinally;
the best provision that can be made against
such perillous Contingencies, is, <hi>that the Patient
regulate himself according to the most rational and exact
Rules of Physick;</hi> and having duly prepared the
Body according to them, before he begin to drink,
that he pursue a <hi>most orderly Course of Diet,</hi> and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61693:185"/>
cautelously deport himself in all those Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
which Physicians include under that
Notion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon this account it is, that the universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and Practice of Mankind seems to have
enacted this into a standing Law,</hi> That none should
wantonly, and with contempt of all Dietetical Rules,
make use of those Mineral Drinks; but that all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
relating thereto, should be conformable to
Moderation and Temperance.</p>
            <p>It behoveth therefore such Persons to avoid,
during such a Course, all surcharge of Meat, all
excess of Drink; that they neither indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with too much sleep, nor maccrate or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
their Bodies by immoderate watching;
that they neither debilitate Nature by so violent
exercise as may introduce a Lassitude; nor retard
the distribution, digestion, and evacuation of those
Mineral Waters by Sloth and In-activity; that
such excrementitious Collections, as Nature
customarily produceth in human Bodies, be duly
evacuated, and neither too long retained, nor too
precipitously discharged; that the Mind be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
into such a cheerfulness and gaiety, as may
prevent all disorderly Passions and Lusts.</p>
            <p>The Effect of the <hi>Bath-Waters</hi> being drunk, is,
to <hi>discharge</hi> the whole Body from all <hi>Impurities</hi>
that are incorrigible; to <hi>correct</hi> those that are <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Amendment;</hi> to <hi>free</hi> the <hi>innate heat</hi> or <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of each part which are oppressed through
any <hi>surcharge,</hi> or peccancy of Humors; and to
<hi>restore</hi> or <hi>revive</hi> those that otherwise <hi>languish,</hi> or
are some way decayed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:61693:185"/>
And this is done, not by any one manner of
<hi>Operation</hi> in them, but by their <hi>complicated working</hi>
at one time of sundry evacuations. It is manifest,
that they operate by <hi>Stool</hi> several times, once,
twice, thrice, four times, or more. It is no less
evident that they operate by <hi>Vrine,</hi> so as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
themselves <hi>oftentimes</hi> in a greater quantity

and <hi>frequently</hi> in a proportion somewhat
less; of the last instance there being several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
observable. It is also manifest, that they
promote not only <hi>insensible Transpiration,</hi> but <hi>Sweat;</hi>
the latter being more or less copious, according
to the <hi>Constitution</hi> of the Patient, <hi>antecedent Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and the <hi>ambient,</hi> whether taken abroad in the
<hi>open Air,</hi> or in <hi>Bed.</hi> The Effects they have in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

<hi>viz.</hi> That upon drinking them they have

The like Effect I have seen in some
Pulmonicks.</p>
            <p>Neither is it to be supposed, that these Waters
discharge themselves purely in an <hi>insipid, limpid,
aqueous Vrine.</hi> For (not to mention sundry ways,
I have tried and discovered <hi>Heterogeneous Contents</hi>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:61693:186"/>
in such Urine) I have seen a Person deeply and
inveterately <hi>Hypochondriacal,</hi> who avoided his Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
at the beginning (and yet they passed well)
deeply <hi>tinged with Choler,</hi> as much as is to be seen
in the <hi>Colick Bilious.</hi> I have also seen Persons,
whose <hi>Lungs, Head,</hi> and <hi>Habit</hi> of Body, were
oppressed with <hi>viscid Phlegm,</hi> to avoid Urines,
which though pale, yet by the lasting consistence
of <hi>viscid Bubbles,</hi> and ever <hi>great Froth</hi> thereon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any agitation, sufficiently shewed the mixture
of the <hi>dissolved Phlegm.</hi> And when they pass
much in the night, they come away more or less
tinged, according to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Patient,
the <hi>Disease,</hi> the <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Circumspection</hi> used for
his Cure.</p>
            <p>The Operation of these Waters being such, as
it is not difficult for an intelligent Physician to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
in what Diseases it is requisite or beneficial
to drink these Waters; so it will likewise seem
evident, that a due preparation is necessary for
such as expect benefit thereby. Neither will
any knowing Physician imagin, that the exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of one Dose of purging Pills, a Potion, or a
<hi>Bolus,</hi> is a <hi>sufficient Preparative</hi> for the <hi>successful
drinking of these Waters.</hi> For seeing that a <hi>stable
Health</hi> consists herein principally, that the <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of the first, and <hi>subsequent Concoctions</hi> be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
by all those ways whereby these Waters
do operate. And since that in <hi>morbid Persons</hi> there
are not only <hi>Depravations</hi> in the <hi>Chyle, Mass of
Blood,</hi> and other <hi>Alimentary Juices;</hi> but also in
the <hi>Chyliferous, Sanguiferous, Lymphatic Vessels
Nerves and Glandules,</hi> (not to mention other
things) the <hi>universal Amendment</hi> whereof is no
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:61693:186"/>
less requisite to a <hi>constancy of Health,</hi> than it is to
Liquors, what they are, and through what Canals
they run; no understanding Person will conclude
otherwise than that according to the several <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi>
and <hi>Indispositions of Patients,</hi> there must be
<hi>different Preparations</hi> made, (and those in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the Methods which solid Physic prescribes)
before they can propose to themselves any great
or durable benefit by the use of these Waters.</p>
            <p>Let us then inculcate that Aphorism of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
to all such as shall repair to these Waters, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora
qui purgare volet, fluida efficiat oportet:</hi> He that
would conveniently purge any Person, must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Humors to a fluidity, and relax the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
first, by which they are to be evacuated.
To the most beneficial operation of Medicaments,
it is requisite that there be an universal <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that
the Humors be <hi>fluxile,</hi> and the Passages <hi>pervious:</hi>
The which is so much the more to be regarded
in respect to the <hi>Bath-Waters,</hi> because they do not
as other Medicaments, operate after one <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
manner,</hi> but more <hi>catholicly.</hi> But more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Obstructions of the <hi>Mesentery</hi> are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
because the Waters are more particularly
to pass through those parts.</p>
            <p>Let us also lay down this for another Rule, that
these Waters are not to be looked upon as being
in themselves an <hi>entire Course of Physic,</hi> but that
<hi>subsidiary Helps</hi> of <hi>Purges,</hi> and other <hi>Medicaments,</hi>
appropriated to <hi>respective Diseases,</hi> will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the <hi>compleating</hi> of their Effects. And if the
<hi>solitary</hi> or <hi>immethodical</hi> use of these Waters hath
ever been successful, (which is not to be denied)
the <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtunate Rashness</hi> of such Persons ought not
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:61693:187"/>
to be drawn into a President, by the considering
part of Mankind; there being so many Instances
of their being unsuccessful, and sometimes preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial,
through the neglect or ignorance of this
Caution.</p>
            <p>These things being premised, the Manner of
drinking these Waters, which the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Persons ought to follow, and which
Reason it self dictates, is this:</p>
            <p>I. That they <hi>begin with drinking of the Waters,
and conclude</hi> (if their condition permit) <hi>with
bathing.</hi> For Bathing is but a <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>local</hi>
Remedy, Drinking a more <hi>general</hi> or <hi>universal.</hi>
Therefore according to the established Maxims of
Physic, the latter ought to precede the former.
Besides, the drinking of these Waters, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Obstructions, attenuating some, and evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
other Humors, doth prepare the way for
Bathing, whereby the Reliques are evacuated by
sweat, and the habit of the Body corroborated.
But <hi>reiterated Bathing</hi> doth not prepare the Body
for drinking; if it open the Pores, and discuss
some Humors, it attracts into the Habit of the
Body others that are crude, gross, and unfit to be
discussed by sweat or transpiration; it puts the
Humors lodged in the <hi>Hypochondria</hi> into an Aestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and Turgency, and raiseth Vapors as well as
Defluxions upon the outward and inward Parts.
Also Bathing, being accompanied with sweating,
hinders evacuation, by <hi>Stool</hi> and <hi>Vrine,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
puts Nature into a Course altogether
opposite to what is to be expected and wished in
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:61693:187"/>
the <hi>drinking of the Waters.</hi> From whence it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that to begin with a Course of <hi>Bathing and
Sweating,</hi> and to terminate with a Course of <hi>drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Waters,</hi> is not only <hi>irrational,</hi> but <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi>
