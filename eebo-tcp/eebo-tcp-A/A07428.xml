            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Anent death, there is twa things even
amongst Christians to be marueyled at;
First, that many liues sa secure and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutelie,
as though thay suld neuer die,
quhilk is a wonder, in respect that nature
it selfe teachis all, that thay man die: and
daily experience tries, that we man leaue
the things of the world, and they vs, with
how great a lust and pleasure soeuer we
be caryed after them.</p>
            <p>The vther is, that when death appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
we are sa greatlie troubled; &amp; when
it befals, we mourne and lament, quhilk
also is strange among professed Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
seeing haly Scripture preachis sa
highlie the profit of death; the godlie
Fathers sa pleasandlie hes died before vs;
the Saints oftentimes wished for death;
and that quhilk is greeuous of all, seeing
this is the chiefe poynt of our Christian
faith, that IESVS CHRIST our Lord
and Sauiour hath for vs be death try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
ouer death, nether is there any
vther way to life and immortall felicitie,
but be the death to tryumph and be vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20340:5"/>
pertakers with him of his crown
and kingdome.</p>
            <p>For remedie of the first, let vs alwaies
remember the penaltie, inflicted to vs all
in person of our first Father for his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression;
<hi>Thou shalt die the death,</hi> (sayis the
Lord) <hi>Thou was taken of the earth, &amp; to the
earth thou sall returne.</hi> Remember the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility
of our nature be the saying of IOB;
<hi>Man that is borne of a woman is of short
life, repleat with miseries: as the flower of the

<hi>He wha euerie day putis ane end to his life, hes
no neid of time:</hi> therefore, thinke to liue
but for ane daie, and esteeme euerie daie
a new life: For there is nathing lyker the
course of our life, than the dailie course
of the Sun rysing in the morning, ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the noone, and declyning to the
evening. No like thing to the graue then
our bedds, to the winding-sheit, then the
shiets to the wormes, nor the punneas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
or flees to the sound of the Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
trumpet, nor the Cock or morning
wackner. Theresore, let vs everie hour of
the daie remember sa mekel of our life to
be spent, every evening reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber death,
everie night goe to bedde as we wald to
graue: lap vs in our sheits as in our win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-
sheits and rest, attending for that
wackner that sal summound vs to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>We haue no permanent Cittie, heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
nor dwelling house heir, wee sit on
an vther mans ground, and occupies ane
vther mans house, without few-ferme,
yea, without ane houres tack: therfore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20340:7"/>
we suld bee euer readie to flit, seeing flit
man wee of necessitie, whensoeuer that
officiar death warnes vs, chopping at the
doore of this house of mudde: or rather
clayming wherein the saul for a season is
enclosed; Of nathing then, sa often and
sa mekil suld we think of, as of the time,
place and manner of our death, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration
from this life: in sik sort, that gif
it were possible, the whole moments that
wee passe of the life, suld bee no vther
thing, but a learning or reckning ouer
some new lesson of death.</p>
            <p>This mooved IOSEPH of <hi>Arimathea</hi>
that noble and honest Counseller, and
faithfull Disciple of Christ, to prepare
for him a Sepulcher in a Garden, after
the auncient custome of the people of
God; at the quhilk dailie he might me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
of death. The quhilk had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to ressaue the bodie of the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Dantoner of death.</p>
            <p>This mooved the noble men of <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia</hi>
(after as appeares) they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Gospell, be the ministrie of
Queene Candaces Eunuch, to keip this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20340:8"/>
custome, that whensoever they went
foorth to the fielde for pourmeneying
them selues: they caused carrie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them a golden Basen full of earth,
togeither with the signe of the Crosse,
to remember them that they were earth,
and suld turne to earth: and that onelie
in the death of Christ Crucified, they
had comfort against death, ane assured
hope of life. This moved PHILLIP of
<hi>Macedon,</hi> to commaunde his chalmer
child euerie morning oft times to crye
thrise in his ear; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber <hi>Ppillip</hi> that thou
art but a mortall man. This mooved also
the auncient Aegyptians at all their ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
to haue placed in a clew and open
place: right in the sight of all their ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketters,
the Image and picture of death,
to make them in the middest of their
pleasure to remember their ende, and sa
to moderate themselues from falling in
sik vices, that easilie aryseth of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of banketting.</p>
            <p>And finallie, this same mooved the
godly Father <hi>Ierome,</hi> whether he eate or
drank, or whatsoever hee was occupied
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20340:8"/>
about, strongly to imagine the hearing
of the sound of that Trumpet summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to judgement.</p>
            <p>And therefore that warning that the
wise man gevis to the youth, that thinks
their lustie age will never be spent: and
therefore giues thame selues to all licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
sensualitie:ought to bee weill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
of all: for, <hi>For all these things</hi>
(sayis the Preacher, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.) <hi>God vvill
bring thee to Iudgment. Remember thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
(sayis he) <hi>in the dayis of thy youth, whiles
the evill dayes are not come, &amp;c. The yeares
quhairin thou sall saye, I haue na pleasure in
them, whiles the Sunne is not darkned, nor the
Light, nor the Moone, nor the Starres, &amp;c.</hi>
And after a long figuratiue and very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificious
description of the decripped,
weake, and sicklie auld age, he comes to
this remembrance of death, whereabout
wee are in these wordes: <hi>Whiles the silver
corde is not lengthened, nor the golden round
broken, nor the pitcher broken at the vvell,
nor the wheele broken at the Cisterne, &amp; dust
returne to earth as it was, and the Spirit to
God that gaue it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:20340:9"/>
But let vs aboue all, giue heid to the
wholesome warninges of our Maister
Christ, and imagine with <hi>Ierome</hi> the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
to be alwaies sounding in our eares.
<hi>Matth. 24. Watch</hi> (sayis he) <hi>for zee knowe
not quhat houre zour Maister vvill come:
Of this be sure, that gif the Gude-man of the
house knewe at vvhat watch the Theefe wald
cum, hee wald surely watch, and not suffer his
house to be digged throwe. Therfore, be ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
alwayes, for in the houre that ye think not,
the Sunne of man will cum: Take heede ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
(sayis he againe) <hi>to your selfes, lest that
at any time, zour hearts be oppressed with sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet,
or drunkennes and cares of this life, lest
that day cum vpon you at vnawares, for it sall
cum as a snare: vvatch therefore, and praye
continually, that ye may be counted vvorthie
to escape, so that yee may stand before the Son
of man. Luc</hi> 21. To this same effect serues
the Parables of the Talents, and ten Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins:
for that quhilk is insisted into be
our Maister anent this point of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for his comming, hes the same vse
and weight for every ane in particular,
when Christ sall call them to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20340:9"/>
judgement, as it hes for all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
when he sall appeir to the common
and last.</p>
            <p>Nowe in this continuall meditation
of death, we suld remember, that it is the
wages of sinne (as sayis the Apostle) and
therefore the meditation thereof, suld
strike our heart with a terror of sin, make
vs earnestlie to repent all our sinnes, and
redeme the time that God spares vs, with
a richt amendement of our life, and gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delie
to gripe at the remeid, the mercies
of God plentifully offered in the merits
and death of the Lord Iesus; lest that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the death temporall, wee die and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
eternallie.</p>
            <p>Next, this vile brickle weak estate of
our life is to be weyed, to make vs eschue
pride, ambition, lecherie, drunkennes,
gluttonie, delicate feeding, pampering,
and decking of this filthie claye, and sik
vther vices of the flesh.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in that as wee brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with vs into this life, so wee are to
carry nothing away with vs at our death;
but as we cam naked from our Mothers
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20340:10"/>
wombe, so ar we naked to be laid againe
in our common mothers bellie. Let vs
learne to eschue avarice, greedines of
landes and geare, vsurie, oppression, and
all vther vnlawfull meanes customablie
vsed, for attaining to ritches and honors
in this warld; but as the Apostle coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells,
having meate and rayment be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and so passe throw thir things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
that by them wee tyne not the
things eternall. It is easie (sayis one) to
that man, to contemne all the things of
this life, quha setledly thinkes that hee
must die.</p>
            <p>Fourthlie, let vs lay as it were before
our eyes, a dead carkesse putrified, and
worme eaten, and of the foule smell and
vglie sicht of every ane of the members,
Let vs learne to eschue the vices, quhair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they are commonly instruments: as
to refraine the tongue and lippes from
blasphemie, swearing, lying, flattering,
and filthy talk: the eies from wantonnes,
and vnchast looks; the whole face from
f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rding and false shewes: the hands from
blud-shed, oppression, theft: and finally,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20340:10"/>
the feet and whole body from entering,
going fordward, and continuing in evill
wayes, against God, our neighbour, and
our selues; without remorse and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
lest a mair horrible spirituall
spectacle be seene on the miserable saul,
demayned in the hells be these spirituall
Adders and Snakes, the Devils.</p>
            <p>And last, in sa farre as death, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
fute choppes as weill at the gates
of Princelie pallaces, as at the doores of
puir cottages; &amp; taks plesure to wound
as weill the flurishing youth, as the hairy
languishing age: shuiting his darts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie,
and never missing be Land, be
Sea; be day, be night; at home, or a field:
Let all estates at all times, in every place,
learne to be ready. And this meikill for
remeid of forgetfulnes of death &amp; louse-living.</p>
            <p>Now followis for comfort aganis the
feare and force of death when he strikes.
For this purpose, wee haue often and
weightilie to considder, what a change
and cosse wee sall make, when wee sall
exchange this miserable and painefull
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20340:11"/>
pilgrimage, with that pleasand and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
habitation. For sen God first for the
sinne of ADAM, enjoyned to him his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie
in these tearmes. <hi>The Earth sall be
cursed for thy cause, vvith sorrowe sall thou
eate thy bread all the dayes of thy life, &amp; with
the sweat of thy browe sall thou feede, till thou

and commotions of the mind, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of that, quhilk daylie experience
may make vs to conceiue.</p>
            <p>Nowe, the onely rest and reliefe from
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20340:12"/>
all this, is in and be death: whereby wee
sall change these diseases in health; these
dangers, in safetie; these paines, in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
this fighting and labour amongst
deadlie enemies, in singing and honour
among heavenly Angels: And finally,
this wicked &amp; evill company, with that
most happy societie of the glorious and
blessed God of the holy Trinitie, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Sonne and Spirit, of the whole tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
Kirks, Patriarches, Prophets,
Apostles, Martyrs, and of the sweete fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of all these perfited spirits of the

even of sik as was most neere and deere
to vs in the Lorde Iesus in this life: the
want whereof, may mooue vs to like the
worse of this world, and the mair ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie
to desire to be dissolved, and to be

was it, that from thir heavens as it were,
the noyse and sounding of this blessed

quhilk the beloved Apostle of Christ
heard, saying: <hi>Blessed are thay quhilk dyes in

But go to mair particularlie, and run
throwe the ages and occupations of this
life, quhilk when the Philosophers had
done, they thought it worthier of the
name of Death than Life: and so hath a
godly learned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vttered after the sense

            <l>Vita mihi haec mors est, mors haec mihi vita perennis:</l>

driven in a hundred conceits, by

or he can taste of the sweit fruite thereof
in any honor or ease? throgh the quhilk,
gif he fall happen to escape and come to
man-heid, then is he moved to marriage,
esteemed of all at the first, merrie age, but

marred: for then vnbesets at once squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
of cares for house, for moyen of
life, for wife, for children, for honestie in
the world: thereabout are pleyis, feides,
quarrells, contentions, running, ryding,
sayling, fighting, flyting without ease or

burnings, heirships, shipwracks, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries;

wherewith the perfite age of man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
in vanitie, vexation, mourning,

age overtake him, wherein hee can
haue pleasure of nothing, wherein the
puir conscience is bitten &amp; pyned with
remembrance and remorse of the bypast
sinnes, and all the stresses and surfets of
his bypast travels, with the lead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genering
humors to corruption, so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besettis
the carkas, that there is nothing
but hosting in the bowels, yaking in the

and infinite maladies, as so many
scourges &amp; Burreaues tormenting him,
till the miserable life in end be pyned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
and expelled.</p>
            <p>SOLOMON sought out carefullie
quhatsoeuer seemed profitable, pleasant,
or might bring any comfort or content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the mind of man in this life: so
that none culd be able sensyne to match
him, to let be to go beyound him, in that
inquisition, in respect of his moyen and
wisdome incomparable, whereby hee
searched out, not onely the three greate
continents of the warld <hi>Asia, Africk,</hi>
and <hi>Europe:</hi> but also these falslie suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be new fund lands, to the quhilk
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20340:14"/>
his ships passed from three year to three:
for sa long was the voyage; and brought
Gold, Apes, Papingoes, Spyces, Odours
and al vther pretious thinges in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,
and yet he found nathing but
vanitie and vexation of spirit.</p>
            <p>Quhat vanitie, vexation, paine and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sherie
is in everie estate of life, trade and
occupation, by this ane thing is most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
that none is content with their
awin estate: but everie one esteems his
neighbours better: because he knawis it
not so weil as his awin, and conferres ay
the fasherie and bitternes of his, with the
pleasures and commodities of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
so that the only ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of things
of the warld, maks the estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them:
but when they are proven by experience
as SOLOMON assayed, they are found
to be nothing lesse, than they were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed:
so that how meikil the mair men
lusted after them, so meikil the sooner do
they loth them, and man confesse in the
ende, all to bee but vanitie, labour and
griefe.</p>
            <p>Therefore hath experience plainelie

paynted foorth the miseries of this life
by diuers similitudes, and the happines
of the exchange thereof, with the blessed
death in the Lord, the quhilk addeth on
(<hi>In the Lord</hi>) is alwais to be remembred,
for who doubts, but it is better to liue in
the most painesull estate of life: that is,
than to burne in Hel fire for euer: onelie
than tak heed, that thou die in the Lord:
that is, in the mercie and fauour of thy
God throgh IESVS CHRIST, sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastlie
beleeving according to the trueth
of the worde of God; that death is swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vp, and devoured by the death of
CHRIST, who therefore by the mouth
of his Prophet, insults over death, saying
<hi>O death, I shall be thy death.</hi> For seeing the
sting of death is sinne, and the force of
sinne (as speaks the Apostle) is the lawe;
certainelie CHRIST fulfilling the law
for vs, and satisfieng by his suffering for
all the transgressions theirof, hee hes so
now plucked awaie that sting, that it
canne no waies hurt vs: as also he hes
broken the force of sinne, that it canne
haue no power to condemne vs. And
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20340:15"/>
how be it, the decree of God be, that all
man die and turne to the dust, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie
to speake; this death in the Lorde
Iesus, is not to be tearmed death; but as
the Scripture calleth it, a sleepe. And as
Christ said to his Disciples, that LAZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RVS
sleeped: And the Apostle speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them that were departed this
life, vsed this form, <hi>Concerning them</hi> (sayis
he) <hi>that are a sleepe, &amp;c.</hi> This ground then
being layde, that thou die in the Lorde
be certaine, then thou hes made a happy
change, from miserie temporall, to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
felicitie.</p>
            <p>For in this mortallife, wee are alwaies
in Prison and bands, with the stinck and
filth whereof, we are infected and defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
pyned with hunger and thirst, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished
with darknesse, and demayned
with dolours: but by death the bandes
are loosed, the prison made patent, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
of freelie wee flie vnto Heavens,
wherein wee are receiued, cleane and
pure washen by the laver of that Lambs
bloud: and beeing cled with his white
garment of jnnocencie, wee are filled
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20340:16"/>
with delights, and findes the fruition of
the light inaccessable. The consideration
whereof, made the Apostle PAVLL
to exclayme; <hi>O miserable man that I am,
who sall deliuer me from this body of death.</hi>
Rom. 7. And earnestlie desire to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and be with Christ. In like manner
DAVID, in the difficulties of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
vttered these voyces; <hi>As the heart
brayes for the streams of Water: so doeth my
soule breath for thee ô God: my saul thirsteth
for thee ô God, even for the living God: O
when sall I go and appeir in the sight of God!

comforts him selfe in the ende of ane v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of the blessed light, as our Poet
hes expressed the sam in these verses.</p>

when this messenger death is sent to call

plane and full of consolation: the 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5
<hi>For we know</hi> (sayis the Apostle,) <hi>that gif
the earthly house of this tabernacle be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we haue a building given of God: an house
not made with handes, but eternall in the
heavens: for therfore we sigh, desiring to bee
clothed with our house quhilk is in heaven,
because that gif we be clothed, we sall not bee
found naked. But indeid, we that are in this
Tabernacle, sigh and are burdened, because
we walde not bee vnclothed, but wald bee
clothed vppon, that mortalitie might bee
swallowed vp of life: And hee that hath
created vs for this thing is GOD, wha
hes given vs the earnest of the spirit: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee are alwaies bold, thoght we know that
while we are hame at in the bodie, we are abse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
from the Lorde: for we walk by faith, and not
by sight: Neverthelesse wee are bolde, and
loue rather to remooue out of the bodie, and

tyle in great quantitie and number, and
yet to gather strawe and stubble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
or then to be scourged &amp; demay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
till wee sigh and cry vnto God, and
he send this death and his <hi>Moses</hi> for our
deliverance: wherby, bringing vs out of
the house of labour and bondage, hee
sets vs downe in the libertie of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
even in that promised <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> with
<hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> to feede with these on
the plenteous fatnes thereof, overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with milke and hony.</p>
            <p>Nowe then, by recapitulation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
the comparisons of the exchange
of this life, with that vther quhilk is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate
by death; wee may weill say with
<hi>Salomon, Better is the Daie of our Death,
then the daie of our byrth:</hi> For man is
borne of a woman in travell, to liue in
miserie, but hee dieth through Christ in
ease to liue in foelicitie; incontinent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he comes in the world, with cries he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20340:22"/>
vttereth his miserable estate: inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
after his departure, with songs hee
praiseth God for ever. He is yet scarselie
in his cradell, when a number of deadly
enemies assailes him: after his death, no
enemie can annoy him: while he is here
he displeaseth God: when he is dead, he
pleaseth him perfitlie: In this life, he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
through sinne: in that to come, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
through righteousnes: Be many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations
here he mortifieth sinne: with
infinite joyes there hee liues in holines:
heere he dieth every houre, there hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
continuallie: heere is hatred, there
is loue: heere paine, there pleasure: heere
mourning, there melodie: heere corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there immortalitie: here time, there
aeternitie: heere miserie, there felicitie:
and finallie, here can we see nothing but
vanitie, but there sall we see the Majestie
of our God: with triumphand and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
joy and glory everlasting.</p>
            <p>Is death then to be detested? suld it be
abhorred? or suld men immoderatelie
mourne for it? or rather suld it not bee
imbraced, welcommed and kissed? Sall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20340:22"/>
we lament without let, when God calles
our neerest and deerest by death to his
life? or contrariwise, haue wee not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
as the <hi>Thracians,</hi> with feasting and
gladnes to congratulate. For gif any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
be befalling therein, it is to vs, and
not to them: But so it is, as ane Ethnick
weill reasons, to bewaile our incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
and to be heavilie grieved for any
evill betyding to vs, it is selfe-loue, and
not the loue of a friend: and so to be sad
for the safetie of a friend, it is rather the
parte of ane enuyous persone, than of a
Brother or favorer: and gif so the Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks
hes ressoned, what suld become vs,
Christians? Sall we contravene that rule
of Christian duetie, lamenting for them
that laughes, &amp; mourning for them that
singes: fasting for them that feasts: hurte
our health, for them that are perfitelie
whole: weare the black doole for them,
quha clothed in white garments does
accompanie the Lamb with joy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
hee goes? For them, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
singing with the Angels. <hi>Holy, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
holy, Lorde God of Hostes:</hi> Sall we with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20340:23"/>
impatient clamours and plaintes repyne
against the will of God? And finally, for
sik as hes the blessed fruition of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
of the Father, Sonne, and holye
Ghost; of the holy Angels, Patriarches,
Prophets, Evangelists, Apostles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
and of all the just and righteous,
who hes beene gathered before to that
triumphant Kirk: Sall wee run like war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolfes
to solitarie holes and corners, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the societie of the faithfull, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
with the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
quhilk they haue in their holy mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;
namely, for spirituall exercises of
godlines, hearing of the word of conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and presenting of prayers &amp; prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
vnto God, quhilk sort of exercise and
conversation, approches neerest to the
holy occupation of them that are gone
before vs to the heavens? Na God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.
But rather, howbeit by the example
of <hi>Abraham</hi> and vthers, some thing bee
granted vnto nature to satisfie the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and bewaile the frailty therof: shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that we are not stocks nor stanes, but
touched with a feeling of the common
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20340:23"/>
miserie of mankinde: namely, because
vtherwise we are so hard harted, that we
cannot so earnestly as we ought be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued
for our sinnes: we may weill fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
our heartes mollified at sik occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
intertaine that constitution for the
exercise of vnfayned repentance. Yet
neverthelesse, we ought therewithall to
rejoyce, and praise God with gladnes of
spreit; quha hes vouchsafed in mercie
happilie and weill to direct the course of
sik persons liues, and giue them ane hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
end; praying him instantly of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable
grace, so to deale with vs also,
that following the gude example of sik
as hes tread that path before vs; wee may
go fordward rightlie and constantlie, till
wee be gathered with them to that rest,
where all together in end, we may glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our God and Father eternallie.</p>
            <p>Now it rests to satisfie such, who fears
their great losse and hurt by death; and
first them who heavily regrates the want
of their Parents, husbands, wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
brethren, sisters, speciall friendes,
and sik vthers: Let sik first considder that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20340:24"/>
quhilk hes beene clearly declared; that
they haue no cause to lament for them,
that are taken so to their rest in respect of
their estate; vnlesse they wald shew them
selues envious of their weilfare, and to
preferre our pleasure to thair so greate
profite, or to make mair of doing of our
turnes here, nor of their termeles felicitie
there; it were to shewe vs altogether ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to the loue of our selues, without
consideration of the weilfare of them to
whome we wish most weill vnto. Wald
thou desire for thy cause, and it were to
effectuate never so good a turne to thee;
that ane whome thou lovest best suld lye
in Prison, liue in banishment, enter in a
barrowis, in a perrelous voyage, in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
journey, in a pyneful thraldome,
and shamefull slaverie? Nay, thou dare
not say it, lest thou wald bewray thy self-loue,
and testifie that thou caredst not
what became of him, so that thy turne
were done. Or gif thou wilt say, I wish
him no worse nor my selfe; there is yet
no token of loue: For gif thou thy selfe
were in miserie and continuall danger,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20340:24"/>
or in worse estate than ill ynough, wald
thou so shewe thy affection, by wishing
thy friend partaker thereof? gif sik bee
thy affection, very fewe wald be faine of
it. Loue wisheth the weill, and not the
woe of the person beloved: yea, gif it be
in sorrowe, it findes the samin doubled,
to see thy friend involved in the samin e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
with it.</p>
            <p>But now I pray thee, quha hes done
this to thee? Is it not God that workes
and dois all this? Yes certainly, be what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
Instrument hee works the samin.
Dois thou not daylie pray, that his will
be done? Why art thou than grieved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou hes obtained thy prayer? Or
thinks thou indeed that he is thy Father
to whome thou hes prayed? and yet hes
done thee that hurt and wrong? Then
man he be in thy judgment ane vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and vnloving Father. Or esteemes
thou thy selfe, to wit better what is gude
for thee, nor he dois that hes made and
redeemed thee? Oh beleeues thou him
not to be al-sufficient, that can be to thee
in steed of all, and furnish thee whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20340:25"/>
thou wants? Or suspects thou his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie
and honestie in keeping his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises?
Certainly ane or all of thir man
be, or than thou art not in thy right wit,
but is transported with ignorance, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie,
follie, and blinde affections; like
vnto a beast, a babe, a foole, or a phrene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.
Therefore, learne to take vppe and
amend thy selfe, and turne againe vnto
the faithfull tread; enter into the Lords
Sanctuarie, cast vp the buke of wisdome,
learne thereof and be wise; and thou sall
cleirlie see the Almightie hes wroght it
and rightlie: he hes done his good will,
and for thy weill: he hes played the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in great favour: hee hes wrought
wisely, and thou art fond quha cannot
persaue it, in taking from thee thy lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
stocks that withheld thee fra him,
that thou may leane to him allanerlie,
and find in him whatsoever thou wants:
he hes taken on him to be a Father to the
fatherlesse, the husband to the widdow,
the friend to the faithfull, the brother &amp;
sister of them that heares his worde and
dois it: Father and mother may leaue
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20340:25"/>
thee, but he will not leaue thee, hee will
not forsake thee: The mother may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the fruit of her wombe, the husband
the wife, the Father the son, the brother
the sister; but the Lord will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
his awin: either sall hee stirre vppe
meanes for thy comfort, and make of
fremd men, fathers and friends, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kend
women, mothers, wiues, sisters, &amp;c.
gif thou be faithfull and patient; or then
sall hee worke, and perfite the worke of
his mercie in thee, and make thy saule
with full contentment to say, Thou finds
thy selfe satisfied by his al-sufficiencie, so
that thou wald wish na mair, no nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
could haue looked for sa meikill.</p>
            <p>Now the doubt quhilk remaines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,
dois furnish vs the greatest conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of all. It wald appeare, that not
without cause suld we feare, for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
of nature; and separation of the
saul from the bodie, and justlie lament
the losse of our bodies; quhilk by death
seems to bee destroyed and brought to
nought: and thereby either to be made
meat to the worms of the earth, foode to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20340:26"/>
the fishes of the Sea, and foules of the
aire; ar turned by the fearefull fire, in
ashes and smokie aire. Let vs then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

and view the commoditie and comfor<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
that redownd; to vs thereby.</p>
            <p>Certainelie, gif wee looke rightlie to
the matter, we sall finde na losse at all, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
thou wald esteeme the losse of thine
enemie to be losse: for indeed, that olde
man of sinne by death is destroyed, and
alluterlie mortified and vndone. That
poyson is put awaie, &amp; that canker con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
whereof fainest thou wald haue
been free, gif thou be the free childe o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Cod; and for the quhilk cause, inspecial
death ought to be embraced as thy best
friend, and dearelie esteemed of, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing
and slaying of thy deadly enemy.
Of whom, by no vther meanes thou can
be cleane quite but by death: for Christ
our king, by the death ouercome and
dantoned death, and made our greatest
enemie, to become our special friend; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as the fire to eate out the fire of the
scalded hand: The Scorpion to heal the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20340:26"/>
Scorpions sting, &amp; the Theryack made
of the flesh of the Viper, to abolish the
deadly venome thereof: What losse is
there in the vre cast in the fornace, when
be the fire out of the moules of the earth
thou gathers silver and gold? What losse
in the casting of the seede in the ground
and scattering in abroade, when for ane
thou resaues ten? The same losse, is in
the laying off of this mortall body in the
graue: wherefra, againe be the vertue of
Christs resurrection, we sall resaue it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,
cleane, and free from the seede
of sinne, and so from all sorrowe, meet to
bee joyned with the immortall saules, to
haue the fruition of the face and light of
the countenance of the God of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie.</p>
            <p>Then let vs repose vpon thir twa chief
grounds of consolation against the feare
of death; to wit, the immortalitie of the
saull, and resurrection of the bodies, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
to our faith, be the most clear and
comfortable passages of the Scriptures
of God. As touching the immortalitie
of the saule, the Philosophers, Ethnicks,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20340:27"/>
yea, the very <hi>American Cannibals</hi> this day
doubts nothing off. But lo, wee haue a
stronger consolation, in the blessed hope
of the resurrection of our bodies, and
ioyning of them with the saule in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
immortall, and perfite estate, to the
stedfast standing of that wark of grace, in
our whole man, body and saule for ever.
Anent the quhilk, we man speak at mair
length; because of the large and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
comfort arising therevpon.</p>
            <p>Of innumerable things in nature, the
reparation of the body of man in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
may bee easilie beleeved: for
any may easilie obserue, how of the auld
and dead grashopper, bee shaking off of
her slouch, the young dois lowpe out
fresh and able: of the swear and decrepit
cale-worme inclosed all the winter in a
sorte of shell, to flye out a faire painted
Butterflie in the Sommer. Or as the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
obserues, of nature hath left in writ:
of the seary Emmets, become winged
flyes: of the carion of a Calfe, the honie
Bees: the silk wormes lies deade all the
winter, and quickens again in the spring
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20340:27"/>
time: the Phoenix reviving out of her
owne ashes. Quha is hee that espies not
the pleasant Spring-time, and the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
vicissitude of the returning newe
yeare: wherein all herbs, trees, birds, and
beasts, begins to shewe a newe force of
nature; and brings foorth sik newe lustie
and goodly shapes, as no naturall witte
can giue the reason thereof. Seing then,
that nature produces daylye so many
things, whereof the minde of man can
conceiue no cause: quha can denie, but
the workeman of the whole world may
raise vppe againe the bodies of men, in a
mair bewtiful forme, nor ever they were
in: seeing his hande that made nature,
workes the like dailye, in nurishing and
drawing out the putrified and corrupt
seede, and making the samin to growe
vp in a pleasant herb, or a faire and great
trie; and sik like the seede of man and
beast; liquid and hin in it selfe to growe
in flesh, blude, hyde, haire; yea, in harde
sennowes and bones.</p>
            <p>And so <hi>Cyprian</hi> dois illustrat the truth
of the Resurrection, be the Apostles Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20340:28"/>
of the seede. 1. <hi>Corinth. 15. Gif any</hi>
(sayis he) <hi>wald mixe together divers sortes
of seedes, and syne sowe or scatter them on the
Earth: dois not every seede in a competent
time, according to the kinde of the awin na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
bring foorth the blade, floure, and fruite
thereof, for the reparation of the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and bewtie of that bodye that perished
of before: So also, the substance of the fleshe of
man, albeit it be diverslie deiected; vvhen it
sall please God, it sall be brought againe to life;
in that same shape, quhilk death defaced; so
that every saule, sall haue restored to it, not <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
confused, sought out, or strange body, but the
very awin selfe bodye in substance quhilk it
had before, onely far altered for the better in
qualities.</hi> Wherefore, the Apostle could
not chuse a mair fit and neere figure to
represent the resurrection, than the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of the seede sowen in the furrows
of the Land: For as in nature the seede is
cast in the furrowes; so in Christian bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
is the body laid in the graue: and as
the seed after it is corrupt and rotten, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
againe to sprout and growe vp in a
stalke, or Tree, flourishing and bringing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20340:28"/>
forth fruite: so dois the bodie fresh and
vigorious rise againe from corruption to
life: a body subject to putrefaction is laid
in the graue; but raised againe, free from
all frailtie: it is laide downe, expond to
wrack and destruction; but it is raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
cheerfull, quick, liuelie; cleane &amp;
pure, fyned from all drosse of earthlie or
elementall alteration: a little assay wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
may bee ordinarlie remarked in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
quhilk is the fore-runner, and mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
of death: for when with a feuer,
ane is heavilie vexed, his colour growes
pale, his body is heavie, his strength is
gone; and of an able man, is turned in a
lazie lump of clay; liker to a carion, than
a living creature: but in some processe of
time, by help of nature, meanes of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
and restoratiue foode, hee reviues,
and becomes lustie, gude-like, and maire
plesant and able, than before his sicknes.
So in the Resurrection, the same bodie
arises againe; but so purged, so fyned, so
strengthened and trimmed, that no ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
nor wamb of the auld corruption
or weaknes may be espyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:20340:29"/>
So then, this separation for a time is
no losse at all; but be the contrary, to the
great gude of both the partes of man: for
the body is laid at rest, free from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
not onely of sinne and al miseries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
therevpon; but also from all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
peaceable sleeping in the graue,
till that pleasant morning of the joyfull
Resurrection. For howbeit, it appeare
voide of life, in so farre as the saule being
separate, carries with it all sense and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing;
so that at last, it is putrified and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to dust: yet notwithstanding, for s<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
meikle as the power and spirite of God
that quickens all things, leaues it not, i<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
cannot be esteemed altogether separate
from life; but as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom
8. Gif the spirit of him that raised Iesus from
the dead dwells in you, hee that raised Christ
from the dead, sall quicken your mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
by the spirit that dwells in you:</hi> As also
in the former similitude of the seede is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident;
the quhilk howbeit it appeare to
be dead, yet hath it life in it selfe before
thou sowe it, and being sowne, it seemes
to be slaine and buried; but it comes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20340:29"/>
wise to passe: for out of very rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennesse,
it springs vp mair pleasant than
it was: so that it is certaine, it had life in
it, both before it was sowne, and in the
midst of the corruption thereof. And
when the Lord in his Lawe, calles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the GOD of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and
<hi>Iacob;</hi> saying, hee is not the God of the
dead, but of the living: as our Maister
vses the samin against the <hi>Sadduces</hi> for
the Resurrection: he meanes not onely
of the sauls of these his servants that wer
living with him in the heavens, but also
of their bodies, quhilk the Lord had laid
vp in the earth, with the awin sort of life
furnished thereto, by his power that
quickens all creatures, even as the seede
lying vnder the furrowes.</p>
            <p>Mairover, we being by faith joyned
&amp; coupled with Christ as these fathers,
not onely in saule for the life and safetie
thereof; but also in body, that quickning
force of his life, whereby hee raised our
nature from the death, never leaveth the
bodies of the faithfull, but with a hid,
fectful efficacie, lurkes for a while, as the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20340:30"/>
seede vnder the clod, till it spring out in
the awin tyme. And this is the grace of
God that ever accompanies it, even in
the midst of corruption, be the vertue of
that everlasting covenant, quhilk is as a
certaine spring and vaine of life, not to
the saules onely, but to the bodies also
in the midst of the very graue: For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that ground of our text, <hi>They
that dyes in the Lorde,</hi> are pronounced
blessed: Nowe, the saule is not properlie
esteemed to die, but the bodye; so that
this blessing man be on the body: but so
it is, that no blessing can be without life,
it followes then of necessitie, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
is not destitute alluterlie of life, but
hes in it, the awin sort and condition of
life, even in the midst of death: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh
through the corruption, it shews
no token of life; yet retaines it thereof a
certaine seede and vertue, quhilk in the
day of the Resurrection it shawis forth,
when the spirite of God sall put out his
infinite power, to quicken these bodies,
and raise them from the dust, to be deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with that glory promised to his elect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:20340:30"/>
Death then affrayes the godlie, but as a
bowgle that feares bairnes: as a mother
that wald put on a Maske to feare her
childe; the child behalding her so disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
cryes and flyes awaie: but how soone
the maske is remooved, and the mother
shewis her selfe as she is: then turnes the
childe againe with joye, and embraces
and kisses her. So is it indeed with the
death, quhilk in respect of the new life it
brings, may be called our mother, as IOB
said to the graue: <hi>Thou art my father, and
to corruption, thou art my mother:</hi> when we
looke on it, as it is masked with the lawe
and rigour of Gods justice and wrath,
for the transgression theirof, then is it
most terrible and feareful; But when that
maske is shaken off, and it presence the
selfe vnto vs, as it is becum to be in verie
deede in Christ: than may we run to it
and meet it, and embrace it as our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to be brought out therby vnto the
estate of a blessed life: sa that there is no
losse by it, but great gaine: for like as on

<hi>Arise my loue, my faire one; Behold the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is past, the rayne is changed and gone away,
the flowers appeir in the earth, the time of the
singing of Birds is cum, and the voyce of the

Arise my loue, my faire one, and come awaye

the prophecie of the spirit; <hi>They who sawis

carying his sheaues with dancing.</p>
            <p>Let vs then stedfastlie repose on Christ
Iesus, who in nothing did shew forth
the powe and glorie of his God-head,
fo meikel as in rysing againe from the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20340:32"/>
dead; and tryvmphing over the power
of the graue: for the same without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
is to be effectuat in al his members,
any of the quhilk, gif he suld leaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfited,
be that resurrection, hee could

vs therefore certaiuelie beleeue the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. and looke for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of our Saviour from the Heavens
at the last daie: at quhilk time, he sall
transforme our humble and mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and mak them conform to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
bodie, be that power, whereby he
is able to subdue all thinges: and let vs
marke the exhortation and consolation
of the same Apostle. 1. <hi>Thes. 4. I will not
haue you to be ignorant brethren, concerning
them quhilk are a sleepe: that ye be not sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
as those who hes no hope. For gif we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that Iesus is dead and rysen againe, even
so them quhilk sleepe iu Iesus, will God bring
with him; for this say we vnto you by the word
of the Lord, that they quhilk liue and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning
in the cumming of the Lord, sal not
preuent them quhilk sleepe: for the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
sal discend from heaven, with a shout &amp;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20340:32"/>
with the voyce of the Archangel, &amp; with the
Trumpet of God: and the dead in Christ sall
ryse first. Then sall they quhilk liue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
bee caught vp with them also in the
clouds, to meete the Lord in the ayre, and sall
be ever with the Lorde: wherefore, comfort
your selfe</hi> (sayis the Apostle) <hi>one ane vther
with these words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reason then, wherefore they that
sleepes in the Lord, suld not bee immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratlie
lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, is, because they ar to be
raysed againe, (be the word of God,) to
haue the fruitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ages that ends ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
As Christ himself hes assured: <hi>Ioh. 5.
The houre sall cum, when they that are in the
graues, sall heir his voyce, and they sall cum
foorth: they that hes done gude to the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of life: but they that hes done evill, to
the resurrection of condemnation.</hi> Now this
gude doing, is beleeving in him, &amp; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the fruits theirof, in loue and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
as he himselfe answered to the
Iewes, in the saxt Chapter theirafter,
when they asked him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>What sal we do, that
we may work the works of God? This is the
worke of God,</hi> (saies or Maister) <hi>that ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20340:33"/>
in him whom he hes sent. This is the
will of the Father that sent me, that none of
those that hee hath giuen mee should perish:
But that I suld rayse them vp in the last daie;
This is the will of him that sent me, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
knowis the Sonne, and beleeuis in him,
sall haue eternall life, and I sall rayse him vp
at the latter daie.</hi> Whereby our sweet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
brings solid consolation, vnto all
his elect and faithfull: to saue them from
succumbing in these heavie tentations:
wherewith Sathan seeks by distrust and
infidelity, grieuously to afflict &amp; deiect
the minds of Gods children. Like as hee
left nothing vnassayd against IOB the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of patience: and that in the midst
of all the righteous servands of God,
strenthened be his spirit: comforted him
selfe in the assured hope of this resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
saying: <hi>O that my words wer now writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
ô that they were written even in a buike,
and graven with an Iron pen, in Lead or in
stone for ever: for I am sure that my redeemer
liveth, and he sall stand the last on the earth,
and thoght after my skinne, wormes destroye
the bodie; yet sall I see God in my flesh, whom I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20340:33"/>
my selfe sall see, and mine eies sal behold, and
none vther for me, though my reynes be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
within me.</hi> Seeing then that all the
hope and assurance of salvation, and all
consolation, in the vtter extremitie, is
in this beleefe, of the blessed resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
let vs speciallie open this vn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o all the
assaults and terrours, wherby Sathan and
his foule spirits, seeks to subvert our
minds, dash vs with distrust, and cast vs
in most dangerous dispaire: and let vs
haue ane fixed faith, and vnshaken hope
in him, wha is the author and purchaser
to vs of this last &amp; greatest benefit, quhilk
crownes and perfytes all the rest, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of our bodies, to the life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</p>
            <p>Now, gif we wald know farther anent
the suertie and maner of the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; what sort of bodies sal be brought
thereby from the dust, meet and able to
jnioy that spirituall kingdome of glorie:
Let vs for the assurance of our faith, and
full instruction and comfort hear it out
of the plaine wordes of the Apostle, out
of the fifteenth Chapter, of the first
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20340:34"/>
Epistle to the Corinthians.</p>
            <p>But some men will say, how are the dead ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vp? and with what body, cum they foorth?
O foole, that quhilk thou sawest is not quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
except it die: and that quhilk thou sawest,
thou sawest not that body quhilk sall be, but
bare corne: As it falleth of wheat or of some
vther; but God giueth it a body at his pleasure,
even to every seede his awin body. All flesh
is not the same flesh; but there is one flesh of
of men, and an other flesh of beastes, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of fishes, and another of birds, there are
also heavenlie bodies, and earthly bodies: but
the glorie of the heavenlie is one, and of the
earthly an other. Ther is another glory of the
Sunne, and an other of the Moone, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Starrs: and ane star differeth from
an other in glorie; Sa also is the resurrection
of the dead: the body is sawin in corruption, &amp;
is raised in incorruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is sawin in dishonour
and raysed in glorie, it is sawin in weaknesse
and raysed in power: It is sawin an naturall
body, and raysed ane spirituall bodie. There is
a naturall body, and there is a spirituall body:
as it it also written. The first man <hi>ADAM,</hi> was
made a liuing saul: &amp; the last <hi>ADAM</hi> was made
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20340:34"/>
quickning Spirit: how be it, that was not first,
quhilk is spirituall, but that quhilk is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:
and afterward that quhilk is spirituall.
The first man is of the earth earthlie: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
man, is of the Lord from heven: as is the
earthlie, sik are they that are earthly, and
as is the heavenlie, sik are they also that are
heavenlie. And as we haue borne the Image
of the earthly, so sall we beare the Image of the
heavenlie. This say I brethren, that flesh and
bloud cannot inherit the kingdome of God, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth corruption, inherit incorruption.
Behold I shew you a secret thing: wee sall not
al sleep, but we sal al be changed in a moment,
in the twinckling of an eie, at the last trumpet:
for the trumpet sall blow, and the dead sal be
raysed vp incorruptible, &amp; we sal be changed:
for this corruptible, must put on incorruption:
and this mortal, must put on immortalitie. So
when this corruptible, hes put on incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and this mortall, hes put on immortalitie,
then sal this saying, that is written be brought
to passe, Death is swallowed vp in victory, ô
death where is thy sting! ô graue where is thy
victorie! The sting of deatb is sinne, and the
strength of sinne is the law: but thanks be to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20340:35"/>
God, who hes giuen victory through our Lord
Iesus Christ. Therefore my beloved brethren,
be ye stedfast and vnmoueable, abound alwaies
in the work of the Lord: for as meikle as ye
know, that your labour is not in vaine in the
Lord.</p>
            <p>Then to conclude, the veritie of this
resurrection of Christ hes wrought this
farre, that thereby the victorie and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
obtayned, over death, in the verie
darke and strongest dungeon theirof,
the graue; no Christian suld doubt of
perfit salvation of bodie and saull; but
may haue a firme and vnshaken hope,
that all sall be perfited in him, quhilk are
expressed and done by his Christ, for his
sake. So heere is the stay and solid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of our faith, grounded vpon the
death &amp; resurrection of our Lorde Iesus:
whereby he hath destroyed the force of
death, and plucked away the sting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
quhilk turned vs awaie from God,
and cast vs awaie from vtter danger of
wrack &amp; destruction. Sen we haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
obtayned so great and so sure felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
be the death and resurrection of our
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20340:35"/>
Saviour. Let vs not suffer our selues to
be carryed awaie with any doubting, or
wandring error: but let vs with all our
maine prease, to injoy the vse and fruits
of so great a gude: and let vs fixe the eyes
of our faith vpon hie, wha hes promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vs all this in Christ: wha is loving,
trew, eternall, and almightie: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
neither can nor will disappoynt vs,
seeing that of his singular fauour &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
be his Christ, raysed from the dead:
he hes regenerated vs in a liuely hope, &amp;
hes restored vs to a life, free from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of death, and hath consigned to vs an
inheritance immortall: forgiving vs all
our sinnes; and blotting awaie all hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writs
and obligatories theirof, that was
against vs.</p>
            <p>The remembraunce theirof, suld al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
walk before the eies of our minds;
namelie, when we are to enter into this
last conflict &amp; battel: wherein detesting
all the sinnes of our by-past life: Let vs
open to Sathan, death, sinne, and hel, the
infinit mercy of God the Father, by faith
in the Lord Iesus Christ: whereby salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20340:36"/>
certainely prepared, is set before vs
with stretched out armes, to meet &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
vs. So this faith and assurance of
the promised mercie and life: infused in
our hearts, be the haly spirit, is to be che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
and stirred vp in vs be all meanes,
that throw the merit of the perfit media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
we may confidently call vpon him,
<hi>Abba deere Father.</hi> Feeling that spirit of
adoption, alwaies assuring our spirit, that
he is our Father in Christ, and we are his
deerely redeemed Children, be that ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

our father hes given vs to his Christ, s<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that no power is able to take vs out of his
hand, or stoppe vs from entring into his
rest: perswading vs, that neither life nor
death, principalitie nor power: heigh,
nor lowe, thing present, nor to come:
nor na vther, is able to separate vs from
the loue of our gratious father in Iesus:
So this spirit, is the earnest of our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
putting vs even presently in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
therof: be an assured &amp; vnshaken
hope: thereby, lifting vs vp, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

terror from our conscience, &amp; makes vs
to embrace the favour and merciful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of our God, for the certain recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

offered alwaies be him vnto vs in Christ
Iesus; whome hee hes proponed, a sure

a quiet and secure minde, in sik sort, that

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20340:39"/>
and provide for sik things, as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
for the marriage, according to
the dignitie and greatnes of the matter:
The quhilk she yeelded vnto, and taking
journey about the sixt of May, shee arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
at <hi>Paris</hi> the 15. of the same Moneth,
and began to make divers walkes to and
fro, throughout the Cittie, to the houses
and booths of the Merchants and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismen,
to finde out sik things as were
meete for the day of the solemnitie; als
weil concerning the wedding garments,
and sik things as shee purposed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyne,
as vther things proper and neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>The Queene, Mother of FRANCE,
KATHERINE <hi>de Medices,</hi> seeing a great
fish fanged in her net, wald not slip the
occasioun: Shee hated extremely the
Queene of <hi>Navarr,</hi> for she had knowne
long before her notable spirit, and what
a Mother she had beene among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants:
so shee thought gif, she suld let
her liue, after that all the rest were massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
she could not eschewe a newe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of her interprise; and to slay her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20340:39"/>
the rest that were to be murdered
thereafter, vnder pretence of the quarrel
betwixt the house of <hi>Guise</hi> and <hi>Chastil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi>
she sawe not a sufficient cause to lay
the fault on the <hi>Guisians,</hi> quha had no
thing to do with the Queene of <hi>Navarr:</hi>
Also she was out of all hope to make the
King of <hi>Navar</hi> her sonne in law, so long
as his Mother lived: quha being wise &amp;
of a gude spirit culd perceiue her craft,
and make all to turne in smoke: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she hes recourse to ane Maister <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
her intertained poysoner, vppon set
pension and wages; quha had anes of
before prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to the vmquhile Prince
of <hi>Condie,</hi> a perfumed impoysoned ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
quhilk was discovered to bee so, be
the experience proven of a dogge, and
be the danger that the Princes Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was into, be smelling of the apple
over neir. This <hi>Renney,</hi> selling his drugs
and perfumed collours, and vther wares
to the Queene of <hi>Navarr;</hi> fand the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
finely to impoyson her be a paire of
perfumed gloues, quhilk the Queene
caught for her awin present vse, So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:20340:40"/>
it was, that the same <hi>Renney</hi> vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himselfe thereafter of his vassaledge,
and durst very weill say, that he held the
same Pageant to playe to three or foure
mo, that feared litle sik fashions. So then
on wednesday, the 4. of Iune, shee falles
downe sick in her bed of a continuall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer;
the cause whereof, as Mediciners
meined it, was a corruption in her pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
whereof be processe of tyme, a
postume had sprung; the quhilks being
moved and irritat be the great heate that
then was, and extraordinarie travell that
she tooke, kendled vp in her that fever,
wherof in fiue daies thereafter she dyed,
to the great regrate of them of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and joy of the secret bludy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell:
yet in very deede, the cause of her
deadly disease was in her beane, wroght
by the force of the poyson, drawne in by
her smelling. Nowe because that in her
sicknes and death, she declared by what
spirit she was guided; we haue thought
good to set down a short discourse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
quhilk may bee a patterne and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to all good Christians to follow; that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20340:40"/>
they may happelie ende this miserable
pilgrimage, and enter into that heavenly
habitation.</p>
            <p>So then the saide Queene of <hi>Navarr,</hi>
finding her selfe pressed with the evill, &amp;
that so meikle the mair as the Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
were diligent to releeue her, with
the quhilks, the Queene mother wanted
not her secreet dealing: shee perceived
that it behoved her to go into another
Cuntrie; and therefore she prepared her
selfe to receiue glaidly at the handes of
God, what it pleased him to dispone, &amp;
so resolved her selfe constantly to die,
craving ever instantly, that shee suld not
be left destitute of that, quhilk all her life
tyme she had esteemed most precious; to
wit, the consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word of God,
with continuall prayer; conform to that
quhilk <hi>Iames</hi> commaunds, that the sick
suld call for the Elders of the Kirk, to the
end, they might pray to God for them;
seeing the prayer of the just is of greate
force and effect.</p>
            <p>Following this advertisement, they
ceased not thereafter to solist her, to take
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:20340:41"/>
good courage; and to put inteirlie her
trust &amp; assurance in God, as in him quha
was the author of her life, and had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to preserue the samin. But namely, on
a certaine daye, the minister quhilk cam
to comfort her, declared to her, be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
testimonies of scripture, that it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
Christians in all things to conforme
themselues to the will of God; because
he is the Father of the faithfull: and for
that cause, crosses and chastisements suld
be suffered patiently; seeing they ar laid
on by their Father for their weill and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation:
howbeit, at some times, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of afflictions, appeareth to the flesh
to be sik; that we imagine na vther thing,
but God to bee enarmed against vs in
wrath vtterlie to destroy vs: yet we man
considder, that as he is just, hee dois no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in that but justlie: and being our
Father, he hes special respect to our weil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:
that he is nothing like the Tyrants,
that takes pleasure in tormenting and
troubling their subjects without reason;
but makes all to serue for the comforte
and edification of his Elect: wherevnto
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20340:41"/>
she answered, that shee tooke all things
from the hand of God, whome shee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be her Father; declaring
mairover, that she never feared the dead,
so farre was shee from murmuring or
grudging against God: notwithstanding
the paines quhilk she indured, knowing
that hee dois nothing but that quhilk is
good and right; so that she was certainly
perswaded, that al suld work for her weil
and comfort.</p>
            <p>The Minister continuing his purpose,
adjoyned; that it behoved to search out
the cause of sicknes some vther way than
the Mediciners are accustomed to doe;
quhilk ever respects, either the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the humors, the hurt or offence of
the noble partes of the body, or some v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
naturall cause: for albeit the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
grounds of sicknesses be there, and sik
be the second causes of them; yet wee
man go fordward to the first cause, even
toward God, quha dispones vppon his
creatures according to his good plesure;
quha by striking makes the wounde, and
syne applies the plaister thereto: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:20340:42"/>
it was, he to whom she suld addresse
her selfe by prayer to finde reliefe of her
sicknes and perfite deliverance, to whom
it were an easie matter to restore her to
health againe, gif so it were his good
pleasure.</p>
            <p>To this she made answer, that she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on nathing, saue on his onely
providence, and that she knew very wel,
that it appertained to him allanerlie, to
dispose on all things; and therefore shee
earnestly desired his Majestie, that hee
wald grant her sa farre as he knewe to be
good and necessary for her, as well anent
her bodily health, as her salvation: and
neverthelesse sayis she, This present life
for just causes, is very noysome to me; for
the miseries that I haue susteined in it
sen my young age, and namly, because I
liue not without offending my dear Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
daylie, with whome I wish to bee
with all my heart.</p>
            <p>The minister replied, that the Pagans
had taken consolation in death, in that it
was a moyen to bee delivered from the
evils of this world, but Christians ought
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20340:42"/>
to go farther: to wit, in consideration
that by death, we are not onely exemed
from thir present miseries, but also that
thereby, wee begin to enter in possession
of a better life, quhilk is the life eternall;
where God hes prepared for vs ane vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable
felicitie, by Iesus Christ, his
Sonne: even as he himselfe had taught
saying: <hi>That it is the will of the Father, that
whosoever beleeues in the Sonne, suld haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life:</hi> and neverthelesse, lang life for
as miserable as it is, ceases not to bee a
blessing of God, seeing he had promised
it as a testimonie of his favour, to the
keepers of his law, and maireover, in sa
farre as we serue in this life, to his glorie:
it suld be a singular honour, and taken of
his gude will, to haue it continued: as in
him, whom a Prince wald a lang time
employ in his service: because hee had
fund him faithfull, not for a day or twa,
but for many yers. For this cause, she suld
pray him instantly, that gif it were his
will to employ her farther in this life, for
the furtherance and increase of his truth:
and it wald please him to accompanie
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20340:43"/>
her with health and good disposition; to
the end, that recovering new forces, she
might incourage her selfe to go forward
to the end in her course, meikle mair ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouslie
then ever of before.</p>
            <p>Where vpon she protested, that her
life was of small avayll in her eyes, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particular respect of hir awin: in so
far as shee ceased not continvallie to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
God in this flesh: But she regarded
chiefely the comforts, weilfare, of the
Kirk of God vppon earth: Wherevnto
gif hir life may serue, she wald esteeme it
some-what worth the lasting. Also, that
she had some regard vnto the tender age
of her children, quhilk God had given
vnto her; fearing to see them want her
presence, in their so base age: yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles
(sayis she,) I am assured that God
wil steir vp gude instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, for the weil
and comfort of his kirke: and will also be
a father &amp; protector to my Children, as
he hes beene vnto mee in my greatest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions;
in sik sort, that I remit it wholly
to his providence to see therevnto.</p>
            <p>The Minister said vnto her, that hee
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:20340:43"/>
praised God to see her so assured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
in his providence; praying her to
continue therein, as a thing quhilk was
a good and assured mark of her faith, and
that the good Patriarches in tymes past
had done so, leaving the speciall care of
their posteritie in the handes of God, as
might be seene in <hi>Abraham, Isaak,</hi> and
<hi>Iacob;</hi> and the blessing quhilk they wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to their awin: alwaies it was very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit
that she suld chuse some persones
of good life and doctrine, quhilk might
continue in these yong Princes, the seed
of Pietie, quhilk shee had sawin in them
with so great travell and cares, hoping
that her faith and constancie in the true
service of God, suld be vnto them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of perpetuall recommendation,
to followe and imitate all the dayes of
their life: like as also it was not liklie, yea
almost incredible, but that they suld e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
haue a feeling remembrance of these
good and halie instructions, quhilk they
had so often heard, as weill of her awin
mouth, as of these whome shee had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to fashion and accustome them
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:20340:44"/>
to followe honestie and vertue.</p>
            <p>And because that thereafter shee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that she had na feare of death; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it was a passage, through the quhilk
all flesh suld resolue themselues to go.
The Minister proposed vnto her, that so
farre suld it bee from Christians to feare
death, that they suld be assured never to
dye, in respect of the saying of Christ,
<hi>Whosoever beleeveth in me sall liue eternally.</hi>
In sa meikle as death, is not properly a
death vnto the faithfull, but a sleep; as it
is often tymes sa tearmed in Scripture.
Seeing Iesus Christ for them hes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quessed
it, and led it in triumph, so that
wee may crye out with Saint P A V L, <hi>O
Death, where is thy sting? O Graue, vvhere
is thy victory?</hi> She was also often admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by him, to acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
her faults before God; telling her,
that sicknes was the way to death, and
death was the reward of sinne: therefore
this chastisement suld teach her in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
howe farre she was detfull to Gods
justice; not onely by the fall of the first
man, in the quhilk she was involved with
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20340:44"/>
vthers; but also by her owne proper of
sinne, seeing the best in the warld is but
a pure miserable sinner; and that gif God
wald punish vs according to our sinnes,
we culd look for nothing but death and
everlasting condemnation.</p>
            <p>At this purpose, shee began to lift vp
her hands, joyne them together, &amp; look
stedfastly with her eies toward the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
saying, she confessed in very trueth,
that she had committed offences with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
number; yea, and moe then ane culd
expresse; but shee hoped that God suld
be mercifull to her, through her Saviour
Iesus Christ, quha had suffered for her
sinnes, and risen againe for her justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
in whome shee had reposed her
whole confidence for salvation.</p>
            <p>This gaue occasion to the Minister,
to discourse at greater length, vpon the
assurance quhilk she suld haue to obtain
the effect of the mercie of God, seeing
that Iesus Christ had come in the world
to saue such, as acknowledge themselues
sinners, as hee himselfe had sufficiently
protested; saying, that he did as the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciners,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20340:45"/>
quha goes not to visit the whol,
as not having neede of his helpe, but the
sick and diseased: and in like maner, that
he was presented and offered with al his
goodnes and benefites to them, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
themselues empty &amp; voide
of all goodnes: of the quhilk thing, shee
suld sa meikle the mair be assured, as she
had ane inward testimonie of the spirite
in her conscience, causing her to cry <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi>
deir Father; as also her faith was no
vther thing, but ane assurance of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and good will of God, manifested
to her in his Sonne Iesus Christ; so that
she might say with the Apostle, <hi>I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that neither death nor life, nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
principalities, nor powers, nor things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
nor things to come, nor heigh, nor deepe,
nor na vther creature, suld be able to separate
vs from the loue of God, quhilk is in Christ
Iesus the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now because, that after this, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
keeped silence, fearing to annoy
her with over long discourse, because the
Mediciners had not thoght it good that
she suld speak meikle; she on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20340:45"/>
prayed him earnestlie to insist in talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her of salvation and the life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
adding therevnto, that sen she came
to <hi>Paris,</hi> she had been negligent ynough
of her duetie, in hearing of the worde of
God, for the quhilk she was grieved: yet
for the present, sayis she, I finde my selfe
greatly eased &amp; comforted be the same,
in this great extremitie.</p>
            <p>Vpon the quhilk desire, the Minister
set forth the felicitie of these happie peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
quha in the hevens enjoyed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of their God, and of all good ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting:
the quhilk was so greatly excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
that the Scripture willing to painte
it forth vnto vs, saith: <hi>That the eye hath not
seene, nor the eare heard, neither could it enter
into the heart of man, to considder what God
hath laid vp for his owne.</hi> There he added
therevnto this similitude, that even as a
potent and magnifick rich King, willing
to honor gretly some stranger, he shewes
him his Court, his Princes, his Estates,
his store-houses, and his most precious
Iewels, he intertaines him delicately, he
feedes his eies with pleasant spectacles,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20340:46"/>
his eares with sweet musick, his taste and
smelling with fragrant odours, &amp;c. Even
so, God wald some day display and laye
open his Glory and Majestie; yea, even
all his treasures vnto his Elect and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
even then, when he sall retyre them
from this miserie vnto himself, in his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
Kingdome of glory; where he sall
highlie honour them, and decore them
with Light, incorruption, and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.
Wherefore, seeing that sik was the
felicitie of the happie and glorified, shee
suld not greatly care to quyte the warld,
in sa far, as for ane earthly Realm, quhilk
she left, she suld inherit the Kingdome of
Heaven: and for goods and ritches cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
shee suld enjoye for ever sik, as
culd not wither nor passe away: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
he addressed himselfe particularlie
to her, demaunding of her, gif she belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that Iesus Christ was her Saviour,
quha had by his bluid made a purgation
for all her sinnes.</p>
            <p>To the quhilk she answered; Yes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely,
I certainly beleeue, that hee is my
onely Saviour and Mediator, and hopes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20340:46"/>
for help no where else, but only by him:
knowing that he hes satisfied for my sins
abundantlie; and I am assured, that God
will be mercifull vnto me, for my Christ
his sake, according to his promises.</p>
            <p>Behold a pairt of the good and holie
purposes, quhilk shee did vse a three or
foure daies of her sicknes: the quhilk al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
both before and thereafter, she ceased
not continually to vtter; sometimes with
great sighes and sobbes, in a most affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
and mooving manner; testifying
the great desire and hope that she had to
go to the Lord: saying oftentimes these
words, <hi>O my God and Father, deliver mee
from this body of sinne, and from the miseries
of this life, that I offend thee no mair; and
that I may enioy the felicitie quhilk thou hes
promised.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now not onely did she daily declare
the godlinesse of her heart, be sa gude
purposes: but also therewithall, did shew
a face and countenance, resolved, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and joyfull, according as the rigour
of her sicknesse might suffer, quhilk testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
sufficiently, that the feare of death
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:20340:47"/>
did no wise shake or brangill the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of her faith. At the ende of all the
conferences for consolation, they were
ever accustomed to make a Prayer to
God, that it walde please his Maiesty to
accompanie him with a constant pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and to shew his mercie and trueth
vpon her; of the quhilk prayer, it is not
by purpose to insert, heir the summe.</p>
            <p>O Lord our Cod, wee acknowledge
before thy face, that we are vnworthie
of thy great mercie, because of our jni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities:
and yet we merit not onely not
to be heard, but also to be cast away from
thy face in vtter confusion: nevertheles,
seeing thou hes promised to heare vs:
wee humbly beseech thee to forgiue vs
freelie all our sinnes, &amp; to cloath vs with
the obedience and justice of thy Sonne
our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, that
in him, wee may bee acceptable in thy
sight. O Lord, we acknowledge, that all
our afflictions cum fra thine hand, wha
art a righteous Iudge, and whome wee
haue continvallie provoked to wrath, by
infinit vices, and rebellious, quhilk ar in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20340:47"/>
vs: whose life answers nawise to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
obedience, quhilk thou requires of
vs, be the right of the law, the quhilk, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
we cease not alwaies to transgresse:
And this is it, quhilk makes vs to caste
downe our selues at this present, to bee
humbled before thy maiestie, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
in earnest, from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of our hearts, our perverse miserie:
and that all the evill, quhilk we indure in
this vale of sorrow, proceeds of this
spring; that we haue not given vnto thee
a right and true obedience: but hes gone
astray from thy pathes; Yet so it is Lord,
that ther is mercy with thee, seeing thou
art our father: and that thou wilt not the
death of a sinner: but that he suld turne
to thee and liue. This is the cause, why
we present our selues, before the throne
of thy grace: with confidence to obtaine
this great mercie: whereof, thou hes at
all times made promise to our fathers,
that it may please thee to accept the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Iesus Christ, thy Sonne our Lord,
for entire and perfit satisfaction of our
iniquities: and thou thereby, beeing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20340:48"/>
we may finde some reliefe of our
evills. The quhilk request, as thou art
God of all mercy and compassion, wee
make speciallie, for them that are vnder
the correction of thy wand, assaulted
with diuers calamities; and namely, for
the Queene here present, strucken with a
very great Maladie: to the intent, that as
it hes pleased thee to afflict hir justlie for
her faults, as she dois acknowledge with
vs: sa it wald please thee, in forgiueing
the same to her, for the loue of thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Sonne Iesus Christ: to make this
chastisement profitable for her amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and ours: Aboue all, to giue vnto
her a tast and certaine assurance of these
heauenly gudis: to the end she may mair
easilie beare and indure the bitternesse
of that cup, quhilk thou hes powred out
to her: and that we onelie desire thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
may swallow vp all the torments
of this miserie: and make her to forget all
the greatnesse and magnificence of the
world: knowing that they are nothing
in respect of these, quhilk thou hes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for her. In the meane time, giue hir
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20340:48"/>
patience in her sicknesse, in sa far as thou
knowis: that howbeit, the spirit be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yet the flesh is heauie, fragill, and full
of incredulitie, to the end, that she recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it, as from the hande of her Father,
she may the mair cherafullie, conforme
her selfe to thy holy will. And for samei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle,
Lord, as thou hes vsed hir hither-tils,
for the advancement of thy glorie, and
for the defence of thy pure people, wee
earnestly beseik thee to restore her again
to her former helth: to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that by
this default, the warke, that thou hes sa
excellentlie begunne be her, remayne
not vnperfited: but that this deliverance
may make hir heereafter to take newe
courage, &amp; imploy her selfe in the samin
better, especially, for the education and
instruction of the Children, quhilk thou
hes given hir. But Lord, gif so it sal please
thee to call vppon her, wee will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
against thy haly will: but wee praye
thee to confirme her mair and mair, in
the knawledge and profession of thy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Evangell: and of the assurance of that
salvation, quhilk thou hes giuen her, be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20340:49"/>
faith in Iesus Christ, shewing the samin
be the in-calling and sanctifying of thy
haly name, vnto her last birth. And as to
vs that ar heare about hir in health, make
vs to vnderstand the shortnes and incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of this life: to the end, we may look
as becoms vs, in this mirror: and see how
the greatest in this worlde, are subiect to
the same calamities, that the pure-anis ar
to the end, that hereafter we may bestow
the rest of our daies, on nothing else, but
on thy honour &amp; service: knawing that
nothing remayns stedfast saue only that,
&amp; the recompence quhilk thou in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
hes bestowed therevpon: and that
through the onely merits, death, &amp; Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of thy Sonne, Iesus Christ, our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
and Mediatour. Amen.</p>
            <p>Now, this is almost the summe of the
Prayer: the time whereof, while it was
directed to God, she ceased not to lift vp
her eies firmelie to the heavens: joyning
some times her hands togeither, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
sighing: Namely, when mensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made of the mercy of God, through
Iesus Christ, shewen to poore sinners; in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20340:49"/>
sik sorte, that there was none present, but
might perceiue plainly, that she follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in her heart, the words quhilk weare
pronounced in her hearing. And sa did
constantlie continue in this resolution,
to go to God al the time that she lay bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast:
taking great pleasure in the haly and
Christian declaration, quhilk was ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
made before her, be many godlie
men, quhilk came to visit her, giuing a
manifest and solemne testification of the
assurance to come, and hope quhilk shee
had to bee saved: and that be the gude &amp;
haly purposes, quhilk she did often hald
and interteine, quhilk for shortnes sake
are omitted.</p>
            <p>And albeit, the dolours quhilk shee
felt were vehement: yet so was it, that
none ever heard an vnpatient worde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
out of her mouth: yea, not sa
meikle, as be the maner of a complaynt:
like as, beside and attowre her dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stickes,
the Queene mother her selfe, the
Mounsieur, and Madame, the brother
and sister of the King, quhilk came som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
to visit her, can beare witnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:20340:50"/>
Now, gif God in the middest of her
greatest travels &amp; paines, had made her
to feele an new life: as there is no mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
so cruell, quhilk hes not some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and vexation: she gaue plainelie
to vnderstande, that shee was not vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to recover her former health, gif it
wald please God to grant it. Refused no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that the mediciners appoynted hir
to take for that effect: and againe, when
her sicknesse did increase, shee brake no
thing off of her courage, but shewed her
self to be armed with an invincible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
to sustayne the proofe of the last
combat, in preparing her selfe joyfullie
to the death.</p>
            <p>And when shee saw her women, and
and mayden-servants weiping about her
bed, shee rebuked them incontinent,
shewing them that they suld not mourn
nor lament for her, but thank God, wha
was calling her to a better life: &amp; to that
heaven of health and salvation, whervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
shee had contended: onely regarding
that shee had no time to recompence
them, &amp; many others of her domestikes,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20340:50"/>
that had awayted faithfully, and weil on
her seruice: excusing her selfe at their
hands thereanent, that it was not for lack
of gude will, but for want of time, being
taken from them in that Maladie, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse,
she sulde take the best order
therewith, that she might.</p>
            <p>As to the rest, it were lang to recite,
al the good &amp; haly advertiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
&amp; admonitions, quhilk shee gaue
to her Dame of honour, Governour to
<hi>Madam</hi> the Princesse: that shee suld re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate
the samin againe to hir, and hald
her in remembrance thereof, when shee
suld come to age, exhorting her by the
sayd Dame of honour, to shew her selfe
firme and constant, in the true service of
God; and that she suld insist with her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly
for the samin effect, taking
heed to the gude Counsell of <hi>Mounsieur</hi>
the Prince of <hi>Navarre</hi> hir brother, as also
of the woman quhilk she had appoynted
for her governour: And to follow the
gude examples and instructions, quhilk
had been giuen her in time bypast, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting,
&amp; resigning her over in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20340:51"/>
of God: with many informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
quhilk needs not be exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded any farther</p>
            <p>In the ende, feeling her selfe growen
weak, she caused make her last testament
and latter will: in the quhilk, she recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
aboue all things vnto her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
the feare and honour of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
them to persevere constantly in
the profession of the Evangell, in the
quhilk they were instructed from their
birth. Appointing namely, that Madame
the Princes hir daughter, suld bee ever
nurished and instructed in the samin: by
the foure Dames quhilk she had appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
hir for this effect; And that into the
Country of <hi>Bearne,</hi> till she cumming to
age; God suld raise vp some Prince of the
samin Religion, to take her in Marriage,
and that be the Counsell and conduct of
<hi>Mounsieur,</hi> the Cardinall of Bourbone,&amp;
<hi>Mounsieur</hi> GASPAR Count of <hi>Colignie,</hi>
Admirall of Fraunce: the quhilk she no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
&amp; established executors of hir
said testament, This Testament received
by the notars, and red over twise before
her, on Sunday the 8. of <hi>Iune,</hi> quhilk was
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20340:51"/>
the day before her death; a little after she
caused the Minister be called to her, and
having mair viuely apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of death, then of before, shee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to speake at length, of the
tentations, be the quhilk Sathan is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to assault the faith of the chosen
of God, at the extreamitie of death. So
then the Minister began &amp; shew, that in
verye deede, that was the houre in the
quhilk Sathan the adversarie of mans
salvation, layis to the moste rude and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
assaults: but even then, and at
that time, inspecial dois the Lord increse
and redouble the vertue and force of his
Spirit in his awin, to mak the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> victorious
in that combat: and as to the tentations
wherby he preases to bring them in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre,
hee layes before their eyes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
multitude of their sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and presents the samin discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before them, that they may see the
turpitude, filthines and pollution quhilk
is therein. And on the vther part, he sets
the justice of God, before the quhilk na
thing can stand that is spoted or vnclean;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20340:52"/>
wherof he inferres, that there is nathing
to be looked for be the sinner, but a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
judgement and condemnation, but
therevnto shee suld oppone in the first
part, even as DAVID dois in the 51. <hi>Psal.</hi>
In the multitude of Gods mercies and
compassions, quhilk in number exceeds
far the multitude of our sins. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
in respect of his justice, and the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
tryall of the samin: wee confesse
that no Creature defiled with sinne, can
suffer the samin, gif he sall be called to an
account; Yet he knowes, that God will
not enter into judgement with them
quhilk beleues in his Son: but imputes
and allowes vnto them the justice and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
perfited and accomplished be
him, the quhilk onely is able to answere
to his justice-Court: therefore also, in the
samin only, his elect hopes to stand befor
his face: and not be their awin dignitie
or merit; For gif they sulde compeir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the throne of God, to receiue the
judgement deserved, they suld haue no
occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but wholilie to be swallowed vp
in dispaire, so oft as they looked to the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20340:52"/>
justice of God: but when they cast their
eye on him, wha beeing the eternall Son
of God, tooke the nature of man vppon
him: and the same buir the paine quhilk
was due to vs: and to discharge and free
vs therefra; then the justice of God not
onelie affrayes vs nothing, but rather
comforts and assures vs; by this certaine
reason, that seeing God is just, he wil not
receiue nor craue the paynes of an debt
twise: wherefore having received a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
satisfaction of him, wha became our
cautioner and debter, and wha hes made
full payment for all our faults: he can no-wise
of his justice require the samin fra
vs of new againe; and for the strenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of her faith therin, she suld remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thir sentences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Esa. 53. That Christs hes
borne our sicknesse and dolours, that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of our peace was layd on him, that by
his wounds, we haue health: we haue erred &amp;
fayled: but the Lorde hes layd on him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
of vs all. That he hes payed that quhilk
he tooke not: that he is our peace and appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
towards God: that hee is that Lamb of
God, that takes awaie the sinnes of the worlde.</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:20340:53"/>
And many vther sentences quhilk the
Ministers added heere vnto; continving
the purpose lang ynough, for satisfying
of the sayd victorious Princesse demand,
&amp; craving strength against the tentation
of Sathan, wherby he preasses in time of
extremity to bring &amp; turne vpside-down
the faith of the faithful: and in the end he
concluded, that the justice of God suld
no wise bee fearefull, to sik to whome
Christ is made be God, justice, sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and redemption, &amp; wha acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
the same Iesus Christ, wha knew
no sinne, was made sinne: that is to saye,
an oblation for sin for vs, that wee might
be the righteousnesse of God in him.</p>
            <p>He added therevnto, that these things
were not spoken of all men jndifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but of them only wha beleeued in the
Sonne of God, wha reposes themselues
wholie on the merit of his death, vnto
whome the merit is sufficient, for all the
meane of their salvation; And wha con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
them selues with that onely. And
vpon that he asked her, gif shee had alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
her confidence reposed on Iesus
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20340:53"/>
Christ, Crucified for her sinnes, &amp; ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
againe for her justification. To the
quhilk, the Princesse having aunswered,
that she looked not for health, justice or
life, by any vther way or meane: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanerlie,
by her saviour Iesus Christ: and
was assured that his merit was aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantlie
sufficient for the satisfaction and
ransome of her sins: although they were
innumerable. The Minister there assured
her that she could not enter in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
but was already passed from
death to life; and tooke occasion therof,
to enter againe on that purpose, that she
had no cause now to feare the throne of
of Gods justice, quhilk was become to
her a throne of grace and mercy: &amp; that
the hour of death suld be greatumly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and desired be her, seeing in culd be
no vther thing vnto her, but an entresse
of a better life: and the houre wherin the
Lorde stretching out his armes, suld em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
her with the samin, that shee suld
continuallie meditate this excellent say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>Blessed are thay that dyes in the Lorde, so
sayis the spirit, for they rest from their labours</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:20340:54"/>
That that was the houre wherevnto she
suld enjoy the visible societie of Christ
her spouse, and suld be in company with
the Angels &amp; heavenly spirits: with the
haly Patriarkes, Prophets, Apostles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
with our godlie brethren, friends,
and acquayntance: with whom she had
comfort and joy in her life time, to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
with them the same felicitie &amp; glory.</p>
            <p>Yet the Minister going forward, and
willing yet to sound nearer, gif shee was
willing to leaue this life without grudge
or regrate: He spake thir words vnto her,
weil then Madame, gif it sall please God
to put an end by this siknesse, vnto your
earthlie Pilgrimage, and call you vnto
himselfe, as there is greate appearance,
wald ye not gladlie goe to him. To the
quhilk, this excellent Princesse, with
great courage and magnanimitie: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
astonishment, answered; yea that I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you: The Minister then said, looke
vp then Madame, with the eyes of fayth,
on Iesus Christ, the great Saviour, that
sitting at the right hande of the Father,
stretching forth his arme to receiue you
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:20340:54"/>
thither: Will you not go vnto him? Yes
I assure you (sayis she) with a very gude
wil: and a farre better then ever I remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the worlde; wherein I haue seene
nothing but vanitie. The Minister con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
not that purpose any langer, but
demanded on that, if she wald that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
suld be made, that many good folkes
quhilk were there, might conjoyne their
Prayers with hers: She answered, do so,
&amp; God stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>then me to continue in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
with you to the last breath. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
then continved the Prayer lang
ynough: all the quhilk space, this Noble
godlie Princesse, declared a burning &amp;
vehement affection &amp; service in calling
to God.</p>
            <p>Wherfore, the Minister after the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
said vnto her; that seing in her so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good and sure testimonies of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and displeasure, quhilk she had of
the offences committed by her against
God, togither with the assurance she had
of his mercy in Christ Iesus: he as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Evangell, and Ambassadour
of the Sonne of God, in the name and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:20340:55"/>
authoritie of him, quha had put in his
mouth the word of reconciliation, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her, that her sinnes were forgiven by
God, that she had obtained free pardone
of them all from him, and that they suld
never come againe in count and recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
before his judgment seate; whereof
she needed na mair to doubt, then gif the
Son of God present in his awin person
said vnto her, <hi>Daughter thy sinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen
thee:</hi> And for to rander in this case,
the puir affrayed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science mair assured,
Christ had given to the Ministers of his
word that authoritie, that vnto all them
to whom they suld forgiue sinnes in the
Earth, they suld be forgiuen in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens;
and where they suld lowse heir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
it suld be lowsed aboue; and that
because the worde whereby they vtter
the samin, is not the word of man, but of
God; having the same force, as if he had
pronounced it himselfe: for so Christ
had said, <hi>They vvho heares you, heares me:</hi>
wherevpon he demanded the Princesse,
gif she resaved gladlie this so gratious a
message of remission of al her sinnes, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:20340:55"/>
perfite reconciliation quhilk he brought
vnto her from God? Yea, sayis she, with
all my heart and saull I assure you; so that
I find na hink nor doubt thereof in my
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, my gracious father be tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ked
quha sa hes wroght in me by his gude
spirite. A little after these exhortations,
the Admiral being come to visit her, and
with him ane vther Minister, shee heard
also this vther a space lang ynough, the
Exhortation wherof, tended to the same
mark with the former, who also at the
end of his Exhortation joyned a prayer,
the quhilk also she heard with great zeal
and affection, and requested the said twa
Ministers to remaine with her all that
night in the Chamber, and not to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from her. The greatest part of that
night was spent in comfortable remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,
incouragements, and consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
quhilk was made be these twa Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
ane after ane vther: after the quhilk,
she commanded to reade vnto her some
good and comfortable places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Ane of the twa Ministers reade vnto
her, from the 14. Chapter of IOHN, to the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20340:56"/>
18. That being done, the prayer was
made; after the quhilk, the Queene desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to repose a litle, but incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
she commanded againe to read. So
the vther Minister red the 8. to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. chap. vers. 16.
to the 11. verse of the 5. Chapter, and
<hi>Psalmes,</hi> 3. 16. 17. 18. 23. 25. 31. 39. 143.
and last, 142. with vther comfortable,
&amp; ardent prayers, meet for the affliction
wherein the Princesse was: And hauing
at last red the 31. Psalme, where DAVID
commended his spirit in the handes of
God, protesting the assurance quhilk he
had, to bee redeemed by the most true
God; she commanded vpon that to make
the praier; and so she passed as is said, the
greatest part of the night: during all the
quhilk tyme, and purposes, there culd
none perceiue, that shee had any regrate
of this life: And that quhilk is mair, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
some dayes before she fell sick, shee
had beene very earnest to prepare some
pompes and magnificences to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> her sonne,
sik as she esteemed meet and proper for
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:20340:56"/>
the greatnes of that allyance, whereinto
she was entring: yet nevertheles, (quhilk
is a thing marvelous) fra the time that she
fel sick, vnto the houre of her death; God
made her so to forget sik things, that shee
never appeared anes to meane and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
any thought or care of sik matters.
This night being sa imployed and spent,
by this godly Princesse; on the Morne,
having alwaies persevered to shewe and
vtter notable signes of godlines and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
faith, she passed from this miserie to
the life eternall; randring most sweetlie
her spirit in the hand of the Lord Iesus,
betwixt aucht and nyne houres in the
morning, the 9. of Iune, the yeare. 1572.
In the 44. yeare of her age, the 6. day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
she took sicknesse: She spake very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligiblie
to the vtter hour of her death,
and shewed not onely in these thinges
quhilk concerned the salvation of her
saull, but also in all vther affayres, a spirit
and courage as whole as ever she
had in her life time.</p>
