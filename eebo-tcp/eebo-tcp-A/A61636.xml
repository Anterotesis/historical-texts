            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Account we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
here of Dr. <hi>B</hi>—'s 
Refusal of the Bishoprick
of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> hath
occasioned great Talk, and different
Censures, as men are divided in
their Interests and Opinions. I know
not what to think of it, because I know
not the Reasons for which he did it;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49491:5"/>
but it is an unhappy amusement at such
a time as this, to which a Wise Man,
who had well considered Consequences,
would not have given the occasion. I
hope it may end all in noise, without
any mischievous Effects; but consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how many there are, who are very
watchful to improve every Accident to
the Disturbance of the Government,
and to unsettle mens minds, I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
giving you my Thoughts about it;
tho my tender regard for the Person
concerned, would have made me silent
at any other time.</p>
            <p>I can easily apprehend several Reasons
which might move Wise and Good men,
where there are no greater and more pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Obligations to the contrary, rather
to chuse an Ecclesiastical Preferment
void by Death or Cession, than by
Deprivation; but our present Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49491:5"/>
are such, as ought to over-rule
all Niceties; the mischiefs of such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
being so intolerable, as nothing
can excuse, much less justifie it, but the
absolute unlawfulness of succeeding in
such Preferments, while the Deprived
Bishop lives; which would be very odd
for them to pretend, who have submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the present Government. To sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
you in this matter, I shall briefly
consider the first sort of Reasons, and
shew that they are no Reasons in our
Circumstances; and then examine the
Lawfulness of the thing it self.</p>
            <p>As for the first, It may so happen,
that the person Deprived, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be Promoted, have been old and
intimate Friends; and this may grate
hard upon the person to be Promoted,
to succed in the Chair of one whom he
loves, whose Misfortune he pities;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49491:6"/>
whom he greatly values for his other
many good Qualities: Now if to refuse
such a Preferment, would keep my
Friend possessed of it, there were some
sense in this; but I know no other
case, wherein tis thought a Breach of
Friendship to succeed a Friend in a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
which he has lost, and which
the Law says is not, and shall not be
his; when there is no suspicion of foul
play in supplanting him, any more than
to succeed a dead Friend: Friendship is
so far from being any Reason against
it, that it should make it desirable to
both; to one, That his Friend may get
what he has lost; to the other, That he
may have opportunity, if there be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for it, to make his Friend's Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
more easie, than a Stranger
would do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49491:6"/>
And if Friendship be no Objection,
What should hinder any Man from
taking a Preferment, which another is
legally deprived of? for I must take
the Legality of it for granted now and
argue upon that Supposition. We must
not take away what is another's; but
surely what is not his, we may accept
from those who have Power to give it.
If one may give, the other may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
for let the Objection be what it
will, it lies as much against the Giver
as the Receiver. They who have lost
it, want it; And what then? so do
a great many Men want what is not
theirs, what they never had, as well as
what they have lost: And must no
Man take a Preferment in Church or
State, which another wants? Must
the good Order and Government
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49491:7"/>
of Church and State be sacrificed to
the Wants and Misfortunes of private
Men?</p>
            <p>But there is a more material Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
which may influence pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and cautious Men, who are well
preferred already. The Experience of
the Revolution in 1660 hath taught
them, how dangerous it may be in
case such a Revolution should happen,
to change their old Preferments for
new Ones, which may be challenged
again by their old Proprietors. But in
our Case there is the least to be said
for this Caution, that can possibly be
in any Revolution: for it is as vain a
thing to hope to secure our selves in
such a Revolution, by Prudence and
Caution, as it is for a Man to fortify
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49491:7"/>
his House against the breaking in of
the Sea: If he take care of the
Banks, and keep out the Sea, his
House will escape; but if the Sea
break in upon him, he must perish
with his Neighbours. If there ever
be such a Revolution as can unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
what this hath done, God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to this miserable Nation; the
prudent and the cautious Sinner, and
the zealous Defenders of the present
Government, will fare much alike:
Nay, however they may flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the deprived Bishops will not
long triumph over their new Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</p>
            <p>Thus in some Cases it may be a
good Reason not to do a very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and innocent thing, if it be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mistaken and misrepresented, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49491:8"/>
give a general Offence and Scandal:
But when it appears, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Mistake and Passion, and
private Interest, or ill Designs on one
Side; and a real Scandal, and great
and publick Mischief on the Other,
no wise Man will deliberate long
which Side to take: None but the
Enemies of the Government can take
offence at any Man's succeeding the
deprived Bishops; and I think those
who have submitted to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and sworn Allegiance
to their present Majesties, ought not
to be concerned at that: They have
offended these Men already, and are
no better in their Opinion than Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
Rebels; and all that they can
now gain by humouring them, is to be
flattered, and to be laugh'd at. They
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49491:8"/>
may for a while give them some good
words, as our Dissenters did those
honest Men, who, as they thought,
conformed against their Consciences;
but they will either secretly abhor them
as Knaves; for swearing against their
Consciences, or despise them as Fools
for refusing Bishopricks. And this is no
very good Reason for a wise Man to
court their Favour.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, what an
unpardonable Scandal does such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
give, both to the Enemies, and
to the Friends of the Government,
and to the Government it self?</p>
            <p>Whatever may be pretended, the
World will not believe that Doctor
<hi>B</hi>— refused a Bishoprick, but
either out of Fear or Conscience: The
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49491:9"/>
first calls in question the Stability or
Continuance of the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the second the Authority of it.
Now this confirms the Enemies of
the Government in their opinion of
the unlawfulness to submit to it, and
encourages them to attempt its over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw;
it weakens the hands of
Friends, and makes them cautious of
embarking in a sinking Interest, and
fills them with new Jealousies of the
lawfulness of it; and what just of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
this must give to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I need not say.</p>
            <p>The truth is, were I not better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the good Inclinations of
their Majesties to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and the general Inclination of
the Nation to support the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49491:9"/>
I should dread what might be
the fatal Consequence of such a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage
as this both to Church and
State.</p>
            <p>There are always too many, who
are glad of such an opportunity to
reproach the Church, and to possess
their Majesties with an ill Opinion of
the Clergy, notwithstanding their
Oaths of Allegiance; and I confess
this gives too great an Advantage
to such Misrepresentations, were not
the Zeal and good Affection of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Men too well known, to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected;
and then I hope a single In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Folly can do no great hurt;
for that is the softest Name I can
give it, on which side soever I view
it.</p>
            <p>This plainly proves, that supposing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49491:10"/>
it lawful to have taken the Bishoprick,
no other Consideration whatsoever can
justify the refusal in our Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and I know not how to suppose
that Dr. <hi>B</hi>— could think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
            <p>He submitted to the Government,
and took the Oath of Allegiance as
early as any Man; and never, that I
heard, had the least scruple about it;
and yet this was the time to have been
Scrupulous, if He would have been
so; for it seems a little of the latest,
when He is become a sworn Subject
to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> to
question their Authority to make a
Bishop. And if the former Bishops
were Deprived, and New Bishops
made, by such an Authority as he
can swear Allegiance to, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49491:10"/>
that it can be unlawful to
accept a Bishoprick from the hands of
those whom he owns, by his swearing
Allegiance to them, to have Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to give it; for this is an Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which belongs to the Imperial
Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides this, Dr. <hi>B</hi>— was one
of those, who by Commission from the
Dean and Chapter of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> hath
exercised Archi-Episcopal Authority,
during the Vacancy of the See, by the
deprivation of the <hi>A. B.</hi> as it is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Commission; and I take this to
be altogether as unlawful (if either of
them were unlawful) to seise upon the
Authority of the <hi>A. B.</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his deprivation, as to take the
Character, and exercise the Authority
of a Bishop in the See of a deprived
Bishop. To receive the Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49491:11"/>
on of a Bishop, I suppose, is not the
thing he accounts unlawful, nor to
exercise the Authority of a Bishop;
and then there is nothing he can think
unlawful, but to exercise the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Bishop in the See of a deprived
Bishop; and then it seems to me as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
for a Presbyter to do this, as for
a Bishop to do it, unless a Presbyter may
do it without the Revenues of the
Bishoprick; but a Bishop must not do
it with them; but this can be no Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
scruple, as so great a Canonist
must needs know; for if the Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
cannot dispose of such Temporal
Matters, it can do nothing.</p>
            <p>But whatever he thought, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
a Bishoprick upon great delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
after an appearing forwardness
to take it, hath tempted people to
think, that he judges it unlawful; and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49491:11"/>
to let him see, how inconsistent this
is with his owning the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and his exercising the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>episcopal
Authority, I shall explain
the meaning of it to him, which, I
believe he never thought of.</p>
            <p>If it be unlawful to succeed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
Bishop, then he is the Bishop
of the Diocess still; and then the Law
that deprives him is no Law, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the King and Parliament,
that made that Law, no King nor
Parliament; and how can this be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
with the Oath of Allegiance,
unless the Doctor can swear Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to him, who is no King, and
hath no Authority to govern?</p>
            <p>If the deprived Bishop be the only
lawful Bishop, then the People and
Clergy of his Diocess are bound to
own him and no other; then all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49491:12"/>
who own the authority of a new
Arch-bishop, and live in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with him, are Schismaticks; and the
Clergy, who live in Communion with
Schismatical Bishops, are Schismaticks
themselves; and the whole Church of
<hi>England</hi> now established by Law is
Schismatical, and Doctor <hi>B</hi>— himself
a Schismatick, if he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with it. And thus we have no
Church, or only a Schismatical Church,
as well as no King; and all that Dr.
<hi>B</hi>— has got by refusing a Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
is to prove himself a Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
if he live in Communion; or to
make a Schism, if he separate from it.</p>
            <p>Now will the Doctor say this?
or if he dare not say it, will he dare to
think it? and yet if the deprived Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
though they retain their Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Character, have no Authority
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49491:12"/>
or Jurisdiction in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
then it must be lawful for other
Bishops to exercise that Authority,
which they have lost; and to succeed
in the Government of such vacant
Sees, unless such Churches must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the Episcopal Authority,
while their deprived Bishops live.</p>
            <p>And this brings me to consider the
lawfulness of the thing it self, which is
so evident when set in a clear light, that
it will admit of no dispute with Men
of Sense.</p>
            <p>In a late Letter said to be sent to
Doctor <hi>B</hi>— and now printed
on the Backside of a scandalous
Rhyming Libel upon his Sermon
of <hi>Restitution,</hi> he is threatned in
Case he should accept the Bishoprick,
with the Fate of those <hi>Ecclesiastical
Schismatical Vsurpers,</hi> Gregory <hi>and</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49491:13"/>
George <hi>of</hi> Cappadocia, <hi>who unjustly
invaded the See of</hi> Alexandria <hi>upon the
deposing of</hi> Athanasius <hi>the Orthodox
Bishop there.</hi> What effect this might
have on Doctor <hi>B</hi>— I know
not; but those who have used them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to <hi>good Sense,</hi> as well as to <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Canons,</hi> easily perceive a vast
difference between these two Cases, as
will presently appear. But to represent
this matter plainly and easily, I shall
briefly State the Case, and that I believe
will satisfie understanding Men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
disputing.</p>
            <p>1. First then in a Christian Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Government, the Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
into the State, and the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Power has a Supremacy in all
Ecclesiastical Causes. To deny this,
is either Popery or Fanaticism: It
is plain, the Reformation of this,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49491:13"/>
Church was founded on this Principle;
and it is the constant Doctrine of our
Articles, Homilies, and Canons, and
they are our Rule considered as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This Supremacy, though it do
not extend to the administration of
Holy Offices or Church Censures, yet
it reaches the Persons and external
Jurisdiction of Bishops, and the other
Clergy, and the Regulating and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Externals of Religion: As
the making and deposing Bishops,
when there is just Cause for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Supremacy; which Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
was exercised by the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Kings over the High Priest himself:
and to resolve all this into a meer Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Authority, is to set up a
Pope, or a Presbytery, or a National
Synod, above the Supream Power;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49491:14"/>
and we may as well say at this day,
that the Supream Power has no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to make a Bishop, because by
the ancient Canons and Practice of the
Church, a Bishop ought to be freely
and canonically elected by the other
Bishops of the Province, or by the
Clergy and People of the Diocess; as
that it cannot depose a Bishop from
the exercise of his Episcopal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
within their Dominions, without
a Synod or Council.</p>
            <p>3. When a Church is incorporated
into the State, an offence against the
State is a just reason to depose a Bishop
from the exercise of his Episcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in such a State: Especially if
such Bishop or Bishops wholly disown
the Authority and Government of the
State, and refuse to submit to it: The
denial of the King's Supremacy in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49491:14"/>
Ecclesiastical Causes, was thought a
good Reason to depose Bishops; and
to deny their Civil Authority, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more than that. This is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and evident, as that the <hi>Church</hi> is
and must be Incorporated into the
State; for if Bishops, who oppose
and disown the Authority of the State,
must not be deposed from the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of their Authority in such a State,
then the <hi>Church</hi> must be divided from
the State, and be independent on it;
such Men may be Bishops of the
<hi>Church</hi> who are no Subjects of the
<hi>State;</hi> which is a contradiction to the
very Notion of a <hi>Church</hi> incorporated
with the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And therefore we must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
between an Ecclesiastical and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
deposition of a Bishop for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49491:15"/>
Heresie, or other Ecclesiastical Crimes;
and a State deprivation. The first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the Character, and Ecclesiastical
Communion; it is the censure of the
Church, which concerns him as a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop;
and when it is ratified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
not only by a Provincial or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Synod, but by a General
Council, such a deposed Bishop is no
longer a Bishop of the Catholick
Church, and no Christian must Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with him as a Bishop: But
a State-deprivation does not concern
the Character; such a Man may be
a Bishop of the Catholick Church
still, if he do not fall under Church-Censures,
for Heresie or other Crimes;
but it only concerns the Exercise of
his Episcopal Authority in any Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
within the Dominions of that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49491:15"/>
State, or enjoying any Ecclesiastical
Benefice in it. And if we will not
allow the Supreme Power of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to judge, who shall be Bishops in
their Dominions, and enjoy the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of the Church, which are the
Gift of the State; you leave the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Power no Authority or Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
over Ecclesiastical Persons.</p>
            <p>5. And this makes a great difference
between succeeding an Orthodox Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
uncanonically deposed, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
an Orthodox Bishop depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by an Act of State. If a Bishop
be deposed by an Heretical Synod
upon false suggestions, and publickly
known to be false and malicious, and
be own'd and acquitted by a <hi>Council</hi>
of Orthodox Bishops, it is Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to invade his See, a breach of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49491:16"/>
               <hi>Catholick Communion,</hi> and a Schism
in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which was
the Case of <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>George</hi> of
<hi>Cappadocia,</hi> who succeeded him: But
if a Bishop otherwise Orthodox, is
guilty of such an Offence against the
State, that he is deprived of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of his Episcopal Office, neither
the <hi>Faith</hi> nor the <hi>Communion</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> is concerned in it, but only
the Authority of the State, which
obliges both the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>the Laity</hi> in
such cases; and when neither the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Faith</hi> nor <hi>Catholick Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
are concern'd, it can be no Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Offence to succeed in such a
Bishoprick, but a due submission and
compliance with that Authority, to
which the <hi>Church</hi> in a Christian Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ought to be subject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49491:16"/>
The reason why these Matters
are not so acurately distinguished by
some Men, is because they were not
at first distinguished when the Empire
became Christian, and the <hi>Church</hi> was
at first Incorporated into the <hi>State.</hi>
The Zeal of the Christian Emperors
for the Service of the <hi>Church,</hi> and
that great Opinion which at that
time they deservedly had of the Piety
and Prudence of the Governours of
the <hi>Church,</hi> made them leave the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the <hi>Church</hi> in the same
state they found it in, when the
<hi>Church</hi> was a distinct Society from
the <hi>State;</hi> and in consequence of this,
they reserved all Causes relating to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
to the Cognizance of their own
Synods, without distinguishing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Offences against the State, which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49491:17"/>
properly belong to a Civil Cognizance,
and those which were of a pure Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Nature. This soon created
great trouble to Princes, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
grew into the Omnipotent Power
of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neered
over Emperors themselves, and
set the <hi>Church</hi> above the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reformation of our Church
began with the Reformation of this
Abuse and Church-Usurpation, and
restored our Princes to that Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which both the Laws of God,
and the reason and nature of Sovereign
Power gives them over all Persons, in
all Causes, as well Ecclesiastical as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:
And now an Offence against the
State, is as just a Reason for a State-Deprivation
by the sole Authority of
the State, without the Authority of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49491:17"/>
Synods or Councils; as Heresie and
Schism, and other Crimes are of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Censures.</p>
            <p>This Authority, as I observed before,
the Jewish Kings exercised even over
their High-Priests, as <hi>Solomon</hi> deposed
<hi>Abiathar</hi> for following <hi>Adonijah</hi> to
make him King, and placed <hi>Zadock</hi>
in his stead; which was a pure State-Quarrel,
and done by his sole Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
without consulting the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi>
in it. Thus when <hi>Iudea</hi> was under
the Government of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they
changed the High-priests every Year;
tho by the Institution of God it was
for Life; and this in our Saviour's
Days, who never reproved them for
it, nor separated himself or his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
from the Communion of such
<hi>Schismatical Vsurping High-priests,</hi> who
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49491:18"/>
succeeded in the places of their living
Predecessors without a Canonical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> at this
Day makes and unmakes the Patriarch
of <hi>Constantinople</hi> at pleasure, and no
Man blames the Patriarch who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> in his Preface to the
<hi>Case of Allegiance,</hi> took notice of this
as matter of Fact, without enquiring
into the Reasons. His Answerer had
nothing to return to it, but by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the legal Authority of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
which is just nothing to the
purpose: For if a legal Government,
by their Authority and Supremacy,
can depose Bishops, and promote New
ones; then all their Arguments against
succeeding in the Sees of such Bishops
as are not Canonically deposed by an
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49491:18"/>
Ecclesiastical Authority, are utterly
lost; and besides that, if this Answer
be good, no man ought to question
these new Promotions, who owns the
Authority of the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the same Objections
which are now made against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of these new Bishops, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
strong, and as eagerly urg'd at
this Day by the Papists against our
first Reformers: For they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
to Bishopricks, while the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Popish Bishops were living, and
not Canonically deposed by any Act
of the <hi>Church,</hi> but only by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the <hi>State;</hi> and there denying
the Supremacy of the King, was one,
and none of the least of those Doctrines,
which they were deposed for; and yet
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49491:19"/>
that only rejects the King's Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Authority; and therefore as it is
only an Offence against the State, so
it is a much less Offence, than utterly
to renounce their Authority in Civil
and Ecclesiastical Causes, as our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
Bishops now do.</p>
            <p>I shall not need to enlarge on these
things, which are plain and obvious at
the first Proposal: If you have any
opportunity of seeing Dr. <hi>B</hi>—,
desire him to consider again of it;
and though he may repent too late
to do himself any good; yet if he
discover his mistake, common Justice
to the Government, under whose Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he lives, and to Their Majesties,
to whom he has sworn Allegiance, and
who had placed such a Mark of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Honour on him, had he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49491:19"/>
known how to value it, obliges him
publickly to own his Mistake, which
is the only recompence he can now
make. I am</p>
