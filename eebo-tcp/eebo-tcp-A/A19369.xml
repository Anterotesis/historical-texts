            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, I had rather you miſliked my labour, than miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted my good will. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being often preſſed with your deſires, I haue heere brieflie collected the rules of horſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, according to Claudio Corte in his ſecond booke.</p>
            <p>I haue not Engliſhed the author at large, nor medled with his manifold digreſsions; neither haue I ſpoken of all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the ſaid ſecond booke: but onelie thoſe that concerne the making of horſſes for ſeruice. I haue alſo left that part vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched,
<pb facs="tcp:421:3"/>
which intreateth of bitting the horſſes, bicauſe the ſame hath beene long ſince verie ſubſtantiallie handled by Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Blundeuile.</p>
            <p>And ſurelie, albeit in this hir Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties most proſperous and peaceable reigne, the Gentlemen of this land haue ſtudied to make horſſes more for pleaſure than ſeruice: yet who ſo ſhall truelie conſider to what end horſſemanſhip tendeth, muſt needs knowe, that the principall vſe of horſſes is, to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell by the waie, &amp; ſerue in the war: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer your horſſe learneth more, is rather for pompe or pleaſure, than honor or vſe. Yet doo I thinke it allowable and therewith commendable, that ſome horſſes (cheeflie of Princes &amp; great perſonages hauing ſtore) ſhould be inſtructed in thoſe ſingularities, and exquiſite motions for pleaſure, as well to delight the lookers on, and make proofe of
<pb facs="tcp:421:3"/>
the riders excellencie; as alſo thereby to ſhew the capacitie of the beaſts.</p>
            <p>By theſe few words you can conceiue the ſubſtance of my labour, which I haue taken in hand rather to content you, than acquit my ſelfe with commendation. For although ſome men ſuppoſe it an eaſie thing, to reduce the conceipt of anie author into an other language; yet am I aſſured it behooueth him not onelie to haue an exact vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that toong, wherein the author wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but alſo apt words, and fit phraſes in his owne, to expreſſe the ſame. Which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the more hard, if the matter be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratiue and artificiall (as this is) conteining diuers particular termes in our Engliſh not to be expreſſed.</p>
            <p>It ſeemeth therfore, that whoſoeuer ſhall, either by waie of tranſlation or abbreuiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſet downe the conceipt of this author, it
<pb facs="tcp:421:4"/>
behooueth him to be fullie informed of his meaning, and well exerciſed in the Art of Riding: in both which I must confeſſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſolute ignorance, or ſimple know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. In reſpect whereof, I praie you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe this booke when you haue peruſed it, or elſe preſerue it at your owne perill.

Which hath moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me (diuers times) to wiſh, that ſome one able to performe it, would take in hand to tranſlate into Engliſh ſome part of thoſe workes, for common benefit, thereby to encourage our Gentlemen to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe horſemanſhip, not onelie for the ſeruice of their countrie (if need ſo require) but alſo for their owne exerciſe, as an ornament of greatest commendation in men of their profeſſion.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ith contrarie to my deſire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation this tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of horſeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is happened into the Printers hand, I haue thought good to remember the readers, that albeit Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, Griſon, Claudio, and others (men most excellent) haue preſcribed ſundrie rules and meanes how to handle horſſes, &amp; ride them with good grace and ſeemelines; yet if the ſame be not confirmed by vſe and practiſe, it prooueth vnprofitable &amp; to none auaile at all. I wiſh therfore that all Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen &amp; others deſirous of that knowlege, ſhould not onelie read, but alſo exerciſe the rules in this booke preſcribed. For as in all
<pb facs="tcp:421:6"/>
other ſciences demonstratiue, ſo heerein vſe and experience ſurmounteth all conceipt &amp; contemplation, which is apparentlie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in thoſe that haue therevnto applied themſelues.</p>
            <p>And ſurelie I ſuppoſe (be it ſpoken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offenſe of time past) that this art hath neuer beene (I meane within this realme) of that perfection it now is; neither were the horſſemen of former ages, equall or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to ſome now liuing, ſith they wanting both demonstrations, and skilfull instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, could not by poſsible meanes atteine therevnto. For, before M. Blundeuile, I find not anie that haue written in our toong: neither were the teachers of that time of much knowledge. Where now, cheefly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hir Maiesties most proſperous reigne, (incouraged by the valorous diſpoſition of ſo excellent a Prince) diuers haue aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to write, &amp; many vertuous Gentlemen
<pb facs="tcp:421:6"/>
with ſingular commendation, atteine to great knowledge.</p>
            <p>Ouerlong it were to reaccount the names of all Noblemen and Gentlemen, that in this age haue aſpired to ſingular skill in horſman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which I impute cheeflie to the imitation of great perſonages. I wiſh therfore that they, and al other Gentlemen ſhould (both for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat exerciſe &amp; publike reſpect) applie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the ſtudie and practiſe of this art, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of that honorable perſon the Earle of Leicester, who among manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertuous qualities both of mind &amp; body, hath indeuored to atteine ſo great excellencie in this art, as for his iudgment, cunning and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lines in riding, he meriteth the priſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Which appeereth not onlie in his owne perſon, but alſo in his choiſe of the eſquires &amp; riders of hir Highnes ſtable, all men of great knowledge: and ſome of them of ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie as may not be matched. I could alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
<pb facs="tcp:421:7"/>
the names of diuers other Gentlmen very skilfull &amp; commendable, which the rather to auoid enuie I omit. Yet may I not forget the praiſe due to thoſe that be teachers of this art in the citie of London; for by their industrie and vertue, the number of ſeruiceable horſſes &amp; horſſemen is dailie increaſed: &amp; ſhould be more, if other skilfull men would applie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to teaching in that maner.</p>
            <p>Thus much I haue thought good to ſaie, as well to excuſe my ſelfe (hauing written this worke onlie to ſatiſfie my priuate friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest) as to admoniſh the Readers therof, in any wiſe to accompanie their ſtudie and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with dailie vſe and experience, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of aſſuredlie great knowledge and excellencie will enſue.</p>

Sith then eueric horſſe hath this propertie by nature, by ordinarie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the hand of man; it is neceſſarie that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer (or for the moſt part) he ſhould begin &amp; end his turnes on the right hand. And for as much as euerie motion is more violent towards the end than in the beginning or middeſt thereof; it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the horſſe will end his turnes ouer ſpeedilie on that hand, whervnto he is by nature moſt inclined, vnleſſe he be diſcreetlie reſtrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the riders hand.</p>
            <p>I would likewiſe aduiſe you, that when ſo euer anie horſſe, either at his firſt riding, or after, ſhall <note place="margin">What is to be doone, if a horſſe leane more on the one ſide than on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</note> leane more on the one ſide than on the other, or that he holdeth his necke on the one ſide (for ſome horſſes be foled contrarie to that we haue ſpoken, with there noſe or necke turned rather to the right ſide than the left) that then you ſhall vſe to turne him from that he is naturallie incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſo both in the beginning and ending make his turnes. As for example: if he leaneth or turneth his head towards the left hand, then ſhall you in turning or managing begin and end on the right hand; and contrariwiſe, if he leaneth to the right hand, then to begin and end on the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:421:10"/>
left hand. Now hauing finiſhed the number of turnes in the large rings, you ſhall with ſome ſpeed &amp; more franklie trot your horſſe ſtraight foorth the length of a iuſt manage, ſtopping him betwixt the two ſmall rings; where pauſing a while, &amp; cheriſhing him with your hand, returne him in that ring which is on the right hand, and then paſe him two or three turnes, changing your hands as you did in the large rings: ſauing that in the end you ought to be in the ſame place where you ſtopped, and began to enter the turne.</p>
            <p>You muſt alſo remember, that as well in the large as the narrow rings, your horſſe in the end ought euer to go and turne with more franknes and ſpeed. Then hauing ſtaied a while, to cheriſh him; you ſhall cut the narow ring in the midſt, and from thence trot your horſſe to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie place of diſmounting: yet before you alight, faile not to make much of him, and once or twiſe aduaunce your ſelfe in the ſaddle, to the end your horſſe may ſtand firme, which doone you may gentlie alight, but not preſentlie ſuffer the horſſe to depart from the place. Thus it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the conditions and nurture which you teach your horſſe at the beginning, ought to be good and profitable. I deſire therefore, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:421:11"/>
aboue all things horſſes ſhould at the firſt bee taught gentlie, and with great patience.</p>

Now to make ſome demonſtration of the forme of the ſaid rings, behold this figure which is the ring: <figure/> and the line that diuideth it in the mideſt is the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or wideneſſe thereof. But you muſt note, that the wideneſſe of the ſmall rings ought not to be much more than one elne. And to the end you may the better conceiue how the rings

ſhould be made, where to enter, where to come out, and how to exerciſe your horſſe in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the demonſtration or figure ſet downe in the end of this chapter.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, that ſome riders accuſtomed vnto two rings will accompt this figure of three large and three ſmall, to be a thing moſt ſtrange: and where they commonlie doo vſe foure turnes on euerie hand, I would haue onelie three, or rather but two. Notwithſtanding, if they pleaſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mine intent, they ſhall find I haue framed this forme of turnes, to eſchew weariſomneſſe both in the rider and in the horſſe, who (cheefelie if he be yoong) will lightlie forget what he ought to doo. Wherefore in my iudgement, theſe rings (though more in number) will not ſo much buſie the memorie neither of the horſſe nor the rider. Beſides that, you may perceiue how in theſe three large rings you may conuenientlie handle two horſſes at one time: which within two rings cannot be ſo conuenientlie doone. I ſhall not need to ſet downe anie entrie or going out of theſe rings or turnes; for whereſoeuer you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you ought alſo to paſſe out: and in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion euerie horſſe in the beginning, and after, dooth prooue better, being vſed to few turnes than manie on one hand. I haue ſet out the three
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:421:12"/>
ſmall turnes, to be vſed with the ſame order: which you may exerciſe or not, as by your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion ſhall be thought meete.</p>
            <p>Touching the profit which proceedeth of <note place="margin">The profit of trotting the rings.</note> trotting the rings, I ſaie that it bringeth the horſſe to be well breathed, it maketh his ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and legges nimble, it ſetleth his head and necke, it maketh him to beare light on the hand, it giueth him heart and courage, it maketh him willing to turne on either hand indifferentlie, it correcteth all euill conditions, and the horſſe becommeth more apt and diſpoſed to the ſhort turnes, and euerie other kind of manage.</p>
            <p>The vſe of the ring is neceſſarie for skirmiſh, <note place="margin">The mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold vſe of the rings.</note> for battell, and for combate, either offending or defending. It is alſo a comelie ſight in the rider, and ſtandeth him in ſteed for the exerciſe of the turneie, and all other feats of armes. Moreouer, it is a thing that naturallie horſſes doo loue: which is prooued, in that the yoong foles, ſo ſoone as they are borne, doo preſentlie runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, plaieng as it were in circular wiſe. I doo therefore conclude, that the ring turnes are things of much importance.</p>

Then when you haue brought him as it were within the compaſſe of an elne, you ſhall change hand, by litle &amp; litle, inlarging the ring till you come vnto the ſame wideneſſe wherein you began: and there vpon the ſame hand you ſhall put him ſtraight into the other <hi>Caragolo;</hi> wherein being, you muſt vſe the ſame order which you did in the former; reſtraining or drawing in the horſſe as afore. This doone, turning towards the right hand, you ſhall gather into the ſtreightnes of the other <hi>Caragolo:</hi> which order you ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue,

ſo long as by your diſcretion ſhall be thought fit. Then ſhall you (hauing firſt giuen your horſſe breath in the middeſt of the <hi>Carago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo)</hi> put him foorth and ſtop him.</p>
            <p>Then pawſing a while in that ſmall ring, you ſhall giue the horſſe two or three turnes, leaning on that hand which you thinke fitteſt.

The profit that commeth by this kind of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage is great, and much greater than that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth through vſe of the rings aforeſaid: for it worketh all thoſe effects which they doo, and with more facilitie reduceth the horſſe to good order in turning and managing. Beſides that, the ſame is a motion ſightlie and pleaſing: for it cannot be denied that to turne in the beginning large, and ſo by little and little reſtraining the horſſe, firſt paſing, next trotting, and laſtlie galo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping eaſilie or frankelie, is a motion verie ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and contentfull to the lookers on. Alſo ſuch an artificiall kind of manage ſheweth great apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, nimblenes, courage, ſtrength &amp; obedience in the horſſe, likewiſe much skill and order in the rider.

            <p>The waie ſo to doo, is to cut the S in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and at the end of the turne make a ſtraight ring, and from thence paſſe right foorth to ſtop at the end of the S, cutting the figure in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, which dooing two or three times in the ſelfe ſame path, at the laſt you muſt make half a turne and then departout.

From this time foorth you may vſe a rod; and when ſo euer he committeth anie fault, preſentlie correct him therewith, &amp; accompanie your correction with your voice. As for example: if he goeth not well forward, you may with a certeine cherk of your lips prouoke him forward, adding therto a ſtripe or two with your rod vpon his bellie, iuſt betwixt the ſurſingle and your heele: whereby he ſhall at one inſtant, or at ſundrie times, taſt of three cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
            <p>So ſoone as the horſſe trotteth well, ſtoppeth and can make his large rings iuſtlie, you may put him vpon the cannon, which would be ſomwhat worne before, ſuffering the curbe to be verie
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:421:19"/>
looſe, and the reines verie ſlacke. But after from time to time you may gather them vp by little and little, drawing them to the iuſt length, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the curbe and cannon to ſtand in the true place.</p>
            <p>And to the end the horſſe may become the more aſſured and accuſtomed to the bridle, you muſt (while he is warme and doing his ordinarie leſſons) faire and eaſilie by degrees drawe the reines to the true length, and then with diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtraine them more or leſſe, till the reines be brought to the iuſt length, and the curbe vnto the true place.</p>
            <p>If the horſſe ſhall not go in the rings as he ought, but leaneth more on the one hand than on the other, or goeth out of the path; then muſt <note place="margin">The vſe of the rod, the heele, and the voice.</note> you helpe him both with the rod, your heele, and voice altogether: which muſt be doone in this caſe, according to the rings and the qualitie of the fault committed. As for example: if you would incourage the horſſe to go with more ſpeed, ſaie, <hi>Via, via,</hi> beating him on the contrarie ſhoulder with the rod: and if you would yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his ſpeed, then ſay, <hi>Via, via, via,</hi> &amp; in the ſame inſtant ſtrike him on the contrarie ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and likewiſe with the contrarie heele.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, it ſeemeth in mine opinion verie
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:421:20"/>
conuenient, when you trot the ring vpon the right hand, that then notwithſtanding you keepe the reines iuſt, yet you ſhould raiſe the right hand ſome what aboue the left, and alſo a little aloofe from it; to the end you may carrie the rod with the point thereof towards the left ſhoulder. Beſides that, whenſoeuer a greater helpe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, you muſt raiſe your right hand much higher, beating the horſſe as it were with the whole rod vpon the ſame ſhoulder. Then chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hands, with the ſelfe ſame order you ſhall turne the rod towards the right ſhoulder, from time to time touching the horſſe vpon the ſame ſhoulder, and (deſeruing it) to vſe greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>True it is, that theſe corrections ought to be <note place="margin">The vſe of the forſaid correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> vſed, rather to enforme the colt how to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the firſt leſſons, than for the correction it ſelfe.

               <p>How to teach your horſſe to retire or go backe, and the commoditie thereof.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Icauſe I am hereafter to ſpeake of retiring, it ſeemeth fit to enforme you what profit it carrieth, and how to make your horſſe doo it. When you haue gone forward ſo farre as we haue before aſſigned, you muſt aſſaie faire &amp; ſoftlie to draw in the reines of the Cauezzan, which muſt be done with both hands euen toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, holding them lowe towards the horſſes ſhoulders, drawing him backe two paſes. But if the horſſe reſiſteth, then doo not in anie wiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force him, but cauſe ſome footeman that hath knowledge, to come neere, firſt to cherriſh the horſſe, and then faire and eaſilie to laie hand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reine of the Cauezzan, gentlie putting him backe: which your ſelfe muſt alſo doo at the ſame inſtant. But that not ſufficing, let the ſaid footeman with a rod lightlie ſtrike him on the knees and forelegs, not rating him, but ſpeaking gentlie, and then he will perhaps with leſſe a doo than we haue ſpoken retire willinglie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:421:21"/>
But though it fortune that all theſe meanes will not preuaile, yet vexe not the horſſe in anie wiſe, either with pulling or beating; but after you haue trotted him a good ſpace about, and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him, doo thus. Firſt offer him to go backe; which if he refuſe to doo, cauſe him to trotſtrait foorth in ſome euen ground; &amp; hauing ſtopped, ſuddenlie offer him to retire: and I am ſure he will either the firſt, ſecond, or third time doo it, though not the ſame daie, yet the next daie after.</p>
            <p>But note, that if the horſſe, which hath worne a <note place="margin">The vſe of correction when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.</note> cannon and a ſadle, doo hap to haue ſo great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie or diſobedience, as he refuſeth to go backe, you may not then vſe ſo manie faire meanes or reſpects, but ſhall emploie the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions due vnto that diſobedience: as beating on the legs, quiching with the Cauezzan, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with the one, ſometimes with the other hand, and ſometimes with both together: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo giue him a chocke or two with the bridle, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng; Retire, retire: or, Backe, backe.</p>
            <p>And if it ſo be, that all theſe corrections will not force him to retire, then muſt ye diſmount, &amp; take one reine of the Cauezzan in your hand, cauſing an other footeman to laie hold on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and betwixt you force the horſſe gentlie to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:421:21"/>
go backe, and in the ſame inſtant ſtrike him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the knees, accompanieng thoſe ſtripes with your voice.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, if all that you can doo will not bring him to retire, yet ſtaie firmelie in the ſame place, and aſſaie once more patientlie to put the ſame correction in vre, offring the horſſe to go backe: and if he ſo doo, put him forward againe to the ſame place, and then mount on his backe, and you ſhall find him preſentlie content to retire: which dooing, you muſt make much of him, both by your voice and hand, and once more put him backe. Marie if he refuſe, then preſentlie alight, and doo as you were woont, correct him on foot, till he becommeth obedient: for ye ſhall be ſure within two or three mornings, he will doo as you will haue him, or perhaps within an houre. You muſt in no wiſe vſe theſe extreame corrections, as chocks with the bit and Cauezzan, to anie colt that weareth no bit, ſeeing they are fit for horſſes of more continuance, &amp; vſed to the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: but I thinke for horſſes that beare the bit, and become diſordered, correction would be performed with terror.</p>
            <p>Touching the commodities that proceed of <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of retiring, &amp;c.</note> retiring, or putting the horſſe backe, they be more than euerie man conceiueth. For retiring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:421:22"/>
maketh the horſſe light vpon his ſtop, and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in beſtowing his legs in all his dooings. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that, if he happen into ſuch a place as he can neither go forward nor turne, it ſtandeth him in great ſteed to retire directlie. It helpeth him alſo in the motion of his ſhoulders and legs, to make him ſlide on his heeles and ſtop well. And aboue the reſt, it is of moſt neceſſitie to make him firme and ſtaied vpon the bridle, &amp; alſo go light vpon the hand. All which things, with diuerſe others, how neceſſarie they are, I leaue to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of euerie diſcreet horſſeman.</p>

Notwithſtanding, hee would haue him continued in his ordinarie leſſons, thereby to increaſe his breath by little and little; alſo to vſe him to ſtop &amp; retire, not forcing much, though all this while he be not ſtopped vpon anie hanging ground,

bicauſe it maketh a colt fearefull in ſtopping, &amp; alſo ſtreineth his ſinewes, ioints and loines. But when he knoweth perfectlie how to ſtop and go backe, you muſt euer after euery ſtopping make him retire two or three paſes, foorthwith putting him as much forward, and then for a while ſtand firme.</p>
            <p>And for as much as I ſuppoſe, that in theſe two moneths, your horſſe will go well &amp; ſtaied vpon the canon, I would wiſh you to bring him into ſome place of good ground for a carriera, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing on the one ſide ſome wall, pale, or banke. It were alſo verie conuenient, that at the end of the carriera, the ground were ſomewhat declining: wherein hauing trotted your horſſe two or three times after his ordinarie leſſons, you ſhall ſtop, retire, and cheriſh him, which done, you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe, paſing him ſomwhat liuelie, aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing your bodie, and ſuddenlie put him foorth vpon his trot, and franklie fall into a gallop, till you come at the end of the carriera.</p>
            <p>Then hauing there ſtopped and made him go backe, as he was woont, you ſhall returne vpon a ſhort &amp; liuelie trot. And being come to the end of the ſtop, againe in the ſame order and turning backe you ſhall put the horſſe foorth in his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, and towards the end of the carriera increaſe

his gallop with ſome franknes: which I wiſh you ſhould continue to doo two or three mornings, euerie daie increaſing the number of your gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping courſes.</p>
            <p>And bicauſe it may be that the horſſe before he hath paſſed halfe the carriera, will of him ſelfe force to make more ſpeed than is fit, not ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng till you put him forth, you ſhall hold him in with a ſtaid hand, till ſuch time as your ſelfe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good, &amp; then ſuddenlie thruſt him forward to gallop, holding both the reines and Cauez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan firme and well, euen towards the end, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him to go with more ſpeed and liuelineſſe, &amp; then at the due place to ſtop. Which you may doo, in thruſting the horſſe by little and little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, keeping your bodie ſomewhat backward, and holding your legs ſtraight ſtretched out, drawing the reines and Cauezzan faire and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie, till the horſſe ſtoppeth iuſt.</p>
            <p>Then hauing ſtopped and doone all thoſe things before ſaid, you ſhall returne to the other end of the carriera, obſeruing the like order: where hauing ſtaied a while, &amp; turned &amp; ſettled both your perſon and horſſe, you ſhall put him foorth with more ſpeed than in the former gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, &amp; being halfe waie, fall into his full carriera, and therein continue to the end, helping him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>How to ride a horſſe with the ſadle, and what obſeruations are therein to be vſed.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter you haue thus han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled your colt two moneths, and ridden him in the pad; you may put on a ſadle, which you ſhall firſt in the ſtable doo faire &amp; gentlie, letting the ſtirrups hang cloſe to his bodie. Then you ſhall ſuffer the ſadle in this ſort ſetled to ſtand vpon the horſſe backe the ſpace of one whole houre, with the reines turned vp vpon his necke, and the curbe hanging by looſe. The head of the horſſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:421:24"/>
muſt be turned downewards from the manger, and his head tied on either ſide with the cords of his Cauezzan. But before you thus doo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to annoint the mouth of the bit with vineger and honie in the winter, and in ſummer with wine and ſalt.</p>
            <p>The next daie you ſhall tie vp the curbe as it ought to be worne; and therein you muſt take great heed: for commonlie the horſſekeepers and footemen are vtterlie ignorant how to place the curbe, bicauſe for the moſt part they make it ſtraiter than it ought to be: whereby the horſſe being much pinched, dooth grow angrie, putting downe his head, and making manie vnſeemelie motions.</p>
            <p>I would therefore aduiſe you, to let your curbe, when it is looſe, hang on the right ſide: and when you will make it faſt, then without writhing it at all, to put it vpon the hooke on the left ſide, in the firſt or ſecond chaine, as you ſhall thinke moſt expedient. Marrie here I muſt warne you, <note place="margin">A caueat touching the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of a colt, &amp;c.</note> that in curbing a colt or yoong horſſe that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the bit well, or anie other horſſe that is cholericke or tender of berd, you ſhall in no wiſe make the curbe ſtraight, but rather ouer looſe, euer faſtening it on the left ſide.</p>
            <p>Surelie ſome men (being much deceiued in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:421:24"/>
conceipt) would haue the curbe to be ſhut on the right ſide, ſuppoſing thereby to remooue that fault, which the <hi>Italians</hi> doo call <hi>La credenza:</hi> which is a certeine obſtinacie of not turning wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie on either hand: which fault may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times remooued by meane of the curbe, but not in that ſort of tranſpoſing it. I doo therfore iudge that cuſtome verie vnfit in ſundrie reſpects, and cheeflie in that you ſhould be forced to make faſt the curbe with your left hand, or verie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodiouſlie with the right hand.</p>
            <p>Now your horſſe being made readie and in good order, as he ſhould be with his curbe, you ſhall ride him to the accuſtomed place of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: where after you haue made much of him, you ſhall excerciſe him in his ordinarie leſſons, wherewith you muſt interteine him for fifteene daies together, but in no wiſe put him to runne anie carriera.</p>
            <p>But for ſo much as to ride in the ſadle is a thing <note place="margin">Of ſitting in the ſadle and pad.</note> more commendable and comelie than in the pad, alſo of much more iudgement and skill; I will put you in mind to ſit in the ſaddle with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grace and regard, and alſo with better diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of bodie than you were woont to ſit in the pad; yet euer eſchuing all curioſitie and affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which you may doo, if before you depart
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:421:25"/>
from the place of mounting, you ſettle your ſelfe iuſt in the middeſt of the ſadle, letting your legs fall in their due order, neither putting them too much forward, nor too much backward, nor too neere, nor too farre from the horſſe bellie, ſtaieng your feete vpon the ſtirrops, as they ought to be, turning your toes ſomewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the horſſes ſhoulder, and ſetling your ſelfe vpon the ſtirrops, yet not ſo hard as though your feete were growne out of them.</p>
            <p>Touching the length of the ſtirrops, they <note place="margin">The length of the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops.</note> ought to be neither ouer-long, nor ouer-ſhort for your legs; but conuenientlie fit and of euen length: but hereof we will ſpeake more at large in another place.</p>
            <p>The ſureſt hold and ſtaie you muſt haue on <note place="margin">The ſureſt hold on horſebacke.</note> horſebacke ſhall conſiſt not in the ſtirrops, but in your knees &amp; thighs, which ought to be euer as it were made faſt or nailed in the ſadle: but from the knees downeward let your legs be looſe and at free libertie, to mooue as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. But to returne to that I ſaid firſt, let not your legs be ouer-much caſt forward, or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, neither ouer neere to the horſſe bellie, nor holding your foote in the ſtirrop ſo far towards the horſſe necke as you poſſiblie can, nor put your feet ſo little as onelie to ſet your toes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:421:25"/>
the ſtirrop, for the one is like vnto a foole, the other ſeemeth to proceed of affectation, as though a man would counterfet S. <hi>George:</hi> but you ſhall doo beſt to obſerue the meane, ſith in all actions the vertue reſteth in the middeſt, and extremities are euer imperfect.</p>
            <p>The reſt of your perſon muſt be kept ſtreight at libertie, and diſpoſed ſo, that your necke wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not either forward or backward, or more on the one than on the other ſide. Yet is it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, but ſufferable, to looke downe to ſee your horſſe how he ſtandeth, or whether he bringeth orderlie the one leg ouer the other, and other helps neceſſarie, whereof we will intreat hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: yet will I allow thoſe motions the leſſe, if they be vſed in the preſence of manie ſtrange ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and lookers on; bicauſe you may both ſtop and manage your horſſe otherwiſe without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, writhing, or other vnſeemelie geſture of bodie, ſo long as you keepe meaſure with your hand and heele.</p>
            <p>You muſt alſo vſe your hand and arme with a certeine iuſt and comelie motion, and cheeflie your right arme ought to be a little bowing: though ſome riders doo make therewith ſundrie geſtures &amp; croſſes not vnlike vnto coniurors in the circles; yea ſome doo beare both the arme
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:421:26"/>
and all the reſt of the bodie with ſuch curioſitie and affectation, as in deed they ſeeme to be men made rather of wood than otherwiſe. You may not be one of that number, but in all things ſhew dexteritie without affecting, likewiſe meaſure, with order, and ſeemelie boldneſſe.</p>
            <p>Thus your horſſe being brought to beare the ſadle comelie, and you to ſit well on his backe, you may exerciſe him dailie in his woonted leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; wherin you ſhall practiſe him fifteene times more without running him at all: in which leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I wiſh, that ſo oft as you trot the large rings, you ſhould at the laſt put him to gallop ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what furiouſlie, to the end that in ſtopping he may gather his bodie, and ſtop as it were on his buttocks. I would you ſhould alſo accuſtome your horſſe to make more ſpeedie turnes than he was woont in the ſtraight rings.</p>
            <p>In all theſe 15. leſſons you may not run your horſſe more than once or twiſe in one morning, and that muſt be in the accuſtomed place of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riera: vnleſſe that returning home you hap to find ſome good ground, which hath in the end ſome prettie fall, where you may doo well to gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop him frankelie, &amp; ſtop him faire and eaſilie at the decline of the place, ſo as he may beare his head firmelie, &amp; ſtop vpon his heeles.

            <p>From thence you may go on to the place of riding, where your horſſe hauing finiſhed all his leſſons, &amp; ſtopped: you muſt offer him to turne, and therewith leane forward with your bodie, to ſee whether he bringeth ouer his contrarie leg as he ought to doo: for both in paſing, trotting, &amp; galloping, the outward leg in the turne ſhould as it were couer the other which is next that ſide whereon the horſſe turneth, which the <hi>Italians</hi> doo call <hi>Incaualare.</hi> Alſo in turning, you muſt take heed that the horſſe doo beare his bodie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and make his turne iuſt in one tracke: which he will doo, if the rider ſitteth ſtaiedlie and aptlie, and handleth the horſſe heedefullie, alwaies hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him when neede requireth: of which helps we will hereafter ſpeake at large.</p>
            <p>Thus, when you haue ridden your horſſe, &amp; ſtaied him againe, making him retire, &amp; then go forward three paſes as he was woont; you muſt once more looke downe on either ſide, to ſee <note place="margin">How your horſſe muſt ſtand, &amp;c.</note> whether he ſtandeth iuſt vpon his legs, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his head well. And if you find he ſtand not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:421:28"/>
iuſt, but putteth one leg before the other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his bodie more on one ſide, than on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you ſhall faire and ſoftlie with your rod beat him on that leg that ſtandeth out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to the end he may remooue it into the right <note place="margin">How the horſſe ſhuld ſtand at his ſtop, &amp;c.</note> place: for in deed the horſſe ought to ſtand iuſt vpon all foure legs, ſo ſoone as he is ſtopped and ſtaied. This correction you may alſo vſe in the ſtable, when ſo euer you ſee the horſſe putteth one leg more forward than the other, or ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more firmelie vpon one than the other: which ſeldome chaunceth, if he be paſtorned as he ſhould be.</p>
            <p>You may not thinke, that to looke downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to behold the iuſtneſſe of your horſſes legs and bodie, dooth ſerue to ſmall purpoſe: for it alſo is a meane to let you vnderſtand, if your horſſe in dooing his leſſons hath hurt his legs, his feete, or his mouth. Beſides that, you may the more eaſilie &amp; perfectlie know the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note place="margin">The moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the horſſes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die &amp; mind appeare by his eies.</note> of his bodie and mind, which doo cheeflie appeare by his eies. For if you ſee his eies looke fierie, that is a ſigne that choler aboundeth in him: if diſcoloured, then is he diſcouraged, and faint of courage: if they be wet with teares, then he complaineth of wearines, or ſome other ſuch cauſe. So that knowing his greefe, you may
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:421:28"/>
eaſilie prouide the cure thereof, as by your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion ſhalbe thoughtfit.</p>
            <p>Thus after you haue made two or three ſtrait turnes on either hand paſing your horſſe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe as he can beſt doo, with that iuſtnes that is required; you ſhall euer depart from thence to the place of riding, trotting him liuelie and roundlie, keeping your bridle euen, &amp; the reines of the Cauezzan more ſtrait on the one than on the otherſide, as you find the horſſe inclined: in that ſort trotting him cheerefullie along the waie, you ſhall ſomtimes with a ſoft voice incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him, and ſometimes with the point of your rod touch him on the crooper of his buttocke, and ſomtimes lightlie ſtrike him ouerthwart the necke vpon his ſhoulder, to the end he ſhould raiſe him ſelfe, and take his paſe with ſpirit and courage: which done, you may fall into your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie leſſons, firſt on the trot, and after on the gallop.</p>

            <p>Wherefore your horſſe being reduced to that

            <p>You muſt go into ſome ſtrait waie that hath <note place="margin">The maner how to put your horſſe to the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uette</hi> or <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate.</hi>

            <p>You may alſo put your hands a little forward, and ſo raiſe the horſſe before, which will be a meane that he may with more eaſe lift vp the fore part of his bodie; yet muſt this helpe be vſed with great diſcretion.

to doo.</p>
            <p>But if he happen to aduance ouer hie, and force <note place="margin">Faults in your horſſe deſeruing correction.</note> forward more than he ought (cheefelie if he ſprall with his legs) then muſt you foorth with correct him with your rod, by beating him vpon the knees. Or if he commit anie other diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as caſting downe his head, or leape ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart, yet force not thereof at all: but after you haue corrected him for the ſame, returne to make him aduance, and you ſhall be ſure he will in one morning, or percaſe in leſſe than the third part of one houre fall from one aduancing to make manie <hi>Peſate:</hi> which dooing you muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie make much of him.</p>
            <p>Other meanes there are to bring your horſſe to make the <hi>Peſate,</hi> as in the ſtrait path of a ring, or in a plaine waie; yet ſtill obſeruing the ſame order: alſo in ſome right vp furrowe halfe an elne wide.</p>
            <p>For certeine daies you may exerciſe your horſſe in the <hi>Peſate,</hi> without forgetting his other ordinarie leſſons. But ſo ſoone as he is perfect in them, both vpon the paſe and trot, to the end he ſhould not become ouer-buſie in that motion, as manie yoong horſſes are, you muſt vſe him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie to be brought into ſome long carriera; where paſing him two third parts thereof, put
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:421:32"/>
him to trot the reſt ſwiftlie, till comming neere the end, you may a little drawe the raines, and putting thereto your voice, ſtrike him gentlie vpon one of his ſhoulders, ſo cauſing him to <hi>Coruette,</hi> and therein (if need require) helpe him otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>I would not (vnleſſe great neceſſitie ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth) <note place="margin">The vſe of the ſpurs.</note> that in theſe <hi>Coruette</hi> you ſhould vſe the helpe of your ſpurres. Neuertheles, if the horſſe be naturallie heauie, hard of head and cold, then is it meete you ſhould ſtrike him towards the flanke, with the iuſt ſtroke of the ſpurres, thereby to raiſe him, and remooue his heauines, ſtubbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and dulnes. But at what times the ſpur is to be vſed I haue not yet ſpoken, but reſerue to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thereof hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now, ſith that manie yoong horſſes doo eaſilie learne the <hi>Coruette;</hi> and hauing learned them, vſe them willinglie; imagining that ſo ſoone as they haue made a few <hi>Coruette,</hi> they are not to doo anie thing elſe, or being corrected with the ſpur continue ſtill to make more <hi>Coruette,</hi> euen againſt the riders will, and when they ought not, and in places vnfit, dooing them manie times higher than they ſhould: therefore vſe your ſpurres verie ſeldome, and likewiſe ſpare to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploie the calues of your legs. For it is an euill
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:421:33"/>
ſight, that for this purpoſe you ſhould ſet them ſo buſilie a worke, cheeflie in coruetting &amp; ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, at which times you ſhould ſhew rather to ſit firmelie and liuelie, which were to more pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe both to become the horſſe and your owne perſon. For in all places, with the onelie helpes of your rod, your voice, and a little raiſing your bridle hand, the horſſe will aduance thicke, and doo what you would haue him.</p>
            <p>And albeit the helps of the voice and ſpurre ought to be vſed at the beginning, when the horſſe learneth; yet M. <hi>Claudio</hi> thinketh both the one and the other may afterwards be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. For (beſides the reaſons alledged) it is no ſeemelie thing in the preſence of lookers on, to vſe ſo manie artificiall motions and affectations as diuers dailie doo.</p>
            <p>It ſhall therefore ſuffice, that when your horſſe can make his <hi>Coruette</hi> well, you vſe onelie a little helpe of the bridle hand, accompanieng the ſame by holding your right hand ſomwhat high; putting thereto ſuch a ſoft, ſharpe, and ſpeedie voice, as that motion requireth.</p>
            <p>But if the horſſe would ſtaie to make his <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uette,</hi> where you would not haue him, the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is to put him forward with the due correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the voice, the rod, and the ſpurre: beſides
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:421:33"/>
that, it is neceſſarie to put downe your hand an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerlie vpon the horſſe necke, and ſo trot him the whole length of a carriera, in the end ſtopping him with two or three <hi>Coruette:</hi> and then before you make much of him, returne him to trot in the ſame waie, and there againe put him to make a few <hi>Coruette</hi> iuſtlie: by which few I meane the number ought not exceed three, becauſe more were vaine and ſuperfluous. Which order you ſhall euer obſerue in ſtopping, and all manages which require to be doone with <hi>Coruette:</hi> which if your horſſe will doo with his forelegs comelie, yet not ouer hie from the ground, ſo as the one doo not tarrie for the other, you ſhall leaue, and make much of him.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, if in his former leſſons he gallop and ſtop well, with the helps thereto belonging; and increaſing the gallop cheefelie in the end, that is to ſaie, the third part of the gallop ought to be as it were running: and at the ſtop you ſhall faire and eaſilie interteine him, leaning your bodie ſomewhat backward, and holding your legs in their place ſtretched out and firme, helping the horſſe with your voice and rod, by ſtriking him faire and ſoftlie vpon that ſhoulder: for by ſo dooing he will bow his howghes, and ſtop vpon the heeles, as he ought to doo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:421:34"/>
But if he commeth to his ſtop, with his legs caſt right foorth &amp; vnwillinglie, his correction ought be the more; and cheeflie vpon the ſhoulders: yet not ſo great, as to make the horſſe angrie, but let him know that you correct him onelie bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhould doo what you would haue him.</p>
            <p>Maiſter <hi>Claudio</hi> ſaith, that ſithence the <hi>Coruet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> are as it were the children of the <hi>Peſate;</hi> ſo ſoon as the one is learned, the other will foorthwith follow. And betwixt them there is no other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <note place="margin">How the Coruette and the Peſate doo differ.</note> than that the <hi>Peſate</hi> muſt be performed with more ſpeed in good time and often, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the matter ſo, as the horſſe may alwaies at the firſt go faſter forward in his coruetting.</p>
            <p>In this motion you may vſe the calues of your legs, and likewiſe the euen ſtroke of your ſpurs, yet lightlie, and ſometimes one ſpur and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the other, as ye ſhall ſee occaſion: which order you may obſerue in the <hi>Peſate,</hi> vſing all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helps likewiſe in that caſe required.</p>
            <p>The motion of coruetting cannot be comelie, vnleſſe the <hi>Coruette</hi> be doone ſhort, lowe and thicke. And it ſhall ſuffice thee to make ten or twelue at one time: for I allow not of thoſe that inforce the horſſe to go from the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of the ſtreate, vpon the <hi>Coruette,</hi> forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that too much of one thing is diſpleaſing.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:421:34"/>
Beſides that, much coruetting brooſeth both the horſſe and rider.</p>
            <p>Maiſter <hi>Claudio</hi> therefore affirmeth plainelie, that he miſliketh manie <hi>Coruette</hi> both forward and backward, and moſt of all if they be made ſidewaies: neither dooth he allow them forward in manage-wiſe, vnleſſe it be with determination to make a turne in that order, for ſo they are commendable. Yet (ſaith he) let no man maruell, that the turnes vpon the <hi>Coruette</hi> are doone with more difficultie, and are more pleaſing to the beholders, than to turne without pauſing and ſwiftlie; for therein he ſhould be deceiued. For euerie horſſe may be taught to turne vpon the <hi>Coruette,</hi> and may doo it eaſilie, by reaſon he may therein take breath and time: but to the other turne he ſhall neuer atteine, vnleſſe he be of more force and ſpirit, ſeeing he is conſtrained to hold his breath longer, and vſe more ſtrength of his backe, with the ſtiffnes of his necke, &amp; firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the mouth. Of one thing you may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that when your horſſe can trot well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he is eaſilie learned to doo it euerie other waie.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the opinion of Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Claudio,</hi> that within the ſpace of foure moneths a horſe may become perfect in all the leſſons aforeſaid, vnleſſe by ſome accident he be hindered. For the horſſe may be within this time brought to ſuch ſtaiednes and obedience, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uezzan may be taken off, and in ſteed thereof you ſhall vſe a falſe reine. During all this time, I would not haue you in anie wiſe to put your horſſe to manage with halfe or whole time, no nor with the ſwift turne: neither would I haue him put to turne hie, with or without yarking. Moreouer, you may not in anie wiſe meddle to make him doo the <hi>Capreola,</hi> to leape, or gallop galliard; no although the horſſe doo ſhew great ſpirit, or deſire to doo thoſe things, for it is vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vaine to teach them, till ſuch time as he be firme and perfect in all things vpon the ground. Beſides that, bicauſe the horſſe dooth want his full ſtrength, you may worke an effect contrarie
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:421:36"/>
to your deſire.</p>
            <p>But being reduced to this ripenes in fowre moneths, I would not haue you (as diuers men doo) neuer leaue off the Cauezzan, continuing there with, moneths, yeares, and whole ages of men, before they make vp the horſſe: but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him firme and perfect in the dooings aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, you ſhall preſentlie take awaie the chaine, and in all his leſſons exerciſe him with the falſe reines, at the leaſt one whole moneth. Then if you ſee that he goeth well, you may put him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to manage without reſt: where vnto ye may eaſilie induce him to doo it both iuſtlie and ſwiftlie, by obſeruing that hath beene often ſaid; which is, if by little and little you drawe in the horſſe, and make him go with more ſpeed: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to exerciſe him often vnto the S, being made ſomewhat ſhort and ſtrait, dooth helpe much in this reſpect; as I haue at large before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed.</p>
            <p>The manage without reſt, called of the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Maneggio di contra tempo,</hi> requireth great <note place="margin">Maneggio di contra tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po, &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neggio di mezzo e di tutto tempo.</note> firmeneſſe both of hand and bodie, and perhaps more time and meaſure is therein to be vſed, than in anie of the other manages with halfe or whole reſt, which they call <hi>Maneggio di mezzo e di tutto tempo.</hi> All which manages are verie
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:421:37"/>
diſcreetlie engliſhed by Maiſter <hi>Blundeuile;</hi> a manage with halfe reſt, whole reſt, and without reſt.</p>
            <p>It ſeemeth more ouer, that M. <hi>Claudio</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the manage without reſt is both moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and moſt difficult; cheefelie when the turnes are made not vpon the ſoft gallop, but ſwiftlie and furiouſlie. Alſo when the horſſe is in ſtopping, if you ſuddenlie at the middeſt of the turne put him foorth with a good grace, cloſing the next turne ſwiftlie, and cloſe as it ſhould be; and if from thence the horſſe doo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ſuddenlie, making haſt to the other end of the manage, there dooing the like, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue without ſtaie or diſorder.</p>
            <p>You muſt neuer forget that this manage muſt be taught the horſſe in the order before ſaid, which is; firſt paſing, next trotting, and laſtlie gallopping, by little and little drawing him to that ſwiftnes and frankenes that is required, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the force of the horſſe; remembring in the end to ſtop him comelie, with two or three <hi>Peſate</hi> made well, and with breath enough. And ſurelie, if you continue thus to doo, you ſhall make your horſſe ſo perfect, that if you pleaſe to put him to doo more, he will learne it eaſilie. You muſt alſo, during this moneth, vſe your
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:421:37"/>
horſſe much to the turnes <hi>Terra terra,</hi> which I would haue him learne, before he be brought to manage, to the end that both in them and all other dooings, he may come more readilie and iuſtlie to his halfe turnes.</p>
            <p>But if it fortune that your horſſe dooth not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie thing firmelie and iuſtlie as you deſire, yet ought you not be diſcouraged; but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in the ſame place where he committeth the fault, correct him by all meanes due to that fault: neither ſhall you ceaſe ſo to doo, till ſuch time as he amendeth. And trulie, either the firſt, ſecond, or third morning he will be brought to doo according to your owne fanſie, ſo that you giue him not ouer at the firſt. This we haue ſaid ſhall ſuffice, to enforme you how to make your horſſe perfect in all his dooings vpon the ground.</p>

            <p>As touching the voice, you muſt vnderſtand <note place="margin">Of varieng the voice in diuerſe reſpects.</note> it maie varie, lowder or ſofter, as the dooings of the horſſe and his diſpoſition altereth. So that, if you ſhould alwaies vſe one voice, your horſſe could neuer conceiue your meaning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie your helpes become vaine. It ſhall therefore behooue you to vſe one voice to a coult at his firſt handling, an other when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to go well, another when he ſtoppeth, another when he gallopeth at leiſure, an other in his gallop galliard, an other in his turnes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, an other when he turneth hie with yarkes or without, an other in his carriera and leaping.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, whenſoeuer you teach him his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie paſe or order of going, a particular voice ought to be then vſed. You muſt alſo be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue a voice for your horſſe, when he is ouer light behind, ſtubborne or diſobedient; and one other, if he doo obedientlie, willinglie, and couragiouſlie. All which M. <hi>Claudio</hi> dooth labour to expreſſe in his language; yet for that they be in all toongs rather ſignificant ſounds than words of expreſſe meaning, I commit them to the riders diſcretion: it ſhall ſuffice that the horſſe thereby may conceiue your meaning,

               <p>How to helpe your horſſe with the rod.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He helpe of the rod is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by one of theſe meanes, by whisking, by ſtriking with the whole rod, with the point ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of onlie, with the middeſt, and alſo with the end vnder the hand, or with ſhewing the rod. Touching the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:421:39"/>
whiske, it ought not be vſed, till ſuch time as the horſſe knoweth well all other helpes of the rod, and can manage perfectlie on either hand. The rider may vſe this kind of helpe in ſteed of the voice, &amp; it ſtirreth vp the ſpirit of euerie horſſe, but chieflie of thoſe which are of courage and great life.</p>
            <p>Striking with the whole rod is required, when you would haue your horſſe go forward liuelie, either in his trot, his gallop, his carriera, his halfe or whole turns, either vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground or aboue, with yarkes or without: for then you ſhall ſtrike him vpon one of his ſhoulders, his flanks &amp; but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, his legs or thighes. This ſtroke of the rod ſhall helpe much, being giuen in due time; and the more, if the ſame be accompanied with the other helps, and chieflie that of the voice.</p>
            <p>You may alſo firſt vſe this helpe in paſing your horſſe, ſometimes ſtriking him on the ſhoulder, to the end he ſhould the more raiſe himſelfe. And you muſt ſtrike him, firſt on the one, and then the other ſhoulder, whereby he will gather his legs the better, go with more life, and beare his head the higher. The like order you muſt obſerue in his trot and ordinarie gallop. But in his carriera you ſhall beate him either vpon his ſhoulders, or vpon his flanks, verie ſharplie: you
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:421:39"/>
may alſo ſometimes vſe the whiske.</p>
            <p>In offring him to make <hi>Coruette,</hi> you may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe helpe the horſſe with the rod, ſtriking him vpon one of his ſhoulders at euerie turne and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie <hi>Coruette,</hi> yet onelie when need ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. It ſeemeth not good, that the horſſe ſhould be continuallie ſtriken vpon, when you offer him the <hi>Coruette:</hi> for it may be he will writh his mouth &amp; necke the rather towards the left ſide; you ſhall therefore ſtrike him on that ſide your owne diſcretion dooth thinke good. If you will raiſe your horſſe to leape at his ſtop; then, ſo ſoone as you haue ſtriken him on the ſhoulder, incontinent turne your hand, &amp; ſtrike him alſo vpon the flanke. The like you may at occaſions doo in the gallop galliard, or turning aboue the ground. But if your horſſe be light enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at his ſtop and leape, then without either beating vpon the ſhoulders or flanks, you may make him to yarke, by letting the point of your rod to touch the horſſe behind in the middeſt of his buttocks.</p>
            <p>An other waie to helpe your horſſe by the rod, is, when you would haue him ſtaie in one place; for then you ſhall laie it ouerthwart his necke, and then he will, as he ſtandeth, lift firſt one, then the other leg, with a certeine grace and comelie

And maruell not though this one maner of holding the rod doth worke two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie <note place="margin">Two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in holding the rod, &amp;c.</note> effects, for in the one you doo ſollicit the horſſe to go by beating, ſtill beating, in croſſing his necke: but in the other you doo onelie laie the rod croſſe, but not moue it otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Touching the great end of the rod vnder your hand, you may therewith make much of your horſſe, if you ſcratch him therwith faire and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon the necke, in ſigne he dooth well. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the ſhew of the rod is in the turns an helpe vnto the horſſe, and a grace vnto the man. For in turning the horſſe on the left hand, you muſt put the point of the rod within one handfull of his eie, or els let it fall downewards ſomewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his right ſhoulder; yet neuer ſuffring your hand to remoue far from the true place therof. And if you will manage your horſſe on the right hand, you ſhall put your rod downe towards the left ſhoulder, yet neuer remoouing one hand far from the other. For in deed, ouer much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the right hand, and lifting vp the rod, ſauoureth too much of affectation, yet at this daie it is of diuerſe men much vſed.</p>

The like may be doone, when at the ſtop or end of anie leſſon, you find the horſſe beare his head lower than he ought. But if he leaneth therewith, more on the one than the other hand, then muſt you with the two laſt fingers of the right hand (holding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie reine) giue him a chocke or two, or more, as you doo find the horſſe deſerueth to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>

Yet his meaning is not you ſhould defer <note place="margin">At what time a colt is to be ſpurred.</note> to ſpur him till he be fiue or ſixe yeares of age, but ſo ſoone as you find him brought to be ſtaid and ſetled (which I hope may be doone in foure moneths) then you may boldlie giue the ſpur vnto your horſſe: which you ſhall not firſt doo in anie ſtreet or waie, but in ſome deepe plowed ground, or ſandie place, after he hath doone his ordinarie leſſons. Firſt you muſt make him feele the one and after the other ſpur, faire and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as he paſeth or trotteth the large rings, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ceaſing ſo to doo, and cheriſh him, laieng your hand vpon his necke, and vttering ſome courteous voice. In this ſort you may pricke him ſometimes on the one and ſometimes one the other ſide, after he hath beene warned well in his leſſons. And hereof you may be aſſured.</p>

               <p>How to helpe your horſſe in the rings, and at his ſtop.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue here to fore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of helping your horſe, yet did I not particularlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme you at what times and what places the ſame helpes ought be vſed: which is doone to the end I might proceed in order, &amp; you the better reteine them in memorie. But now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing accompliſhed what order and helps are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, here will I let you know how and when they ſhalbe vſed.</p>
            <p>And firſt you muſt remember, that when ſo <note place="margin">How and when the foreſaid helpes are to be vſed.</note> euer either in the large or ſtrait rings, in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragolo,</hi> in the figure of S, or in the manage in and out, which (as is before ſaid) the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peggiare,</hi> your horſſe dooth put out his but tocke; then muſt you forth with correct him on that ſide with your rod, with your heele, and with your ſpur (if you weare any) which you muſt continue till the horſſe amendeth his fault. The like you muſt doo, if turning of anie hand, or in going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he caſteth his hinder part out of order.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:421:44"/>
You may alſo in that caſe vſe this ſubtiltie; firſt to make proffer to go on one hand, &amp; then ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlie put the horſſe to turne on the other. You may likewiſe for this fault correct him well, if you paſe or trot him neere vnto a wall, &amp; when he turneth putting out his hind part, he muſt of force hurt himſelfe, vnleſſe he holdeth his bodie ſtrait, which he will not doo often, but for feare therof leaue his fault, which he ſhall doo the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if you ad there vnto the other helpes.</p>
            <p>In gallopping the rings you may helpe the horſſe with your bodie, by carrieng your legs put forward more than ordinarie. And there is nothing that maketh a man to ſit ſo comelie on horſſebacke as the gallop: for in gallopping he may take time to ſettle his feete in the ſtirrops, to hold his legs in their due place with his thighs and knees cloſelie, and his whole bodie ſtrait and diſpoſed, with either hand beſtowed in their places. Therefore M. <hi>Claudio</hi> (perhaps contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to many other good riders) thinketh beſt that the ſtirrops ſhould be euen of one length, which <note place="margin">The ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops ſhould be of euen length.</note> will be a meane that the rider ſhall ſit with the better grace, and more conuenientlie helpe his horſſe; much maruelling why the right ſtirrop ſhould be ſhorter than the other.</p>
            <p>In gallopping you muſt ſomewhat yeeld your
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:421:45"/>
perſon towards that ſide you would haue the horſſe turne, yet not mooue your legs but when need requireth. As for example. If you gallop turning on the right hand, you muſt ſtaie your ſelfe ſomewhat more on the right than the left ſtirrop. The like order ſhall you obſerue on the contrarie hand, holding your bodie a little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward that ſide. Alſo in turning you muſt put your contrarie ſhoulder ſomewhat more forward, reſting your bodie on that ſtirrop more than the other: for by that meanes you ſhall ſwaie your horſſe towards that ſide, and be the more readie to helpe him. But in his trot or gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop ſtrait foorth, you ſhall not ſo doo, but ſit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallie in the middeſt, without leaning: vnleſſe the better to helpe your horſſe you beare your bodie ſomewhat forwards.</p>
            <p>It is alſo at ſometime permitted, you ſhould leane your bodie to the contrarie ſide, from that the horſſe is inclined, thereto to enforce him to leane the ſame waie your ſelfe leaneth. Alſo if vpon that occaſion you vſe the helpe of the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop, ſtriking his ſhoulder therewith on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie ſide, and likewiſe giue him a twich or two with the falſe raine on the ſame ſide, it will be a good meane to draw him that waie.</p>
            <p>But in ſtopping you muſt caſt your bodie a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:421:45"/>
little backwards, ſuffring the horſſe to ſlide for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as it were alone, drawing the reines faire &amp; eaſilie, till ſuch time he be come vnto that place you would; then hauing ſtaied his furie, you may ſtop him firme, and ſtaie him there. This I would haue obſerued, with thoſe horſſes that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how to be handled vpon the ground. But if in ſtopping the horſe leaneth more on the one than the other hand, then muſt you, leaning backe, giue your ſelfe moſt towards that ſide, whereto he leaneth not, helping him all other waies: and ſo gallop him &amp; ſtop him ſtrait forth, till you find his fault amended. But note, that gallop ſhall not exceed the length of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie manage. At the end wherof hauing ſtopped, if the horſſe ſtoppeth not ſtrait as he ought, put him forward againe, and at his ſtop correct <note place="margin">Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons diuerſe waies for not ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, &amp;c.</note> him on that ſide he yeeldeth not, with your ſtirrop, the calfe of your leg, your ſpur, &amp; your perſon, till he be content to yeeld and ſtop as you would haue him.</p>

               <p>How the ſtirrops ought to be of euen length.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ho ſo euer rideth with one ſtirrop longer than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, dooth ſeeme therein to proceed contrarie to nature, hauing made man two legs of one iuſt length. Therfore if you make one ſtirrop ſhorter than the other, it is not poſſible you can ſit ſo comelie or iuſtlie on horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, as if they were of equall length: or how can you vſe your ſpurs commodiouſlie or euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie? For in ſtriking the horſſe with the ſpurs, you ſhall of force ſpur him higher on the one than the otherſide, ſo long as the one ſtirrop be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the other: which thing how vnſeemelie it is, I refer to your iudgement.</p>
            <p>Beſides that, how can you with your bodie ſo conuenientlie helpe your horſſe in his dooings? Sith you doo not ſit with your bodie iuſt in the ſaddle, or reſt your ſelfe equallie vpon the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops, iuſtlie counterpeiſed? which is the thing that makes you ſeeme faire &amp; firme in the ſadle, by not leaning more on the one than the other
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:421:46"/>
hand, and ſuch a ſeate will beſt become you in all ſorts of turnes, either on the ground, aboue with yarkes, and euerie other motion.</p>
            <p>And albeit it is the opinion of ſome, that to <note place="margin">The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome, that the right ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop ſhould be ſhorter than the left, &amp;c.</note> breake lances it behooueth a man at armes to haue his right ſtirrop ſhorter than the other by two fingers, yet doo I not conceiue the reaſon thereof; ſith both in running at the ring, or courſe of the field, an horſſeman ought to ſit euen, without leaning more on the one than the other ſide, or turning anie of his ſhoulders: for thereby he ſhall ſhew the more cunning, and gaine aduantage in the length of the lance, which is ſome helpe at the incounter.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, although it ſeemeth that leaning more on the one than the other ſtirrop, and that thruſting forward of the one ſhoulder, dooth make the man ſtronger, both to meet the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, &amp; receiue his reinconter; yet is it certeine, that thereby he is the more apt to commit the errors beforeſaid, by ſitting looſe in and vneuen in his ſtirrops.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, ſith euerie man ſtandeth moſt ſtronglie vpon the ground, when he reſteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both his feete: ſo doo I thinke that an horſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſtaieng his bodie vpon both ſtirrops e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallie, ſhall be better prepared both to aſſaile,

and receiue the incounter of his aduerſarie, than if he ſhould doo otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons Maiſter <hi>Claudio</hi> reſolueth, that the ſtirrops ſhould be of equall length, whereby the rider may (as he thinketh) ſit more comelie and aſſuredlie. Neuertheleſſe, it is (as beforeſaid) permitted, that the rider ſhould at occaſions, to helpe the horſſe in his leſſons, reſt more on the one than the other ſtirrop, but not otherwiſe. It is not alſo to be diſallowed, though <note place="margin">The left ſtirrop to be longer than the right.</note> to fight in combate or turnie, the left ſtirrop be made longer ſomewhat than the other: bicauſe the rider is to emploie his right arme, and turne on the right ſide, in reſpect whereof the left ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop would be the longer.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Henſoeuer you will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage your horſſe without reſt, you muſt trot or gallop, till you come to the place of turning; where making as it were a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to ſtop, you muſt raiſe him, and therewith ſuddenlie put him forward
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:421:47"/>
one paſe, leaning your bodie, and caſting your bridle hand a little forward: then by moouing your leg, you ſhall warne him to returne an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſe, and in the turning eaſilie you ſhall put him forward at the halfe turne <hi>Terra terra,</hi> hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him with your voice, your heele, &amp; ſpurre. And if you will haue him to turne on the right hand, helpe him on the left ſide; and on the left ſide, with the right ſpurre: &amp; remember to helpe him much or little, as you ſee occaſion require.</p>
            <p>Remember alſo, if at the halfe of his turne he commeth about hard, as it were hanging on the contrarie hand from that he turneth, that then you muſt forbeare to ſtrike him with the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſpurre, that is to ſaie without the turne, and ſtrike him with your ſpurre within, on that hand you doo turne. The like order you ſhall obſerue both in gallopping and the franke manage. But if you find your horſſe commeth ouer faſt about to his halfe turne, not ſetting himſelfe iuſt in the ſame path from whence he came, for (to make the turne iuſt he muſt bring his head where his hinder feet were) then ſo ſoone as you haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him the ſpur on the outſide, you muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie anſwere the ſame with an other on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: both which muſt be neere vnto the girths, vnleſſe you find occaſion to giue them neerer
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:421:48"/>
vnto the flanks; which is, when the horſſe dooth turne with his buttocks more on the one than the other ſide. But if he turne ouermuch, bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his legs behind, &amp; ouer low with his but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks; then muſt you foorthwith thruſt him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſtriking him neere vnto his girthes with both ſpurs together; accompanieng that helpe with the rod vpon the horſſes flanke, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe your voice, if need dooth ſo require.</p>
            <p>The ſtroke of the rod dooth alſo helpe much in turning, if the ſame be giuen when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires vpon the contrarie ſhoulder of the horſe: but if no ſuch neede be, it ſhall ſuffice if you put your rod ouer the horſſe, ſo as the ſame may hang on the left ſhoulder, to make him turne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the right hand, and likewiſe on the right ſide, when you would haue him turne on the left hand.</p>
            <p>But you ſhall helpe him much more, and with better grace, if when the horſſe ſlideth vpon his heeles, you ſit ſomewhat with your bodie lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning backward; and ſuddenlie putting him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, turne the point of your contrarie ſhoulder towards that hand you would haue the horſſe to turne. As if you would haue him come on the right hand, then muſt you put forward your left ſhoulder; or if you would haue him turne on the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:421:48"/>
left hand, then put your right ſhoulder ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what forward.</p>
            <p>In turning, you muſt alſo remember that your bridle hand may not be farre remoued from the bending of the horſſes necke, euer holding it right againſt the middeſt of the pommell.</p>
            <p>If you ride a horſſe that is alreadie made, and perfect; then, to make him turne on the left hand you muſt turne your bridle hand, yet not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it from the place; ſo as your thumbe be downewards, and your little finger (which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the reines) be vppermoſt: and turning on the right hand, you ſhall turne your fiſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe; ſo as all the other fingers be vpward, but the thumbe not ſo high as the ring and little fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. This motion of the hand is not eaſilie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and therefore M. <hi>Claudio</hi> remitteth it to the diſcretion of the rider, ſo that he keepe his hand firme in the due place preſcribed.</p>
            <p>But if your horſſe be not brought vnto perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but weareth his Cauezzan or falſe reine, then theſe points of cunning are not required; bicauſe you are to emploie all neceſſarie helps, to the end the horſſe may hold his head ſtrait, &amp; go iuſt with his necke, chieflie when he turneth: euer helping, as need requireth. As if you turne on the left hand, then faire and eaſilie you ſhall
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:421:49"/>
(according to neceſſitie) drawe the right falſe reine: or if you turne on the right hand, then muſt the left falſe reine be holden and drawne ſtrait, and the other as you thinke good.</p>
            <p>Theſe halfe turnes in the manages without reſt, I wiſh to be iuſt, and with good grace; for ſo being, M. <hi>Claudio</hi> ſaith they are the moſt ſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and neceſſarie motions the horſſe can make. And if the horſſe can doo theſe turnes exactlie well, you may eaſilie make him alſo to doo them (as it were) mocking (which for want of engliſh words to expreſſe the ſame) I will vſe the <hi>Italian,</hi> calling them <hi>Volte ingannate &amp; rubate.</hi> The waie <note place="margin">Volte ingan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate &amp; ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</note> to manage your horſſe with theſe <hi>Volte ingan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> is, that when he commeth vnto the place of turne, readie to ſtop, you muſt proffer him to turne on the one hand, and ſuddenlie turne him on the other.</p>
            <p>If you like to vſe the ſame order in turning your horſſe, you may doo it in this maner. When you haue ſet your horſſes head ſtrait in the ſame path and place where he ſtood with his heeles, without putting him any whit forward; you muſt force him to make a whole turne round in the ſame order you obſerued in the halfe turnes: ſo as at euerie end of the manage you ſhall make one whole turne &amp; a halfe vpon one hand. And
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:421:49"/>
remember that the horſſe doo not paſſe forward to the other end of the manage, till you haue ended the turnes, but tarie till you will haue him ſo to doo. You may alſo (if ſo you thinke good) hauing giuen your horſſe an halfe turne on the right hand, preſentlie returne him with the like time on the left hand, to make an whole turne, in the order before preſcribed. But remember that in theſe dooings you may not labour your horſſe much, vnleſſe he be of great force; and more than ordinarie ſtrength. The like order you ſhall obſerue in helping in managing your horſſe with reſt; ſauing that you muſt then turne him at the firſt or third aduancing. This manage may be made with halfe turnes, &amp; whole turnes mocked: but they muſt be aboue the ground &amp; aloft. For I haue often told you, that I like not the whole turnes that be made ouer high, the horſſe reſting onelie vpon his two hinder feete. And if in ending the halfe turne or the whole turne with the halfe, you put your horſſe to one or two <hi>Peſate,</hi> or as manie <hi>Aggroppiati rileuati,</hi> before you come to the other end of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, the ſame will be pleaſing to the beholders; you ſhalbe alſo thought to ſhew much skill, and the horſſe more obedience. Note that in this manage with reſt aboue the ground, and high,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:421:50"/>
you muſt at euerie turne (for the moſt part) help the horſſe with the euen ſtroke of the ſpurs: yet not hard, vnleſſe need ſo requireth.</p>

               <p>How to helpe your horſſe in his Coruette, Peſate, and Raddoppiare.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit we haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of turning, and likewiſe of the <hi>Peſate</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uette,</hi> yet did I not particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie enforme you of the helpes to them belonging. I ſaie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that neither in the <hi>Coruette</hi> nor the <hi>Peſate</hi> you muſt in anie wiſe mooue your legs, to helpe the horſſe ſo buſilie, as thereby to ſeeme rather a weauer than a rider: for you may helpe him ſufficientlie otherwiſe. But you ſhall hold them ſtrait and forward, and your bodie right vp in the ſadle; and not leaning forward, as ſome cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious riders doo, raiſing their buttocks behind, and lifting them vp and downe more than the horſſe either in his <hi>Peſate</hi> or his <hi>Coruerte</hi> dooth.</p>
            <p>Maiſter <hi>Claudio</hi> therefore dooth counſell you, that without anie imitation of theſe men, you ſhall in coruetting ſit firme in your ſadle; with
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:421:50"/>
your legs in their due place, holding a conſtant hand vpon your bridle. Neuertheleſſe, if your horſſe doo beare hard, and not make his <hi>Coruette</hi> lightlie, then may you helpe him with the euen ſtroke of your ſpurs; or firſt with the one, and after with the other, and (if need ſo requireth) with your bridle hand, turning your fiſt in ſuch wiſe, as heretofore I told you; that is, at euerie <hi>Coruette,</hi> your ring finger, which is vnder, may turne vpward, and your thumbe at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant may fall ſomewhat downeward, towards the bending of your horſſe necke.</p>
            <p>It will be alſo a good grace, if in coruetting you hold the end of the reines in your right hand, holding it vp from the other hand two ſpans: but you may not, during that time, vſe your rod, but in ſteed thereof betwixt your two hands open the reines, and at euerie <hi>Coruette</hi> ſhut them ſuddenlie, making thereby a certeine ſharpe ſound, which will ſomewhat awake, ſtirre and put forward the horſſe. You may alſo vſe the voice fit for this purpoſe as is before ſaid.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe at occaſions you ſhall imploie your rod, ſtriking the horſſe ſometimes on the one and ſometimes on the other ſhoulder, lightlie or ſharpelie, as by your diſcreation ſhall be thought meeteſt. You may in like maner with the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:421:51"/>
midle part of your rod ſtrike the horſſe vpon the bending of his necke, or with the point ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vpon the middeſt of his buttocks, letting the rod fall backwards ouer your ſhoulder. It will moreouer be good to vſe the whiske of your rod, ſometimes before, ſometimes behind: for that ſhall helpe much to haſten the horſſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance, and beare his bodie with a ſeemlie grace, and beate the time faſt.</p>
            <p>Now you muſt vnderſtand the reaſon, whie <hi>M. Claudio</hi> miſliketh ſo much the motion of the <note place="margin">The moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the legs and perſon miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked, and why?</note> legs and perſon: bicauſe (ſaith he) it is a thing diſcommendable in the preſence of manie loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers on (cheeflie if they be of knowledge) to vſe ſo much art, or bring into their preſence a horſſe that cannot without helpe, and as it were alone make the <hi>Coruette</hi> and alſo the <hi>Peſate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh alſo, that when your horſſe turneth, you ſhould ſit ſtrait and firme with your bodie, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your legs in their place, helping the horſſe in due time; ſomewhiles with the euen ſtroake of your ſpurs, ſometimes on the one ſide, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the other. It may alſo happen, that the helpe of your legs alone will ſuffice, and that your ſpur ſhall be needleſſe; for that your horſſe is of too great life and ſpirit. Therefore that helpe ioined with your bridle hand, your voice
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:421:51"/>
and your rod ſhall worke the effect of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and make him turne as you would haue him.</p>
            <p>If you will turne your horſſe vpon the ground <hi>Terra terra,</hi> we haue heretofore told you how to doo it: if halfe aboue the ground (which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Amezzo aere)</hi> the ſame helpes ſhall ſerue, yet ſomwhat increaſed. But if his turnes be loftie <hi>Di tempo in tempo,</hi> then in turning you muſt helpe him with a great voice and ſtronger helps: which the horſſe will performe at euerie turne, whenſoeuer it pleaſe you, if among other helps with the point of the rod you beate him betwixt his buttocks, adding therevnto your voice.</p>
            <p>But note this one thing, that in what ſort ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you turne your horſſe, you muſt not in any wiſe tranſgreſſe or go out of the place. As for example. If you turne <hi>Terra terra,</hi> the hinder <note place="margin">Orders to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the turnes <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra terra,</hi> and <hi>A mezzo aere.</hi>
               </note> legs of your horſſe may not remooue, but the forelegs onelie go about: the like order you muſt obſerue in his turnes <hi>A mezzo aere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the turne wherein the horſſe mooueth as well his hind as his foreparts (which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Raddoppiare a groppette)</hi> he muſt of force firſt mooue his forelegs, and next his hinder legs: yet ought neither the forelegs preſſe ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, nor the hinder legs ſo much backward, as to exceed the bounds of the beaten circle, which

muſt not be in widenes more than the horſſes length. Yet though the horſſe dooth not preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie keepe the compaſſe, it ſhall be no great fault: for it were a thing almoſt impoſſible, to meaſure the motions of an horſſe by the geometricall compaſſe, or the watch of a clocke.</p>
            <p>Now to the end you may better conceiue what is ſaid, behold this figure, and imagine that the hinder feet of <figure/> the horſe doo ſtand in the centre, which is the middeſt of the circle, and the forefeet in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference. Then, when ſo euer you put the horſſe to turne, you muſt make him to mooue his feet from the place where he ſtandeth, vnto the next line of the croſſe, and ſo from thence to the other without loſſe of time: ſo in foure remooues of the horſſe feet, he ſhall euer make one round turne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete; firſt on the one and then on the other hand. But if it happen, that either you or the horſſe doo not keepe the iuſt remooues of his feet, it ſhall not be anie great fault, ſo long as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:421:52"/>
you obſerue time, and cloſe the turne comelie.</p>
            <p>To turne loftilie, with or without yarks, you ſhall obſerue the ſame order: but therein you muſt be warie and well aduiſed to keepe your bodie, and chieflie your backe well knit, to the end that when the horſſe riſeth or ſetteth, you yeeld not more on the one than the other ſide. And aboue all things, you muſt keepe your legs firmelie ſtretched out, not touching the horſſe with your ſpurre, but with great meaſure.</p>
            <p>The waie to doo ſo, is to raiſe your horſſe firſt with his hind parts, as it were a iumpe or two, &amp; then at the ſecond or third iumpe to drawe him to turne aloft, &amp; euerie fourth turne helpe him with the euen ſtroke of your ſpurres, with your rod on the contrarie ſhoulder, &amp; ſuddenlie with the point of the rod vpon his crooper; adding therevnto the helpe of the bridle hand and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, if need requireth. The like you may doo on the other hand, neuer forgetting that in the end of euerie turne (of what ſort ſo euer) you muſt vſe greater ſpeed.</p>
            <p>It is alſo a great helpe to make your horſſe to turne high and aboue the ground, if you vſe him to turne in ſome ground that hath the ſides ſomewhat higher than the middeſt: for therein you turne the horſſe, for not hurting his legs
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:421:53"/>
vpon the hill, he will lift his feete with a good grace, caſting out his legs as he ſhould doo, and let them fall againe in the iuſt time and place: &amp; therewith alſo at the halfe turne yarke out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, as you would wiſh, according vnto the helps you put vnto him. The ſame hils will alſo ſerue well to teach your horſſe to put one leg ouer the other, which the <hi>Italians</hi> doo call <hi>La ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambetta.</hi> But note, that this place ought not to be betweene the hils more than three or foure ſpannes at the moſt.</p>
            <p>Thus much concerning the <hi>Coruette, Peſate,</hi> and turnes, both vpon and aboue ground.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Reſtie horſſe is he that refuſeth or reſiſteth to obeie <note place="margin">Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for horſſes.</note> his rider, either in not going forward, or turning on which hand you would haue him. The beginning of this ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne condition is eaſilie perceiued. For when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you find your horſſe to go, as it were in two minds, ſeeming he doubteth whether he ſhould go or not: then ſhall you foorthwith vſe ſome ſharpe correction of voice, and (if he be reſtie) accompanie the ſame with ſome ſure ſtroakes of the rod, vpon his ſhoulders and loines. But beware in anie wiſe to ſtrike the <note place="margin">Not to ſtrike the horſſe on the head.</note> horſſe vpon the head, and cheeflie betwixt his eares, for ſo he may be eaſilie ſlaine. To ſtrike him on the head, may alſo bring other inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, as hurt of the eies, and make an horſſe ſo ſtriken, for euer after to be fearfull of the ſword, and cowardlie.</p>
            <p>Beſides the correction of the voice, the rod, and ſpur, you may cauſe two footmen (that haue
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:421:56"/>
ſome skill) to ſtand with goads in their hands, &amp; when the horſſe refuſeth to go forward, then to rate him terriblie, and pricke him behind, till he doo go as you would haue him, &amp; then ceaſe. But during all this time, the rider ſhall ſit quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and ſaie nothing, and ſo ſoone as the horſſe goeth forward, or amendeth his fault, make much of him.</p>
            <p>An other waie to correct your horſſe for this <note place="margin">Sharpe corrections for a reſtie horſſe.</note> fault, is, that when he goeth arſward, and refuſeth to doo as you would, then to pull him ſtill backe, till he be wearie, and then let a footeman come behind with a long pike, hauing a wiſpe burning at the end thereof, and therewith pricke your horſſe till he go forward; which doing, you muſt make greatlie of him. But vnleſſe the horſſe be more than ordinarilie reſtie, I would not wiſh you to touch him with fire, or tie chords to his ſtones, or cats to his taile, as ſome men doo; bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo cruell corrections doo deforme the horſſes skin, and make him deſperate: beſides that, ſuch helps are ouer baſe, and vnfit to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by gentlemen.</p>
            <p>Remember alſo, that if an horſſe hauing this fault dooth weare an hard bit, you muſt take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, and in ſteede thereof put on a canon or ſcatch. You muſt likewiſe foreſee, whether your
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:421:57"/>
horſſe hath this fault through want of ſight: for if his eies be not good, then will he be fearefull to go forward in reſpect thereof: in which caſe you may not proceed with ſuch rigour, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by all faire meanes, and much making of, giue him courage to looke well vpon the thing he feareth. <hi>M. Claudio</hi> therefore dooth counſell riders to walke their horſſes abroad, as well in the night as the daie, and bring them in ſtreets and other places, where is much noiſe, and other things to be feared, as ſmiths ſhops, pewterers, braſiers, and ſuch like places.</p>
            <p>If your horſſe reareth, you muſt foorthwith <note place="margin">Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons if the horſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, &amp;c.</note> looke what is the occaſion therof, to the end you may prouide a remedie. As if you beare too hard an hand, you muſt hold it more temperatlie. But if the fault be in the horſſe, then beat him ſurelie ouerthwart his ſhoulders: which correction is alſo neceſſarie, when the horſſe dooth make his <hi>Coruette</hi> more high than you would haue him, or in dooing them caſt his legs ſtrait foorth. It is alſo neceſſarie, that at ſuch time as the horſſe dooth go about to reare, you beare a light hand vpon the bridle, and haue the curbe more ſlacke than ordinarie.</p>
            <p>But if your horſſe be ouer light, and apt to yarke behind, then ſhall you correct him well: if
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:421:57"/>
at euerie yarke you giue him a chocke with the bridle; accompaning the ſame with a ſtripe of the rod, ouerth wart his bodie and ſhoulders. Note alſo, that the crooper of ſuch horſſes ſhould be verie ſlacke, and likewiſe the quiſeill.</p>
            <p>If the horſſe dooth yarke when he is ſpurred, then muſt you continue to ſpur him the more, till he leaueth that fault: yet ſo, as the ſame be doone in due time, firſt with the one, and next with the other ſpur, mixing thereto a chocke of the bit, with the corrections of the rod &amp; voice. Till ſuch time as the horſſe be brought to leaue this falt, it were alſo good to haue a ſtrong bit, &amp; ſometimes put him forward a great waie in a ſwift gallop, and therewith tire him.</p>
