            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>DURING my ſtay at <hi>Dublin,</hi> (which
with much difficulty and hazard, I left
on <hi>June</hi> the 8th,) I made it a great part
of my Buſineſs to be well inform'd of the
State of Affairs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
matters that paſt there, which I had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of doing, as well by my own Obſervation, as
by what I received from Perſons of Credit, that I
frequently converſed with; that thereby I might be
enabled to give ſuch an Account, as might be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59931:4"/>
to the Government here, upon my Arrival to be
acquainted with, which in the following Narrative,
I have endeavoured to do with all poſſible Sincerity
and Impartiality.</p>
            <p>The Revenue of <hi>Ireland</hi> is quite ſunk, no Money
being raiſed, but by the Excize, that for this Year
and half paſt, there has not been paid one Penny of
the Civil Liſt; and now the late King has been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to make a new Eſtabliſhment, and gives only
Half Pay, which he calls <hi>Subſiſtance; They grumble at
it, and are ready to Mutiny:</hi> To the Foot Three pence
<hi>per</hi> day, and for the Officers 'tis no matter, he makes
them Content; The Dragoons have Five pence fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

and the Horſe Six pence <hi>per</hi> day: He propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
this, One half Money, and the other—For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
The Horſe Granadiers Fifty in each Troop,
Seven Regiments of Horſe 2750. Men; Seven Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of Dragoons, 3800 Men; The Royal Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Foot, Twenty two Companies 1980 Men.</p>
            <p>Forty two Regiments of Foot more 33852 Men.
The total is, 42432.</p>
            <p>Of this Army, there are about 17000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> drawn
Northwards, againſt <hi>Londonderry,</hi> and <hi>Enniskilling,</hi>
which are of the beſt, both of Horſe and Foot, and
have been ſo haraſſed, that within theſe ten days
paſt, they were not in any condition of Service;
there are Five thouſand more gone after theſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Enniskilling,</hi> and more on their March, ſo
that there are near Twenty five thouſand gone againſt
<hi>Londonderry</hi> and <hi>Enniskilling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides this, they deſigned two Camps by <hi>Dublin,</hi>
which Camps were to conſiſt of 14000 Men, the

that and <hi>Rathmines,</hi> on the South of <hi>Dublin,</hi> in the
view of the Harbor. The next Camp was to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in view of the Bay alſo.</p>
            <p>Colonel <hi>Sarſefield</hi> lies at <hi>Sligoe</hi> with his Own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment,
and ſome Dragoons, and has received ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rubbs from the People of <hi>Enniskilling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid, there came One hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pound with the late King, from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and Three hundred thouſand pound with the
Fleet, that arrived at <hi>Bantry;</hi> but by as near a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
as poſſibly can be made, we cannot find
that there came above One hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pound in all, the firſt being Sixty thouſand
pounds, and the laſt, Ninety thouſand pounds: and
about Nine hundred <hi>French, Engliſh, Scotch,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Officers came this laſt time with the Fleet, all which
receive the ſame allowance with the Officers of the
Army, proportionable to their Stations and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador influences all Affairs,
both Civil and Military, and 'tis diſcourſed amongſt
themſelves, what a prejudice he has againſt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Majeſty, having formerly been Ambaſſador in
<hi>Holland;</hi> he often preſſes for ſeverity to be uſed
againſt the Proteſtants. No violence whatever, that
is acted by any of the <hi>French,</hi> dares be complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, but it is ſtifled immediately, and he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
is frowned on. He has influenced the paſſing
the Bill for deſtroying the Act of Settlement, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that he has ſaid, that he would go again to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59931:5"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> if it were not done, to tell his Maſter.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Boyſloe,</hi> the Governor of <hi>Cork</hi>'s Letter to
the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, was the occaſion of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargo
at <hi>Dublin,</hi> on Saturday, <hi>May</hi> 18. laſt paſt.
The late King is wholly at their Diſcretion, and <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel</hi>
is mightily diſcompoſed, both in Body and
Mind, ſince the King came: For the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
ſaid, <hi>If any one had ſerved his Maſter as he did,</hi>
(about <hi>Londonderry) in taking away the Lord</hi> Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy's
<hi>Regiments, he would have loſt his Head.</hi> The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
Commands the Treaſury, and not one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is paid out, without his leave, for he views the
Muſter Rolls, before he ſuffers any payments to be
made ſo that the Deſign is plain <hi>French,</hi> and to bring
this Kingdom wholly under them, that thereby they
may divert <hi>England</hi> from annoying <hi>France:</hi> But now
they are become obnoxious to the People of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
who ſee, all that is for the <hi>French,</hi> ſo that great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
is upon the Spirits of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>French</hi> being put into Imployments,
for they generally ſay, and allow, that <hi>Ireland</hi> is
given to the <hi>French</hi> King, in conſideration of the
Charges he ſhall be at, in helping the late King <hi>James,</hi>
towards the regaining of the Kingdoms of <hi>England,</hi>
and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Boyſloe</hi> at <hi>Cork,</hi> ſeizes the Merchants
Goods, Drinks their Wines, and in ſhort, takes
away from them, whatever he has a mind to, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making them any ſatisfaction; and ſays, it is a

the Rebels of <hi>England.</hi>

The <hi>Enniskilling</hi> People have rummaged the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
for near thirty Miles round about them, and
brought in all the Cattle and Forrage they could find,
and have diſarmed ſeveral Companies of the new raiſed
<hi>Iriſh;</hi> and 'tis talked of by the late K. and the Caſtle,
that the Garriſon of <hi>Enniskilling</hi> were ſo reſolute, that
they would attempt the raiſing of the Siege of <hi>Derry;</hi>
the fear of which does ſomewhat alarm them, for about
the latter end of <hi>May</hi> they came near to <hi>Kells,</hi> thirty
Miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and Weſtward as far as <hi>Finnah,</hi>
burning <hi>Luke Reily,</hi> High-Sheriff of the County of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi>'s
Houſe, with the Houſes of other conſiderable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
who were in Arms againſt them, killing only
three Soldiers at a place call'd <hi>Drum,</hi> becauſe they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to quit their Arms; and as one <hi>Brady</hi> who is a
Papiſt, and an Inhabitant there declares, That they
were the faireſt Enemy that ever came into a Country,
not injuring any perſon that lived peaceably, leaving a
Troop of Horſe in the Town of <hi>Cavan,</hi> until all the
Army were marched away, to ſee that no injury
might be done to the common people: He likewiſe
ſays, they drove along with them about four or five
thouſand head of Cattel, that had lately been taken
from the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>As for the State of <hi>Enniskilling</hi> it is ſaid, that they are
in a very good Condition for Proviſion and all other
Neceſſaries as yet, and that there are there, and at <hi>Bally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhannon</hi>
eight hundred able Horſe beſides Foot, who
are brave reſolute Men: Moſt of them being Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
out of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Connaught,</hi> that fled thither,
who are reſolved to looſe their Lives, and ſacrifice all
rather than yield.</p>

On <hi>June</hi> the Firſt there marched from <hi>Dublin</hi> Sir

to attacque it, with a Reſolution to bear it down:
All Sir <hi>Michael Creagh</hi>'s Regiment raiſed in <hi>Dublin,</hi>
Sir <hi>John Fitz-Gerald</hi>'s from <hi>Munſter,</hi> and moſt that

            <p>There are gone from <hi>Dublin</hi> General <hi>La Roſe,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>La Roy,</hi> Count <hi>D' Eſtrades,</hi> and ſeveral other

to buy up all the Corn in <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Meath,</hi> to be
brought to <hi>Kells,</hi> twenty-ſeven Miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi>
and forty from <hi>Enniskilling,</hi> which is the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

they will meet with the ſame Penury and Want that

            </p>
            <p>Now for the State of <hi>London-Derry;</hi> it is ſaid
this morning at the Caſtle, they have ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it within half Cannon-ſhot, and taken the
Wind-Mill-Hill, which the Town quitted, and
had thrown up their Trenches, and drawn up all
their Army on <hi>Friday</hi> laſt, and ſo modeled and
divided them into two Bodies to compaſs the
Town, placing them in their ſeveral Poſts. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59931:6"/>
               <hi>Pontee</hi> was to have Bomb'd it before, but he
found when he came to examine, that the Fuſees
of the Bombs did not fit, ſome being to little, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to big, which he having new moulded and
worked up, did as he himſelf ſaid, intend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to Bomb on <hi>Sunday</hi> the ſecond inſtant. They
hear that there are Ships in the River, which
they believe will endeavour to Succour <hi>London-Derry;</hi>
but by the help of <hi>Culmore</hi> Fort, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Batteries they have raiſed, together with the
Chain and Bomb they have fixt a-croſs the River,
they hope to prevent them.</p>
            <p>There is an Account ſent up from the Camp,
of the Names and Behaviour of the ſeveral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
there, with which they make themſelves
ſport at the Caſtle, particularly the Lord <hi>Galmoy,</hi>
running himſelf into a Ditch of Briars; Lord
<hi>Kingſland</hi> getting into a Buſh of Furrs, together
with the Valour of Sir <hi>Gregory Birne,</hi> and Sir <hi>Luke
Dowdall,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A Dragoon that was ſhot into the Shoulder,
and came up to his Friends near <hi>Dublin,</hi> to get
Cure, ſaid, that abundance were loſt for want of
care being taken of them; that he himſelf had
ended his days, if he had ſtaid; that he left 400
lying of their Wounds in the Church of <hi>Culmore;</hi>
that they had loſt near 7 or 8000 by the Sword
and Sickneſs, ſince they ſat down before <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Barwick, James Fitz James,</hi> and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59931:7"/>
Lord <hi>George Howard,</hi> are ſaid to be in <hi>Brook-hall,</hi>
at Sir <hi>Matthew Bridge</hi> his Houſe, near <hi>Kilmore,</hi>
a curing of their Wounds.</p>
            <p>They likewiſe give out, they are in great want
of Proviſion in the Town, and are ſo crouded, that
they are very noiſom and full of Vermine, for
that ſeveral who have been taken and killed, are
found to be ſo. But in truth, as to the State of
their own Army, they have loſt as many for want
of Conveniencies, as have been killed: For the
Bloody-Flux, Small-pox, Feavers, and Agues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among them, they die extreamly faſt in the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Camp; the generality of their Suſtenance
being nothing elſe but Oatmeal and Water, with
ſome raw lean Beef, inſomuch that the ſpirits of
the men are mighty low, and very weak.</p>
            <p>There are gone down to them abundance of
<hi>French</hi> Officers, that are to be prefered as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
fall, with great reſolution what they
will do when they come there.</p>
            <p>They did not carry any of their great Guns
or Bombs over the River, but they lie on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, and ſo play over the Water at <hi>London-Derry.</hi>
Since there ſending the Army towards
<hi>Enniskilling,</hi> the People of <hi>East,</hi> and <hi>West-Meath</hi>
have raiſed the price of Corn extreamly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Kerry</hi> Forces are drawn to the <hi>Shannon</hi> to
fortifie all places on it, as <hi>Lymerick, Athlone,</hi> &amp;c.
All the beſt of the Forces are clearly drawn out
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59931:7"/>
of <hi>Munſter,</hi> except the Major-General's Regiment,
which is now Commanded by one Monſieur <hi>Boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſloe,</hi>
a moſt tyrannical <hi>French-man,</hi> who with his
Regiment is now at <hi>Cork<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> where he exerciſes an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Authority, that no manner of Complaint
againſt him will be heard, though he thruſt out
one of the Proteſtant Sheriff of <hi>Cork</hi>'s eyes, and
ſwore he would make no more of blowing up
all the Proteſtants in their Churches, than of a
Child in a Cradle. He threatens to Hang any
that ſhall be taken going away; and if four Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
be together, he looks on it as a Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
and ſends them to Goal: They have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
imployed Spies about <hi>Dublin,</hi> to ſee if any
Proteſtants meet or talk together; and are mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incenſed at the Imbargo in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe
they cannot have a free Correſpondence with their
Friends there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> the Fifth, the late King declared, He expected
in a Week's time, if the Wind ſerved, a great Fleet
from <hi>France,</hi> and a numerous Army of Land-men;
that the Fleet after landing their Men, would repair
to the <hi>Downs,</hi> to find out and fall on the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Fleet. Some of his Council adviſe him to <hi>Scotland;</hi>
others to <hi>Cheſter</hi> with his <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces,
as ſoon as <hi>Derry</hi> is taken.</p>
            <p>They have lately impriſoned ſeveral perſons in
<hi>Dublin,</hi> on a pretence for Plotting and Correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Rebels in the <hi>North,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.
and in ſearching for Treaſonable Papers and Arms,
they took away whatever Money they could
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59931:8"/>
find in the Houſes of the ſeveral perſons. They
likewiſe threaten another Search for Arms very
ſuddenly, when it is not queſtioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they
will take all Money and Plate away, for they
are erecting a Mint for the Coyning of Money.
One thing more is to be obſerved, That the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Clergy has ordered all their People not to
pay one Farthing to any Proteſtant, but to ſtand
it out to the uttermoſt, till they are compelled
by Law; the Deſign being viſible, that they would
utterly Extirpate the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there.</p>
            <p>The Wind no ſooner blows <hi>Eaſterly,</hi> but they
are in great dread and fear; yet they tell us,
there is Confuſion in <hi>England,</hi> and that there will
no Succours come from thence; that they will
land an Army in <hi>England</hi> ſuddenly; and that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
fears an Invaſion from <hi>Ireland,</hi> more than
it doth from them: Their uſual ſaying is, You
Whiggiſh Dogs, we will make you know, that
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is not come yet; and we
will do your buſineſs before he comes, for when
we come back from <hi>London Derry,</hi> we will make
an end of you all. And the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tenants and
Neighbours of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that formerly lived in
amity with, and chiefly depended on them, do
continually ſend the Souldiers to the Proteſtants
Houſes, telling them, that Whiggs live there;
where they go and eat up their Proviſions, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away their Horſes from the Plow, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
elſe they have a mind to, giving them horrid
Abuſes beſides; ſo that many Families who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
lived very plentifully, have not now left
them Bread to eat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59931:8"/>
The Popiſh Clergy appear in Multitudes, and
are going forward with all their Chappels and
Buildings, and looking out for Abbeys and Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries,
and do exaſperate the King mightily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Proteſtants. The Lord <hi>Melfort</hi> is alſo
very violent againſt them; and the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
(though an <hi>Engliſh-man)</hi> worſe than he.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Whitſon Monday,</hi> the Town of <hi>Drogheda</hi> was
alarm'd by two Officers who rid thorough it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Dublin,</hi> telling them, That the <hi>Scots</hi> were
within ſix Miles, and had taken the great Guns,
Carriages, Ammunition, and Proviſions, that
were going to <hi>Derry,</hi> and killed the Convoy:
Whereupon they immediately planted their Guns,
and ſhut up the Gates; having only two Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the new raiſed Men, and a few Horſe of
the Lord <hi>Gilmoys</hi> in the Town: An Expreſs was
ſent immediately to <hi>Duleek,</hi> where the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
of Enquiry into the Eſtates of the Abſenters
were met, (who being buſied in Swearing and
Examining the Tenants of the Earl of <hi>Drogheda,</hi>
and others, as to w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at Rents they paid, and what
Arrears of Rent were due) requiring them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to the Town, and bring with them what
Strength they could to fortifie the Town: Some
being ſent out to know the truth of the matter,
returning, told them, It was only a falſe Alarm;
tho' it was generally ſaid and believed, that ſeveral
Cart loads of their Ammunition, Proviſion, and
Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were intercepted and taken by the People
of <hi>Balliſhannon</hi> and <hi>Enniskilling.</hi>

There has been a Motion in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
for the Naturalizing all <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> inſomuch
that ſome ſaid in the Houſe, that they ought to
have a Day of Thankſgiving, for the coming of
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are preparing for another Court of
Claims, and reducing the Fees of all Offices,
throwing all Forſeitures into the Stock of Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals;
into which Stock the late King has thrown
his private Eſtate that he had in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The old Proprietors are taking poſſeſſion daily,
before the Act that makes void the Settlement of
<hi>Ireland</hi> paſſeth; ſome of them paying the Quit-Rent
to get into poſſeſſion; Eight Proteſtant Peers,
four being Spiritual, and four Temporal, entred
their Proteſt at the Bill paſſing the Lord's Houſe,
and Mr. <hi>Juſtice Dayly</hi> oppoſed it to that degree,
that in his Paſſion he ſaid many things that were
highly reſented, the ſubſtance whereof was, <q>That
inſtead of being a Parliament, as we pretend,
we are more like <hi>Maſſanello</hi>'s, confuſed Rabble,
every Man making a Noiſe for an Eſtate, and
talking Nonſence, when our Lives are in Danger:
we expect a ſudden Invaſion from <hi>England,</hi> and
a bloody War likely to enſue; as Perſons alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unmindful of the Ruine that hangs over
our Heads; and without taking any Care to
prevent it, we are dividing the Bears skin before
ſhe is taken. All the Honour we do His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
is, by reflecting on His Royal Father and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59931:9"/>
Brother, as wicked and unjuſt Princes, charging
them with enacting thoſe Laws that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Laws of God and Man.</q> Which
the Houſe ſummed up in ſix Articles againſt him:
They would have been contented with a Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but he refuſed any, ſaying, He would go to
<hi>Jamaica</hi> rather: Yet his Friends prevail'd on
him at this Juncture, to ask the Pardon of the
Houſe; and yeſterday he was to have come into
the Houſe of Commons; and accordingly the
the Houſe being ſat, the Uſher of the Black Rod
went in and acquainted the Speaker, that Mr.
<hi>Juſtice Dayly</hi> was at the Door; upon which it
was put to the queſtion, in the Houſe, Whether
his asking of Pardon ſhould be a ſufficient Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for them to paſs by his Miſcarriages; and
it being carried in the Affirmative, Mr. <hi>Nugent</hi>
of <hi>Carlingſtown,</hi> in <hi>West-Meath,</hi> a Member of the
Houſe, was ordered to go and acquaint him, that
the Houſe was reſolved to accept of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
that ſo there might be admittance for
his coming to receive Pardon of the Houſe.
Mr. <hi>Nugent</hi> returning into the Houſe, told the
Speaker that Mr. <hi>Juſtice Dayly</hi> was very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and ready to come in to make his Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and at the ſame time ſaid, Mr. <hi>Speaker, I
have other great News to tell you,</hi> viz. London-Derry
<hi>is taken.</hi> Upon which there was three great
Shouts ſet up in the Houſe, and throwing up their
Hats, cryed out, <hi>No Submiſſion of Mr.</hi> Juſtice
Dayly; <hi>We Pardon him, we Pardon him;</hi> being
tranſported with joy, ſuffered him not to come
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59931:10"/>
in, but pardoned him without any Submiſſion at
all. But afterwards ſome of the Members (none
of Mr. <hi>Dayly</hi>'s Friends) finding it falſe, thought
it was ſome Trick put on them, and threatned
Mr. <hi>Nugent,</hi> to bring him on his Knees before the

LETTER
FROM
<hi>Colonel Walker,</hi>
GIVING
A Full Account of the Treachery of
the late Governour of <hi>London<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derry.</hi>
            </head>
            <q>
               <p>WHen the Lord <hi>M—y</hi> left the
Garriſon of <hi>Londonderry,</hi> He
gave private Orders to the Colonel he
left Commander in Chief, <hi>That he ſhould
punctually obſerve whatſoever Directions he
ſhould receive from him from</hi> France.
Now ſuch were the Circumſtances of
that unfortunate Lord, that being ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
by the late King <hi>James,</hi> and
lookt upon as the Betrayer of that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59931:16"/>
Kingdom, He had no other way of
inſinuating into his Favour, and regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his loſt Reputation with him, but
by promiſing to make Colonel <hi>L</hi>—
an Inſtrument to break and ruin the
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and render them incapable
of oppoſing any Army, that ſhould
March againſt them.</p>
               <p>The deluded <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Derry,</hi> and
all over the North, were extremely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd,
that they had ſo good a Souldier
for their Head; One whom they really
believ'd to be of their own Religion,
and who ſeem'd to be ſo zealouſly and
warmly Affected to Their Intereſt; and
therefore they entirely relied and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
upon his <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi>
and ſubmitted themſelves to his <hi>Conduct</hi>
and <hi>Management,</hi> never entertaining the
leaſt Suſpicion of him till it was too late;
thô it was Whiſper'd in every Corner of
the Garriſon, That he had ſaid, <hi>He would
heartily Fight againſt</hi> Tyrconnel, <hi>but not
againſt King</hi> James. At length a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
and regular Army of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59931:16"/>
March'd down towards the North; Our
Forces then having not the leaſt Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Approach, till they came
almoſt to the <hi>Towns</hi> where our Men were
Garriſon'd, which they were forced to
quit in great diſorder and confuſion.</p>
               <p>The Colonel in the mean time ſat
quietly at home, neither made any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for the <hi>Frontier Garriſons,</hi> nor gave
any Orders to Fortifie and Secure them,
and oppoſe the <hi>Enemy,</hi> before they were
Blooded and Animated with <hi>Succeſs.</hi>
Soon after (without any oppoſition) they
overrun the two great Counties of <hi>Doun</hi>
and <hi>Antrim:</hi> And then the Colonel ſent
Letter after Letter to the Lord <hi>K—n</hi> at
<hi>Sligoe,</hi> where there was good ſtore of
<hi>Proviſions</hi> and <hi>Forage,</hi> to come and joyn
his <hi>Horſe</hi> at laſt with the <hi>Lagan</hi> Forces.
The Lord ſent him word, <hi>That if the Horſe
came away, the Foot would not be perſwaded
to continue there; and that he feared there
was not ſuch plenty of Proviſion for their
Horſe and Men in the</hi> Lagan, <hi>as they had at</hi>
Sligoe. Upon this Anſwer, the Colonel
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59931:17"/>
ſends an Expreſs to my Lord, <hi>That both
his Horſe and Foot ſhould quit</hi> Sligoe, <hi>and
March immediately to the aſſiſtance of</hi>
Derry.</p>
               <p>My Lord wearied with theſe <hi>Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi>
and not in the leaſt miſtruſting the
Integrity of the Colonel, advances with
his Forces, and was followed by all the
Inhabitants of the Town. But no ſooner
were they come to <hi>Balliſhanon,</hi> 20 Miles
from <hi>Sligoe,</hi> but they receiv'd a Meſſage
from the Colonel, <hi>That there was not Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
for the Horſe in the</hi> Lagan. The <hi>Enemy</hi>
by this time had poſſeſt themſelves of
<hi>Sligoe;</hi> ſo that they were forc'd to ſtay at
<hi>Ballyſhanon,</hi> where both their <hi>Horſe</hi> and
<hi>Men</hi> were expoſed to the greateſt Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,
and were almoſt deſtroy'd for
want of Proviſions.</p>
               <p>All this while the Towns of <hi>Eniskilling</hi>
and <hi>Ballyſhanon</hi> had no Ammunition
ſent them from him, thô he had at the
ſame time above 500 Barrels of <hi>Powder</hi>
in the <hi>Pullir Store-houſe</hi> at <hi>Derry;</hi> neither
could he be perſwaded by any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59931:17"/>
to get Forage into <hi>Derry,</hi> thô
the Neighbouring Country round
about him had great quantities of
<hi>Hay</hi> and <hi>Oats,</hi> and made a voluntary
offer of them for the ſervice of the
<hi>Garriſon.</hi> Beſides, as if he had along
deſign'd the Ruin of that Place, and
conſequently of the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi>
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he ſtill gave <hi>Paſſes</hi> to every
Man that ask'd them: He endeavour'd
to poſſeſs them that were the moſt Bold
and Reſolute, with ſtrange apprehenſions
of their Danger; and where this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not, out of the abundance of his
Affection, he courted and invited others
to accept of <hi>Paſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards, when the <hi>Enemy</hi> made
their approaches nearer <hi>Derry,</hi> He drew
out a Body of 7000 Men, pretending he
would fight them at a <hi>Paſs</hi> they were to
come over: But as ſoon as ever Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Shelden</hi> (with his <hi>Horſe)</hi> advanc'd,
He gave him the Sign to come over,
and ran away, Swearing a great Oath
and ſaying, <hi>Gentlemen, I ſee you will not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59931:18"/>
Fight.</hi> Thô at the ſame time, they were
in all appearance very zealous and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to Engage. From thence he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
fled to the City, and then
ſhut the <hi>Gates</hi> upon Thouſands of Souls,
pretending ſcarcity of <hi>Proviſions,</hi> who
all either periſhed for Hunger, or were
left as a Prey and Sacrifice to the rage
and fury of their inſulting <hi>Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after Colonel <hi>C</hi>—and <hi>R</hi>—with
two Regiments came to the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of <hi>Derry,</hi> whom he diſcouraged
from ſtaying; declaring, <hi>That they had
Proviſion but for a very few Days, and that
the People who were in the City were but a
Rabble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, all the Tranſactions in
their <hi>Council of War,</hi> as they called it,
(thô none were admitted to it but the
Colonels own Creatures) were managed
with the greateſt Secrecy; and the
better to delude the <hi>Garriſon,</hi> it was
given out, <hi>That the Forces would forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Land.</hi> And of this they were ſo
fully perſwaded, that many went Aboard
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59931:18"/>
the <hi>Ships</hi> that were in the Harbour, to
careſs and congratulate the <hi>Souldiers</hi>
ſafe Arrival, who were not ſuffered to
return again; but againſt their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
were brought into <hi>England.
C</hi>—next Day (when on Board, and as
it was agreed betwixt him and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
Colonel) ſends him a Letter,
<hi>That he had diſcovered ſome Ships at a
diſtance, which muſt needs be further Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
deſign'd for the relief of</hi> Derry; <hi>that
he would fall down to the Harbours Mouth,
and return again with the reſt of the Fleet.</hi>
This Letter was handed up and down
<hi>Derry</hi> to pacifie the People, though
generally they began to apprehend they
were ſold and betrayed: And in this
their Suſpicion they were confirmed by
a Lady (Related to the Colonel) who
had forgot her Cue, and unwarily told
a Lieutenant in the <hi>Garriſon, That</hi> C—<hi>did
not deſign to Land, and that his Letter
was a meer Sham.</hi> After this <hi>C</hi>—ſet
Sail, and hover'd at a little diſtance,
expecting the Colonel, who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59931:19"/>
him to make his Eſcape, and go
with him for <hi>England;</hi> but the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
not coming according to the time
appointed, he purſued his Voyage, and
left us under the Apprehenſions of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Deſtruction. But (bleſſed be
<hi>GOD)</hi> We have hitherto made ſome
tolerable Defence for our ſelves, and
ſtill hope, to give a good account of
the Place. I am</p>
