         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is not any Doctrine more uſefull to
the life of man, or more neceſſary to be
known to the comfort of the Saints, then
the Doctrine of Providence; for not to
know and beleeve, that God the Creator
doth by his ſecret and wiſe providence
govern all things, is injurious to God,
and hurtfull to our ſelves, and as much
as to deny the Soveraignty and high prerogative of the Lord
<hi>Jehovah</hi> over the worlds; which is indeed the exerciſe of his
Kingly dominion, in ordering the whole univerſe, which in the
following Diſcourſe I offer unto your ſerious conſideration: But
becauſe theſe times are peſtered with many peſtilent opinions, and
ſeditious practiſes, all truths cannot pleaſe all men, every man
believeth or denieth whatſoever may moſt advance their own
particular judgments and intereſts; ſo that I well know this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
will be very unpleaſant to many of this age: Therefore
(good Readers and my friends) let me beg your patience, not
only in the matter of my diſcourſe, thwarting the deſires and
ſelf-deſignes of men, it being againſt the common ſtream of the
now raigning opinions; but in the manner alſo, in my applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the preſent Changes and alterations, deſigns and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
ſo ſtrongly ſtrugled for by the moſt of men; to all which
this my diſcourſe runs in flat oppoſition; the ſame thing being
<pb facs="tcp:119009:3"/>
flatly denied which I affirm and do defend. I think I am the firſt
that in this way and manner hath publiſhed any thing in defence
of the preſent Government under his Highneſs the <hi>Lord Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor:</hi>
I have not read nor ſeen any thing written of this nature,
but what hath been to the contrary; by which I received ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſatisfaction, or am ſo farre from being ſatisfied by what I have
read, that my ſpirit burned within me to make oppoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
which cauſed me to put my pen to paper on this ſubject.
Give me alſo leave to give my Judgment in the matter; I am one
of the free-born of the Nation, and claim my vote as well as any
other, having a proportionable right to all priviledges, and muſt
proportionably ſhare in any affliction that God ſhall pleaſe to
inflict upon the Nation; Therefore it concerns me to ſpeak as
well as to hear others ſpeak; if I ſpeak not their ſenſe, let me be
born with, as I bear with them that ſpeak not my ſenſe: if any
my friends be offended at what I write, I cannot help their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
nor will I be angry at them: I know not any mans aym nor
end in what they do, ſo well as I know my own: I know my
own; I know my aym is publike good, and my end Gods glory,
nor do I ſeek to pleaſe men but to pleaſe God, I ſeek not victory
but verity; if God accept of my endeavour, I have my end; if
men reject it, or me for it; I paſs not: yet I would ſo ſpeak and
write, that I may not give any offence, neither to the Jew, nor to
the Gentile, nor to the Church of God: but if offence be taken
without cauſe, why therefore ſhould I loſe my liberty in which
Chriſt hath made me free? But though I be free from all men (as
the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) yet would I be ſervant to all (in the
ſenſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) that I might gain the more to God:
<hi>There is a time to ſpeak, and a time to keep ſilence;</hi> If ever there
were a time to ſpeak for God, and the Cauſe of the Saints on
earth, the deſpiſed ones, it is now no time to be ſilent, but to
contend earneſtly for the truth, and for the faith that was once
delivered to the Saints: It was but once delivered, I dare not ſay
it ſhall be delivered a ſecond time, to them that have had it once
delivered, if they loſe it, whether it be to a Nation or to a man
only.</p>
            <p>We in <hi>England</hi> have had it delivered to us, We, beyond <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum,</hi>
have <hi>been exalted unto Heaven</hi> &amp;c. the myſteries of the
Goſpel have been unfolded unto us above all other Nations, and
<pb facs="tcp:119009:3"/>
God hath long owned us to be his people; the Word hath been
operative, working in power, piercing even to the dividing of
ſoul and ſpirit, joynts and marrow; a diſcerner of the thoughts
and intentions of the heart: It hath been a converting Word,
elſe whence had thoſe rebellious children their converſion boaſted
of, that caſt off their Mother that bare them, and brought them
forth? an Antichriſtian Church brings not forth a Chriſtian
brood: It is thus farre true, that we have had much chaff mixt
with the pure wheat, many weeds have grown in this vineyard
of Gods planting: Was there ever wheat without chaff? Was
there ever a garden without weeds? but never ſo many as at this
day: ſome have been alwayes, and ſome will be to the end of the
world: there ſhall be, there muſt be tares among the good corn:
the evil one will caſt tares where God caſts good ſeed; and that
evil one hath been buſie in this age above all ages; the field of
Gods Kingdom ſeemeth now to be covered all over with tares,
but God can gather in his good corn, and weed out thoſe tares, at
the day of his harveſt: he will manifeſt the blaſphemers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the horrid blaſphemies, ſtrange ſelf-opinions, falſe chriſts,
falſe apoſtles and teachers, ſeducers of mens ſouls, evil angels in
ſhape of Angels of light, that under the notion of truth broach
damnable hereſies, doctrines of devils: All o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d herefles, abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by the primitive Church, are all at this day revived at once,
and in diſguiſed new dreſſes, come like wolves in ſheeps cloathing:
theſe are ſuch as trouble the Church of God, which the Apoſtle
in his time wiſhed to have been cut off, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 12. And it is the
duty of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate to ſuppreſs them; he is as Chriſts
vicegerent and Lievetenant on earth, not only to command ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
of the firſt Table, but alſo of the ſecond: If he that
deſpiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, died without mercy, under two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;
<hi>how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye ſhall he be thought
worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Sonne of God.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and done
deſpight to the ſpirit of grace?</hi> Heb. 10. 28, 29. And the ſword is
not put into the Magiſtrates hand in vain We read in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.
from <hi>verſ.</hi> 2 to <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. if any had broken the covenant with God,
and worſhipped falſe gods, he was to be ſtoned to death: yet I
ſay not, that every hereſie under the Goſpel ſhould be puniſhed
by death: but I ſay, it is the duty of the ſupreme Magiſtrate, to
ſuppreſs all hereſie and blaſphemy by a Law: Nor do I ſay, that
<pb facs="tcp:119009:4"/>
an erring Conſcience is to be puniſhed by the Law of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
if he keep his erring opinion within his own walls; but if
he ſeduce others, and thereby ſtirre up ſedition, alienating mens
judgments from due obedience, I ſay ſuch a one is liable to the
wrath of the Civil Magiſtrate; and thoſe Magiſtrates, that tolerate
or connive at ſuch things, will be found to do the work of the
Lord negligently: thoſe things I only hint at by the way, and leave
to the conſideration of the judicious.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid as to the matter of my following diſcourſe,
which is Providence, ordering all things; it is the truth of God
held forth in ſacred Scripture, from which I cannot retrograde:
what I have ſaid as to the matter applicatory, I only give my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and leave the even to that Providence which governs all
things. As to my vindication of the Lord Protector, whom Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath exalted, Providence will yet further order him, and
all his counſels and actions, <hi>after the counſel of Gods will:</hi> God
hath a great work for him to do, and it ſhall be done, whether to
be a <hi>nurſing father</hi> to the Church of Chriſt, and a skilfull <hi>Eſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi>
to heal the diſtempers of three ſick and wounded Nations, or
whether for a contrary work, I cannot aſſert, God only knowes
it, to whom all ſecrets belong: what is revealed belongs to us,
and it is our duty as we are men, to own the Powers that be; and as
we are Chriſtian men to pray for them; therefore for him; that
God will make him a glorious inſtrument in his own hand for his
glory and the peoples good. We hope well, but prayer is better
then our hopes, and is the means to accompliſh our hope: and
God is alwayes better to his praying people then their prayers:
let us not ſinne by withholding our prayers, which thing hath
ſometimes cauſed bleſſings to be turned into curſes: Let us not
limit the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor give rules to Providence; nor let
us ſpend our time in deviſing and plotting, nor as the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
make it our work to hear and to tell News; but pray and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
for peace and truth; and beleeve, that <hi>God is a rewarder to
them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> There is yet balm in <hi>Gilead,</hi> a dore

<pb facs="tcp:119009:4"/>
let us pray unto God for our Governours, for his Highneſs, and
for his Parliament; for as God doth inſtruct the husbandman to
diſcretion, to break the clods of his ground, and to caſt in his ſeed
in the appointed place and time, as the Prophet ſpeaketh; ſo doth
he inſtruct Princes, and teacheth them diſcretion to rule and govern
as he pleaſeth; for by him Princes raign and rule; <hi>The husbandman
waiteth for the fruit of the earth</hi> (ſaith <hi>James) and hath long patience
for it, untill he receive the early and the later rain;</hi> and ſhall not
we follow the footſteps of providence, and patiently wait Gods
time and means, for giving us the bleſſings promiſed? Let us caſt
off our own wayes, wills and deſigns, and be obedient to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and ſee what the Lord our God will do for us. Courteous
Reader, read me with patience, not with any prejudice: try all
truths, oppoſe nothing that is truth; good counſell is not to be
ſlighted, nor ſeaſonable reproof to be ſcorned, though it come
from one of whom you could ſay as <hi>Achab</hi> ſaid of <hi>Michaiah,</hi> that
you hate him, and that he doth not ſpeak good concerning you
but evil: I have written what God hath inſtructed me, do you
read, and read all; then judge (as God ſhall put into your heart)
of him who is your ſervant in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that deſires
increaſe of grace to you and all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God.</p>

            <p>Yea more, It is evident from ſacred Scriptures, That all the wicked Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of wicked men are ordered by providence, God ruleth them, and orders
them for the accompliſhment of his ſecret counſel, and by the ordering of
thoſe Actions God hath glory: I ſay, they are ordered by providence, not as
wicked men intend or act them, they intend and act out of a wicked prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
to a wicked end, but God orders them otherwiſe, to effect ſomething
of his own decree, and turns it to good in the doing his will; The action,
and the ſin in the action is their own, but the ordering of the action is of
God: All wicked actions of wicked obdurated <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> providence ordered
to the glory of God. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> hath this expreſſion, <hi>For the Scripture ſaith of</hi>
Pharaoh, <hi>even for this cauſe have I raiſed thee up, that I might ſhew my power in

His cruelty in deſtroying all the male-children of the Hebrews; <hi>Moſes</hi> being

his encreaſe of the burthens and labours on the Hebrews, and his oft refuſing

               <note n="i" place="margin">Iſa. 29. 10</note>; God is not only
a bare permitter of evil actions in men, but he is a powerful agent, ordering
of thoſe evil Actions by his wiſe and ſecret providence, to ſerve to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

is Gods, ordered to his own glory; <hi>Job</hi> tels us, that <hi>the deceiver and the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

               <note n="k" place="margin">Ioh 12. 16.</note>, he ordereth both; <hi>If a Prophet be deceived when he hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

               <note n="l" place="margin">Eze. 14. 9</note>, that is, ſuch Prophets as <hi>Ahabs</hi> four
hundred Prophets were, whom Satan could not deceive till he was bid to go
and prevail: All the actions of the devil are ordered by providence, and there
is not, nor cannot be any action of the devil but what is extreamly wicked:
Remarkable is that place of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 17. 13. ſpeaking of that foul apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

ſaith not they will give, but they ſhall give, as a thing that God had pre-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to be, much more may be ſaid, this I hope may ſuffice to prove this
Truth.</p>
            <p>Yet furrhermore you ſhall ſee, that as God orders by his providence all
Men, and all Actions, of all ſorts, their times, their diſpoſitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo he
ordereth the very ſecrets of the heart, and the anſwer of the tongue; The
Wiſeman tels us, <hi>The Kings heart is in the hand of God, be turns it as the Rivers

The man thar ſhall conſult within himſelf, and debate in his own thoughts,
and come to a full reſolurion what he will anſwer or ſpeak to this or that
thing, ſo as that he thinks nothing ſhall alter him, yet that man when he
comes to put his reſolves into action, ſhall ſpeak or do as providence ſhall
order and direct, it may be quite contrary to what he reſolved, ſomething
will come in between the preparation and the action; <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the High Prieſt
doubtleſſe ſpake not thoſe words of himſelf when he ſaid, It was expedient
that one man ſhould die for the people, but Providence ordered him to uſe
thoſe thoſe words, <hi>That as he was High-Prieſt that year, he prophefied, that Chriſt
ſhould die for the Nation</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 11. 51.</note>: So the Wiſeman tels us, Many ſeek the favour of the

ſeek the favour of a Judge before whom they have a matter to come, but
they conſider not that the verdict ſhall be as providence ſhall order it.</p>
            <p>Yea, Providence extendeth to the leaſt and ſmalleſt of things as well as to
the greateſt, for God worketh all things <hi>after the counſell of his own will,</hi> even
thoſe things that men corruptly call Chance or Fortune; The very hairs of a

ſo all creatures readily obey his command, they are all at his call, at

            <p>You know that <hi>Gideon</hi> was a good man, and God ſtirred him up to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer

Yet <hi>Gideon</hi> that he might leave a memorial of his acts and name, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the people their earrings, and their chains of gold, which they had taken

he made an <hi>Ephod,</hi> and put it in his City, <hi>And all Iſrael went a whoring after it,</hi>
that is, they ſuperſtitiouſly worſhiped it, <hi>which thing became a ſnare to</hi> Gideon
<hi>and to his houſe</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Iud. 8. 27</note>; This was the means to bring a period to <hi>Gideons</hi> Family,
for as ſoon as <hi>Gideon</hi> was dead, <hi>Abimelech</hi> the Son of <hi>Gideon,</hi> which he had by
his Concubine a <hi>Shechemite,</hi> together with the men of <hi>Shechem,</hi> conſpired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

Here was ambition, treachery, and murther in <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and in the men of
<hi>Shechem,</hi> this puts a period to the life of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> to the people of <hi>Shechem,</hi>

            <p>So you know <hi>Ahab</hi> ſinned, he ſold himſelf to do wickedly, and God by
the Prophet foretelleth the deſtruction of him, of his Family, and of his
Kingdom<note n="b" place="margin">1 King. 21. 21.</note>; Providence brings <hi>Jehu</hi> to be the Inſtrument to accompliſh this
work, <hi>Iehu</hi> did it to the full, and with great zeal, ſeeming to the Lord of

yet <hi>Iehu</hi> muſt be no leſſe puniſhed then he had puniſhed <hi>Ahab; Calvin</hi> gives a

               <note n="f" place="margin">Verſ. 31.</note>, <hi>Iehu</hi> ſinning like
<hi>Ahab</hi> muſt be puniſhed like <hi>Ahab,</hi> and it was made good accordingly at the

            <p>This is an admonition to them of our time whom God hath made Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to puniſh the ſins and oppreſſions of others, that they take heed that
they be not guilty of the ſinnes and oppreſſion that they have puniſhed in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
It were a happineſſe to this Nation if ſome were not as faulty as thoſe
that they have puniſhed; It is good that ſin be puniſhed, but it will prove
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119009:10"/>
very ill to the puniſhers that walk in the practiſe of the ſame ſinnes. It was

will, or what it was, or the cauſe of doing it; but it was very ill in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8.
that he continued in the practiſe of the ſame ſuperſtition and perſecution of
Gods people: It was a good act to cut off Tyranny, but it is extream evil
that the ſame hands ſhould act high oppreſſion; God will ſtir up other hands
to cut off them and their Families, he hath already ſhewed his anger, and
will perfect it to their ruine, if their repentance prevent it not, for God is
unchangeable in all his judgements and his dealings with men, <hi>wherein a man
ſinneth therein he ſhall be puniſhed,</hi> as it was with <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> if men notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all warnings, admonitions, and examples, will go on in ſin, it is a
ſign that their period is nigh: Thus it was with the Sons of <hi>Ely,</hi> they were
wicked, and they were oppreſſive, they cauſed the <hi>Sacrifices of God to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 17.</note>,
and they were admoniſhed by good old <hi>Ely,</hi> but they would not
hearken to his voice, to be reformed, and why? becauſe ſaith the Text
<hi>The Lord would ſlay them</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 24.</note>, and providence ordereth the Philiſtins to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
to accompliſh it; This was alſo the occaſion of caſting off <hi>Flies</hi>
Family for ever: By this we ſee how providence orders things, Actions, and
Inſtruments to overturn and cut off Men and Families, yea, whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
as we ſee in the mighty of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> at the period of time the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
upon the wall ſhewed <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> that God had <hi>numbred his Kingdom
and finiſhed it</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Dan. 5. 26</note>, the ſet time was come, and the ſame night was <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>
ſlain, and the Monarchy transferred to the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> when he lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

to be brought to carouſe in, which his Father <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had taken out
of the Temple in <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> God defers long, but when he ſmites he doth
it ſuddenly, when men leaſt look for it, and that irreſiſtibly.</p>
            <p>Now as providence ordereth things, Actions and Inſtruments, to cut off
and to deſtroy, as it pleaſeth him, ſo providence ordereth things, Actions and
Inſtruments, ſecondary cauſes, to advance men, families, and kingdoms, when
he pleaſeth; Of which I ſhall offer two or three Inſtances; We ſee when God
for the bringing his own purpoſe to paſſe in accompliſhment of his Decree
and promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and would to that end advance <hi>Ioſeph</hi> above
his brethren, that he might be the Inſtrument to preſerve his Fathers houſe,
which was then the only viſible Church on earth, Providence orders every
thing to concurre: And herein obſerve theſe nine particular peeces of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
1. <hi>Iacobs</hi> love to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> procures his brethrens hatred<note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 37. 2, 3, 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> v. 10. 11</note>. 2 His Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
hatred procure conſultations and conſpiracies againſt the life of <hi>Ioſeph.</hi>
3. Providence ſuffereth them not to agree in their counſels to kill him, and
ſo his life was preſerved. 4. They ſell him to the Midianitiſh Merchants, theſe
Merchants carry him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and there they ſell him to <hi>Potiphar</hi> a chief
Officer to King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> where God bleſſeth <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and proſpered all that
he put his hand unto<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 39. 2, 3, 4.</note>. 5. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> is caſt into priſon by the falſe accuſation of
<hi>Potiphars</hi> wife: In the priſon he findeth favour of the Keeper of the priſon,
and is truſted by him<note n="o" place="margin">Ver. 21.</note>. 6. Two of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſervants, his chief Butler and
his chief Baker are by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> caſt into the ſame priſon where <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was<note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 4. 2, 3</note>,
and are put under <hi>Ioſephs</hi> charge. 6. This Butler and this Baker dream each
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119009:11"/>
of them one dream in one and the ſame night; <hi>Ioſeph</hi> came to the knowledge
of their dreams, and ſhews them the interpretation of it. 7. This occaſioneth
<hi>Ioſephs</hi> skill and knowledge in the Interpretation of dreams to be known<note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 41. 12.</note>
8. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> alſo dreameth a dream which none could interpret, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> to be ſent for out of the priſon, who telleth unto <hi>Phara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Houſe, and over the whole Kingdom, next to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelf<note n="r" place="margin">Ver. 40.</note> 9. God
brings a famine on all the earth, except in <hi>Egypt,</hi> for there he had given plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
Therefore <hi>Iacob</hi> ſends his Sons into <hi>Egypt</hi> to buy food<note n="ſ" place="margin">Gen. 42. 2, 3.</note> there they bow
to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> their brother and do homage to him, as was foretold by his dream,
and for which they ſo much the more hated him<note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 37. 7, 9.</note>: Thus you ſee how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
ordered every thing to concurre to effect Gods purpoſe: And <hi>Ioſeph</hi>
himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>els his brethren as much, ſaying, <hi>It was not you but God that ſent me

accompliſh what was promiſed long before<note n="w" place="margin">Gen. 15. 13. Act. 7. 6.</note>.</p>
            <p>The like inſtance we have in the advancement of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Very obſervable in ten other particular peeces of providence: 1. That at ſo
great and publike Feaſt as the King <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> made to his princes and people,
it ſhould come into the Kings minde to ſend for his Queen <hi>Vaſtai,</hi> a thing
unuſuall at ſuch meetings. 2. That the Queen ſhould give ſo peremptory a
denial: And that the King for that one offence, ſhould be ſo greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
againſt his Queen, whom he loved (and in whoſe beauty he gloried)
as to call for advice to revenge himſelf upon her<note n="x" place="margin">Eſt. 1. 11</note>. 3. That the Princes, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and wiſe men, ſhould thereupon ſuddenly adviſe to put away <hi>Vaſtai</hi> from
being Queen. 4. That when the faireſt of the Perſian Virgins were to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the King to chuſe him another Queen, that <hi>Eſter</hi> ſhould be brought
amongſt them, who was of a ſtrange Countrey and a Captive, without any
friend or means in Court to preferre her, nor was her kindred nor family
known, yet providence gives her favour in the eyes of <hi>Hegai</hi> the keeper of
the women<note n="y" place="margin">Eſt. 2. 9.</note>, and of all that looked on her, and ſpecially in the eyes of the
King, ſo as ſhe was taken into the houſe Royall, and afterward became
Queen in <hi>Vaſtai's</hi> ſtead<note n="z" place="margin">ve. 16, 17.</note>. 5. That <hi>Mord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cai</hi> a captive Jew ſhould be in the

this diſcovery of <hi>Morde at</hi> ſhould be recorded, and <hi>Mordecai</hi> named for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer.
7. That <hi>Haman</hi> the <hi>Agagite</hi> having gotten an irrevocable decree to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<hi>Mordecai</hi> and all the Jews, the whole Church of God<note n="b" place="margin">Eſth. 3. 8, 13.</note>, yet ſwelling in rage
againſt <hi>Mordecai,</hi> prepared a gallows of fifty cubits high to hang <hi>Mordecai</hi>
thereon<note n="c" place="margin">Eſt. 5. 14.</note>. 8. That the ſame night before the intended execution of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai,</hi>
Sleep ſhould go from the King, which cauſed him to call for the
Chronicles to be brought and read before him, and that the act of <hi>Mordecais</hi>

to think of giving honour to <hi>Mordecai,</hi> which he never thought of before<note n="d" place="margin">Eſt. 6. 1, 2</note>.
9. That at that very inſtant <hi>Haman</hi> ſhould come to the King with intention
to ſpeak that <hi>Mordecai</hi> might be hanged on the Gallows prepared, of which
he was not only diſappointed, but to his ſhame and grief was made the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

from the cruelty of their enemies, but was greatly advanced to their great
joy, rejoycing, and thankſ-giving, to the praiſe and glory of God; All which
is left to the memory of all ages upon ſacred record; Such is the power and

            <p>Something I might ſay of many particulars and clear providence, obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of late daies in ordering things, Actions, and Inſtruments, leading <hi>Oliver</hi>
our preſent Lord Protector to the place, office, and dignity in which he now
ruleth, with the Honourable High Court of Parliament, for whom I pray,
and of whom I intend to ſay ſomething more in the proper place afterward,
in the mean time we have I hope ſaid enough to prove that God and God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
pulleth down Kings and ſetteth up Kings; That ſo we may acknowledge
that every mercy and every judgement is from God, ordered by him, and is
not from men, whatſoever their deſigns are, or whatſoever they intend or
aim at as their end, for all men good and bad are but Inſtruments in Gods
hand, ſecondary cauſes, and can do nothing but what God by Providence leads
them to do, or permits to be done to effect his own purpoſe and ſecret decre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>,
ordering all and every Action thereunto.</p>
            <p>It is true, that a merciful man doth good, and a good man ſheweth mercy,
but a good mans goodneſſe is not his own, he hath received it from God who
is the fountain of all good, nor can a good man diſtribute good to another
but as he is guided by God, he is but the Inſtrument in Gods hand, <hi>Every
good and perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note>:
A man may be able to do good to this or that man, yet he may ſometimes
want will to do it, if he have a will it is from God, where, how, or to whom
he ſhall do that good; or if a good man have a will and intention to do good
to this or that man, his intentions may be croſſed that he cannot do it, or if
he be not croſſed in his intentions, yet the good he doth may turn to the hur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
of him that receives it, except God bleſſe and proſper it, ſo that all good
and every mercy to any man, let the Inſtrument be what it will it is from
God: God gave <hi>Ioſeph</hi> favour with the Keeper of the priſon<note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 39, 21.</note> and God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
mercy to his people in the ſight of the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Ezr. 9. 9.</note>, all is from
God; Men are but Gods Inſtruments, therefore <hi>Iacob</hi> praieth to God that
God would give his Sons favour with the men they had to do with<note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 43. 14</note>.</p>
            <p>And as it is in mercies, ſo it is in judgements and afflictions, all is from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119009:12"/>
God, men are his Inſtruments, ſecondary cauſes; It is true that wicked men
deviſe and imagine miſchief continually, and plot againſt the righteous, to
afflict and to moleſt them, although the wickedneſſe which they plot is their
own; And they think they have power to act accordingly, they never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will to do it, yet they are croſſed by providence in acting what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend:
And often yea alwaies (to the Elect of God) the evil they think to do
turns to the good of them againſt whom it is done; as the bufferings from
Satan did to <hi>Paul,</hi> it was advantage to him, for if wicked men could act
anſwerable to their wils and intentions, neither righteouſneſſe nor holineſſe
ſhould be amongſt men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not the man on earth that ſhould practiſe either, but

place; All that I now drive at, is but to prove, that all ſecondary cauſes,
men or things, can do nothing of themſelves either to miſery or to happineſs;
But that all mercies and all judgements, are of God, from him, and by him,
he diſappointeth the deviſes of the crafty, ſo that their hands cannot perform
their enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>This I ſay is the Soveraignty of God the Creator over all things, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
the world by his wiſe and ſecret providence; And it doth above all
things declare the glory, omnipotency, and incomprehenſible wiſedom of
God, working in and by all things, <hi>after the counſell of his own will;</hi> That all
things though in motion and uſe, never ſo contrary one to another, and in
their nature and ends deſtructive one to another, yet all and every thing in
moſt harmonious union, work together in one conſent to effect and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
whatever God hath in his ſecret counſel determined, yea, by the worſt
of Inſtruments, to do glorious things, bringing good out of their evil, and
work deliverance to his Church by the, Enemies Actions, and deſtroy his
Enemies by their own counſels, cauſing <hi>the wiſedom of the wiſe to periſh, and to

            <p>Thus much ſhall ſerve for foundation or groundwork of our intended diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
from whence we may gather ſome inferences, and therein take a view
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119009:12"/>
of ſome late and remarkable Providences in theſe our daies, ordering Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
Actions and Things contrary to mens deſigns and endeavours, and <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all things after the counſell of his own will,</hi> pulling down and ſetting up
whom he pleaſeth for the accompliſhment of his own ſecret purpoſe, firſt one,
and then others, changing times and ſeaſons, men and counſels, governments
and things: From whence I inferre,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That all mercies are from God, and are given in to a Nation or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Gods free love, not of any deſert, merit, or by any procurement of
men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That all judgements and afflictions are from God only, and are
the juſt recompence for ſin, procured by our ſelves, men or things afflicting,
being but ſecondary cauſes, inſtruments in Gods hand.</p>
            <p>That the evil deſigns of men, their wicked counſels, aims and ends, are all
ordered by providence, and turned to their own ruine.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That God in his ſecret counſel hath ſet a time when he will
give in mercies to a Nation, and when he will inflict judgements, and hath
alſo appointed the means, and upon whom it ſhall be, what it ſhall be, and
how much it ſhall be, and that thoſe times altogether unknown to men</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Although God have ſet the time for the one and for the other,
which ſhall certainly be accompliſhed in its time, according to Gods good
pleaſure, yet men are to be diligent in the uſe of all lawful means for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of the one, and for the avoiding of the other.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That when God hath effected and done his will in any thing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
made known to us by the work of his providence; We are not to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
nor repine though it be in any thing contrary to our expectation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
or though it be to our great affliction, but to ſubmit to it willingly, only
by praier to ſeek unto God, and patiently wait his time and means for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, That all mercies are from God, and are given in to a people
or nation, of Gods free love, not of any deſert, merit, or by any procurement
of men; This inference is very clear, and warranted by ſacred Scriptures,
whether ſpiritual mercies or temporal mercies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, All ſpiritual mercies are of Gods free love, we neither deſerve, nor
can by any means of our own procure the leaſt ſpirituall mercy; We are all
by <hi>Adams</hi> fall <hi>alienated from God, and are become his enemies</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Col. 1. 21. Rom. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </note>, We are born
heirs of wrath<note n="w" place="margin">Eph. 2. 3</note>, and there is nothing in us that can reconcile us to God, nor
any way appeaſe his wrath againſt us, therefore whatever the mercy be that we
enjoy it is of Gods free-love; Any puniſhment leſſe then hell fire is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
from God which we cannot deſerve: God indeed made <hi>man righteous and
upright, but men have ſought out many inventions</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Ecc. 7. 29.</note>; Men can pervert their own
waies, and make themſelves miſerable, but no way help themſelves out of
miſery; <hi>But God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c.
Joh. 3. 19. <hi>So loved,</hi> that is, he loved beyond what can be expreſſed, <hi>He gave
his only begotten Son,</hi> it was a free gift, free love, in the full dimenſions, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
and incomprehenſible, <hi>He ſent his Son made of a woman and made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law</hi> to redeem us, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons<note n="y" place="margin">Gal. 4. 4, 5.</note>, yea,
Chriſt gave himſelf to redeem us from our iniquity<note n="z" place="margin">Tit. 2. 14. Gal. 3. 13.</note>; We are not redeemed
by corruptible things, but <hi>with the precious bloud of Chriſt</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </note>, if all the Angels
in heaven ſhould give themſelves to die for the ſin of one man, it could not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119009:13"/>
redeem him; All Angels and Men joyned together cannot procure the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of one ſin, therefore all is of Gods free love; but that God ſhould
give his Son Jeſus Chriſt into the world to take our nature, our fleſh, and
for us to undergo reproach and ſhame, and ſorrow of ſoul, and at the laſt lay
down his life for us, that we by his death might have life; This is a love not
to be expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All temporal mercies are of Gods free-love, No man hath by
right nor deſert the leaſt claim to any good thing, but as it is the free-gift
of God, every mercy to a Nation, to a Family, or to a particular man is the
free-gift of God: It is Gods free love and mercy that the heavens are not
made Iron and the Earth braſſe, and that our fruitful Land is not turned
into a barren wilderneſſe, that the fruits of the earth are not parched away
by droughts, nor deſtroied by Inundations, nor an Enemy let in upon us to
devour and conſume all our labours; It is Gods free mercy to man to give
wine to chear the heart, and bread to ſtrengthen him: And that he giveth us
rain from heaven and fruitful ſeaſons, filling our hearts with food and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
a mercy that we of Gods free mercy enjoy at this day beyond imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
And it is free mercy that God doth not ſuddenly ſmite us for our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe
under ſuch enjoyments, and for the murmurings of men for
ſuch a bleſſing; It was Gods free-love to his Church to put into the heart of
<hi>Henry</hi> the 8. to caſt off the Popes Supremacy, let the cauſe or end be what
it will; It was from God the earneſt of future deliverance from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of ſpirituall <hi>Babylon:</hi> It was Gods free-love to preſerve Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
from the rage and bloudy plots of an Antichriſtian brood, that ſhe might
be inſtrumental to a Goſpel-Reformation, carried on by her with much pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
although not perfected: It was Gods free-love to this Nation to ſcatter
the <hi>Spaniſh Armado</hi> in 88. And to defeat the Papiſts bloudy deſign in their
helliſh plot of the Powder-Treaſon in 1604. And it was free mercy from
God to withhold the deſtroying plague of peſtilence from this City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
amidſt the many great diſtractions wherewith he had afflicted us; this
ſinfull City which deſerves nothing from God but wrath and judgements,
yet God hath long ſpared it, when the plague hath been ſore in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
and in divers places of this Nation; It was doubtleſſe free-mercy
from God that God gave us a Parliament in 1640. and the fault was in men
that it was not for happineſſe to poſterity: It was free mercy from God that
we were victorious over the power of a late Royall Army, and that we were
not given as a prey into their hands, and it was no leſſe free mercy to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that we had victory over he inſulting people of the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> as alſo
to order things by his wiſe providence, to compoſe things ſo as new to ſettle
a peace between the two Common-wealths, which I pray may be laſting to
Gods glory: <hi>It was the Lord that was on our ſide when men roſe up againſt us,
elſe they would have ſwallowed us up quick: The ſnare is broken and we are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly (whatſoever ſome men think) it was a great and free mercy
from God that our everlaſting Parliament was diſſolved, who had a price
put in their hand, but they neglected it though they ſate full twelve years:
Self-ſeeking, covetouſneſſe, and private intereſt blaſted the good fruit we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
at the firſt we made them demy-gods, but God hath ſhewed us they
were but men: They indeed took off an oppreſſor, but they gave life to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119009:13"/>
and brought a free people into hard bondage: The houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
was Gods Vineyard, and the men of <hi>Judah</hi> his pleaſant plants, Whence God
<hi>looked for judgement but behold oppreſſion, for righteouſneſſe but behold a cry</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Iſa. 5. 7.</note>;
Religion and policy were with many but one and the ſame thing, <hi>We faſted
for ſtrife and debate, and ſmote with the hand of wickedneſse,</hi> but did not looſe
the bands of wickedneſſe, <hi>to undoe the heavy burthens and let the oppreſsed go
free</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Iſa. 58. 4, 6</note>: Providence diſſolved that Parliament not yet that I know lamented
by any: And truly I conceive it was no leſſe mercy from God that the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Parliament was diſſolved too, Many members therein having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to deſtroy our Laws and Religion, to cut off the head of the two great
Ordinances of God, Magiſtracy and Miniſtery, at one blow, and ſo ſet open
a floud-gate for looſe licentious liberty to break in upon us to our confuſion,
where then ſhould we have found the true liberty and priviledge of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſo much talked of, while we were under the oppreſſion of an arbitrary
power? bleſſed be that providence that hath prevented thoſe deſigns, and freed
us from that yoke, giving us comfort in hopes of a ſetled peace and holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
with the reſtoring us again to our Laws and true priviledges,
By that Illuſtrions and Noble Champion <hi>OLIVER</hi> Lord Protector of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;e. whom Providence hath made inſtrumental to

            <p>Let no man miſtake me to think that I am an enemy to Parliaments, I am
not God knows it, but I am a lover and honourer of Parliaments, and ſhall

covetouſneſſe, ſelf-ſeeking, oppreſſion, ſchiſms, diviſions, factions and
private intereſt, theſe God hates, and I cannot nor will love what God abhors
though I be hated for it: I do with much thankfulneſſe acknowledge it as a
free mercy from God that we have this preſent Parliament, My Praier is,
that God will make them bleſſings to laſting poſterities; And ſurely it is
free-love and mercy from God in ſetting up that authority and ſingle perſon
which hath called this Parliament; And as great a mercy that Providence
diſcovered that Plot and murtherous deſign hatched in <hi>France</hi> and to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
upon his Perſon in <hi>England:</hi> The ſame mercy and free-love was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to this Nation for his Highneſſe late eſcape from the danger of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
attempt in a recreation not becoming his dignity, I pray it may
be a monition to him not again to go out of his place and rank: Providence
having called him to the care of the greateſt affairs con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erning the Church of
God in general, and the welfare of the people of theſe three Nations, A
heavy burthen! and requires the whole ſtrength of body and minde; And
above all theſe mercies we muſt not forget to acknowledge it a mercy from
God that we at this day do enjoy the Ordinances of God, notwithſtanding
the mighty oppoſitions both on the left hand and on the right hand, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
on one ſide and imprudent zeal on the other, we have the word of
Truth held out to us, and may enjoy every Ordinance in its purity if we
will, or if we were not wanton; for men may be as holy as they will or can
be, there is no reſtraint in that, nor perſecution for it: I wiſh we did not too
much counive at groſſe apparent hereſie and blaſphemy, For though the truth
ſhould be free hereſie ſhould have a bar, God blames the Church of <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
and the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> for ſuffering them them that held the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

diſhonour to the Truth.</p>
            <p>We come to the ſecond Inference, and that is, That all Judgements and
Afflictions are from God only, and are the juſt recompence for ſinne, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by our ſelves, men or things afflicting, being but ſecondary cauſes, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Gods hand: This is very fully proved in the whole Book of God,
That all Iudgements and Afflictions are from God; is ſufficiently proved in
our foregoing diſcourſe; And that they are the juſt recompence of ſinne is as
clear, for God never puniſhed but for ſin, and if there had been no ſin there
ſhould never have been any puniſhments, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth ſhall die</hi>

are encreaſed, which we alſo covenanted to extirpate; We covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to preſerve Priviledges of Parliament and liberty of the people, but where
are they? if loſt, who loſt them? the power of the Enemy could not take
them from us; but loſt they are, or in great meaſure loſt: I will not diſpute
whether a Parliament or an Army loſt them, or took them from us, for it was
neither; It was ſelf-ſeeking that loſt all, Now hopeful by providence to be
again reſtored by his Highneſſe, ſtirred up by Providence (I hope with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)
to be <hi>Englands</hi> deliverer: As to that part of the Covenant that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the late King, And that which concerned the Union of the three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
I conceive them to be leſſe ſubſtantiall and more conditional; condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and circumſtances not well obſerved, makes the forfeiture on that ſide;
Providence I truſt will put us into a better Union then we intended or could
then think of, <hi>God worketh all things after the counſell of his own will;</hi> I charge
no particular perſon, nor blame any more then my ſelf, I know my own heart
is deceitful to my ſelf, I cannot ſay ſo much of any other mans.</p>
            <p>All my aim and deſire is, as to my ſelf ſo to all others, to ſtir them up to
conſiderate remembrance, that we are yet under ſuch a Covenant, and that
I and every one may examine whether we have done our duty or not, and
what we finde to be wanting in us let us in the ſtrength of the Almighty
endeavour to make up by humbling our ſouls before God whom we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
For the Covenant was lawfull or it was unlawfull; if lawfull, we
have provoked the high God by our ſleighting of it; if unlawfull, we have
diſhonoured God in ſwearing before him to that which he would not own;
ſo there is great cauſe and good ground why we ſhould be deeply humbled in
the preſence of God: Every particular perſon covenanted to reform himſelf,
and to endeavour Reformation in others, and each one to endeavour to go
before another in example of real Reformation: if we have done what we
were able in this particular, we have done well: if not, ſinne lieth at our door,
and judgement will ſurely enter into our houſes; for as God is true and juſt,
he will <hi>avenge the quarrell of his Covenant</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Lev. 26. 25.</note>; Let no man great or ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to himſelf ſafety, nor think it is fogotten by God, though it be caſt off

with whom they might not make Covenants, but had commiſſion to

their aims and ends are all ordered by providence, and turned contrary

by Scripture and by common and daily experience. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith the

to make them uſeleſſe and himſelf a great Monarch, preparing for a greater
work which his Son was to act; which deſign our late King endeavoured to
exalt, and in purſuance thereof followed the footſteps of his Father (not in
perſonal ſins, but) in publike grievances: Like <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to make one of his
fingers heavier then his Fathers loins; And like <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to ſet up Calves

they endeavoured to weaken the Nations of able religious men, and of Arms,

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the advance of prerogative, new waies were invented to get money
without Parliaments or Law; Loan-money, Knighthood-money, Ship-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
Compoſitions for Cottages, Compoſitions for New Buildings, Moneys
for Forreſt Lands, Woods, Timber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Monopolies upon all our neceſſary

to effect the Tyrannical deſign, the Duke and his plotrers had provided to
have 600 Flanders Horſe brought into <hi>England,</hi> with <hi>Swiſser</hi> Riders; No
man is ſo ſilly I think as to ask why all this was done, for the reaſon is plain
to every reaſonable man.</p>
            <p>Nor was this all, for all zealous and godly Miniſters were weeded out of

and they were made Biſhops that defended it; Lectures were put down,
Afternoon Sermons on the Lords Day were forbidden, Books were publiſhed
to give way to prophane the Lords Day by ſports and paſtimes; theſe Books
were commanded to be read in all Churches to ingratiate the multitude, and
ſuch Miniſters as refuſed to reade theſe Books were ſuſpended, the morality
of the Sabbath was denied, preached againſt, Sunday called no Sabbath, the
name Miniſter was changed to Prieſt, the Table to an Altar, on which Baſons
and Tapers were ſet, there was very little wanting to plain Popery but the
name; Thus far the deſign was carried on ſmoothly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scotland</hi> only ſtood in the way as ſome rub that muſt be removed, and to
that end a Liturgy was ſent down to them which they would not ſwallow;
Therefore they muſt be forced, an Army to that purpoſe was prepared; The
Scots make oppoſition, money grew wanting to manage that deſign to leavy
more forces; A Parliament was called to raiſe money, which refuſing to give
were quickly diſſolved: The Scots grew enraged, had encouragements, make
invaſion, which cauſed another Parliament to be called, That Parliament
would give no money except they might be eſtabliſhed to ſit till they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
abuſes and things; They were eſtabliſhed by an Act to ſit until
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119009:16"/>
both Houſes conſented to diſſolve, and alſo two Acts of grace was paſſed,
<hi>viz.</hi> to take away the High-Commiſſion and Star-Chamber; All this to
pleaſe the people that they might aſſiſt in their further deſign of war, as ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after appeared, wherein providence ordered their deſigns, counſels, aims,
and ends to Gods glory and to their own ruine.</p>
            <p>Here take ſpeciall notice of ſix ſeverall peeces of providence; 1. That the
great preſſures, innovations, and the deſigns apparent of bringing on greater
oppreſſion even to a perpetual ſlavery, cauſed great fears in the people, which
could not be ſecured but by an eſtabliſhed Parliament. 2. That providence
infatuated the late King and his counſell in paſſing an Act of unlimited time
for eſtabliſhment of that Parliament, which was the giving away of one chief
part of prerogative, by which he might elſe have diſſolved that Parliament
after ſome years, and ſaved his head; <hi>Eſau</hi> ſold his birthright but he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have the bleſſing, Providence had infatuated him that he conſidered
not that the bleſſing was annexed to the birthright: Our late King ſold that
part of his exerciſed prerogative, with deſign to get it double, not only to
be King ſtill but Tyrant too, How Providence hath ordered thoſe deſigns we
know. Thirdly, That after the ſigning of the Act aforeſaid the Soveraign
Authority was in the Parliament, which the late King by a wicked Councel
and lying Clergy was ſeduced to take Arms againſt, as <hi>Ahab</hi> was by his
Councell and 400. lying Prophets, to go up to <hi>Ramoth-Gilead</hi> to his own
ruine, and the ruine of his Family. Fourthly, That his heart was hardened
and the hearts of his Councel, and would not hearken to any offer of peace
or reconciliation, though many addreſſes were made to him from time to
time by the whole houſe unanimouſly, but his heart like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> was hard,
and <hi>the time of his peace was hid from him,</hi> until it was too late, when he deſired
it and might not have it. Fifthly, That Providence ſhould make uſe of the
Earl of <hi>Eſsex</hi> to be the Inſtrument to drive the late Kings wife from him,
whoſe Wife the late Kings Father gave to another man. Sixthly, That the
late King by his refuſal of all offers of reconciliation, and his delaies, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
providence over-ordering all things againſt his deſigns, became his
irrecoverable ruine; of whom we may ſay as Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> ſaith of
<hi>Darius,</hi> He was infatuated in all his Counſels and undertakings againſt
<hi>Alexander,</hi> ever following the worſt counſell, and uſing the unſafeſt means
to preſerve himſelf, which ſheweth plainly that God had purpoſed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
and the loſſe of his Kingdoms; And that the diſappointing him
and his Counſell in all their Deſigns, and overthrowing their bloudy and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
Armies was the immediate work of providence for the accompliſhing of
the ſecret purpoſe of God; If we continue not to imitate and act the ſame
ſins of oppreſſion and innovation, or the like, as <hi>Jehu</hi> did: If ſo we do, <hi>Iehu</hi>'s
reward will be given, for our God is an unchangeable God; What he hath
done to others before us, he will as ſurely do ſtill, and for ever where the like
ſins are acted; God ſometimes gives <hi>a King in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>is anger, and takes him away in
his wrath,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 11. They, whether King, Parliament, or people, <hi>that reject
the Word of the Lord, the Lord will reject them,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 23. Thus God did
by <hi>Saul,</hi> and thus he did by <hi>Rehoboam;</hi> for in that the ten Tribes revolted,
God himſelf teſtifieth and ſaith, <hi>This thing is done by me,</hi> 1 Kin. 12. 24. <hi>Who is
he</hi> (ſaith the Prephet in the name of the Church) <hi>that ſaith it cometh to paſſe
when God commandeth it not,</hi> Lam. 3. 37.</p>

Many other obſervable providences have offered the due conſideration of them
to us; which I may not paſſe by with ſilence among many that have attended
our late Parliaments both in their ſitting and in their diſſolution; I ſhall minde
you of theſe few, the firſt ſhall be this, That when things were not likely to
ſucceed according to the Parliaments deſign, or a great part in Parliament,
They deviſed to publiſh an Ordinance called the Self-denying Ordinance,
thereby calling all the members of both Houſes from all offices and military
affairs, here was a ſpecious pretence, but by them that made it it was not
intended to be obſerved; for who left any place of profit to ſerve the publike?
It is true, ſo far as the preſent deſign reached it took and made a great and a
good change in the Army, but providence ordered that Ordinance and that
change, pulling down and ſetting up, to fruſtrate the future deſign of them
that made it: Providence by that Ordinance took off the Right Honourable
his Excellency the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> from being General, when he had gone with
courage and fidelity as far in that work as his principles could carry him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
made him inſtrumental to lay the foundation of that work, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
alſo by that Ordinance and that change Ordered, That the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and Noble Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> ſhould be ſet up in his room, to raiſe
the ſtructure of that work and building upon the fonndation <hi>Eſſex</hi> had laid,
as fitter to effect Gods further purpoſe, who built as far as his principle could
carry him, when providence had uſed <hi>Eſſex</hi> as far as God had purpoſe to uſe
him in that work: Providence alſo in Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> his time put a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
ſpirit amidſt the Members of Parliament, ſo as the conteſt was very
great, grew into factions and intereſts, ſome deſigning the life of him whom
others deſigned to die, ſo as the power of the Sword was called to end the
controverſie, and all to the accompliſhment of Gods will, his Excellency the
Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> having a farre larger Commiſſion then ever the Parliament
gave before, having in his hand power, the uſe of the whole Militia, Caſtles,
Forts, Towns, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Providence ordered upon ſome ſcruple in his Excellency
that he voluntarily and reſolvedly laid down his Commiſſion, when earneſtly
ſollicited both by Parliament and by the then L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eutenant General <hi>Cromwell</hi>
to hold it up; And providence ſtill ordering things to effect the purpoſe of
God, Ordered that the then Lieutenant Generall ſhould have the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
or larger, without limit, to be Captain Generall of all Forces by
Sea and Land, Caſtles, Forts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conſequently of all the whole Militia;
This was providence, That he might lay on the topſtone of the ſtructure and
finiſh the work ſo farre: And as Providence had ſtirred him up as a valiant
Champion, ſo next as a faithful Patriot to his Countrey to diſſolve a ſit ſtill
Parliament, to whom God had given all opportunities to do their Nation
good, but they would not, nor could give themſelves to conſider what was
their duty to act for their private Intereſts, ſome levelling the Earth for their
own deſign, others building of Caſtles in the Air for a <hi>Fifth Monarchy,</hi> an
unſafe practice and very unſound doctrine, unwarrantable to be maintained
in bloud, If theſe be not clear providences what ſhall we call Providence?
Theſe things we have ſeen gradually acted and ordered by a ſecret and wiſe
providence, turning the deſign of the Parliament in their Self-denying Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and the Powers and Commiſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns thereupon granted, to their diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which they aimed ſhould have been the means to have perpetuated their
ſitting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:119009:17"/>
Theſe things premiſed, I ſhall modeſty offer ſix Queries to any impartiall
man upright and unbyaſt in this caſe. Firſt, Whether it was not of providence
that the Parliament gave to his Excellency the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> that unlimited
power for the ſafety of the Nation, as it was of providence that the Late
King and his Councel paſt an Act of unlimited time for the Parliament to
ſit, to his own ruine and caſting off his poſterity? 1. Whether his Excellency
were not bound in conſcience for publike ſafety, being a publike perſon in
truſt, to make uſe of the one, as well as the Parliament made uſe of the other;
and by that authority to diſſolve an undoing Parliament, as well as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
a deſtroying Enemy, both conducing to publike ſafety? Thirdly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the diſſolving of that Parliament were any greater breach of priviledge
then the taking out of one half of the members by force, of which he had
before of late a Preſident in the time of the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and well approved
of by the diſſolved Parliament. Fourthly, whether as Providence ſerved our
neceſſity by the late Kings Act for the Parliaments ſitting for a long
time, It did not (after ſeverall admonitions) as much ſerve our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
after their too long fitting, to diſſolve that Parliament by the power
of their own Commiſſion? Fifthly, whether it were not evidently a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
That the ſucceeding Parliament (not appointed by his Excellency,
but) choſen by the Souldiery, Many of them promoting (except in giving
away the publike treaſure) the like deſtructive waies, to the taking away
our Fundamental Laws, and bringing in (as it were) another Goſpel, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down and overthrowing all, but ſet up nothing except a floudgate to
confuſion, ſhould of themſelves, that is, the <hi>major</hi> part, to prevent thoſe
(almoſt executed) deſigns, diſſolve that Parliament, and reſign their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
into his Excellencies hand? Sixthly, whether providence did not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
order things in that time of diſtraction, diſcontent, and diviſion
among the people at home, and a bloudy warre abroad: That his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
calling of a Councel, ſeeking God by praier and faſting, All his Councel
and all other perſons of quality whom it concerned to be acquainted with the
thing, ſhould moſt harmoniouſly agree, and reſolve to meet one way as to the
government of the three Nations; And with one conſent publikely to entitle
him (then his Excellency) to be Lord Protector of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and of all the dominions and territories thereunto belonging? Let me
ſay again with the Prophet, <hi>Who is he that ſaith it cometh to paſſe when the Lord
commandeth it not?</hi> Lam. 3. 37. Theſe things ſufficiently prove the Inference,
That the evil deſigns of men are ordered by Providence to their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
            <p>The next and fourth Inference is, That God in his ſecret counſell hath
ſet a time when he will give in mercies to a Nation, and when he will inflict
judgements, and hath alſo appointed the means; And upon whom it ſhall
be, what it ſhall be, and how much it ſhall be; And theſe times are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unknown unto men.</p>
            <p>That this is a truth, that God hath appointed a ſet time for mercies and
for judgements, the holy Ghoſt witneſſeth, <hi>Eccl. 3. 1. To every thing there is a
ſeaſon, and a time to every purpoſe under heaven:</hi> If there be a time to every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
then nothing is contingent, if to every purpoſe then it muſt needs be
appointed by God, none but God knows all times and purpoſes, therefore
none but God can appoint times and ſeaſons; This is one part of Gods So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119009:17"/>
as he is Governour of the world; Men ſometimes may appoint
times and never intend to keep them, and they may ſometimes appoint times
to ſome purpoſe which they are not able to perform, or ſometimes they may
appoint times, and their minde changeth, they are altered from what they
intended; But God is juſt and intendeth to do all that he ſaies and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points;
And he is infinite, can do whatſoever he will, nothing can diſable
him; And he is unchangeable, <hi>In him is no ſhadow of change,</hi> whatever he
hath appointed ſhall ſurely be done in its time: <hi>Is there not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) au

to give unto <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed the whole Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and he ſet the time

            <p>So for Judgements, God hath appointed and ſet the time when he will inflict
them, whether on Nations, Families or perſons: God himſelf witneſſeth this

though he was a Prophet of God, God had not revealed to him that it was
expired, nor could he aſcertain the time; Neither could <hi>Nehemiah</hi> nor <hi>Ezra</hi>
till the very time was come; Nor could they ſay or imagine by what means
their deliverance ſhould come: but God who only is wiſe and faithfull in all
his promiſes, keeps his time, and by providence ordereth the means to effect
the thing promiſed, ſo it was in bringing back his people from theit captivity,
which what done when they looked not for it, before they were aware; Hence
it was that the Church in celebrating her praiſe for that deliverance, ſaith,
<hi>When the Lord returned again the Captivity of Zion, we were like them in a dream</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Pſ. 126. 1</note>,
the ſuddenneſſe of their deliverance was amazement to them, as if they had

yet until the very time came none could tell or ſay that was the time; So the

God hath ſet the time for the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and he hath ſet the time

               <note n="n" place="margin">Da. 12. 3</note>, that is, ſhut or ſeal this
Prophecy, for it is obſcure, and long to the end, before it ſhall be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
It is the ſaying of <hi>Irenius,</hi> That every Prophecy before it be accompliſht
is as a riddle, but being once accompliſhed it is plainly underſtood; And
though by faith we look upon all Prophecies to come as that which is truth,
and that there is a certainty in them as if we now ſaw them fulfilled, yet at the
time of their accompliſhment they ſhall be much more glorious, and it is true
that as Knowledge encreaſeth, ſo men will be more ſtudious in them, and in
obſerving the ſeveral providences of God working and ordering ſecondary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as the means to accompliſh them in the time appointed, but it cannot be
known unto us as is proved.</p>
            <p>Then ſurely it muſt needs be unwarrantable boldneſſe in any to take upon
them to tell what God will do, and when he will do it, and will preſcribe the
means how it ſhall be done, as many do in theſe daies, who ſpare not to affirm,
that Chriſt ſhall come to reign on the earth a thouſand years, and the time
when he ſhall come, and by what means that fifth Monarch ſhall be ſet up,
and what Governours and Government ſhall be in the world till then, they

will tell us when the Jews ſhall be converted, and how; When <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall
fall, and by whom, and what means; But theſe things are ſecrets of Gods

and till the time of the accompliſhment no man can know the certainty
of them; To tell us of Revelations, Viſions, Dreams, and new Lights, is
nothing, but even as much as if they ſhould ſay they dreamed, they were in a

which conſpire againſt a burning coal, and encompaſſe it by heaps to put it
out, that when they think they have done it, and have eclipſed the light for
a little while, it ſhall kindle, burn, and conſume them all, theſe ſtraws though
mighty for a time ſhall come to nothing; This is their time of attempts, and
this is the time that God will purge his Church, This is the time of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and of great judgements; For whenever God hath been doing any
great work tending to Reformation, the devil and Satan, that great old Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and ſubtle Serpent hath alwaies made the greateſt oppoſition, the greater
the work is that God is doing the ſtronger the oppoſitions will be, as we ſee
in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3, 4. conſidered and compared: That God is doing a great
work in theſe daies is manifeſt, clear as the light of the Sun, But what God
will do he only know, To us it is unknown, whether he will at this time give
in to <hi>England</hi> the mercies promiſed, or whether he will yet afflict us with more
and greater Judgements we know not: The former ſhall be made good aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly

of all the alterations and changes in our times, is hid from our eyes, only it is
Gods good pleaſure, and he is doing a great work.</p>
            <p>There are three things, evils, that have long threatned the great judgements
and changes which we of <hi>England</hi> have lately felt and ſeen in this Nation.</p>
            <p>1. The encreaſe and growth of all kinde of ſin, eſpecially corruption in
Religion<note n="x" place="margin">Iudg. 5. 8</note>, and a general crying oppreſſion, theſe do ſtill remain as high as
ever.<note place="margin">y Zep. 3. 1. Eze. 25. 7. Jer. 5. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. The appearance and encreaſe of ſecondary cauſes thereunto conducing,
principally Jealouſies, Diviſions, Emulations, Hypocriſie, Sedition and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery<note n="z" place="margin">Judg 9. 23.</note>:
Theſe things are effects of Gods anger<note n="a" place="margin">Iſ. 19. 14</note>, and forerunners of great
changes, but theſe do encreaſe in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The ſtraits and neceſſities of the Church, when good men eſpecially
holy, godly Miniſters are ſcorned, contemned, and miſuſed<note n="b" place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 16.</note>, then God is
exceeding angry, and brings wrath without remedy; For the Churches ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
is Gods opportunity to deliver his Church and to avenge himſelf of
their enemies, and that is alwaies by great changes: God hath made change
after change in <hi>England,</hi> once, twice, thrice, and again, but the evils are not
changed, therefore more changes are threatned: The Prophet denonncing

overturn it, and it ſhall be no more until he come, whoſe right it is and I will give
it him</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ezek. 21. 25, 26, 27.</note>; This Prophecy was concerning <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and <hi>Iſraels</hi> carrying captive

will abaſe him that is higheſt, and exalt him that is low, and will overturn,
and overturn again and again <hi>until he come,</hi> for his right it is to whom Jeſus
Chriſt ſhall give it.</p>
            <p>So it is evident that all turnings, overturnings and changes that have been
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119009:20"/>
in this Nation, or whatſoever ſhall be are not by accident, nor by the ſubtle
contrivement of counſel or men, but as all is ordered by Providence to effect
Gods will, for man is not able of himſelf to bring any enterpriſe to paſſe, he
is not able (ſaith Doctor <hi>Preſton</hi>) to ſee all the wheels that tend to make up
an enterpriſe, nor if he were able to ſee them all, he is not able to turn them,
nor to fit every one ſo together as to make up an enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>God by providence after ſeveral changes and ſeveral attempts of new enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes,
which the attempters (though skilful to deceive and powerful to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell)
could not enterpriſe, hath given us a Supream Magiſtrate to judge the
people of theſe Nations; And by providence hath intitled him <hi>OLIVER</hi>
Lord Protector of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of the Dominions
thereunto belonging; This is the man whom God by his ſecret providence
hath made the inſtrument of our deliverance, from the deſigns of an Anti-chriſtian
brood, and from the powers of Royall and Hierarchical enemies,
and reſcued our Laws and Religion out of uſurpers hands, therein compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

might have ſate in Parliament at eaſe, and with profit as others did, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence

that I can remember was he put to the worſt, or cauſed to fly from, or turn

He is of an ancient Family, He hath been well educated in Learning and in

and made ſucceſſeful in all his undertakings, and providence hath
kept in all dangers, ordering all along by gradations to what he now is, as is
obſerved in our third Inference: Why God hath done all this we cannot give
any reaſon, but that it is his ſecret will to effect his own purpoſe; But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it ſhall be at this time as an income of mercies, or encreaſe of afflictions,
I leave to the all-knowing God who will manifeſt his pleaſure in his own
time; It may be a mercy from God and ſo I eſteem of it, but we may by our

Sure I am (whatever may be) that ſince providence laid this burthen

uſe unlawful means for the obtaining of lawful things, or to ſeek unlawfull

from their open pollutions and vicious practices, and Schools of Learning to
be purged of vitious Schoolmaſters, the poyſon of youth and the bane of age
and ages, is a work acceptable to God, a means to obtain bleſſings to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
and it will coſt no money to do it.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the like means diligently uſed, really proſecuted, freed from ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſt,
vain-glory, or hypocriſie, will aſſuredly multiply mercies on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and prevent the judgements threatned, and cauſe <hi>England</hi> to be the
praiſe of the whole earth: I pray give me leave to ſay what the Lord by the
Prophet ſaid in another caſe (concerning Tythes then due by a Law of
God, leviticall, only belonging to the Jews; now due by no ſuch right, but
they were unjuſtly withheld) Therefore ſaith the Lord, <hi>Prove me now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
if I will not open to you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a bleſſing</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Mal. 3. 10</note> &amp;c.
So I ſay, Uſe ſuch means as before I have briefly mentioned, and prove the
Lord if he will not double and redouble all ſorts of bleſſings on this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
            <p>I bleſſe God that there hath been a beginning of a Reformation of ſome
things by his Highneſſe more then in ſome years paſt by others, though much
was promiſed; And I bleſſe God that put into his Highneſſes heart and this
preſent Parliament to call for a general and publike day of Humiliation, for
emergent cauſes named, which God will doubtleſſe accept of, as of late he
did by a ſignet of his favour, when we by his Highneſſe order ſought God for
Rain in our great neceſſity; Although ſome who ſtile themſelves Saints not
only refuſed to joyn in our Petitions, but uſed unchriſtian ſpeeches to Gods
diſhonour and contempt of the duty: And truly it was ſad to obſerve the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
neglect of our late Solemn Faſt, that only Shops ſhould be ſhut, and
places for recreation full (as I was informed) but Churches ſhut or empty,
in reſpect of the numbers of Inhabitants, many omitting the duty out of
carnal reſpects, and many out of will, becauſe it was commanded, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the end croſſed their ſelf-intereſts; I do affirm that it is no leſſe a duty
in the Chriſtian Magiſtrate to command the duties and performance of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for the true worſhip of God, then it was duty to the Magiſtrate under the
Law, but the Magiſtrate under the Law did command ſuch duties, as <hi>Aſa,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119009:25"/>
Jehoſaphat, Jehojada, Hezckiah,</hi> and others: We know that <hi>Aſa</hi> did not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Reformation of Gods worſhip, bur annexed to his command a great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<note n="i" place="margin">2 Chron. 15. 13.</note>; And <hi>Ezra</hi> did the like<note n="k" place="margin">Ezr. 7. 26</note>; And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> diminiſheth nothing
of the Magiſtrates Authority under the Goſpel, nor is there any Scripture
that offers the leaſt doubt of that their authority, but rather makes it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 28. therefore I ſay that the neglect or rather contempt of ſuch
duties, and the ſuffering of it uncontrolled by the Magiſtrate, will in ſtead
of a bleſſing bring a curſe, as is threatned by the Prophet, <hi>Jer</hi> 48. 10. but
the due obſervance of the holy and ſpiritual worſhip of God held forth by
the Magiſtrate, and practiſed by the Miniſter and People, is the chief
means to divert the judgements we fear and procure the bleſſings we want.</p>
            <p>I come now to the ſixth and laſt Inference, and that is, That when God
hath effected and done his will in any thing viſibly made known to us by the
work of providenee, we are not to murmure nor repine, though it be in any
thing contrary to our expectation or deſire, or though it be to our great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
but to ſubmit to it willingly, only by praier to ſeek unto God, and
patiently wait his time and means for deliverance.</p>
            <p>This hath been the practice of the godly in all ages;<note n="k" place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 22, 23.</note> Thus holy <hi>David</hi>
did, while his childe was yet alive he uſed all lawful means for the life of
it: But when God had done his will, and the childe was dead, he left off
to mourn, and murmured not, but patiently bear the affliction; Thus did
juſt and righteous <hi>Job,</hi> he feared his Sons might ſinne, and procure Gods
diſpleaſure, he therefore uſed the right means to prevent it<note n="m" place="margin">Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 3. 25 Job 1. 5.</note>, but when Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
had brought that to paſſe which he feared, and God had viſibly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
his pleaſure, <hi>Job</hi> was patient, he murmured not, neither againſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
nor inſtruments, but bleſſed the Name of the Lord<note n="n" place="margin">Iob 1. 11, 22.</note>: The Church
under her great affliction murmured not, they acknowledged Gods hand, and
complained of their ſins the cauſe of all<note n="o" place="margin">Lam. 3. 37, 29.</note>, and waited patiently for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance:
<hi>It is good</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>that a man ſhould both hope and quietly
wait for the ſalvation of the Lord</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Lam. 3. 26.</note>; Surely (ſaith <hi>Job) it is meet to be ſaid unto
God, I have born chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Iob 6. 12</note>; And the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts,
that we <hi>be followers of them that by faith and patience inherit the promiſe</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 6. 12</note>:
But to murmure againſt providence is wickedneſſe, and the effects of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
and diſcontents is very dangerous; Dangerous to a mans ſelf, and
bringeth others into dangers too: You know what became of the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilderneſſe, from time to time, as is recorded in the Books
of <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Numbers;</hi> Conſider the caſe of murmuring <hi>Korah</hi> and all his
murmuring company, the earth opened and ſwallowed them up<note n="ſ" place="margin">Num. 16. 32, 33.</note>; This was
the immediate hand of God, not <hi>Moſes</hi> nor <hi>Aaron,</hi> yet ſuch was the rebellious
hearts of the people, that the next day they all fall to murmuring againſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and againſt <hi>Aaron,</hi> and accuſed them that they had <hi>killed tho Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Num. 16. 41.</note>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And for this there died preſently of them, fourteen thouſand and ſeven
hundred by a ſudden plague<note n="u" place="margin">Ver. 49.</note>; You know that for this ſin of murmuring all
the people that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> from twenty years old and upward, were
excluded from the promiſe, except <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua</hi>
               <note n="w" place="margin">Numb. 14. 29.</note>: Hence the Apoſtle
exhorts us Chriſtians, not to tempt God as they tempted him, nor to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
as they murmured and were deſtroied; for ſaith he, <hi>All theſe things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
unto them for our examples</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 10, 11.</note>; God is the ſame to us that he was to them,
only he hath divers diſpenſations of his judgements; he is an unchangeable

God for evert If we ſin like them that went before us, we ſhall be as greatly
puniſhed as they were, yea, greater; Though God do not ſo uſually ſtrike
men ſuddenly for ſin as formerly, yet there is greater wrath to come.</p>
            <p>Let us a little conſider the cauſe of mens murmuring, and ſee if it do not
ariſe from a carnal heart, a carnal man propounds ends to himſelf, as the
Merchants S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaks of, that ſay they will go to ſuch a City, or ſuch a
Countrey, and buy, and ſell, and get gain, but ſay not, if God will: ſo it is
with men that ſeek their own ends in any thing, they propound this or that,
but God is not in their thoughts, they ſay no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, if God will; but we will do this

common with theſe men, that they will have the Name of God in their
mouths, but (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks) <hi>God is not in all their thoughts;</hi> And
therefore when their wils and deſigns are croſſed, they are angry, and repine
againſt God and men; Thus the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did in the wilderneſſe, they
met with croſſe providences which they looked not for, and they could not
bear it, but cry out againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>becauſe there were no graves in Egypt;

            <p>Thus at this day we have ſeen many ſtrange Providences ſuch as we looked
not for, and men have had many and diverſe deſigns, aims and ends, but meet
with croſſe Providences, which they cannot bear, nay, reſolve they will not
bear, they complain and cry out againſt this and that thing, but ſpecially
they murmure againſt God and own not his providence in governing the
world; Therefore they alſo murmure at the thing done, and againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
doing it, this is I ſay againſt God himſelf, for he alone orders every
thing and every Action, as is proved in the beginning of this ourdiſcourſe,
which may ſatisfie humble men; But ſaith the wiſeſt of men, <hi>The fooliſh man
perverteth his way,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pr. 19. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and his heart fretteth againſt the Lord:</hi> This is a carnal heart,
for a ſpiritual man ſees God in all and bears all things with patience, and
waits by praier for guidance by providence, but never praies againſt a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
providence, except to be delivered from the evil that may in ſome caſes
be feared, for providences lead the people of God into ſtraights and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for ſin, as well as it delivereth them from afflictions when they are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and this the Church was well acquainted with; therefore ſay, <hi>It is good
that a man ſhould both hope and quietly wait for the ſalvation of the Lord</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">La. 3. 16</note>, then
by the rule of contrary it muſt needs be evil to repine and murmure.</p>
            <p>It is very obſervable that <hi>Moſes</hi> mentioneth a mixed multitude that came
with <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exo. 12. 38. theſe were of other Nations, probably
Servants, that kept their cattle, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> And they ſeeing the mighty wonders that
God did for his people in <hi>Egypt</hi> joyned with them, and would go out with
them; As the multitude that followed Chriſt for the loaves<note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 9. 26.</note>, but being
croſſed in their expectation they grow diſcontent and murmure, luſting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fleſhpots of <hi>Egypt</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Nu. 11. 4</note>, and bred a generall diſcontent among the people,
ſuch a mixed multitude was among the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from their ſeventy years captivity, <hi>which good Nebemiah ſeparated from
Iſrael</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Neh. 13. 3</note>.</p>
            <p>Such a mixed multitude are at this day in <hi>England,</hi> ſome of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſome of contrary Religions, Prieſts and Jeſuites, and others that have
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119009:26"/>
by all ſubtle waies inſinuated themſelves, and theſe have ſet the people into
diſcontents and murmurings, and are enemies to the advance of the Goſpel,
and to the building of the ſpirituall Temple, no leſſe then thoſe adverſaries
of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> that would have inſinuated themſelves under pretence
of helping to build the Temple, ſaying, they ſought the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, and did ſacrifice to him<note n="f" place="margin">Ezr. 4. 2.</note>, when indeed they were enemies, and
endeavour to hinder their work; but <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and the chief of the Fathers
caſt them off, then they ſend to have conference with <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to betray
him, but he would not own their meſſage<note n="g" place="margin">Neh. 6. 2, 4.</note>, and the work in his hand proſpered.
But our Fathers of <hi>England</hi> have hearkened to theſe our mixt multitude, and
Gods work hath been hindred, and themſelves loſt their honour; The mixed
multitude among us are grown numerous and incorrigible, they do not only
murmure but they (ſome of them) threaten, and reſolve not to be ſatisfied,
for if one ſort have what he deſires another will diſlike it, and that which is
accepted this year ſhall be cried down next year (nay ſometimes next day)
for they that ſeek they know not what, cannot tell when to be pleaſed at every
thing that is done: ſome cry out againſt it, and againſt the Inſtruments do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, without regard to Providence or publike intereſt, and theſe cauſe
murmurings among the people who would not murmure but for them; Theſe
are thoſe that have taſted of the heavenly <hi>mauna,</hi> but grew wanton, luſting
after other food, many of theſe came into our hoſts becauſe they ſaw the great
thing the Lord did for us, but they came not in with the firſt, nor did they
bear the brunt of the day, and being enticed by their own luſts they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
and grow impatient at every providence that croſſeth their deſires: They
murmured againſt our firſt Parliament called <hi>Anno Dom:</hi> 1640. and rejoyced
when it was diſſolved, endeavouring to carry on their deſigns by the next
Parliament, but providence croſſed them, and they were diſſolved too: And
Providence hath ordered all actions, counſels and things, to ſet up another
way of government, which for private intereſt was cried down: Now <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
by the Providence of God is ſet up and made Lord Protector of <hi>England,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. the great and general murmuring is againſt him,
He is a man of honour and integrity, the inſtrument in Gods hand to do
great and mighty things for us, And as I have ſaid before he is the man of
the Saints prayers, and by their praiers God hath made him proſperous and
ſucceſſeful in all his undertakings, we (yea many of the chief murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers)
have acknowledged it, and owned him as our <hi>Ioſhua:</hi> What hath
he done to the prejudice of the people or Nation, that we now mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
againſt him? why, he hath by Gods providence fruſtrate the deſigns
and aims of the mixed multitude, therefore they all murmure; The Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
and prelatical parties and all the Hierarchy are angry and ſeek his
life, the Levelling party and the men of the <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi> they are angry,
and combine together by plotting againſt him, and as the Prophet ſaith of
himſelf ſo I may ſay of his Highneſſe, <hi>They watch for his halting, ſaying, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
he will be enticed, and we ſhall prevail againſt him, and take our revenge
upon him</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Jer. 20. 10.</note>: Beſides theſe there is another ſort of this mixed multitude that
murmure, and they are pecuniaries, either oppreſſors or mercenaries: Becauſe
it is conceived his Highneſſe will look after the publike treaſuries, and manage
the publike treaſure to publike advantage; Theſe were afraid of a day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in this life that were not afraid of a judgement day in the life to come,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119009:27"/>
therefore they are angry; There is another ſort that are ambitious to have the
honour and command that Providence hath caſt upon his Highneſſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are angry, for ambitious men cannot endure any ſuperiour; Good
men without holy watchfulneſſe may fall into the evil of ambition: We
finde that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Siſter <hi>Miriam</hi> a Propheteſſe grew ambitious againſt
<hi>Moſes,</hi> they quarrell with him about the <hi>Ethiopian woman</hi> which he had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
that's their pretence, but then they plainly tell <hi>Moſes</hi> that God had not
only ſpoken by him but by them alſo; You know how God took it at their
hands, if good men ſin God will not ſpare them but more ſeverely puniſh
them: ſome other there be that murmure againſt his Highneſſe, as <hi>Ioab</hi> did
againſt good <hi>David</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Abner,</hi> becauſe he made peace with him, and
with the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 21, 24.</note>: Others murmure, becauſe they conceive more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
greater eſteem, and better reward is given to ſome then to themſelves,
like thoſe that were hired into the Vineyard<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 20. 11.</note>, you know what anſwer Chriſt
gives to ſuch; This kinde of evil began to enter into the hearts of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
but Chriſt taught them a better leſſon<note n="m" place="margin">Luke 9. 46, 47.</note>, of ſome of theſe ſorts, are
all the great murmurers of which the Apoſtle <hi>Iude</hi> ſaith plainly, <hi>theſe are
they that walk after their luſts, and their mouth ſpeaketh ſwelling words</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Jud. 16.</note>; Theſe
ſtrive for maſteries, they would all command but they cannot endure to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
and would perſwade the people that all their oppreſſions, injuſtice, and
cruelty is righteouſneſſe, and that the juſtice diſtributed to every man through
one man, is oppreſſion; <hi>Every mans waies are right in his own eyes</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Pro. 16. 2</note>, as the
holy Ghoſt is pleaſed to expreſs; And they would do as when <hi>there was no
King in Iſrael but every one did what was right in his own eyes</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Iud. 17. 6</note>, to adulterate
Religion, abuſe the Miniſters of the Goſpel, teach for doctrines the precepts
of men, commit adultery, blaſphemy, and kill, or what not, as in the time
of vacancy of Judges in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that <hi>there was no publike Magiſtrate in the Land
to put them to ſhame in any thing</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Iud. 18. 7</note>: Was not <hi>England</hi> almoſt brought to this

that under the ſpecious pretence of a Reformation, ſuch a Reformation as
aſcendeth out of the ſmoak that came out of the pit<note n="r" place="margin">Rev. 9. 2, 3</note>: bleſſed be our Jehovah
that hath thus far holpen us againſt ſuch deſigns, that they have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented

who hath been uſed by his hand to diſappoint their purpoſes, of whom
I hope and expect much better things then from thoſe Reformers, or then we
have ſeen in our Age for due adminiſtration of juſtice and eſtabliſhment of
Religion and Laws, that Religion may be advanced, held forth to the people
by a holy diſcipline, according to the Word of God, which is the will of
Chriſt, not the fancies of men, for God is a God of order and not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
He is <hi>not the Authour of confuſion but of peace in all the Churches of the
Saints</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 33</note>; And it was the Apoſtles joy in beholding their order and ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of faith in Chriſt<note n="t" place="margin">Col. 2. 5.</note>; And for this cauſe as himſelf ſaith, he left <hi>Titus
at Crete,</hi> that he ſhould ſet things in order that was wanting and ordain El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in every City<note n="u" place="margin">Tit. 1. 5.</note>; Order by a diſcipline of worſhip in the purity of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
is the way to that Reformation the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> looketh for; and the
eſtabliſhment and due execution of good and juſt Laws, that every man may
enjoy his own propriety, and that juſtice may be diſtributed to every man
without favour or revenge impartially, and that oppreſſors may be puniſhed
ſeverely, according to their offence; This is the thing God looks for at the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119009:27"/>
hand and by the place to which he hath called the Lord Protector; And
this I beleeve he intendeth and will do, if murmurers will have but patience,
If he do it not, he diſſembleth with God, and God will judge him, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knows the ſecrets of all hearts; For Judgement belongs unto God alone,
he hath not given that unto men, but he hath commanded us not to judge
(but our ſelves;) <hi>Judge not that ye be not judged</hi>
               <note n="w" place="margin">Mat. 7. 1</note>, for <hi>the Lord is a God of
Judgement, bleſſed are they that wait upon him</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Iſ. 30. 18</note>: The Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> ſharply
reproveth the Jews in a caſe like ours at this day; <hi>Ye have wearied the Lord

that doth evil is good in the ſight of the Lord</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Mal. 2. 17</note>; that is, you make acclamations

ye deſire, and in their own way, as if he were a favourer of evil doers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ye cry out <hi>Where is the God of judgement?</hi> as a violent affirmative that

               <note n="z" place="margin">Pſ. 44. 21</note>.</p>
            <p>Why then do we judge and condemn the man that hath done us good and
no harm? and why do we murmure againſt God and repine at providence?
The Lord in mercy open the eyes of all his people, and bring their hearts
ſuitable to himſelf, that they may willingly ſubmit their wils to the will of
God: You know we had a long time of peace and knew not the bitterneſſe
of war, and we had a happy beginning of Reformation in the daies of Q.
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but in ſtead of going forward we went backward, and fell into the
hands of oppreſſors and perſecutors of Goſpel-Truths, which was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement
of war, (a ſore puniſhment) we expected relief from men,
but were more oppreſſed, they neither cared to eaſe us, nor pitied out
condition, our Religion grew to be mixed with multitudes of new devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and all old hereſies (cried down by the primitive Church;) Under
theſe calamities we groaned and cried to God, yea, many of Gods people
ſought him by praier and faſting, private and publike for deliverance, And

               <note n="a" place="margin">Iſa. 1. 26</note>, that we might be called the righteous and faithfull Nation, yet we
will not give God leave to do it for us, though we ſee Providence working it,
we will not be ſatisfied except God bring his will to our will, nay to our wils,
except God will give us the thing we ask in our own way, and by the means
we our ſelves preſcribe and ſet down, we will not own it any other way; We
aſcribe too much to our ſelves, therefore we preſcribe unto God things, times,
men and means.</p>
            <p>God by providence hath given us again a free Parliament, freely choſen

it is their fault, and I fear their ſin, It is not his Highneſſes fault, nor the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

themſelves being witneſs, but that God hath done wonderfull things by
his Highneſſe for us and againſt our enemies, of which we have (and may
have a laſting) benefit; if we provoke not the Almighty by our murmurings,
and cauſe him to turn our bleſſings into a curſe; Faith makes not haſte, but
ſtaies Gods time, and waits upon Providence; But it appears we live more
by ſenſe then by faith; We truſt God ſo far as we ſee reaſon for it, and no
farther; We ſay as the murmurers in the Wilderneſſe did to <hi>Moſes, Thou haſt
not brought us into a Land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance
of fields and Vineyards; Wilt thou deceive us, and make thy ſelf a Prince over us,

thus it may befall us, if God be not more merciful to us; Who is then the

            <p>I beſeech you My Brethren of <hi>England,</hi> be not impatient, take heed that
you fight not againſt God, murmure not at any Providence, beleeve that God
ruleth in the earth, and governs all things, and that all the turnings and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnings,

our fifth Inference, to which I referre the Reader for further ſatisfaction;
We that make Scripture our rule, ſay, and ſhall ever aver, that the Kingdom
of Chriſt is ſet up by praier, and that is the power of the Spirit of God within
us, he ſhall rule in the hearts of the Saints, and by his Kingly power ſhall
and will ſubdue our luſts or fantaſies and ſelf-waies; mortifie the fleſh and
the affections thereof, that we may be fit Temples for him to dwell in, that
he alone may rule and reign there<note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 16, 17.</note>; Others there be that will have none to
rule over them but <hi>Caeſar, Caeſar</hi> muſt be their King, they will neither have
Chriſt, nor his vicegerent to be their King, but they ſay ſtoutly as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving

            <p>Conſider what I have ſaid, and the Lord give every one a good and right

not hurtful only to themſelves but to the whole Nation, the
evil example of one murmurer draws more to the imitation of that ſin, then
the perſwaſion and good counſell of many can divert, and ſo all or multitudes
oft periſh together; As we ſee in the men that were ſent to ſpy out the Land
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they murmured and brought an evil report of that good Land,
which cauſed all the people to weep and murmure and cry out againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi>

               <note n="c" place="margin">Nu. 14. 2</note>, for which their murmuring they were excluded from that good

up the evil report, were deſtroied before the Lord by a plague<note n="d" place="margin">Numb. 14. 27.</note>; Conſider

and the defence of the true Religion againſt incroaching Tyranny, and
innovations ſubtlely inſinuated by the late King and his evil Counſel; But
that our Warre intentionally was againſt the lawful Authority of Kings, or
againſt the Perſon of the Late King as he was King, or againſt his juſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
I deny; Only againſt his evil Councel the War was raiſed, that
the Priviledges of Parliament, the Liberty of the People, and the truth of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119009:30"/>
Religion might be defended and eſtabliſhed, This will appear by ſeverall
Parliament Declarations, Proteſtations, and ſolemn Covenant; wherein the
Parliament do declare, proteſt, and covenant (as their own priviledge, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and liberty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) to defend and preſerve the Kings perſon, his juſt
Rights and Prerogatives, ſo far as it might ſtand with the preſervation of
Religion and the peoples Rights; But the late King ſtanding in ſtrong op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the Parliament and Liberty of the people, and his Rights and
Prerogatives coming in competition with or againſt the preſervation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Priviledges of Parliament and the peoples Right; He defending
and taking upon himſelf all the evil Actions and wicked devices of his evil
Councell, miſcarried (for ſo providence had ordered it ſhould be:) And the
people (as providence led them) ſubmitted to a Parliament to govern them as
a free People, they expected much eaſe and great Reformation, but enjoyed—.
Now I would ask the Objectors theſe two ſhort Queſtions. 1. If a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould become more tyrannicall then a King, and lay heavy burthens
upon them, reaching to their perſons, lives, and eſtates, by an unknown Law
or arbitrary power, and ſuffer Innovations to come in on every ſide, to the
contempt of Religion and adulterating every truth, turning Religion into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſhape to metamorphiſe truth; whether in this caſe, if ſuch ſhould be, the
people might not as juſtly cry out and take up Arms againſt ſuch a Parliament
as againſt a King? 2. If all theſe evils could be found and ſenſibly felt by the
people, whether it were juſtice to themſelves, acceptable to God, or benefit to
their poſterity, to caſt off, and to abandon for ever the authority and uſe of
Parliaments? I think they would give their negative, except ſuch as would
live without all order or command, which is to be worſe then devils; Nor is
the office nor juſt power of a King to be for ever rejected becauſe there have
been Tyrannical, oppreſſing, ſuperſtitious, or idolatrous Kings, for the office
of a King is the Ordinance of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and cannot be made null by man: To
this office though not by the Name or Title of a King, God by his providence
hath exalted the Lord Protector; And he that reſiſts his juſt Authority and
Government reſiſts the Ordinance of God: It is evident he hath not aſſumed
to himſelf that authority: he that objects that, I beleeve ſpeaks againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of his own conſcience (except his conſcience be cauterized) and that
he hath exerciſed any Tyranny or oppreſſion over the people, it is falſe, and
malicious calumniation, or that he will ever do any ſuch thing is but envies
ſuſpicion, therein meaſuring his Corn by their own Buſhell; He hath been the
inſtrument in Gods hand to withhold greater oppreſſions from the people,
and what at this day lies upon their ſhoulders, were laid on by others, not by
him, from which he is endeavouring to free us; Let us not therefore whileſt
he is eaſing of us cry out againſt him, and ſay he hurts us, like the dogge that
bites him that ſaves him from the tree; And for Laws he hath given none of
himſelf, for he refers that to the Honourable Parliament now ſitting, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors:
That which he did by advice of his Councel in the regulating of the
Chancery, and ejecting ſcandalous Miniſters, and bringing all treaſuries into
one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were (I think) very acceptable things and beneficial to the Nation,
ſuch as were long looked for from—but they came not.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:119009:31"/>
I anſwer, not conteſting whether he made any ſuch particular engagement
and promiſe or not: but grant he did, ſuch a thing I hope the Objector will
grant, for it cannot be denied that in every promiſe or engagement there is
ſome condition, the condition not kept the promiſe or engagement is void;
Whether it were between man and man in private contract, or whether it
were between a publike perſon of truſt and a Nation, or to other perſons of
publike concernment, if in any thing of private contract, doubtleſſe although
the promiſer were a looſer by it he is in ſtrictneſſe of conſcience tyed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what he promiſed; But if to publike concernment, the conditions fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the leaſt, he is not bound to perform what he promiſed and intended,
for that were the higheſt breach of truſt, poſſibly his Highneſs might by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
and conditions promiſed, engage againſt the government by Kings,
and to be governed by Parliaments, beleeving (ſuch or ſuch conditions being
performed) it might be moſt for the Peoples Freedom and Liberty, but when
he found the conditions waved, and that the Freedom and Rights of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was monopolized, and their liberty turned into licentiouſneſs, he might
change his minde and purpoſe: A good Father that promiſeth to his childe
ſuch or ſuch an Inherinance, and really intends to do it, yet if he be fully and
experimentally convinced that his childe will abuſe that donation, he revokes
his promiſe, alters his intention, and gives it to any other, and that juſtly: I
am unwilling to ſpeak all the truth in this caſe, becauſe I would not caſt dirt,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the queſtion is whether his Highneſs was not bound rather to wave
ſuch a promiſe to preſerve poſterity, then to keep it to enſlave a Nation, he
being a chief and principal man in truſt? For as I ſaid juſt now, in every
promiſe there is ſome condition, as when it was impoſed by ſupream authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
on all the people of the Nation to engage to be true and faithful to that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
then without King or Houſe of Lords; The condition was implied
that the people muſt have honeſt and juſt protection under that government;
And the end of all promiſes and engagements ought to be to Gods glory and
publike good: Now if after ſuch promiſe or engagement made by his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
if either the condition or the end did not concurre or anſwer the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as we know it did not) his Highneſs is abſolutely freed from his promiſe
or engagement, and no way tied unto ſuch a promiſe.</p>

by his induſtry and faithfulneſſe might be diſtributed to the people in

what ſhould be anſwer him?</hi> Nor did he break the priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
though he diſſolved that Parliament, for the priviledges of Parliament
were broken (but not by him) long before their diſſolution, by whom and
upon what deſign the whole people of the Nation knew, and I willingly omit
to repeat: If the attempting to take out five Members was a breach (as ſurely
it was) then the taking out or driving away of more then half five hundred,
was a greater breach and as much as a whole diſſolution, which priviledge could
not well be reſtored without a diſſolution; for if that Parliament (as was in
deſign by ſome) had been perpetuated; or if (as was by ſome others deſigned)
there had been another force upon the houſe, or (as they called it) another
purge, where had been the priviledges of the people? What would have become
of the fundamental Laws of the Nation? and amongſt how many hereſies
and corrupt new formed Religions muſt we have ſearcht to finde truth? and
who ſhould have known his right or enjoyed his propriety in any thing? Nor
did his Highneſſe ſet up himſelf, for God ſet him up, who puls down and ſets
up whom he pleaſeth, providence leading him to that he is, nor doth he ſeek
to rule and govern according to his own will, but according to the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Laws of the Nation, and agreeable to the will of God, elſe he would have
asked much more for himſelf and his poſterity then he hath done, nor intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to rule by any arbitrary power, for then he would nor have bounded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

               <hi>Fourthly, The great Objection framed againſt his Highneſſe, is,</hi> 1. That

them, many members ſent away, becauſe they would not engage to his deſign, to
confirm on him the ſupream power of the Nation, give him the Militia, negative to
all Parliament Reſolves, power to make Laws, and to raiſe money, ſo that not only
all the ſtrength and treaſure of the Nation ſhould be in his power, but Religion too,
which is more then ever the King had, and the things for which we engaged in a war
againſt him as a Tyrant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </label> To this I anſwer, as we ſay in our Proverb, and that truly, Ill will never
ſpeaks well, The men of the world, deſigning men, have ever envied vertue
and honour, which I verily beleeve are compactible in his Highneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and
therefore envyed, not by the righteous, but by the men of the world, whoſe
deſigns and intereſts are croſſed: 1. That he called this Parliament for any
other end then for publike benefit, circumſtances do demonſtrate; If things
be compared with things which I willingly forbear to particularize; And
for all preceding things which the Objectors call deſigns, Providence hath
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119009:32"/>
clearly led him to, as is proved in our foregoing diſcourſe. 2. That this is a free
Parliament, both in the Election and in the proceedings, is evident to them
that are not blinded by ſome prejudication; For the reſtrictions made in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of qualification in perſons to be Elected and Electors, was ſo far from
infringing the peoples liberty, or being any barre to their freedom, that it was
indeed their greateſt freedom and ſecurity of their ſafety, and was at this time
(conſidering out preſent condition) of abſolute neceſſity; Many deſigns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on foot to corrupt and enſnare counſels, the judgements of men being much
unſetled by ſubtle inſinuations of ſeducers; Nor was there any reſtraint upon
Parliament proceedings when aſſembled, as is objected, but what tended to
publike good, and the end why this Parliament was ſummoned, <hi>viz.</hi> to put
things that are out of order into order, by the Legal way of Parliament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
not to encreaſe factions, nor to maintain parties and private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
but to eſtabliſh Religion, peace, and juſt Laws, the main baſis and
foundation to the well-being of a Commonwealth, wherein the Parliament
is free, And I hope by their wiſedom, through the aſſiſtance and direction of
<hi>Jehovah,</hi> this Parliament will be inſtrumentall in the laying of ſuch a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
that God may own us for his people, dwell in our Land, remove his
afflicting hand from us, and leave a bleſſing to poſterity.</p>
            <p>I ſay further, that this preſent Parliament was ſummoned by the Authority
of the Lord Protector, which authority is from God, to which providence
hath led him all along, And we are commanded to be ſubject to the higher
powers, not ſome but all; <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject,</hi> why? <hi>for there is no power
but of God,</hi> The Apoſtle tels you that <hi>the powers that be are ordained of God,</hi>
Rom. 13. 1. By this power he ſummoned this Parliament, And before the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
he by the advice of his counſell declared to all the people the condition
that the Commonwealth was in, and what was now neceſſary to be done for a
happy ſettlement, I need not repeat any particular thing declared, nor verbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpoken by his Highneſſe at the Parliaments firſt aſſembling, becauſe it is
publike to all, The people in all obedience to his Highneſſe authority accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his ſummons, made their reſpective Elections; The Knights and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes
elected (or the moſt of them) accepted of their Elections, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the day and place; Why any one ſhould after all this oppoſe that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which called them, and the end why they came together, I will not judge.</p>
            <p>That his Highneſſe ſent any away, as is objected, I deny, They were at
their own liberty to ſit in the houſe or to depart, it was at their free choice,
That which they were to ſubſcribe was no other then was plainly held forth
to all men in the government as to one man, This was no barre to the free
debates in Parliament, for their debates to eſtabliſh juſtice and righteouſneſſe,
or offering any thing that might conduce to the benefit of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
It is only a bar againſt <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> the worſt of governments ready to
break in upon us: It is true it doth confirm his Highneſſe Lord Protector,
for his life and no more, which if he did not for publike benefit he might
have asked it for his poſterity, and carried it by his power, if he had made
himſelf his deſign, as is objected; To that part of the Objection concerning
the Militia, he was truſted with it by the Parliament, and it was at his diſpoſe,
for the good of the publike, and ſo he ever uſed it with all faithfulneſſe, and
God by it made him inſtrnmental to bring us out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (I may ſay) by
great wonders; We are ſtill in the Wilderneſſe ſcarce come ſo far as to Mount
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119009:32"/>
               <hi>Nebo:</hi> And we have many thouſands among us that ſtill look back unto
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and we have the Children of <hi>Anak,</hi> Giants and <hi>Cananites</hi> that ſtand in
the way and hinder out entrance into the poſſeſſion of our Evangelicall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
promiſed, Theſe muſt be ſubdued and kept under, therefore the Militia
is ſtill as uſeful in his hand as before, to ſecure the people from thoſe luſting
murmurers, and to ſubdue the <hi>Cananites;</hi> He claims not the Militia to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
but deſires it may be in Parliaments and himſelf, Providence hath put it
into his hand, and he knows his own heart, that he intends to uſe it no way
but for the benefit of the Common-wealth by advice of Parliament, But he
cannot know any others heart, nor can he ſay of any other that they would ſo
uſe it, No, not for the people, if it were in their hands at this time, for the
people are of as many mindes as men, if all might elect whom they would to
ſerve in Parliament, or all that would by deſigns get to be elected ſhould be
Members, it is more then probable the Enemy might in ſhort time be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Militia, and by it not only give away our Freedoms ſo much talked
of, and the liberty of the people, but take away our lives alſo, and which is
more then all take from us the priviledge of the Goſpel, and what elſe hath
been purchaſed with ſo much bloud and treaſure, and turn our pleaſant <hi>Eden</hi>
into an <hi>Acheldama;</hi> The good people of this Nation with his Highneſs may
ſay at this time, as <hi>David</hi> once ſaid, <hi>The Sons of Zervia he too hard for me,</hi>
which cauſed <hi>David</hi> to omit the doing that juſtice he willed to be done; And
truly my judgement tels me, if his Highneſs ſhould for his time (whatever he
may for publike good grant for future) part wholly with the Militia from his
hand, he ſhould provoke providence and betray his truſt to the Commonwealth
(which conſiſts not of a few men that appropriate ſingularity to themſelves
for private intereſts, but all the people) and give his life as a prey to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and with himſelf the three Nations, which till ſome ſettlement be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
depend upon his welfare; As alſo the intereſt that all true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
people in the world have in the welfare of this Nation; There muſt be a
truſt ſomewhere, but every man may not be truſted, though every free born
ſubject have right in it; Nor can it be truſted in the hands of the multitude,
for they rule by voice, not by Law, nor to ſome of them, becauſe others have
equal right: Nor can it be ſafe under the hand of a government Democratical
(the thing mightily aimed at by the oppoſites to his Highneſs, under ſpecious
ſhews, to pleaſe and to deceive the people) which is, as experience tels us, next
coſen to the higheſt Tyranny; why then not rather in him? of whoſe truſt
and fidelity the people of this Nation have good experience and great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
from a firſt and ſecond thraldom, till he by Gods bleſſing with his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
advice can ſettle it in ſafety for the future.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is objected, That he ſeeks a negative voice to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
reſolves, is a ſcandal, He asks it not but only in thoſe things that funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
concern the government, and that is (if men could ſee) for publike
benefit, that neither <hi>Oligarchy</hi> nor <hi>Domocracy</hi> may ſtart up to enthrall and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave
the people, by governing them according to will and fancy, by promiſes
without known Laws, where then would be the freedom and liberty of the
people now ſo much talked of by the Objectors? Theſe things he only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
againſt, in all other things whatſoever of Parliament Reſolves being
drawn into Bils, and offered unto his Highneſs, if he conſent not unto them
within twenty daies, they are to paſſe into, and to become Laws, although he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119009:33"/>
ſhall not give his conſent, as is expreſt in <hi>Art.</hi> 24. And for his ſeeking to have
power to make Laws, and to raiſe money, it is meer calumniation, he ſeeks it
not, nor claims it not, but leaves it to the wiſedom of Parliament, as appears
in <hi>Art.</hi> 6. except (as is there excepted) for and in caſes of ſafety and of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
till the time that this preſant Parliament were aſſembled, and that to be
done by him with the advice of his counſel, as in <hi>Art.</hi> 30. ſo then he ſeeks not
the ſtrength nor treaſure of the Nation to himſelf, nor to have it in his own
power, as is objected: And for Religion he ſeeks nor to have it in his power,
but leaves it alſo to the Parliament to debate, conſult, and reſolve, that he by
them and they by him might receive all light poſſible in ſo great a buſineſs, for
<hi>In the multitude of counſel there is ſafety;</hi> It is indeed a great work, beyond the
wiſedom of man to appoint, without divine aſſiſtance and ſpiritual wiſedom;
His Highneſs well knows the evil of the rigid prelatical Perſecution, in Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizing
over the conſciences of men in that rigid ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

and as <hi>ſervants to corruption, occaſions to the fleſh,</hi> and to licentiouſneſs,

quarrels, ſeditions, and confuſion, which ſeldom ends, if tolerated,
but with deſtruction to the beſt and moſt flouriſhing Commonwealths: Theſe
are Rocks that will ſplit the Ship of the beſt fortified Commonwealth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
carefully to be avoided by the beſt advice and skill of the moſt experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Pilot, in which his Highneſs doth not refuſe the counſel of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor doth he refuſe to paſs the Bill they ſhall agree on, except in his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
he ſee (as our chief Pilot) ſomething in it be dangerous to the well-being
of the Nation, and give them ſatisfaction therein, for he is more in this caſe
then any one man in Parliament, poſſibly a vote may be carried by one man,
which in ſuch a caſe he may juſtly deny, becauſe the utility, peace, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of a Commonwealth depends upon the right Diſcipline in Religion,
and the juſtice of Execution of juſt Laws, for regulating between two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams;
Religion in the power of it, in all godlineſſe, is a Law in it ſelf, and
needs no Law to command it, for Religion is truly the very nurſing Mother
to all vertues, graces, peace, and unity among men; And I muſt tell the
Objector, that the late Kings have not really endeavoured this, but he or they
had power to have done it, the neglect was his ruine, and a chief cauſe of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
miſery.</p>
            <p>Nor did we engage againſt this power or authority of the late King, but
againſt his miſuſing of that power, caſting off thoſe juſt Laws which by his
authority he ſhould have obſerved and commanded to be executed for the
good of his people; He ſeeking to rule by his own will, by abſolute power in
himſelf, to caſt off all juſt Laws and adulterate Religion at his pleaſure; this
was the Original of our war, and this is that which the Ancients in all times
have called Tyranny; But his Highneſs aſſumes not to himſelf ſo much Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
as the late and former Kings claimed and exerciſed, That which he
claims is ſuch a power as may enable him to eſtabliſh Religion in its purity,
and that he with his Parliament might enact and give life to all juſt Laws,
under which the people may live in all peaceableneſs, and be governed in all
ſobriety and godlineſſe, with tranquillity and utility, for preſent and future,
that the people may dwell ſafely every man ſitting under his own Vine and
under his Figree, as in the daies of <hi>Solomon, 1 King.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
            <p>

in a wilderneſs in untroden and uneven waies, and are digreſſed much from the
right way of good diſcipline, almoſt in that condition as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

we have been led in crooked waies, and leaped over all bounds to loſe our ſelvs,
we muſt meet with ſome unevenneſs and cragged ſteps before there can be an

There is a ſpiritual Temple to be erected, of which that was the Type, we

it ſhall be done at the time appointed, and by the man and means appointed;
