            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THE Design of the following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise is in general to represent the Constitution, Discipline, Vnity and Worship of the Primitive Church, that flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd within the first Three Hundred Years after Christ; but more particularly and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to describe their Opinions and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, with respect to those things that are now unhappily controverted between those of these Kingdoms, who are commonly known by the Names of</hi> Church of England-men, Presbyterians, Independents <hi>and</hi> Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists; <hi>for which reason it comes to pass, that to those Points, concerning which there is no difference amongst us, I have not spoken so largely as otherwise I might have done; and some other Customs of theirs I have not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at all, because now neglected and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used by us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95309:3"/>
What I have written as to this Subject, I have wholly collected out of the Genuine and unquestionably Authentick Writings of those Ages, that are now extant, making use of no other Writings whatsoever, except the Ecclesiastical History of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> which was writ in the beginning of the Fourth Age, and relates only those Affairs that were transacted in the Three former, beyond the Period of which time this Enquiry doth not reach; but is wholly limited thereby, and confined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. That which hath been thus collected, has been done, I hope, with the greatest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality and Fidelity, without any prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of Mind, or any fraudulent dealing whatsoever, which the Reader may the sooner believe, and the easier be convinced of, since for the clearer Demonstration of my Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and Vnprejudicedness herein, I have taken care to print in the Margent the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Words of all the Passages that I have cited, at least of all that are necessary, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the very Pages whence I fetch'd them, that so the Reader turning to the Pages mentioned in those Editions that I use, (which Editions I shall set down at the end of this Preface) and finding it according to my Quotations, may the more readily be perswaded, that throughout this whole Tract I have been every way honest and unbyass'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95309:3"/>
And as I have faithfully and impartially collected these Observations, so I have as modestly and unconcernedly represented them, avoiding all Words or Speeches that might seem to carry the least sharpness or Reflection in them, and have as nakedly expressed them, declining all affected or pompous Expressions, contenting my self with those Terms, that most naturally serve to render the Truth more perspicuous and evident, according to the Observation of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi>

                     <hi>He that would deliver the Truth, ought not studiously to affect an Elegancy of Expression, but only to use such Words, whereby he may render what he means intelligible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether all, or some, or none of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Primitive Customs may be changed by the Civil Magistrate, or by a Convocational Assembly, I pretend not here to handle; my Design at present is only to search into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, to find out what were the Vsages of the Ancient Church within the first Three Hundred Years after Christ; for, as was said before, no lower do I intend to go, which after the most impartial and serious Enquiry, I find to be according to the ensuing Treatise, in the penning whereof I have avoided all
<pb facs="tcp:95309:4"/>
Prolixity and Tediousness, and for that end omitting to answer several Objections, that I know may be made against several things which I have here asserted, mine Intention being briefly and perspicuously to prove what I judge to be the true Practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, as to those Points now dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by us.</p>
                  <p>As for the Occasion of my Publishing this Treatise, it cannot be imagined to proceed from a Spirit of Vanity or Ambition, since I so far conceal my Name, as that even my Bookseller knows not who I am; much less, I hope, will it be construed by any, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a Spirit of Contention and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity, from an ill Design to foment and increase our present Feuds and Divisions; since I assure the whole World, our unnatural Quarrels do so much afflict and trouble me, as that I would sacrifice not only this Book, but also all that I either am or have, if thereby I might be an happy Instrument to compose and heal them. But amongst other Reasons, these two were the chiefest that swayed me hereunto, To inform others, and, To inform my self: To inform others what the Practices of the Primitive Apostolick Churches were, if any shall be inquisitive and desirous to know them; or, if I am mistaken, (as who is without his Errors?) to be better
<pb facs="tcp:95309:4"/>
informed my self, which, I must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, was that which I chiefly designed in the Publication hereof; wherefore without any Ostentation or challenging, but unfeignedly and sincerely to prevent Mistakes in my younger Years, I humbly desire, (if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest be not too bold) and shall heartily thank any Learned Person, that will be so kind as to inform me, if he knows me to have erred in any one, or more Particulars, which he may do, either Publickly, or if he thinks fit, Privately, by Letter to my Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller, who will convey it safely to my Hands; and if any one that finds me deceived in any one or more Points, will favour me so far, as to undertake such a trouble, I should desire these few things of him, That he would be pleased, as I have done, to use only those Writings that were composed within my prescribed time, and if possible, the same Editions, and not only to form Objections against what I have written, but also to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, or rather to give me another Sense of those Passages which I have cited, and then I promise, if my Mistakes are fairly shewn, I will not pertinaciously and obstinately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, but most willingly and thankfully renounce them, since my Design is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a Party, but to search out the Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95309:5"/>
I have but one thing more to add in this Preface, and that is, that when I first resolved on the printing of this Treatise, I designed to have published my Observations on the fourth general Head propounded in the Title Page to be enquired into, <hi>viz. The Worship of the Primitive Church,</hi> as well as now I have done those on the three former, but for some Reasons I have reserved this for a particular Tract by its self, which probably, though I do not absolutely promise it, may in a little time more be also published; and that the rather, because in this Part I have made two or three References thereunto, which I thought good to acquaint the Reader with, that so if he cannot find some things that I have referred to in this Treatise, he may be assured they are to be met with in the ensuing one.</p>

                        <hi>That they should only come to the Threshold of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door, but not go over it.</hi> And in this Sense is the Word frequently to be understood in <note n="7" place="margin">De praescript. advers.

                     <p>§. 4. I begin with the first of these, What were the Peculiar Acts of the Clergy? Now here must be consider'd the Functions of every particular Order and Degree of the Clergy, which we may say to be three, <hi>viz.</hi> Bishops, Priests and Deacons, whose Employments we shall severally handle; as also several other Points, which under those Heads shall offer themselves unto us. I shall begin first with the Bishop; but for the better understanding both of him and the rest, it will be necessary, first of all, to consider the condition of the whole World, as it was before the Preaching of the Gospel, in a state of Paganism and Darkness, having their Understandings clouded with Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Error, alienated from God, and the true Worship of him, applauding their own bruitish Inventions, and adoring as God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their corrupted Reason and silly Fancies proposed to them as Objects of Adoration and Homage. Into this miserable state all Mankind, except the <hi>Jews,</hi> had wilfully cast themselves; and had not Christ the Son of Righteousness enlightned them, they would have continued in that lost and blind condition to this very day:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95309:11"/>
But our Saviour having on his Cross Triumph'd over Principalities and Powers, and perfectly conquered the Devil, who before had rul'd ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually in the Heathen World; and being ascended into Heaven, and sat down at the Right Hand of the Father, on the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost he sent down the Holy Ghost on his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Disciples, who were then assembled at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> enduing them thereby with the Gift of Tongues, and working Miracles, and both commissionating and fitting them for the Propagation of his Church and Kingdom, who having received this Power and Authority from on high, went forth Preaching the Gospel, First, to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and then to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> declaring those glad Tidings to all Kingdoms and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; so that as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 18. <hi>Their sound went into all the Earth, and their words unto the ends of the World;</hi> every one taking a particular part of the World for his proper Province, to make known the joyful News of Life and Salvation through Christ therein. Thus St. <hi>Andrew</hi> principally preach'd the Gospel in <hi>Scythia,</hi> St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> in <hi>Parthia,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Lesser Asia,</hi> and all the rest of the Apostles had their particular Provinces allotted them, wherein they went forth preaching the Gospel; and as they came to any City, Town or Village, they published to the Inhabitants thereof the blessed news of Life and Immortality through Jesus Christ, constituting the first Converts of every place through which they passed, Bishops and Deacons of those Churches which they there

                     <p>§. 5. Whether in the Apostolick and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive days, there were more Bishops than one in a Church, at first sight seems difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve: That the Holy Scriptures and <note n="4" place="margin">

Now put all these Observations together, and duly consider, whether they do not prove the Primitive Parishes to be no larger than our modern ones are, that is, that they had no more Believers or Christians in them than there are now in ours: I do not say, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Bishopricks had no larger Territories, or no greater space of Ground, than our Parishes have. On the contrary, it is very probable that many of them had much more; since in those early days of Christianity, in many places the Faithful might be so few, as that for twenty or thirty Miles round, they might associate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under one Bishop, and make up but one Church, and that a small one too: But this I fay, that how large soever their Local Extent was, their Members made but one single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and had no more Christians in it, than our Parishes now have; for that Diocess cannot possibly be more than one single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, where all the People met together at one time, Prayed together, Received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament together, assisted at Church Censures together, and dispatched Church Affairs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and yet the Members of the Primitive Diocesses did all this together, as the preceding Observations evidently declare; so that I might stop here, and add no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Now let any impartial Man judge, whether all these Descriptions of those Ancient Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses do not forcibly constrain us to reduce them to the Rate of our modern Parishes.

                     <p>How long it was before these Diocesses swell'd

                     <p>Now the four greatest Diocesses, that in those days were in the World, are <hi>Antioch, Rome, Carthage, Alexandria.</hi> The three former of which, during the whole three hundred years after Christ, never branched themselves into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particular Congregations, though the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did, as shall be hereafter shewn.</p>

                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p>That for this Reason these separate Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations were introduced at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> seems evident enough; because <hi>Dyonisius Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> saith, that these distinct Congregations were only in the <note n="2" place="margin">

he look'd on his Obligation of Residency at his Church to be so binding, as that in no Case almost, could he warrant the leaving of it; which Determination of his might be the more fix'd and peremptory, because that not long before, he was so severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tax'd <note n="3" place="margin">Epist. 3. apud Cyprian. p. 11.</note> by the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, and by many of his own <note n="4" place="margin">Pontius in vita Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priani.</note> Parish, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from them for a while, though it was to avoid the Fury of his Persecutors, who had already proscribed him, and would have executed him as a Malesactor, had he not by that Recess from his Church, escaped their murderous Hand.</p>
                     <p>So that the Primitive Apostolick Bishops constantly resided with their Flocks, conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously applying themselves with the utmost Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and Industry to the Promotion of the Spiritual Welfare of those that were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their trust, employing themselves in all Acts of Piety, and Offices of Charity; so lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a laborious and mortified Life, till either a natural, or a violent Death removed them from Earth to Heaven, where they were made Priests to the most High, and were infinitely remunerated for all their Pains and Sorrows; and so leaving their particular Flocks on Earth, to be sed and govern'd by others, who should succeed them in their places; which brings me in the next place to enquire, How a vacant Bishoprick was supplied, or in what manner a Bishop or Minister was elected to a Diocess or Parish?</p>
                     <p>§. 3. Now the manner of electing a Bishop,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95309:29"/>
I find to be thus: When a Parish or Bishoprick was vacant through the Death of the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, all the Members of that Parish, both Clergy and Laity, met together in the Church commonly, to chuse a fit Person for his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, to whom they might commit the Care and Government of their Church.</p>
                     <p>Thus when <hi>Alexander</hi> was chosen Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> it was by the <note n="5" place="margin">

                        </note> 
                        <hi>All the People met together in the Church to chuse a Successor, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing several illustrious and eminent Personages, as fit for that Office, whilst no one so much as thought upon</hi> Fabianus <hi>then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, till a Dove miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously came and sate upon his Head, in the same manner as the Holy Ghost formerly descended on our Saviour; and then all the People, guided as it were, with one Divine Spirit, cryed out with one Mind and Soul, That</hi> Fabianus <hi>was worthy of the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick;</hi>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:95309:29"/>
and so straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taking him, they placed him on the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Throne. <hi>And as</hi> Fabianus, <hi>so likewise his Successor</hi> Cornelius <note n="7" place="margin">Episcopo Cornelio—Cleri ac plebis suffragio ordinato. <hi>Cyprian. Epist.</hi> 67. §. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 198.</note> was elected by the suffrage of the Clergy and Laity.</p>
                     <p>Thus also with respect to the Diocess of <hi>Carthage, Cyprian</hi> was chosen Bishop thereof by its Inhabitants and Members, as <hi>Pontius</hi> his Deacon writes, <note n="8" place="margin">Judicio Dei, &amp; plebis favore ad Officium Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotii, &amp; Episcopatus Gradum, ad huc Neophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus- electus est. <hi>In Vita Cypriani.</hi>

                        <hi>That though he was a Novice, yet by the Grace of God, and the Favour of the People, he was elevated to that sublime Dignity;</hi> which is no more than what <hi>Cyprian</hi> himself acknowledges, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently owns, that he was promoted to that Honourable Charge by the <note n="9" place="margin">Populi universi suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio. <hi>Epist.</hi> 55. §. 7. <hi>p.</hi> 139.

                     <p>§. 4. When the People had thus elected a Bishop, they presented him to the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bishops for their Approbation and Consent, because without their concurrent Assent, there could be no Bishop legally instituted, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
                     <p>Thus when the fore-mentioned <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> was Chosen Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by the Brethren of that place; he had also <hi>the</hi>

                        <hi>common Consent of the circumjacent Bishops.</hi> Now the Reason of this, I suppose, was, lest the People thro' Ignorance or Affection, should chuse an unfit, or an unable Man for that sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; it being supposed, that a Synod of Bishops had more Wisdom, Learning, and Prudence, than a Congregation of unlearned and ignorant Men, and so were better able to judge of the Abilities and Qualifications of the Person elect, than the People were. Hence we find, that sometimes the Election of a Bishop is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Choice of the Neighbouring Bishops, with the Consent and Suffrage of the People: This Custom generally prevail'd throughout <hi>Africa;</hi> where upon the Vacancy of a See, <note n="2" place="margin">Apud nos, &amp; fere per Provincias universas te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netur, ut ad Ordinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes rite celebrandas, ad cam plebem cui praeposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ordinatur, Episcopi ejusdem Provinciae prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imi quique conveniant, &amp; Episcopus deligatur, plebe praesente, quae sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulorum vitam plenissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me novit, &amp; uniuscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jusque actum de ejus Conversatione perspexit.

                        <hi>The Neighbouring Bishops of the Province met together at that Church, and chose a Bishop in the presence of the People, who knew his Life and Conversation before; which Custom was observed in the Election of</hi> Sabinus, <hi>Bishop of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merita <hi>in</hi> Spain, <hi>who was advanc'd to that Dignity by the Suffrage of all the Brethren, and of all the Bishops there present.</hi> But whether the Election of a Bishop, be ascribed to the adjoining Ministers,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95309:30"/>
or to the People of that Parish, it comes all to one and the same thing; neither the Choice of the Bishops of the Voisinage, without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the People; nor the Election of the People, without the Approbation of those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, was sufficient and valid of it self; but both concurred to a legal and orderly Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was according to the Example of the Apostles and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Preachers, who in the first Plantation of Churches, <note n="3" place="margin">

                        </gap> of the Matter, I leave to the Learned Reader to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin; I may be deceived, neither mine Years, nor Abilities, exempt me from Mistakes and Errors: But this I must needs say, That after the most diligent Researches, and impartialest Enquiries, The following Notion seems to me most plausible, and most consentaneous to Truth; and which, with a great facility and clearness, solves those Doubts and Objections, which, according to those other Hypotheses, I know not how to answer. But yet however, I am not so wedded and bigotted to this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but if any shall produce better, and more convincing Arguments to the contrary, I will not contentiously defend, but readily relinquish it, since I search after Truth, not to promote a particular Party or Interest.</p>
                     <p>Now for the better Explication of this Point, I shall first lay down a Definition and Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Presbyter, and then prove the parts thereof.</p>
                     <p>Now the Definition of a Presbyter may be this: <hi>A Person in Holy Orders, having thereby an inherent Right to perform the whole Office of a Bishop; but being possessed of no Place or Parish, not actually discharging it, without the Permission and Consent of the Bishop of a Place or Parish.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But lest this Definition should seem obscure, I shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> it by this following Instance: As a Curate hath the same Mission and Power with the Minister, whose Place he supplies;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95309:33"/>
yet being not the Minister of that place, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform there any acts of his Ministerial Function, without leave from the Minister thereof: So a Presbyter had the same Order and Power with a Bishop, whom he assisted in his Cure; yet being not the Bishop or Minister of that Cure, he could not there perform any parts of his Pastoral Office, without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the Bishop thereof: So that what we generally render Bishops, Priests, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, would be more intelligible in our Tongue, if we did express it by Rectors, Vicars, and Deacons; by Rectors, understanding the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; and by Vicars, the Presbyters; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being the actual Incumbents of a Place, and the latter Curates or Assistants, and so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in Degree, but yet equal in Order.</p>
                     <p>Now this is what I understand by a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for the Confirmation of which, these two things are to be proved.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That the Presbyters were the Bishops Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and Assistants, and so inferiour to them in the actual Exercise of their Ecclesiastical Commission.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. That yet notwithstanding, they had the same inherent Right with the Bishops, and so were not of a distinct specifick Order from them. Or more briefly thus:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Presbyters were different from the Bishops <hi>in gradu,</hi> or <hi>in degree;</hi> but yet,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They were equal to them in <hi>Ordine,</hi> or <hi>in Order.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 2. As to the first of these; That Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were but the Bishops Curates and Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, inferiour to them in Degree, or in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95309:33"/>
actual Discharge of their Ecclesiastical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. This will appear to have been, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, already proved, if we recollect what has been asserted, touching the Bishop and his Office, That there was but one Bishop in a Church; That he usually performed all the parts of Divine Service; That he was the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Disposer and Manager of all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Diocess, there being nothing done there without his Consent and Approbation: To which we may particularly add,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That without the Bishop's leave, a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter could not baptize: Thus saith <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>

                     <p>Now had the Presbyters had an equal Power in the Government of those Churches wherein they lived, how could it have been impudent
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95309:34"/>
and usurping in them to have perform'd the particular acts of their Ecclesiastical Function, without the Bishop's Leave and Consent? No, it was not fit or just, that any one should preach, or govern in a Parish, without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the Bishop or Pastor thereof; for where Churches had been regularly formed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Jurisdiction of their proper Bishops, it had been an unaccountable Impudence, and a most detestable act of Schism for any one, tho' never so legally Ordained, to have entred those Parishes, and there to have performed Ecclesiastical Administrations, without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of, or which is all one, in Defiance to the Bishops, or Ministers thereof; for though a Presbyter by his Ordination had as ample an inherent Right and Power to discharge all Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Offices, as any Bishop in the World had; yet Peace, Unity and Order, oblig'd him not to invade that part of God's Church, which was committed to another Man's Care, without that Man's Approbation and Consent.</p>
                     <p>So then in this Sense a Presbyter was infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to a Bishop in Degree, in that having no Parish of his own, he could not actually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the particular Acts of his Ministerial Function, without leave from the Bishop of a Parish or Diocess: The Bishops were superiour to the Presbyters, in that they were the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and inducted Ministers of their respective Parishes; and the Presbyters were inferiour to the Bishops, in that they were but their Curates and Assistants.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. But though the Presbyters were thus different from the Bishops in Degree, yet they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95309:35"/>
were of the very same specifick Order with them, having the same inherent Right to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form those Ecclesiastical Offices, which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop did, as will appear from these three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That by the Bishop's permission they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged all those Offices, which a Bishop did. 2. That they were called by the same Titles and Appellations as the Bishops were: And, 3. That they are expresly said to be of the same Order with the Bishops. As to the first of these, That by the Bishop's permission, they dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all those Offices which a Bishop did; this will appear from that,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When the Bishop ordered them, they preach'd. Thus <hi>Origen,</hi> in the beginning of some of his Sermons, tells us, That he was commanded thereunto by the Bishop, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly when he preach'd about the Witch of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor;</hi> he says, <note n="1" place="margin">

Now I would fain know, Whether during the vacancy of a See, or the Bishop's absence, which sometimes might be very long, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> was absent two years, a Presbyter could not admit a returning Heretick to the Peace and Unity of the Church, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we consider their positive Damnation of all those that died out of the Church?

                     <p>Now then if the Presbyters could supply the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95309:38"/>
place of an Absent Bishop, and in general dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge all those Offices, to which a Bishop had been obliged, if he had been present; it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follows that the Presbyters could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge every particular Act and Part thereof. If I should say, such an one has all the Senses of a Man, and yet also assert that he cannot see, I should be judged a Self-contradictor in that Assertion; for in affirming that he had all the Human Senses, I also affirmed, that he saw, because Seeing is one of those Senses. For whatsoever is affirmed of an Universal, is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of every one of its Particulars. So when the Fathers say, that the Presbyters performed the whole Office of the Bishop, it naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues, that they Confirmed, Ordained, Baptized, &amp;c. because those are Particulars of that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal.</p>
                     <p>But now from the whole we may collect a solid Argument for the Equality of Presbyters with Bishops as to Order; for if a Presbyter did all a Bishop did, what difference was there between them? A Bishop preached, baptized and confirmed, so did a Presbyter. A Bishop excommunicated, absolved and ordained, so did a Presbyter: Whatever a Bishop did, the same did a Presbyter; the particular Acts of their Office was the same; the only difference that was between them was in Degree; but this proves there was none at all in Order.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That Bishops and Presbyters were of the same Order, appears also, from that originally they had one and the same Name, each of them being indifferently called Bishops or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. Hence we read in the Sacred Writ of

                     <p>The first that expressed these Church-Officers by the distinct Terms of Bishops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, was <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who lived in the beginning of the Second Century, appropriating the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

of Bishop, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> signifying only a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or an ability to take the Charge of such a Flock or Cure; the former implying an actual discharge of the Office, the latter a power so to do.</p>
                     <p>This Distinction of Titles arising from the difference of their Circumstances, which we find first mentioned in <hi>Ignatius,</hi> was generally followed by the succeeding Fathers, who for the most part distinguish between Bishops and Presbyters; though sometimes according to the primitive Usage they indifferently apply those Terms to each of those persons.</p>
                     <p>Thus on the one hand the Titles of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are given unto Bishops; as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his Synodical Epistle, twice calis <hi>Anicetus, Pius, Higynus, Telesphorus,</hi> and <hi>Xistus</hi> Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi>

And on the other hand, the Titles of Bishops are ascribed to Presbyters, as one of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretive Appellations of a Bishop is Pastour. Yet <hi>Cyprian</hi> also calls his Presbyters <note n="1" place="margin">Pastores ovium. <hi>Epist.</hi> 11. §. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 33.</note>

                     <p>Now if the same Appellation of a thing be a good Proof for the Identity of its Nature, then Bishops and Presbyters must be of the same Order, because they had the same Names and Titles. Suppose it was disputed, whether a Parson and Lecturer were of the same Order, would not this sufficiently prove the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive? That though for some Accidental Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects they might be distinguished in their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95309:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet originally and frequently they were called by one and the same Name. The same it is in this Case, though for some contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and adventitious Reasons Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were discriminated in their Titles, yet originally they were always, and afterwards sometimes, called by one and the same Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and therefore we may justly deem them to be one and the same Order.</p>
                     <p>But if this Reason be not thought cogent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the Third and last will unquestionably put all out of doubt, and most clearly evince the Identity or Sameness of Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, as to Order; and that is, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said by the Ancients, That there were but two distinct Ecclesiastical Orders, <hi>viz.</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Deacons, or Presbyters and Deacons; and if there were but these two, Presbyters cannot be distinct from Bishops, for then there would be three.

And if they ordained but those Two, I think no one had ever a Commission to add a Third, or to split One into Two, as must be done, if we sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Order of Presbyters from the Order of Bishops: But that when the Apostles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Order of Bishops, Presbyters were included therein, will manifestly appear from the Induction of those fore-cited Passages in

                        <hi>Clemens's</hi> Epistle, and his drift and design there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, which was to appease and calm the Schisms and Factions of some unruly Members in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who designed to depose their Presbyters; and that he might dissuade them from this violent and irregular Action, amongst other Arguments he proposes to them, that this was to thwart the Design and Will of God, who would that all should live orderly in their respective places, doing the Duties of their own Stations, not invading the Offices and Functions of others; and that for this end, that all occasions of disorderliness and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion might be prevented, he had Instituted Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities of Offices in his Church, appointing every Man to his particular Work, to which he was to apply himself, without violently leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into other Mens places; and that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Apostles foreseeing through the Holy Spirit, that contentious and unruly Men would irregularly aspire to the Episcopal Office, by the Deposition of their lawful Presbyters; therefore that such turbulent Spirits might be repressed, or left inexcusable, they ordained Bishops and Deacons where they preached, and described the manner and qualifications of their Successors, who should come after them when they were dead and gone, and be rever'd and obeyed with the same Respect and Obedience as they before were; and that therefore they were to be condemned as Perverters of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution, and Contemners of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Authority, who dared to degrade their Presbyters, who had received their Episcopal Authority in an immediate Succession from those

                     <p>This was the true Reason for which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted Passages were spoken, which clearly evinces, that Presbyters were included under the Title of Bishops, or rather that they were Bishops; For to what end should <hi>Clemens</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the Schismatical <hi>Corinthians</hi> to obey their Presbyters, from the consideration of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Ordination of Bishops, if their Presbyters had not been Bishops?</p>

Now that by these Presbyters, Bishops are meant, I need not take much pains to prove; the precedent Chapter positively asserts it; the Description of them in this Quotation, by their enjoying the Dignity of the first Session, and the application of that Text of <hi>Isaiah</hi> unto them, clearly evinces it. No one can deny but that there were Bishops, that is, that they were superiour in degree to other Presbyters; or, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> styles it, honoured with the first Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but yet he also says, that they were not different in Order, being of the Presbyterial Order, which includes both Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</p>
                     <p>To this Testimony of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> I shall subjoin that of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> who tho' he mentions <note n="2" place="margin">

Now the Scripture mentions but two Orders of Angels, <hi>viz.</hi> Archangels and Angels, the Archangels presiding over the Angels, and the Angels obeying and attending on the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels.

                     <p>Whether this hath been fully proved, or whether the precedent Quotations do naturally conclude the Premises, the Learned Reader will easily determine. I am not conscious that I have stretched any Words beyond their natural Signification, having deduced from them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they fairly imported: If I am mistaken, I hope I shall be pardoned, since I did it not designedly or voluntarily. As before, so now I profess again, that if any one shall be so kind and obliging to give me better Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I shall thankfully and willingly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and quit mine Error; but till that Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation be given, and the falsity of my present Opinion be evinc'd, (which after the impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and narrowest Enquiry, I see not how it can be done) I hope no one will be offended, that I have asserted the Equality or Identity of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95309:44"/>
Bishops and Presbyters as to Order, and their difference as to Preeminency or Degree.</p>
                     <p>§. 4. Now from this Notion of Presbyters, there evidently results the Reason why there were many of them in one Church, even for the same Intent and End, tho' more necessary and needful, that Curates are now to those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Incumbents whom they serve, it was found by Experience, that variety of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and Circumstances did frequently occur both in times of Peace and Persecution; the Particulars whereof would be needless to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate, that disabled the Bishops from attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and discharging their Pastoral Office; therefore that such Vacancies might be supplied, and such Inconveniencies remedied, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained Presbyters or Curates, who during their Absence might supply their Places, who also were helpful to them, whilst they were present with their Flocks, to counsel and advise them; whence Bishop <hi>Cyprian</hi> assures us, that he did all things by the <note n="7" place="margin">Communi Consilio. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.</hi> 24. p. 55.</note> 
                        <hi>Common Council</hi> of his Presbyters.</p>
                     <p>Besides this, in those early days of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Churches were in most places thin, and at a great distance from one another; so that if a Bishop by any Disaster was Incapacitated for the Discharge of his Function, it would be very difficult to get a neighbouring Bishop to assist him. To which we may also add, that in those times there were no publick Schools or Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, except we say the Catechetick Lecture at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was one for the breeding of young Ministers, who might succeed the Bishops as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95309:44"/>
they died; wherefore the Bishops of every Church took care to instruct and elevate some young Men, who might be prepared to come in their place when they were dead and gone. And thus for these and the like Reasons most Churches were furnished with a competent number of Presbyters, who helpt the Bishops while living, and were fitted to succeed them when dead.</p>
                     <p>§. 5. I say only, most Churches were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Presbyters, because all were not, especially those Churches which were newly planted, where either the Numbers or Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Belîevers were small and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: Neither indeed were Presbyters Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Constitution of a Church; a Church might be without them, as well as a Parish can be without a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

As for the time when Presbyters began, to me it seems plain, that their Office was even in the Apostolick Age, tho' by their Names they were not distinguished from Bishops till sometime after. The first Author now extant, who distinctly mentions Bishops and Presbyters, is <hi>Ignatius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who lived in the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95309:45"/>
beginning of the Second Century: But without doubt before his time, even in the days of the Apostles, where Churches increased, or were somewhat large, there were more in Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders than the Bishops of those Churches. We read in the New Testament of the Bishops of <hi>Ephesus, Acts</hi> 20. 28. and <hi>Philippi, Philip.</hi> 1. 1. which must be understood of what was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards distinctly called Bishops and Presbyters.

And as the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were of the same Order with the Bishop, so probably the Subdeacons were of the same Order with the Deacons, which may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from what we may suppose to have been the Origin and Rise of these Subdeacons, which might be this, That in no Church whatsoever, was it usual to have more than Seven Deacons, because that was the original Number instituted by the Apostles; wherefore when any Church grew so great and numerous, that this stinted Number of Deacons was not sufficient to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their necessary Ministrations, that they might not seem to swerve from the Apostolical Example, they added Assistants to the Deacons, whom they called Subdeacons or Under Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, who were employed by the Head or Chief Deacons, to do those Services in their stead and room, to which, by their Office, they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged. But whether this be a sufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove the Subdeacons to be of the same Order with the Deacons, I shall not determine, because this Office being now antiquated, it is not very pertinent to my Design, I only offer it to the Consideration of the Learned, who have Will and Ability to search into it.</p>

                        </gap> dreadful and tremendous a Charge. And this now brings me in the next place, to enquire into the Manner and Form of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ordinations, which I chuse to discourse of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95309:47"/>
in this place, since I shall find none more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for it throughout this whole Treatise.</p>
                     <p>§. 4. As for the various Senses and Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which may be put on the Word <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> I shall not at all meddle with them; that Ordination that I shall speak of is this, the Grant of a Peculiar Commission and Power, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains indelible in the Person to whom it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and can never be obliterated or rased out, except the Person himself cause it by his Heresie, Apostacy, or most extremely gross and scandalous Impiety. Now this sort of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination was conferred only upon Deacons and Presbyters, or on Deacons and Bishops, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Bishops being here to be consider'd as all one, as Ministers of the Church-Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal. As for the Ordination of Deacons, there is no great Dispute about that, so I shall say no more concerning it, than that we have the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof at their first Institution in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6. which was, that they were Ordained to their Office by Prayer and Imposition of Hands.</p>
                     <p>§. 5. But as for the Ordination of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I shall more distinctly and largely treat of the Manner and Form thereof, which seems to be as follows.</p>
                     <p>Whosoever desired to be admitted into this Sacred Office, he first proposed himself to the Presbytery of the Parish where he dwelled and was to be Ordained, desiring their Consent to his designed Intention, praying them to confer upon him those Holy Orders which he craved. Now we may suppose his Petition was to the whole Presbytery, because a Bishop alone could not give those Holy Orders, as is most evident
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95309:48"/>
from <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us, that <note n="4" place="margin">Communi Consilio om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium nostrum. <hi>Epist.</hi> 24. <hi>p.</hi> 55.</note> 
                        <hi>all Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ordinations were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Common Counsel of the whole Prebytery.</hi> And therefore when upon a <note n="5" place="margin">Necesse fuit—necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate urgente promotum est. <hi>Ibidem.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>most ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and necessary occasion</hi> he had been forced to ordain one, but a Lector without the Advice and Consent of his Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which one would be apt to think was no great Usurpation, he takes great pains (<hi>Ep.</hi> 24. <hi>p.</hi> 55.) to justifie and excuse himself for so doing.</p>
                     <p>§. 6. Upon this Application of the Candidate for the Ministry, the Presbytery took it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Consideration, debated his Petition <note n="6" place="margin">Communi Consilio. <hi>Epist.</hi> 24. <hi>apud Cypr. p.</hi> 55.</note>

What those Gifts and Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were, touching which he was examined, may be reduced to these Four Heads, his Age, his Condition in the World, his Conversation, and his Understanding.</p>
                     <p>As for his Age; It was necessary for him to have lived some time in the World, to have been of a ripe and mature Age; for they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained no Novices, or young Striplings: That was the Practice of the Hereticks, whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> jeers and upbraids with Ordaining <note n="7" place="margin">Nunc Neophytos con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locant. <hi>

This also was founded on that other Apostolick Canon in 2 Tim. 2. 4. <note n="2" place="margin">Nemo militans Deo obligat se molestiis Sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularibus, ut possit pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ei cui se probavit.

                     <p>§. 14. But now their formal Ordination was by Imposition of Hands, usually of the Bishop and Presbyters of the Parish where they were Ordained: For this there needs no other Proof than that Injunction of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi>

As for Imposition of hands, it was a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that was variously used in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from whence it was translated into the New, and in the Primitive Church used on sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry occasions, to no purpose here to enumerate: One of those Actions was, Ordination of Church-Officers, wherein, I think, it was never omitted.

So the Church of Christ, which has a certain Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment annexed to it, that it may preserve its self from Ruine and Confusion, has certain Laws and Orders for the due Regulation of her Members, and Penalties annexed to the Breaches thereof.

Having thus found out the Members of the Ecclesiastical Tribunal, the next thing to be consider'd, is the manner and Form of their Proceedings in the Exercise of their Judicial Power and Authority, which by <hi>Tertullian</hi> is described to be after this manner: When at their general Assemblies the other parts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note n="3" place="margin">Ibidem etiam exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones, castigationes, &amp; censura divina; nam &amp; judicatur magno cum pondere, ut apud certos de Dei conspectu, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>then followed Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, Reproofs, and a Divine Censure; for the Judgment is given with great weight, as amongst those that are sure, that God beholds what they do; and this is one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Preludiums and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of the Judgment to come, when the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is banished from the Communion of Prayers, Assemblies, and all Holy Commerce. Approved Elders preside there, who obtained that Honour by Testimony, not by Price.</hi> So that when the Consistory was sat, the Bishop and his assisting Presbyters, here called <hi>Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Elders;</hi> but commonly the Presbytery pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided and moderated all things there proposed and debated. Then the Offenders, if possible, were actually brought before them, (tho' the non-appearance of the Criminals was no impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to their Proceedings) for notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they condemned them, and censured them
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95309:66"/>
not only for those Crimes, for which they were cited to appear, but also for their Contumacy and Stubbornness, as <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> writes, <note n="4" place="margin">Spirituali gladio su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbi &amp; contumaces ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantur, dum de ecclesia ejiciuntur. <hi>Epist.</hi> 62. §. 3. p. 170.</note>

                        <hi>those that are stubborn and fear not God, but go off from the Church, let no Man accompany.</hi> But yet, I say, if possible, the Offenders personally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that so their Crimes might be objected to them, to which they were to plead, as <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> says, that the Lapsed <note n="6" place="margin">Acturi &amp; apud nos, &amp; apud Plebem universam causam suam, <hi>Epist.</hi> 10. §. 4. p. 30.</note>

                        <hi>that all things were debated in common amongst them.</hi> And if the Bishop and Majority of the Court judged their Defence insufficient, they were voted by their common Suffrage to be condemned and censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> writes, that <note n="8" place="margin">Secundum vestra divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na suffragia conjurati. <hi>Epist.</hi> 40. <hi>ad Plebem.</hi> §. 1. p. 92.</note> 
                        <hi>whoever was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, it was by the Divine Suffrages of the People.</hi> The Delinquent being thus cast, or found Guilty, the next thing that succeeded, was the formal Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sentence of the Court, which was
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95309:67"/>
pronounced, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> intimates in that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted Passage, by one of the presiding Elders, that is, either by the Bishop or a Presbyter Commission'd by him, the manner of which Pronunciation seems also from that Passage to be thus: He that passed the formal Sentence on the Criminal, first began with <hi>Exhortations;</hi> that is, as we may reasonably suppose, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the Faithful to use all diligent Care and Fear to avoid those Sins and Crimes, which had brought the Offenders before them to so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and fatal Condition. Then followed Reproofs, which were sharp Rebukes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions to the Delinquents for their foul Miscarriages and enormous Practices, setting forth the Evil, Villany and Misery of them; That they were provoking to God, grievous to the Faithful, scandalous to Religion, and in fine, ruining and pernicious to themselves; in that it rendred them obnoxious to that <hi>Divine Censure,</hi> which then immediately, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of all, he formally pronounced on them.

Hence tho' the Labours and Inspections of the Bishops were more peculiarly confined to their own Parishes, yet as Ministers of the Church Universal, they employed a general kind of Inspection over other Churches also, observing their Condition and Circumstances, and giving unto them an account of their own state and posture; as <hi>Cyprian</hi> inspected that of <hi>Arles,</hi> giving this as his Reason for it, that <note n="5" place="margin">Nam etsi pastores mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti sumus, unum tamen gregem pascimus, &amp; oves universas quas Christus sanguine suo &amp; passione quaesivit, colligere &amp; fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere debemus. <hi>Epist.</hi> 67. §. 6. <hi>p.</hi> 199.</note>

                     <p>That which must be spoken of in this Section is, the several kinds or sorts of Synods, the most august and supreme kind whereof, was an Universal or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But those Synods, which were very frequent within my prescribed time, were Provincial Synods, that is, as many particular Churches as could conveniently and orderly associate themselves together, and by their common Consent and Authority dispose and regulate all things that related to their Polity, Unity, Peace, and Order.

                     <p>§. 5.

                     <p>§. 7. When a Synod was convened, before ever they entred upon any Publick Causes, they chose out of the gravest and renownedst Bishops amongst them, one, or sometimes two, to be their Moderator or Moderators; as at the Council held at <hi>Carthage, Anno</hi> 258. <note n="5" place="margin">Act.

thereof. And so we read of the Prolocutors of several Synods, that were assembled in divers parts of the World, to determine the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies concerning <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:</hi> As <note n="6" place="margin">Apud Euseb. lib. 5. cap. 23. p. 190, 191.</note> Victor <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>was Prolocutor of a Synod held there.</hi> Palmas <hi>Bishop of</hi> Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris <hi>Moderator of a Synod held in</hi> Pontus; <hi>and</hi> Irenaeus <hi>Bishop of</hi> Lyons <hi>of another in</hi> France. <note n="7" place="margin">Apud Fuseb. lib. 5. cap. 24. p. 191.</note> Polycrates <hi>Bishop os</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus <hi>presided over a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of</hi> Asiatick <hi>Bishops;</hi> and <note n="8" place="margin">Apud Euseb. lib. 5. cap. 23. p. 190.</note> 
                        <hi>at a Convocation in</hi> Palestina <hi>there were two Moderators,</hi> viz. Theophilus <hi>Bishop of</hi> Caesarea, <hi>and</hi> Narcissus <hi>Bishop of</hi> Jerusalem. The Office and Duty of a Moderator was to preside in the Synod, to see all things calmly and fairly deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and decreed; and at the conclusion of any Cause, to sum up what had been debated and urged on both sides, to take the Votes and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of the Members of the Synod; and last of all, to give his own. All this is evident in the Proceedings of the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which are extant at the end of <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Works, <hi>Cyprian</hi> being Moderator of that Council: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all things were read and finished relating to the Question in hand, sums up all, telling the Synod what they had heard, and that nothing more remained to be done, but the Declaration of their Judgment thereupon. Accordingly thereunto the Bishops gave their respective Votes and Decisions; and last of all <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as President, gave in his.</p>

§. 8. When the Moderator was chosen, then they entred upon the consideration of the Affairs that lay before them, which may be consider'd in a two-fold respect, either as relating to Foreign Churches, or to those Churches only of whom they were the Representatives. As for foreign Churches, their Determinations were not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory unto them, because they were not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by them; and so the chiefest matter they had to do with them, was to give them their Advice and Counsel in any difficult Point, which they had proposed to them; as when the People of <hi>Astorga</hi> and <hi>Emerita</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> had written to some <hi>African</hi> Churches for their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, what to do with their two Bishops, who had lapsed in Times of Persecution. This Case was debated in a Synod held <hi>Anno</hi> 258, whose Opinion thereupon is to be seen in their Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Epistle, extant at large amongst the Works of <hi>Cyprian. Epist.</hi> 68. <hi>p.</hi> 200.</p>
                     <p>§. 9. But with respect unto those particular Churches, whose Representatives they were, their Decrees were binding and obligatory, since the Regulation and Management of their Affairs was the general End of their Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>Various and many were the particular Ends of these Synodical Conventions, as for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Injustice and Partiality in a Parish Consistory: As suppose, that such a Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had wrongfully and unrighteously censured one of their Members, what should that censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Person do, unless appeal to the Synod to have his Cause heard there, as <hi>Felicissimus</hi> did, who after he was excommunicated by his own

                        <hi>the Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters met together every Year, to dispose those things which were committed to their charge.</hi> Here they consulted about the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, Government, and External Polity of their Churches, and what means were expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and proper for their Peace, Unity and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which by their common Consent they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted and decreed to be observed by all the Faithful of those Churches whom they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present.</p>

HAving in the precedent Chapters dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of the Constitution and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Primitive Church, I come now in this to treat of the Unity thereof, which I had a very great Inclination to search into, since by the due understanding thereof we shall the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apprehend the Notion of the Ancients con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Schism, because that Schism is nothing else but a Breach of that Unity, as will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now that we may know what the Breach of the Unity of the Church was, it is absolutely necessary first to know what the Unity its self was; for till we understand its Unity, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that we should understand the Breach thereof.</p>
                     <p>Now for the distinct apprehending hereof, we must remember the various Acceptations of the Word Church, as they are related in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Treatise, and according to the different Significations thereof, so must its Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be diversified, or be differently understood; and according to the different manner of its Unity, so must we apprehend the Breach thereof.</p>
                     <p>§. 2.

                     <p>Negatively, It consisted not in an Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Rites and Customs; for every particular Church was at liberty to follow its own proper Usages: One Church was not obliged to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Rites of another, but every one fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed its own peculiar Customs.

violated their reasonable Canons, were censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as turbulent and factious, as it hath been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnced in the former Chapter, and needs no farther Proof in this, because that the Schism of the Ancients was not a Breach of the Churches Unity in this Sense, <hi>viz.</hi> as denoting or signifying a Church Collective.</p>
                     <p>§. 5. But Schism principally and originally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected a particular Church or Parish, tho' it might consequentially influence others too. Now the Unity of a particular Church consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Members Love and Amity toward each other, and in their due Subjection or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to their Pastour or Bishop: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the Breach of that Unity consisted in these two things, either in a Hatred and Malice of each other, or in a Rebellion against their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pastour, or which is all one, in a causeless Separation from their Bishop, and those that adhered to him.</p>
                     <p>As for the first of these, there might be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies and Discords between the Inhabitants of a Parish, without a formal Separation from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which Jars and Feuds were called Schism; an Instance whereof we find in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> unto whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 1 Cor. 11. 18. <hi>When ye come together in the Church, I hear that there be Divisions,</hi> or as it is in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>Schisms amongst you.</hi> Here there was no separate Communion, for they all came together in the Church, and yet there were Schisms amongst them, that is, Strifes, Quarrels and Discords. And as far as I can perceive from the Epistle of <hi>Clemens Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> which was writ to appease another
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:95309:87"/>
Schism in the same Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> there were then only Turmoils and Differences, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any actual Separation. But on this I shall not enlarge, because it is not what the Ancients ordinarily meant by Schism.</p>
                     <p>§. 6. But that which they generally and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly termed Schism, was a Rebellion against, or an ungrounded and causless Separation from their Lawful Pastour, or their Parish-Church. Now because I say, that a causless Separation from their Bishop was Schism, it will be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to know how many Causes could justifie the Peoples Desertion of their Pastour, and these I think were two, or at most three; the first was Apostacy from the Faith, or when a Bishop renounced the Christian Faith, and through fear of Persecution embraced the Heathenish Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as was done in the case of <note n="1" place="margin">Basilidem &amp; Martia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem libellis Idololatriae commaculatos—Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>§. 9. But for the clearer Proof, that this was what the Fathers meant by Schism, it may not be altogether unnecessary to add unto these Quotations an Example or two; for Examples more convincingly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> than bare Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Citations. And here let us first view the Schism of <hi>Felicissimus</hi> in the hurch of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> as it is related in the 38th, 40th, and 55th Epistles of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and we shall find it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting only that particular Church or Parish. When <hi>Cyprian</hi> was elected Bishop of <hi>Carthage, Felicissimus</hi> and others of his Faction opposed him, but finding themselves too weak, and not powerful enough to balance his interest, they yielded to his Promotion, but yet still retained an Hatred against his Person, and waited for a more favourable opportunity and a plausible Pretence to separate from him. It pleased God that <hi>Cyprian</hi> some time after his Advancement, was forced, by reason of the Persecution, to withdraw and absent from his Flock, during which Absence that Faction made use of all means to lessen his Interest, till they had made their Party indifferently strong, and then they broke out into an open Separation from him, forming themselves into a distinct Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, creating a new Bishop, erecting a new Altar, and constituting a new Church. Now all this was acted in, and respected only the particular Parish of <hi>Carthage,</hi> without causing or attempting any Separation in any other Church or Parish; and yet this <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95309:94"/>
                        <hi>Schism,</hi> and Excommunicates the Actors in it as Schismaticks, and Breakers of the Unity of the Church, of his Church Actually, and of all the other Churches of the Church Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Virtually, who like the Members of the Natural Body, are affected with the Pains and Convulsions of each other.</p>
                     <p>So also the famous Schism of <hi>Novatian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected only the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> being no other than his causeless Separation from <hi>Cornelius</hi> his lawful Bishop, and his erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing separate Conventicles against him, as may be read at large in those Epistles of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that treat of this Affair, and in his Book <hi>De Vnitate Ecclesiae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§. 10. But I foresee an evident Objection against this restrained Notion of Schism, and in particular from the Schism of <hi>Novatian,</hi> which I cannot well pass over without resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, since the Solution thereof will inform us in the manner, how the Schism of one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church did affect other Churches. Now the Objection may be this: If Schism respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only one particular Church, whence then comes it to pass that we read of <hi>Novatian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, not only at <hi>Rome,</hi> where that Schism first began, but in several other Churches and Parishes besides? Now to this I answer, That we must distinguish between the Schism and the Heresie of <hi>Novatian;</hi> had <hi>Novatian</hi> been only guilty of Schism, in all probability, his Schismatical Actions, as well as all other Schisms before, would have ended in the same Church where they began, and have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95309:95"/>
no farther; but he having once engaged in his Schism, and willing to continue it, that he might have some pretence for those enormous Practices, he accused his Bishop of remitting and loosing the Reins of Discipline, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with <hi>Trophimus,</hi> and others, that had Sacrificed to Idols, as may be amply seen in the 55th Epistle of <hi>Cyprian;</hi> consequently for the Justification of this Accusation, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Doctrine, as the Characteristick Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma of his Party, That the Church had no Power to absolve those who lapsed after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, but were to leave them to the Tribunal of God. This was an Error in Doctrine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious to the Mercy of God, and injurious to the Merits of Christ, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> shews at large in his 55th Epistle. Every Error in Doctrine was called Heresie. Accordingly <hi>Novatian</hi> is branded for this as an Heretick; whence the Confessours in their return from his Party, confessed that in adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to them, <note n="4" place="margin">Commisisse se Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata, &amp; haeresis auctores fuisse. <hi>Cyprian.

So that <hi>Novatian's</hi> Schism was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Heresie; which, as usual, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led after the Name of its Author; and having many eminent Persons to abet it, and a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous shew of Sanctity and Mortification, it is no wonder that it spreads its self into many other Churches, besides that where it was first hatched; unto which we may also add their Industrious Endeavours to proselyte Men unto their Party, <note n="8" place="margin">Ostiatim per multo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum domos, vel oppida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, per quasdam civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates discurrentes, obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis suae &amp; erroris scissi sibi quaerant co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites. <hi>Epist.</hi> 41. §. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 97.</note>

And probably several Bishops of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, who were the legal Pastours of their respective Parishes, were through their own Ignorance, and those Men's fair Pretences, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded into the same uncharitable Error with them, Of denying the Lapsed any Pardon. But we need not guess at this as only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, since we have an Instance of it in <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> the lawful Bishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> concerning whom, <hi>Cyprian</hi> writes to <hi>Stephen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he had received Advice from the Bishops of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, <note n="9" place="margin">Martianus Arelate consistens Novatiano se conjunxerit, &amp; à Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicae Ecclesiae unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, atque à corporis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stri &amp; Sacerdotii con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensione discesserit, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens Haereticae praesump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis durissimam pravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, ut servis Dei poenitentibus &amp; dolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, &amp; ad Ecclesiam lachrymis &amp; gemitu &amp; dolore pulsantibus, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinae pietatis &amp; lenitatis paterna solatia &amp; subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia claudantur, nec ad fovenda vulnera admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur vulnerati, sed si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne spe pacis &amp; commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicationis relicti ad lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum rapinam &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Diaboli projician<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Epist.</hi> 67. §. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 198.</note>

of <hi>Arles</hi> had joyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unto <hi>Novatian,</hi> and had departed from the Vnity of the Church, and the Concord of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, holding that Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Severity, that the Consolations of Divine Pity and Fatherly Lenity, should be shut against the penitent and mourning Servants of God, who knock at the Church with Tears, Sighs and Groans, so that the wounded are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to have their Wounds healed, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left without any hope of Peace or Communion, are thrown out to the Rapine of Wolves, and Prey of the Devil.</p>
                     <p>So that it was not <hi>Novatian's</hi> Schism, but his Heresie, that was diffused through other Churches; his Schism respected only his own Church, but his Heresie, which was a Breach of the Unity of the Church Universal, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected other Churches also; so that in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the forenamed Objection, we need only say this, That there was no such thing as the Objection supposes; that is, that there were no Bishops or Followers of <hi>Novatian's</hi> Schism in other Churches, but that those that were discriminated by his Name, were the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Followers of his Heresie.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95309:96"/>
But however let us suppose the worst, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Schismaticks had been Orthodox and sound in every Point of Faith, had been exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary and pious in the discharge of every Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had been guilty of no Crime but their Schism from their Bishop and Parish, and yet their Schism might have influenced other Churches and Parishes too, and that I think these two ways.</p>

If one or more Churches had admitted to Communion those that were Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by their own Church for Schism, that Church or Churches made themselves Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of those Mens Crimes, and involved themselves in the same Guilt of Division and Schism with them, as <hi>Martian,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> was adjudged by <hi>Cyprian</hi> as a Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, <note n="1" place="margin">Cum Novatianus ipse, quem sequitur, olim ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentus &amp; hostis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiae judicatus sit. <hi>Epist.</hi> 67. §. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 198.</note>

And First,</p>
                     <p>§. 2. When the Congregation was assembled, the first Act of Divine Service, which they performed, was the Reading of the Holy Scriptures. In our Publick Assemblies, says <hi>Tertullian,</hi>

the lawful and ordinary Prayer, there is place for accidental. Requests, and a Liberty of offering up other Petitions, so as they do agree with the Precepts: As far as we are from the Precepts, so far are we from God's Ears; the remembrance of the Precepts makes way for our Prayers to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, of which it is the chief.</p>
                     <p>Now these other Prayers, which made up a great part of Divine Service, were not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and imposed Forms, but the Words and Expressions of them were left to the Prudence, Choice and Judgment of every particular Bishop or Minister.</p>
                     <p>I do not here say, that a Bishop or Minister used no Arbitrary Form of Prayer; all that I say is, that there was none imposed: Neither do I say, that having no imposed Form, they unpremeditately, immethodically or confused<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vented their Petitions and Requests; for without doubt they observed a Method in their Prayers; but this is what I say, That the Words or Expressions of their Prayers were not imposed or prescribed, but every one that offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated, delivered himself in such Terms as best pleased him, and varied his Petitions according to the present Circumstances and Emergencies: Or if it be more intelligible, that the Primitive Christians had no stinted Liturgies, or Imposed Forms of Prayer.</p>
                     <p>Now this being a Negative in Matter of Fact, the bare Assertion of it is a sufficient Proof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept its Affirmative can be evinced. Suppose it was disputed, whether ever St. <hi>Paul</hi> writ an Epistle to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the bare Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof would be Proof enough that he did not, except it could be clearly evidenced on the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95309:116"/>
contrary that he did: So unless it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Ancients had fixed Liturgies and Prayer-Books, we may very rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in the Negative, that they had none at all.</p>
                     <p>Now as to these prescribed Forms, there is not the least mention of them in any of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Writings, nor the least Word or Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tending thereunto that I can find, which is a most unaccountable Silence, if ever such there were, but rather some Expressions intimating the contrary; as that famous controverted place of <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> who describing the manner of the Prayer before the Celebration of the Lord's Supper, says, That the Bishop sent up Prayers and Praises to God <note n="8" place="margin">
                           <hi>Apolog.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 98.</note> 
                        <hi>with his utmost abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>

                        </gap>, that is, that he prayed with the best of his Abilities, Invention, Expression, Judgment and the like. I am not ignorant that there is another Sense gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of <gap reason="foreign">

Now the praying by a Monitor, as is acknowledged by all, was praying by a Book.

                     <p>But that I may hasten to the Conclusion of this Section, it is very unlikely that they were obliged to prescribed Forms, because they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read a Syllable of their Prayers out of any Book whatsoever, which is evident from their Posture of Prayer, which was two-fold, Either with their Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven, or with their Eyes shut: That they prayed with their Eyes and Hands lifted up to Heaven, has been already shewn in the Third Section of this Chapter, to which I shall only add this far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Observation, that <note n="8" place="margin">Expandimus manus &amp; dominica passione modu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantes &amp; orantes consite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur Christo. <hi>Tertul. de Orat. p.</hi> 659.</note>

                        <hi>That they also prayed with their Eyes shut, is evident from</hi> Origen, <hi>who having explained what is meant by that Injunction of our Saviour in</hi> Matth. <hi>6. 5.</hi> And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are; for they love to pray standing in the Synagogues, and in the Corners of the Streets, that they may be seen of Men; verily, I say unto you, they have their Rewards, <hi>thus explains the following Verse;</hi> But thou, when thou prayest, enter thou into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut to thy Door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in

De Orat. §. 9. p. 62, 63.</note> But he that is no Hypocrite, enters into the Closet of his Heart, to the Riches that are treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up there, and shutting himself in amongst those Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge, and not fixing his Eyes on external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as looking after any thing without, and closing every Gate of the Senses, lest he should be drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side by them, and their Species or Fancies should creep into his Mind, he prays the Father, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver flies from, or leaves such an one, but together with the Son, dwells in him. <hi>So the same Father writes, that a true Christian prays in every place,</hi>

                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:95309:120"/>
If therefore there had been prescribed and imposed Forms, they must of necessity have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred them, which would have been an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Load to the strongest Memory, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to have repeated Word after Word the Prayers of their Fast Days, which must have been several Hours long, since some of their Fasts, as will be shewn in another place, were prolonged from the Morning of one Day, to the beginning of another.</p>
                     <p>§. 8. There remains now but one Question more with respect to their Publick Prayers, and that is, Whether they were divided into several Collects? To which I have not much certain to Answer; probably on their Assemblies on Fast Days, when they continued together tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the usual time, for the Ease of the Bishop and his Assistants, they made several <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But all this is but Conjecture, all that I find positive, is touching their Prayer, that preceded the Consecration of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical Elements, which, as <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> writes, <note n="2" place="margin">

                     <p>§ 2. As for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that were Baptized, they were two sorts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Infants, or Adult persons. That Infants were baptized, will be evident from this single Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Baptism was always precedent to the Lord's Supper; and none were admitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Eucharist, till they were baptized. This is so obvious to every Man, that it needs no proof: If any one doubts it, he may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> it clearly asserted in the Second Apology of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin Martyr, p.</hi> 97. Children received the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist in the Primitive Church, which is also a thing so well known, as that for the proof of it I shall only urge one pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of <note n="6" place="margin">Diaconus reluctanti li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, de Sacramento Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licis infudit. <hi>De Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> §. 20. <hi>p.</hi> 284.</note>

refused to taste the Sacramental Wine, that the Deacon was obliged forcibly to open her Lips, and to pour down the Consecrated Wine. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it naturally follows, that Children were baptized; for if they received that Ordinance, which always succeeded Baptism, then of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity they must have received Baptism its self. But I needed not to have mentioned this Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, since Infant-Baptism is as clearly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in Words at length in the Primitive Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as a thing can possibly be.

                        <hi>they could find, who should receive their Confession, and absolve them by Imposition of Hands.</hi> So that it is evident that Presbyters, even without the Bishop, did absolve Offenders, and formally receive them into the Churches Peace by Imposition of Hands.</p>
                     <p>Now then, If the Imposition of Hands on Persons just after Baptism, and the Imposition of Hands at the Restitution of Offenders was one and the self-same thing; and if Presbyters had Power and Authority to perform the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I see no reason why we should abridge them of the former; both the one and the other was Confirmation; and if Presbyters could confirm at one time, why should we doubt of their Right and Ability to perform it another time? If it was lawful for them to impose Hands on one occasion, it was as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to do it on another.</p>
                     <p>§ 9. From the precedent Observation of the Identity of that which we now distinguish by the Names of Confirmation and Absolution, it necessarily results, that Confirmation was not like Baptism, only once performed, but on many Persons frequently reiterated: All Persons after Baptism were confirmed, that is, by the Imposition of Hands and Prayer, the Holy Ghost was beseeched to descend upon them, and so to fortifie them by his Heavenly Grace, as that they might couragiously perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in their Christian Warfare to their Lives

end; but if it should so happen, as oftentimes it did, that any so confirmed should fall from the Christian Faith, and be for a time exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Churches Peace, when they were again admitted, Hands were again imposed on them, and the Holy Spirit again Invocated, to strengthen them with his Almighty Grace, by which they might be upheld to the Day of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and so as often as any Man fell, and was restored to the Churches Communion, so often was he confirmed, and the Holy Ghost entreated more firmly to establish and settle him.</p>

                     <p>First, As for the time of its Celebration: In general, it was at the conclusion of their Solemn Services, as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin Martyr</hi> writes, <note n="1" place="margin">

                        <hi>at Supper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time;</hi> from which late Assembling, it is probable, that the Heathens took occasion to accuse them of putting out the Lights, and promiscuously mingling one with another.

But before I meddle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, I shall briefly premise this Observation, <hi>viz.</hi> That in some places, as in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> the Communicants first made their Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, presenting according to their Ability, Bread, or Wine, or the like, as the first Fruits of their Encrease, <note n="3" place="margin">Offerre igitur opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet Deo primitias ejus cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aturae, sicut &amp; Moyses ait, non apparebis vacuus ante conspectum Domini Dei tui. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. c. 34. p. 262.</note> 
                        <hi>It being our Duty, as Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> writes, <hi>to offer unto God the first Fruits of his</hi>

                     <p>These Offerings were employed to the Relief of the Poor, and other Uses of the Church; and it seems probable that a sufficient Quantity of that Bread and Wine was presented to the Bishop, or to him that officiated, to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Sacramental Elements, whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration next succeeded, which in the main was after this following Manner.</p>
                     <p>§ 4. It is very likely, that in many places the Minister first began with an Exhortation or Discourse touching the Nature and end of that Sacrament, which the Congregation were going to partake of, that so their Hearts might be the more elevated and raised into Heavenly Frames and Dispositions. This may be gathered from the History of an Exorcist Woman, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by <hi>Firmilian,</hi> who took upon her to per. form many Ecclesiastical Administrations, as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95309:153"/>

By which I mean such things as are inseparable from all humane Actions, as <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Time, Habit,</hi> and <hi>Gesture.</hi> As for Habit, as much of that as is Controverted, I have spoken to already in that Chapter, where I discoursed of the Ministers Habit in Prayer. And as for Gesture, I have already treated of Worshipping towards the East. And of their Posture at the Reception of the Lord's
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95309:157"/>
Supper. There is nothing more disputed with reference thereunto, besides the bowing at the Name of Jesus, and the worshipping towards the Communion Table; but both these being introduced after my prescribed time, <hi>viz.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three hundred years after Christ, I shall say nothing to them, but pass on to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussing of the two remaining Circumstances of Publick Worship, <hi>viz. Place and Time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>§ 2. First. As for Place: This all will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily grant to be a necessary Circumstance of Divine Worship; for if we serve God, it is impossible, but that it must be in one place or other. Now one Query with respect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto may be, Whether the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had determined fixed Places for their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship? Unto which I answer, That usually they had; though it is true indeed, that in times of Persecution, or when their Circumstances would not permit them to have one usual sixed Place, they met where-ever they could, <note n="1" place="margin">

                     <p>§ 5. Time is as necessary a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to Religious Worship as Place; for whilst we are in this World, we cannot serve God at all times, but must have some determinate time to serve him in: That God's People therefore under the Law might not be left at an uncertainty when to serve him, it pleased the Almighty to institute the Sabbath, the Passover, and other Feasts, at which times they were to congregate and assemble together, to give unto God the Glory due unto his Name, And for the same end under the Evangelical Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration there are particular Days and Seasons appointed for the Publick and Solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Glorious and Eternal Lord, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Sayings of <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> God hath required us to serve him. <note n="1" place="margin">

                     <p>Occasional Fasts were such, as were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by any constant fixed Period of Time, but observed on extraordinary and unusual Seasons, according as the Variety and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of their Circumstances did require them. Thus in Times of Great and Imminent Danger either of Church or State, when by their Sins they had kindled God's Wrath and Fury against them, that they might divert his Vengeance, and appease his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Majesty, they appointed set Days and Times for the Abasing of themselves
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95309:163"/>
before the Lord, for the seeking of his Face by Prayer and Fasting, abstaining from the Food of their Bodies, and practising all external Acts of Humiliation, as so many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of the internal Contrition of their Hearts and Souls. So <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the time of a sharp Persecution ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised his Flock <note n="1" place="margin">Ad placandum atque exorandum Dominum, non voce sola, sed &amp; jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niis, &amp; lachrymis, &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni genere deprecationis ingemiscamus. <hi>Epist.</hi> 8. § 1. p. 22.</note>

                     <p>But that the Ancients esteemed <hi>Lent</hi> to be the only necessary fixed Fast, and any other, even the Stationary Days to be indifferent, will appear most evidently from this ensuing Passage of <hi>Tertullian, Tertullian</hi> being now a <hi>Montanist,</hi> and defending their prescribed Fasts against the Orthodox, thus jeeringly exposes the Opinions of his Adversaries with respect to the necessary determined times of Fasting. <note n="3" place="margin">Certè in evangèlio illos dies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Fasts, wherein the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom was takeu away, (<hi>i.e.</hi> Lent) and those to be the only Fasts of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Legal and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Fasts being abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished; and that for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers we may indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fast, according to our Will, not out of necessity or command, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and conditions, and that so the Apostles abserved, commanding no other fixed and common Fasts besides this; no, not the Stationary Days, which indeed they keep on <hi>Wednesdays,</hi> and <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,</hi> and do all observe, but yet not in obedience to any Command, or to the end of the Day, but Prayers are concluded at three a Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, according to the Example of <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Acts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that from hence it is evident, That the Orthodox apprehended themselves to be free from the necessary Observation of the Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary Fasts, and to be only strictly obliged to fast on those Days, <hi>wherein the Bridegroom was taken away;</hi> or on <hi>Lent,</hi> from which Periphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95309:166"/>
of <hi>Lent</hi> we may collect both the Reason and the Duration thereof.</p>
                     <p>First, the Reason thereof, or the Ground on which they founded the necessity of this Fast, and that was on that saying of Christ, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 15. <hi>The Days will come when the Bridegroom shall be taken from them.</hi> This they imagined to be an Injunction of Christ to all his Followers, to fast at that time, when the Bridegroom should be taken away. The Bridegroom they esteemed to be Christ, the time when he was taken away, his Crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Death, and continuing under the Power of Death to the instant of his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, during which time they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by the forementioned Command obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to fast.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, From hence we may observe the Duration of this Fast, or how long it was continued, and that was, from the time that Christ the Bridegroom was taken away, to the time that he was restored again, that is, from his Passion to his Resurrection. Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Various Computations of the beginning and end of Christ's being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, so was the Duration of their Fast; some might reckon from Christ's Agony in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95309:166"/>
or shortned. This we may probably suppose to be the occasion of the different Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Fast with respect to its Duration, as we find it in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>

                     <p>§ 4. As for the manner of their Fasts, we may observe them to be of three sorts, <hi>viz. Statio, Jejunium,</hi> and <hi>Superpositio; Station, Fasts,</hi> and <hi>Superposition;</hi> all which three are at once

                        <hi>Easter</hi> as one of the four Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals observed in his time.

created a violent Disorder and Confusion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Christians; for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would impose their Usages on the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the <hi>Lesser Asia,</hi> unto which the latter peremptorily refused to submit.

                        </gap>, that every Church should be left to follow its own Custom, as accordingly they were to the times of Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> who revived this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, and was so turbulent and imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as that he excommunicated the <hi>Asiaticks,</hi> for refusing to comply with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this matter, condemning them as Hereticks, loading them with the long and frightful Name of <hi>Tessareskaidekatitae,</hi> or, <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>todecimani,</hi> so called because they kept their <hi>Easter Quarta Decima Luna,</hi> upon the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Day after the appearance of the Moon, or at the Full Moon, on what Day soever it happened. But however the <hi>Asiaticks</hi> stood their Ground, and still maintained their old Custom, till the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> Anno 325. by their Authority decided this Controversie, decreeing, that throughout the whole Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World, <hi>Easter</hi> should be observed not on the Day on which the Jewish Passover fell, but on the Lord's Day ensuing, as it was ever after observed and followed.</p>

                     <p>§ 1. HAving in the precedent Chapters enquired into the several Parts of Divine Worship, and the Circumstances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I now come to close up all with a brief Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix concerning Rites and Ceremonies, by which I mean two different things: By Rites, I understand such Actions as have an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Relation to the Circumstances or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Worship: As for Instance. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was to be received in one manner or other, but whether from the Bishop or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, that was the Rite. <hi>Lent</hi> was to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a certain space of Time, but whether One Day, or Two Days, or Three Days, that was the Rite thereof. So that Rites <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> necessary Concomitants of the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Divine Worship, Appendages to them; or, if you rather please, you may call them Circumstances themselves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:95309:176"/>
By Ceremonies, I mean such Actions as have no regard either to the Manner or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Divine Worship, but the Acts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be performed without them; as for instance, In some Churches they gave to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <note n="1" place="margin">Suscepti lactis &amp; mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis concordiam proegusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. <hi>Tertul. de Coron. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>when they were baptized, Milk and Hony.</hi> And, <note n="2" place="margin">Manibus ablutis—Orationem obire. <hi>Idem De Oratione,</hi> p. 659.</note> 
                        <hi>Before they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they washed their Hands.</hi> Now both these Actions I call Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, because they were not necessary to the Discharge of those Acts of Divine Worship, unto which they were affixed; but those Acts might be performed without them; as Baptism might be entirely administred without the Ceremony of giving Milk and Hony, and Prayers might be presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without washing of Hands.</p>
                     <p>Now having explained what I intend by those two Terms of Rites and Ceremonies, let us in the next place consider the Practice of the Primitive Church with reference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And first for Ceremonies.</p>

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95309:181"/>
old Customs of that Church, to which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, and not to bring in any Innovations or new Rites, because, as was said before, that would beget Tumults and Disorders, and the Persons so acting would be guilty of that Strife and Contention, which is condemned by those Words of the Holy Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. <hi>But if any Man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom; neither the Churches of God.</hi> Which is, as if the Apostle had said, If any Men, either to shew their Wit, or to head and strengthen a Party, will contradict what we have said, and affirm it to be decent and comely, either for Men to pray covered, or Women uncovered, This should silence such Contentious Opposers, that there is no such Rite or Custom in any of the Churches of God, but their Practice is the very same with what we have directed unto, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to that they ought peaceably and quietly to submit and yield.</p>

This Theme is too harsh and displeasing; if it is an unpleasant Work to rip up those uncharitable Actions, may they be buried in perpetual silence and oblivion, and never more be remembred, so as to stir up Anger and Revenge, but only so as they may produce in us all Humility, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and mutual Forgiveness; let us now with our Floods of Penitential Tears at once quench God's Anger for our past Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Flames of our present Fire and Heats, that so there may be no Fuel for future Contentions; and being grieved that we have played the Fool so long, we may now the more firmly resolve by the Grace of God to do so no more, that so however infamous we have been heretofore for our blind Zeal and unaccountable Animosities, we may for the time to come be highly renowned and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous for our ardent Love and fervent Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <note n="1" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 32, 33.</note>

Certain I am, we need no Arguments to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us hereunto; both the necessity and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of Love and Unity require it at our hands; its necessity is evident from hence, that whilst we spend our Zeal and Heat about these inconsiderable matters, the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Faith and Morals are attack'd and shaken, Atheism increases, Immorality pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, and those damnable Heresies, which for many Ages have been silenced and abandoned, are now revived by Men of a corrupt Faith, who take an occasion from the Lawlesness and Licentiousness of this present Age, to vent those cursed Tenents, which eradicate and destroy all Religion; it is to be feared, that unless we hasten to compose our Differences about the Skirts and Fringes of Religion, the very Vitals and Essentials thereof will be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded and devoured by Heresie and Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>And as for these and the like Reasons the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of an Union or Comprehension is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest on the one Hand, so the Facility of such an Union is as apparent on the other hand; for, thanks be to God, our differences are neither about Faith nor Manners; we all believe in one and the same God, hope to be saved by one and the same Redeemer, desire to be sanctified by one and the same Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, receive one and the same Scriptures, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the same Doctrins, and acknowledge the necessity of the same Duties: Our Disputes are only about lesser matters, about Modes and Forms, about Gestures and Postures, and such like inferiour matters, about which it
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95309:184"/>
should grieve a wise Man to quarrel, and which with the greatest ease in the World might be composed and setled, if managed by Men of Prudence and Moderation; and such Men, tis hoped, are the Reverend Bishops advanced by their Majesties, whose Promotion to those Places of Dignity and Trust many honest and peaceable Men look upon as a good Omen and Prognostick of our Future Union and happy Establishment.</p>
                     <p>With these two Considerations let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member those solemn Vows and Engagements which we made to Almighty God, and to one another in the day of our late Distress; how we then vow'd and promised, that if God would be pleased to deliver and rescue us, we would forget our Differences, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually condescend and abate of our Rigour and Severity: Wherefore now since God hath so wonderfully saved us, let us not be so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious and faithless, as to neglect to perform what we then obliged our selves unto; but let us willingly and conscientiously discharge it, lest God bring severer Judgments on us then ever, and at once utterly destroy us both Root and Branch, for our Lying, Perjury and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie.</p>
                     <p>Many other such cogent Arguments I might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> produce; but that I may avoid too great Prolixity and Tediousness, I shall urge but one more, which is, that unless we have an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting Spirit, and a peaceable Disposition, we are no true Christians, we unjustly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate that glorious Name; for the very Soul of Christianity is Love and Charity,
