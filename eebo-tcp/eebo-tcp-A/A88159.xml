            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>May it pleaſe your Excellency,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince your ſelf with your Councell of Officers in your reſpect to the welfare of this Commonwealth, were pleaſed to diſſolve the late Parliament, I have made many humble addreſſes to your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency for a Paſs to return to my native Country; having ſuffered extraordinary much under the late Parliaments ſentence of Baniſhment. But being informed that ſuch addreſſes are conceived only fit to be made to ſuch an authority as ſhal ſucceed the late Parliament in their Legiſlative Power: And my condition being ſuch, as could not admit of time to expect the iſſue of new addreſſes to be made to the ſucceeding Power, being in ſuch daily and hourly hazard of my life where I had my reſidence beyond the Seas; only becauſe I had faithfully ſerved the Commonwealth, that it concerned my life, either ſpeedily to reſolve upon a perpetual ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment into ſome foreign Country, where none ſhould know me; hoping there to live ſecurely in an utter obſcurity and uſeleſsneſs to my generation, and a burthen to others for my bread; or otherwiſe to run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of returning to <hi>England</hi> without a Paſs, or promiſe of protection.</p>
            <p>And my diſpoſition led me to chuſe the laſt, not without much wavering in my thoughts, in regard of ſome provocations which I believe I have even lately by Letters put particularly upon your Excellency: yet I hoped and believed that the harſheſt and moſt diſguſtfull paſſages in them might poſſibly be conſtrued to be the fruits of my higheſt paſſions, when my reaſon was clouded, not only by my ſad and moſt heavy ſufferings, but alſo by the miſapprehenſions of your Excellencies actions and intentions, which I could not have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of beyond the ſeas, but as others miſrepreſented them unto me; hereupon I hoped that God in his mercy to me, and my poor ruined Family, might incline your mind ſo to conceive of all former paſſages of whatſoever nature.</p>
            <p>And then finding that your Excellency with your Councel, had declared that you would take upon you the care and protection of all Engliſhmen living godly, quietly and peaceably untill the great truſt of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Nation be veſted in ſuch as are choſen for the ſame. And in the midſt of all theſe thoughts, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much upon my ſpirit that God by his providence would reſtore me to my native Country; and my heart being filled with a ſtrong faith in the goodneſs of God, and his protection in my endeavours therein. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I reſolved, come life, come death, to caſt my ſelf, my life, and all that's left me in this world beſides (under God) upon your Excellency, preſuming upon your protection, at leaſt untill thoſe that are choſen for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority be ſetled therein, and their anſwer be given to my humble addreſs. I confeſs I judged my ſelf an Engliſhman, and amongſt my Countrymen, capable of your Excellencies promiſed protection, being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely reſolved to live as quietly and ſubmiſſively to the preſent and ſucceeding Power as any man, having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſolutions, intentions, nor thoughts then to live godly and peaceably with my poor diſtreſſed Family; and to ſtudie to ſerve the Commonwealth, if thoſe truſted with the Government thereof, ſhould at any time conceive me fit for their Service; or otherwiſe to confine my ſelf to the moſt private life.</p>
            <p>This I deſired to make known unto your Excellency by my wife (the bearer hereof) and my true Friend Mr <hi>William Kiffin,</hi> the firſt hour of my return hither from <hi>Callis</hi> to <hi>London</hi> (in one day, in the privateſt manner I poſſible could) and they having waited for, or upon your Excellency ſeveral hours this morning; and your great Affairs preventing their audience, I preſumed thus to declare it in writing, leſt any miſconſtruction ſhould be made of my ſudden return: the true occaſions of it, and my ends and intention therein, being nakedly and <hi>bona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fide,</hi> herein fully declared, and only according to the integrity of my heart in theſe real expreſſions; I humbly hope for, and confide in your Excellencies goodneſs to protect,</p>
