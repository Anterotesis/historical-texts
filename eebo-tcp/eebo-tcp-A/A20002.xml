            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

On the South-weſt part thereof is that faire, and goodly Fort, ſo much renowned, both for the pleaſant ſituation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſtrength, knowne by the name of <hi>Knareſborow Caſtle,</hi> ſeated on a moſt ragged and rough Rock; whence (as learned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Camden</hi> ſaith) it is ſo named.</p>
               <p>Both the Caſtle and Towne are fenced on the South and Weſt parts with the Riuer <hi>Nid:</hi> which is beautified here with two faire Bridges of ſtone, which lead from the Towne into the Foreſt adioyning, as alſo vnto a large em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paled Park of his Maieſties, called <hi>Bilton parke,</hi> well ſtored

with fallow Deere: part whereof is bordered with the ſaid riuer.</p>
               <p>The Towne it ſelfe ſtandeth on a hill, hauing almoſt on euery ſide an aſcent to it; and about it are diuers fruitfull valleyes well repleniſhed with graſſe, corne, and wood. The waters there are wholeſome and cleare; the ayre dry and pure. In briefe, there is nothing wanting, that may fitly ſerue for a good and commodious habitation, and the content and entertainment of ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>Many things are very obſeruable in this place, which becauſe they rather do appertaine to the volumes of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, &amp; Antiquaries, then to the purpoſe intended in this little treatiſe, are here omitted.</p>

               <p>AS generally moſt parts of the Weſt Riding of <hi>Yorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> (eſpecially the hilly and more mountaineous places thereof) are ſtored with fountaines and ſprings of cleare, limpide, and pure ſimple waters; ſo likewiſe the territorie here abouts is not without plenty of them.

               </p>
               <p>Theſe, formerly for a yeere, or two, haue beene in great requeſt in theſe parts amongſt the common ſort, much ſought vnto by many, and great concourſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple haue daily gathered and flocked to them both neare, and a farre off, as is moſt commonly ſeene, when any new thing is firſt found out. <hi>Fama enim creſcit eundo,</hi> euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to incredible wonders and miracles, or rather fictions, and lyes.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13823:5"/>
to make them become medicinable, it is verily thought, that the many &amp; ſeuerall cures, which haue bin attributed vnto them in thoſe times, when they were ſo frequented, were rather fained, and imaginary, then true, and reall; and that thoſe, who then viſited them, were deſirous (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vphold, and maintaine the credit, and reputation of their Saints, or elſe, to auoyd the ſcorne and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their owne deluſion) to haue others likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>

               <p>The firſt is the <hi>Dropping-well,</hi> knowne almoſt to all, who haue trauelled vnto this place. The water whereof diſtilleth and trickleth downe from the hanging Rocke ouer it, not onely dropping wiſe, but alſo falling in many pretty little ſtreames.</p>
               <p>This water iſſueth at firſt out of the earth, not farre from the ſaid hanging rocke, and running a while in one entire current, continueth ſo, till it commeth almoſt to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13823:6"/>
the brim of the cragg; where being oppoſed by a damme (as it were artificiall) of certaine ſpongy ſtones, is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diuided into many ſmaller branches, and falleth from on high in manner aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>It is therefore very likely, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Camden</hi> in perſon did not ſee this Fountaine, but rather that hee had it by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from others; or at leaſt wiſe (if he did ſee it) that hee did not marke, and duly obſerue the originall ſpringing vp of the water, when in his <hi>Britannia</hi> he ſaith thus: <hi>The waters thereof ſpring not vp out of the veines of the earth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Concerning the properties and qualities thereof, I haue nothing more to write at this time (there being formerly little tryall had of it) ſauing that diuers inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts ſay, and affirme, that it hath beene found to bee very effectuall in ſtaying any flux of the body: which thing I eaſily beleeue.</p>
               <p>The other three are ſulphureous fountaines, and caſt forth a ſtinking ſmell a farre off, eſpecially in the winter ſeaſon, and when the weather is coldeſt. They are all noyſome to ſmell to, and cold to touch, without any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, or actuall heat at all; by reaſon (as may moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be thought) their mynes, and veines of brimſtone, are not kindled vnder the earth; being (perhaps) hindred by the mixture of ſalt therewith.</p>
               <p>Thoſe, who drinke of their waters, relate, they verily thinke there is gunpowder in them, and that now and then they vomit after drinking thereof.</p>
               <p>The waters, as they runne along the earth, doe leaue behind them on the graſſe and leaues a gray ſlimy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; which being ſet on fire, hath the right ſauour of common brimſtone. They are much haunted with Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, an argument of much ſalt in them; of which in the euaporation of the water by fire, wee found a good quantity remaining in the bottome of the veſſell.</p>
               <p>One thing further was worth obſeruation; that white mettall (as ſiluer) dipped into them, preſently ſeemeth to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13823:6"/>
reſemble copper: which we firſt noted by putting a ſiluer porrenger into one of theſe; vnto which Sir <hi>Francis Trapps</hi> did firſt bring vs. Which tincture theſe waters giue by reaſon of their ſulphur.</p>
               <p>Touching their vertues, and effects, there may in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall the like properties be aſcribed vnto them, as are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto other ſulphureous Bathes actually cold, participating alſo of ſalt.</p>
               <p>The vulgar ſort drinke theſe waters (as they ſay) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell reefe, and fellon; yea, many, who are much troubled with itches, ſcabs, morphewes, tetters, ring-wormes, and the like, are ſoone holpen, and cured by waſhing the parts ill affected therewith. Which thing they might much more conueniently, and more commodiouſly doe, if at that in <hi>Bilton</hi> parke were framed 2 capacious Bathes, the one cold, the other to be made hot, or warme, by art, for certaine knowne howers a day.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the difference of this Fountaine from thoſe at the <hi>Spaw,</hi> to wit, <hi>Sauuenir,</hi> and <hi>Pouhon.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis ſpringeth almoſt at the top of the aſcent (as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hath beene ſaid) from a dry, and ſomewhat ſandy earth: The water where of running South-Eaſt, is very cleare, pure, full of life, and minerall exhalations.</p>
               <p>We find it chiefly to conſiſt of a vitrioline nature and quality, with a participation alſo of thoſe other minerals, which are ſaid to be in the <hi>Sauuenir</hi> fountaine; but in a more perfect, and exquiſite mixture and temper (as wee deeme) and therefore to be ſuppoſed better and nobler, then it. The difference betweene them will be found to be onely <hi>Secundum maius &amp; minus,</hi> that is, according to more, or leſſe, which maketh no difference in kind, but in degrees. This partaketh in greater meaſure of the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and leſſer of the ſubſtances of the minerals, then that doth; and for that cauſe it is of a more quicke and ſpeedy operation; as alſo for the ſame reaſon, his tenuity of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and fulneſſe of minerall ſpirits therein contained, it cannot be ſo farre tranſported from its owne ſource, and ſpring, without loſſe, and diminution of his ſtrength, and goodneſſe. For being caried no further, then to the towne it ſelfe (though the glaſſe or veſſell be cloſely ſtopt) it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth ſomewhat weaker: if as farre as to <hi>Yorke,</hi> much more: but if 20 or 30 miles further, it will then bee found to be of ſmall force, or validity, as we haue often obſerued.</p>
               <p>Whereas contrariwiſe the water of the lower fountain at the <hi>Spaw,</hi> called <hi>Pouhon,</hi> is frequently and vſually caried and conueyed into other Countries farre off, and remote, as into <hi>France, England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> diuers parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>Italy;</hi> yea, and that of <hi>Sauue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nir,</hi> (which is the better fountaine, and whoſe water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13823:8"/>
be caried ſo farre away, as the other may) is oftentimes vſed now adayes at <hi>Paris,</hi> the chiefe City of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this of ours cannot be ſent away any whit ſo farre off without loſſe and decay of his efficacy, and vertue: ſo ayrie, ſubtill, and piercing are its ſpirits, and minerall exhalations, that they ſoone paſſe, vaniſh, and flye away. Which thing wee haue eſteemed to be a principall good ſigne of the worthy properties of this rare Fountaine. So that this water, being newly taken vp at the Well, and preſently after drunke, cannot otherwiſe, but ſooner paſſe by the Hypochondries, and through the body, and cauſe a ſpeedier effect, then thoſe in <hi>Germany</hi> can. Whereby any one may eaſily collect, and gather, that this getteth his ſoueraign faculties better in its paſſage by and through the variety of minerals, included in the earth (which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afford vnto it an halitious body) then thoſe doe.</p>
               <p>If then wee bee deſirous to haue this of ours become commodious either for preſeruing of our healths, or for altering any diſtemper, or curing any infirmity (for which it is proper and auaileable) it ought chiefly to bee taken at the fountaine it ſelfe, before the minerall ſpirits bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated.</p>

               <p>That <hi>Vitriolum</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Chalcanthum)</hi> is here moſt predominant, there needs no other proofe, then from the aſſay of the water it ſelfe; which both in the tart and inky ſmack thereof, ioyned with a piercing and a pricking quality, and in the ſauour (which is ſomewhat a little vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioline,) is altogether like vnto the ancient <hi>Spaw</hi> waters: which according to the conſent of all thoſe, who haue conſidered their naturall compoſitions, doe moſt of all, and chiefly participate of vitrioll.</p>

               <p>This demonſtration hath beene often made, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the admiration of thoſe, who firſt did ſee it. For the ſame quantity of galles mingled with ſo much common water, or any other fountaine water thereabouts, will not alter it any thing at all; vnleſſe to theſe you alſo adde Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioll, and then the colour will appeare to be of a blewiſh violet, ſomewhat inkiſh, not reddiſh, as in the former, which hath an exquiſite and accurate coniunction of other minerall exhalations, beſides the vitrioline.

               <p>THe qualities of Vitrioll, according to <hi>Dioſcorides, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Aetius, Paulus Aegineta,</hi> and <hi>Oribaſius,</hi> are to heate and dry, to bind, to reſiſt putrefaction, to giue ſtrength and vigour to the interiour parts, to kill the flat wormes of the belly, to remedy venemous muſhromes, to preſerue fleſh ouer moyſt from corruption, conſuming the moyſture thereof by its heat, and conſtipating by his aſtriction the ſubſtance of it, and preſſing forth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous humidity.</p>

               <p>Neither will I further trouble the Reader with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall of diuers and ſundry excellent remedies, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, found out and made of it in theſe latter times, by the Spagyricke Phyſitians, and others: In ſo much that <hi>Ioſeph Quercetanus,</hi> one of thoſe, is verily of opinion, that out of this one indiuiduall minerall, well and exquiſitely prepared, there might be made all manner of remedies and medicines ſufficient for the ſtoring and furniſhing of a whole Apothecaries ſhop.</p>
               <p>But it will (perhaps) be obiected by ſome one or other in this manner: If vitrioll, which as moſt doe hold, is hote and dry in the third degree, or beginning of the fourth, nay, of a cauſticke quality, and nature (as <hi>Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:13823:10"/>
is of opinion) ſhould here be predominant, then the water of this fountaine muſt needs bee of great heat and acrimony; and ſo become not onely vnprofitable, but alſo very hurtfull for mans vſe to be drunke, or inwardly taken.</p>
               <p>To which obiection (not to take any aduantage of the anſwer, which many learned Phyſitians doe giue, <hi>viz.</hi> that vitrioll is not hot, but cold) I ſay: Firſt, that although all medicinall waters doe participate of thoſe mineralls, by which they doe paſſe, yet they haue them but weakly <hi>(viribus refractis)</hi> eſpecially when in their paſſages they touch, and meet with diuers other minerals of oppoſite tempers and natures.</p>
               <p>Secondly I anſwer, that in all ſuch medicinall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, as this, ſimple water doth farre ſurpaſſe and exceed in quantity, whatſoeuer is therewith intermixed; by whoſe coldneſſe it commeth to paſſe, that the contrary is ſcarce, or hardly perceiued. For example, take one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of any boyling liquor to 100. or more, of the ſame cold, and you will hardly find in it any heat at all. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then vitrioll to be hot in the third degree, it doth not therefore follow, that the water, which hath his vertue chiefly from it, ſhould heat in the ſame degree. This is plainly manifeſt not onely in this fountaine, but alſo in all others, which haue an acide taſte, being indeed rather cold, then hot, for the reaſons aboue mentioned.</p>

               <p>More particularly, the water of this fountaine hath an inciſiue and abſterſiue faculty to cut, and looſen the viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous and clammy humours of the body, and to make me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the groſſe: as alſo by its piercing and penetrating power, ſubtilty of parts, and by his deterging and deſicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue qualities to open all the obſtructions, or oppilations of the meſentery (from whence the ſeeds of moſt diſeaſes doe ariſe and ſpring) liuer, ſplen, kidneis, and other inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour parts, and (which is more to be noted and obſerued) to coole, and contemperate their vnnaturall heat, helping, and remouing alſo all the griefes and infirmities depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereupon.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, it comforteth the ſtomacke by the aſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it hath from other minerals, eſpecially iron, ſo that (without doubt) of a thouſand, who ſhall vſe it diſcreetly and with good aduice (their bodies firſt being well and orderly prepared by ſome learned and skilfull Phyſitian, according to the ſtates thereof, and as their infirmities

               <p>Moreouer, it clenſeth, and purifieth the whole maſſe of blood contained in the veynes, by purging it from the ſereſity peccant, and from cholericke, phlegmaticke, and melancholike humours; and that principally by vrine, which paſſeth through the body very cleare, and in great quantity, leauing behind it the minerall forces, and vertues.</p>
               <p>Their ſtooles, who drinke of it, are commonly of a blackiſh, or darke greene colour, partly becauſe it empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the liuer and ſplen from aduſt humours, and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, or the ſediment of blood; but more eſpecially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the mineralls intermixed doe produce and giue ſuch a tincture.</p>

But, if the affect or griefe be in the matrix or womb, then it clenſeth that way according to the accuſtomed and vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner of women.</p>
               <p>In melancholicke people it purgeth by prouoking the haemorrhoides, and in cholericke by ſiege, or ſtoole. If it cauſeth either vomit or ſweat, it is very ſeldome and rare.</p>
               <p>See here a moſt admirable worke guided by the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency

and wiſedome of the Almighty, that a naturall, cleare, and pure water, ſhould produce ſo many and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall effects and operations, being all of them in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner contrary one to another, which few medicines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by art can eaſily performe without hurt and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the party. Wherefore being drunke with thoſe cautions and circumſtances neceſſarily required thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it is to be preferred before many other remedies, as not onely procuring theſe euacuations; but alſo (which is more to be noted) ſtaying them, when they grow to any exceſſe. For ſeeing that here are minerals contained both hot, cold, dry, aperitiue, aſtringent, &amp;c. there is none ſo ſimple but muſt needs thinke and grant, that it cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe bee but good and wholeſome in grieuances, and diſeaſes, which in their owne natures are oppoſite.</p>
               <p>But I may inſtance in ſome few, for which it is good and profitable, and therein obſerue ſome order and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode; It dryeth the ouer moiſt braine, and helpeth the euils proceeding therefrom, as rhumes, catarrhs, palſies, cramps, &amp;c.</p>

It cooleth the kidneyes or reynes, and driueth forth ſand, grauell, and ſtones out of them, and alſo hindreth the encreaſe or breeding of any new, by the concretion, and ſaudering of grauell, bred of a viſcous and clammy humour, or ſubſtance. The ſame it performeth to the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for which it is alſo very beneficiall, if it chance to haue any euill diſpoſition either in the cauity thereof, or in the necke of it, and ſhutting muſcle called <hi>Sphincter,</hi> whereby the whole part, or member is let and hindred in his office and function.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if there chance to be any vlcer in the parts laſt ſpecified, or any ſore, or fiſtula in <hi>perinaeo</hi> through an impoſtume ill cured, this water is a good remedy for it, in regard of its clenſing, cicatrizing and conſtringing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and vertue; and for that cauſe it is very proper and commodious for the acrimony and ſharpneſſe of vrine, and againſt the ſtopping and ſuppreſſion of vrine, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of making water, and the ſtrangury.</p>
               <p>Although it is very auaileable againſt the ſtone in the kidneyes, and againſt the breeding, and increaſe of any new there; yea, and againſt little ones, that are looſe in the bladder; yet notwithſtanding it will afford little or ſmall benefit to thoſe, in whom it is growne to bee very great and big in the bladder: Becauſe nothing will then ſerue to breake it, as <hi>Braſſauolus</hi> ſaith, but a Smiths an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile and hammar.

The vſe whereof, after the aduice and councell had of the learned Phyſitian, for the well and orderly preparing their bodies, is ſingular good againſt the greene ſickneſſe, and alſo very commodious and behoouefull to procure their monthly euacuations, as alſo to ſtay their ouer much flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as well to correct, as to ſtay their white floods; as well to dry the wombe being too moiſt, as to heat it being too cold, through which cauſes and diſtempers concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (for the moſt part) is let and hindered in cold Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne Countries, as <hi>England,</hi> and the like.

               <p>This hath beene ſo much, and ſo often obſerued at the ancient <hi>Spaw,</hi> that it cannot otherwiſe, but bee alſo veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at this in after times, when it ſhall bee frequented (as thoſe haue beene) with the company of Ladyes, and Gentlewomen: Diuers whereof, hauing beene formerly barren for the ſpace of ten, twelue yeares, or moe, and drinking of thoſe waters for curing and helping ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infirmities, then for want of fruitfulneſſe, haue ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceiued after their returne home to their husbands, beyond their hopes and expectations.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, it is good for thoſe women, who, though otherwiſe apt enough to conceiue, yet by reaſon of the too much lubricity of their wombes, are prone to miſcarry and abort, if before conception they ſhall vſe it with thoſe cautions and directions requiſite.</p>

Therefore to know th'originall mineralls, faculties, and vertues of this worthy acide fountaine, will bee to no end, or to ſmall purpoſe for them, who vnderſtand not the right and true vſe, nor the fit and orderly adminiſtration of it. For not only Phyſicke or medicines, but alſo meats, and drinks taken diſorderly, out of due time and without meaſure, bringeth oftentimes detriment to the partie; who otherwiſe might receiue comfort and ſtrength ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: So likewiſe this water, if it be not drunke at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient time and ſeaſon, in due faſhion and proportion, yea, and that after preparatiues and requiſite purging and euacuation of the body, may eaſily <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines ought not to be taken raſhly, and vnaduiſedly, as moſt doe hand ouer head without any conſideration of time, place, and other circumſtances; as that ignorant man did, who getting the recipt of that medicine, wherewith formerly he had been cured, made triall of it againe long after for the ſame infirmity without any helpe or good at all; whereat greatly maruailing, receiued this anſwer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Phyſitian: I confeſſe (ſaid hee) it was the ſelfe ſame medicine, but becauſe I did not giue it, therefore it did you no good.</p>
               <p>To the end therefore, that no occaſion may hereafter be either giuen, or taken by the miſgouernement, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſhneſſe of any in vſing it to calumniate and traduce the worth, and goodneſſe of this fountaine, I will briefly here ſh<gap reason="illegible: damage" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt then, becauſe very few men are throughly and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently informed concerning the natures, and cauſes of their grieuances, it will be neceſſary that euery one ſhold apply himſelfe to ſome one, or other, who either out of his iudgement, or experience, or both, may truely be able to giue him counſell and good aduice concerning the conueniency of this fountaine.

After that, it will be conuenient to prepare the body by ſome Iulep or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pozeme, or to giue ſome lenitiue medicine to free the firſt region of the body from excrements. For otherwiſe the water might peraduenture conuey ſome part of them, or other pecca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t matter, which it findeth in his paſſage either into the bladder, or to ſome other weake, and infirme member of the body, to the increaſe of that euill diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is to be remoued, or elſe to the breeding of ſome other new infirmity.</p>

                  <note place="margin">2.</note> Secondly I anſwer; Although this obſeruation of the dog-dayes might perhaps be of ſome moment in hotter countries, as <hi>Greece,</hi> where <hi>Hippocrates</hi> liued, who firſt made mention of thoſe daies: Yet in colder climates, as <hi>England,</hi> and ſuch like Countries, they are of little or ſmall force at all, and almoſt not to be regarded any whit, either in vſing mild &amp; temperate purgatiues, or almoſt in any other; or in blood-letting: though very many, or moſt doe erroniouſly ſay and thinke the contrary. So that (if there be cauſe) they may as well and ſafely then purge, as at any other time: Or, if occaſion ſhall vrge, as in pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall bodies, and many other caſes, a veine may ſafely (or rather moſt commodiouſly) be then opened, and ſo much blood taken away, as the skilfull Phyſitian ſhall thinke in his diſcretion and wiſdome to be needfull and requiſite.</p>
               <p>Let no man here think, that this is any ſtrange poſition, or a new paradoxe (for the learned know the contrary) or that I am ſtudious of innouation, but rather deſirous to roote out an old and inueterate errour, which in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie hath coſt moe Engliſh mens liues, then would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a royall army, in neglecting thoſe two greater helpes or remedies, to wit, Purging, and Blood-letting in hot ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the yeare; which in all likelihood might haue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many of their liues, while expecting more temperate weather, they haue beene ſummoned in the meane time, or <hi>interim,</hi> by the meſſenger of pale death to appeare in an other world.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let all thoſe who are yet liuing, bee admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed hereafter by their examples, not obſtinately and wilfully to eſchue and ſhunne theſe two remedies in hot

ſeaſons, and in the time of the Dog-dayes, (much leſſe all other manner of phyſicall helpes) not once knowing ſo much as why, or wherefore, and without any reaſon at all, following blind and ſuperſtitious tradition, and error, haply firſt broched by ſome vnworthy and ignorant Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, not rightly vnderſtanding <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his ſaying in all likelyhood, or at leaſt wiſe miſapplying it. Which hath ſo preuailed in theſe times, that it hath not onely worne out the vſe of purging, but alſo of all other phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke for that ſeaſon, becauſe moſt people by the name of phyſicke vnderſtanding purging onely, and nothing elſe. As though the art and ſcience of Phyſicke was nothing elſe, but to giue a potion or purge. Then we rightly and truly might ſay, <hi>Filia deuorauit matrem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for as much as moſt people are altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the true ground or reaſon, from whence this ſo dangerous an error concerning the Dog-dayes did firſt ſpring and ariſe, giue me leaue a little to goe on with this my digreſſion, for their better inſtruction, and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and I will briefly, and in few lines ſhew the caſe, and the miſtake ſomewhat more plainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his fourth booke of Aphoriſmes, the fift, hath theſe words: <hi>Sub canicula, &amp; ante caniculam difficiles ſunt purgationes.</hi> That is, vnder the canicular, or dog-ſtar, and before the dog-ſtar, purgations are painfull and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill. This is all that is there ſaid of them, or brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them for that ſeaſon, or time of the yeare. A great ſtumbling-blocke, againſt which many haue daſhed their feet, and knockt their ſhinnes, and a fearfull ſcar-crow, whereat too many haue nicely boggled. Here you doe not find or ſee purging medicines to bee then prohibited, or forbidden to be giuen at all (much leſſe all other phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke) but onely ſaid to be difficill in their working: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe (as all expoſitors agree) nature is then ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what enfeebled by the great heat of the weather; partly becauſe the humours being then, as it were, accended, are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13823:15"/>
more chaffed by the heat of the purging medicines; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and laſtly, becauſe two contrary motions ſeeme then to be at one and the ſame time, which may offend nature; as the great heat of the weather leading the humours of the body outwardly to the circumference thereof, and the medicine drawing them inwardly to the center. All which circumſtances in our cold region are little, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all (as formerly hath beene mentioned) to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. For as <hi>Iacobus Hollerius,</hi> a French Phyſitian, much honoured for his great learning and iudgement, hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well obſerued in his Comment vpon this Aphoriſme; <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaketh here onely of thoſe purging medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which are ſtrong, and vehement, or hot and fiery; and that this precept is to take place in moſt hot Regions, but not in theſe cold Countries, as <hi>France, England,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>Ouer and beſide all this, thoſe churliſh hot purging medicines, which were then in frequent vſe in <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> his time, and ſome hundred of yeares after, are now for moſt part obſolete, and quite growne out of vſe, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome brought in practice by Phyſitians in theſe dayes; becauſe we haue within theſe laſt ſix hundred yeares great choice and variety of more mild, benigne, and gentle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues found out by the Arabian Phyſitians, which were altogether vnknowne vnto the ancients, to wit, <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Dioſcorides, Galen,</hi> &amp;c. which haue little heat, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony, many wherof are temperate, and diuers cooling, which may moſt ſafely be giuen either in the hotteſt times and ſeaſons of the yeare, or in the hotteſt diſeaſes. Let vs adde to theſe the like familiar and gentle purging medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines more lately, yea, almoſt daily newly found out ſince the better diſcoueries of the Eaſt and Weſt Indies. So that henceforth let no man feare to take either eaſie purgatiues, or other inward Phyſicke, in the time of the canicular, or dog-dayes.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Hollerius</hi> goeth on in the expoſition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13823:16"/>
of the ſaid Aphoriſme, and confidently ſaith: <hi>Ouer &amp; beſides that we haue benigne medicines, which we may then vſe, as Caſſia,</hi> &amp;c. Wee know and finde by experience no time here with vs more wholſome and more temperat (eſpecially when the Eteſian, or Eaſterly winds do blow) then the Canicular dayes: ſo that, wee finde by obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that thoſe diſeaſes which are bred in the moneths of Iune and Iuly, doe end in Auguſt, and in the Canicular dayes. Wherefore, if a diſeaſe happen in thoſe dayes, we feare not to open a veyne diuers times, and often, as alſo to preſcribe more ſtrong purging medicines.</p>
               <p>Wherefore away henceforth with the ſcrupulous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and too nice feare of the Dogge-dayes, and let their ſuppoſed danger be had no more in remembrance among vs. And if any will yet remaine obſtinate, and ſtill refuſe to haue their beames pulled out of their eyes, let them ſtill be blinde in the middeſt of the cleare Sun-ſhine, and groape on after darknes: and let all learned Phyſitians rather pitty their follies, then enuy their wits.</p>

               <head type="sub">At what time of the yeare, and at what houre of the day it is moſt fit and meet to drinke this water.</head>
               <p>TO ſpeake in generall tearmes, it is a fit time to drinke it, when the ayre is pure, cleare, hot and dry: for then the water is more tart, and more eaſily digeſted, then at other times. On the contrary, it is beſt to forbeare, when the ayre is cold, moiſt, darke, dull and miſty: for then it is more feeble, and harder to be concocted.</p>
               <p>But more ſpecially, the moſt proper ſeaſon to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this our Engliſh Spaw dyet, will be from the middeſt or latter end of Iune to the middle of September, or lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, according as the ſeaſon of the yeare ſhall fall out to be hot and dry, or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:13823:16"/>
Not that in the Spring time, and in Winter it is not alſo good, but for that the ayre being more pure in Sommer, the water alſo muſt needs be of greater force and power. Notwithſtanding it may ſometime ſo happen in Sommer, that by reaſon of ſome extraordinary falling of raine, there may be a ceſſation from it for a day or two. Or if it chance to haue rained ouer night, it will then be fit and neceſſary to refraine from drinking of it, vntill the raine bee paſſed away againe: or elſe (which I like better) the fountaine laded dry, and filled againe, which may well be done in an hower, or two at moſt.</p>
               <p>Touching the time of the day, when it is beſt to drinke this water, queſtionleſſe the moſt conuenient hower will be in the morning, when the party is empty, and faſting, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeauen aclocke: Nature hauing firſt diſcharged her ſelfe of daily excrements both by ſtoole and vrine, and the concoctions perfected. This time is likewiſe fitteſt for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, which is a great good help, and furtherance for the better diſtribution of the water, whereby it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce its effects more ſpeedily.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the manner of drinking this water, and the quantitie thereof.</head>
               <p>THoſe who deſire the benefit of this Fountaine, ought to goe to it ſome what early in the morning, &amp;, if they be able and ſtrong of body, they may doe very well to walke to it on foot, or at leaſt wiſe ſome part of the way. Such, as haue weake and feeble leggs may ride on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, or be caryed in coaches, or borne in chaires. As for thoſe, whoſe infirmities cauſe them to keepe their beds, or chambers, they may drinke the water in their lodgings, it being ſpeedily brought to them in a veſſell or glaſſe well ſtopt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:13823:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It is not my meaning or purpoſe to deſcribe here parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, what quantitie of it is fit and meet for euery one to drinke: for this is part of the taske and office, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Phyſitian, who ſhall be of counſell with the Patient in preparing and well ordering of him: who is to conſider all the ſeuerall circumſtances, as well of the mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die or diſeaſe it ſelfe, as of his habite and conſtitution, &amp;c. Neuertheleſſe I may aduiſe, that at the firſt it be moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, increaſing the quantitie daily by degrees, vntill they ſhall come at laſt to the full height of the proportion appointed, and thought to be meet and neceſſary. There they are then to ſtay, and ſo to continue at that quantitie, ſo long as it ſhall be needfull. For example, the firſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning may happely be 16 or 18 ounces, and ſo on by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to 20. 30. 40. 50. 60. or moe, in people, who are of good and ſtrong conſtitutions. Towards the ending, the abatement ought likewiſe to be made by degrees, as the increment was formerly made by little and little.</p>
               <p>Here by the way every one muſt be admoniſhed to take notice, that it is not alwayes beſt to drinke moſt, leſt they chance to oppreſſe and ouercharge Nature, that would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be content with leſſe. It will therefore be more ſafe, to take it rather ſomewhat ſparingly, though for a longer time, then liberally and for a ſhort time. But, indeed, the trueſt and iuſteſt proportion of it, is euer to be made and eſteemed, by the good and laudable concoction of it, and by the due and orderly voiding of it againe.</p>
               <p>It will not be here amiſſe to adde this one obſeruation further: That it is better to drinke this water once a day, then twice, and that in the mornings, after that the Sunne hath dryed vp &amp; conſumed the vapors retained through the coldneſſe of the night, &amp;c. as is formerly declared. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter drinking it, it will be needfull to abſtaine from meat &amp; other drinke for the ſpace of three or foure dayes.</p>
               <p>But if any one, who hath a good ſtomacke, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to take it twice a day; or if any ſhall bee neceſſarily
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13823:17"/>
compelled ſo to doe for ſome vrgent cauſe, by the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of his Phyſitian, let him dine ſomewhat ſparingly, and drinke it not againe, vntill fiue houres after dinner be paſt, or not vntill the concoction of meat and drinke in the ſtomacke be perfected: Obſeruing likewiſe, that hee content himſelfe in the afternoones with almoſt halfe the quantity he vſeth to take in the mornings.</p>

               <p>THe regiment of life in meats and drinks, ought chiefly to conſiſt in the right and moderate vſe of thoſe, which are of light and eaſie digeſtion, and of good and wholeſome nouriſhment, breeding laudable iuice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all thoſe are to be auoyded, which beget crude and ill humours. There ought furthermore ſpeciall notice to be taken, that great diuerſity of meats and diſhes at one meale is very hurtfull, as alſo much condiments, ſauces, ſpice, fat, &amp;c. in their dreſſing and cookery.</p>
               <p>I commend hens, capons, pullets, chickens, partridge, pheſants, turkies, and generally all ſuch ſmall birds, as liue in woods, hedges, and mountaines. Likewiſe I doe approue of veale, mutton, kid, lambe, rabbets young hare or leuerits, &amp;c. All which (for the moſt part) are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be roaſted then boyled. Neuertheleſſe thoſe, who are affected with any dry diſtemper, or thoſe, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are ſo accuſtomed to feed, may haue their meats ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; but the plainer dreſſing, the better.</p>
               <p>I diſcommend all ſalt meats, beefe, bacon, porke, larde, and larded meats, hare, veniſon, tripes, and the entrailes of beaſts, puddings made with blood, pig, gooſe, ſwan, teale, mallard, and ſuch like; and in generall all water-Fowle,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13823:18"/>
as being of hard digeſtion and ill nutriment.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the ſeuerall kinds of fiſhes, trouts, pearches, loaches, and for moſt part, all ſcaly fiſh of brookes, and freſh riuers may well bee permitted. Moreouer ſmelts, ſoales, dabs, whitings, ſturbuts, gurnets, and all ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as are well knowne not to be ill, or vnwholeſome to feed on. All which may be altered with mint, hyſſope, aniſe, &amp;c. Alſo cre-fiſhes, crab-fiſh, lobſters, and the like, may bee permitted.</p>
               <p>Cunger, ſalmon, eeles, lampries, herrings, ſalt-ling, all ſalt-fiſh, ſturgion, anchouies, oyſters, cockles, muſcles, and the like ſhell-fiſh are to be diſallowed.</p>
               <p>White-meats, as milke, cruds, creame, old cheeſe, cuſtards, white-pots, pudding-pyes, and other like milke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats, (except ſweet butter, and new creame cheeſe) are to be forbidden. Soft and reer egges we doe not prohibit.</p>
               <p>Raiſons with almonds, bisket-bread, marchpane-ſtuffe, ſuckets, and the like, are not here forbidden to be eaten.</p>
               <p>Let their bread be made of wheat, very well wrought, fermented or leauened; and let their drinke be beere well boyled and brewed; and let it bee ſtale, or old enough, but in no wiſe tart, ſharp, or ſower: And aboue all let them forbeare to mixe the water of the fountaine with their drinke at meales; for that may cauſe many inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences to follow, and enſue.</p>
               <p>Let me aduiſe them to eſchew apples, peares, plumbs, codlings, gooſeberries, and all ſuch like ſommer fruits, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raw, in tarts, or otherwiſe: Alſo peaſe, and all other pulſe; all cold ſallets, and raw hearbs; onions, leekes, chiues, cabbage or coleworts, pompons, cucumbers, and the like.</p>
               <p>In ſtead of cheeſe at the end of meales, it will not bee amiſſe to eate citron, or lemon pils condited, or elſe fenell, aniſe, coriander comfits, or biskets and carawayes, as well for to diſcuſſe and expell wind, as to ſhut and cloſe the ſtomacke, for the better furthering the digeſtion of meats,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13823:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and drinkes. And for that purpoſe, it would bee much better, if the Phyſitian, who is of counſell, ſhould appoint and ordaine ſome fit and proper Tragea in groſſe powder mixed with ſugar, or elſe made into little cakes or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. Likewiſe marmalade of quinces, either ſimple or compound, (ſuch as the Phyſitians do often preſcribe to their patients) may be vſed very commodiouſly.</p>
               <p>After dinner they ought to vſe no violent exerciſe, neither ought they to ſit ſtill, ſadly, heauy, and muſing, nor to ſlumber, and ſleepe; but rather to ſtirre a little, and to raiſe vp the ſpirits for an houre or two, by ſome fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.

               <p>ALthough thoſe who are of good and ſtrong conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, obſeruing the aforenamed direction, doe ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or neuer receiue any hurme, or detriment by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this water: notwithſtanding it may ſometime ſo fall forth, that ſome of the weaker ſort may perhaps obſerue ſome little, or ſmall inconuenience thereby, as retention of it in the body: inflation of the bellie: coſtiueneſſe, and the like. Wherefore to gratifie thoſe, a word two of euery one ſhall ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, for to cauſe a more ready and ſpeedy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of it by vrine, it will not be amiſſe to counſel the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie after his returne to his lodging to goe to his naked bed for an houre or two, that thereby warmneſſe, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heat may be brought into each part of the body, the paſſages more opened, and nature by that meanes made more fit and apt for the expulſion of it. During which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13823:19"/>
time it will be very requiſite to apply hot cloathes to the ſtomack: but not ſo as to prouoke ſweat. Or elſe, to cauſe it to voyd and evacuate either by vrine, ſtoole, or ſweat, exerciſe will be a good helpe and furtherance; if the party be fit for it. But if neither of theſe will preuaile, then a ſharpe glyſter ought to be adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>The inflation or ſwelling of the belly hapneth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to thoſe, who haue feeble and weake ſtomacks; who may do very wel to eate aniſe, fenell, or coriander comfits at the fountaine betweene euery draught, and to walke a little after; or elſe ſome carminatiue Lozenges, made with groſſepowders, ſpices and ſeeds for breaking of wind: or what other thing the learned Phyſitian ſhall deeme to be moſt fit and proper in his wiſdome, and iudgment. But if the inflation chance to be very great, then a carminatine glyſter muſt be ordained.</p>
               <p>Such as ſhall be very coſtiue may doe well to eat moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning meats, and to vſe mollifying hearbes, raiſons ſtoned, corants, damaſcene prunes, butter, or the yolkes of egges, and the like in their broths, or pottage. If theſe will not be ſufficient, then let a day be ſpared from drinking the water, and let the party take ſome lenitiue medicine, as laxatiue corants, or ſome ſuch like thing; whereof the Phyſitian hath euer great choice and variety, wherewith he can fit directly euery one his caſe; to whom preſent recourſe euer ought to be had, when any of theſe, or the like accidents doe happen, as likewiſe in all other caſes of waight and moment.</p>
