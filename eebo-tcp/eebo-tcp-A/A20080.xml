         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If (as thou canst not choose) thou art glad thou art out of this Tempest, haue a care to man thy Ship well, and doe not ouer-lade it with bad merchandize (foule Sins) when thou art bound for this place: for all the danger will be at thy putting in. The Rockes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section lye hid in our deepe Seas, and therefore it behoues thy soule to take heed what sayles she hoyses, and thy body, what Pylote it carries aboord.

Reignes together of two most excellent Princes, &amp; now at the beginning of a third (as excellent as they) we haue liued in all fulnesse: yet at the end of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> foure and forty yeeres, when she dyed, she went not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but had in a traine which followed her, in a dead <note place="margin">The number that dyed When Queene Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth dyed.</note> march of a twelue-moneth long, onely within London and the Liberties, the numbers of 38244. those, who then dyed of the Plague, being 35578. the greatest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall in one weeke being 3385. of all diseases, and of the Plague 3035.</p>
            <p>Thus shee went attended from her earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to a more glorious one in Heauen, it being held fit in the vpper-House of the Celestiall Parliament, that so great a Princesse should haue an Army of her subiects with her, agreeing to such a Maiesty. But what numbers God will muster vp to follow our Peace-maker (King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed memory) none knowes: by the beginning of this Prest which Death makes amongst the people, it is to bee feared, they shall be a greater multitude.</p>
            <p>To Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and to King <hi>Iames;</hi> wee were an vnthankfull and murmuring Nation, and therefore God tooke them from vs; they were too good for vs; we too bad for them and were therefore then, at the decease of the one, and now, of the other, are deserued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished: our sinnes increasing with our yeeres, and like the Bells, neuer lying still. <note place="margin">Sinnes like the Bels, neuer lie still.

            <p>We are punished with a Sicknesse, which is dreadfull three manner of wayes: In the generall spreading; in the quicknesse of the stroke; and in the terror which waites vpon it. It is generall: for the spotted wings of it couer all the face of the Kingdome. It is quicke: for
<pb facs="tcp:5546:6"/>
it kills suddenly; it is full of terror, for the Father dares not come neere the infected Son, nor the Son come to take a blessing from the Father, lest hee bee poysoned by it: the Mother abhors to kisse her owne Children, or to touch the sides of her owne Husband: no friend in this battell will relieue his wounded friend, no Brother shake his brother by the hand at a farewell.</p>
            <p>This is something, yet this is nothing: many Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians of our soules flye the City, and their sicke Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients want those heauenly medicines which they ear tyed to giue them, &amp; those that stay by it, stand aloofe.</p>

            <p>To see three thousand men together in Armour in a <note place="margin">Coffins and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slcts.</note> field; is a goodly sight: but if wee should behold three thousand Coffins piled (in heapes) one vpon another, or three thousand Coarses in winding sheetes, laid in some open place, one on the top of each other, what a sight were this?

               <p>It were a worthy act in the Lord Maior, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Magistrates in this City, if, as in the Townes to which our Merchants, and rich Tradesmen flye, the Countrey-people stand there, with Halberds and Pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forkes to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out; so, our Constables &amp; Officers, <note place="margin">A new policy, good for the City.</note> might stand with Bils to keepe the rich in their owne houses (when they offer to goe away) vntill they leaue such a charitable piece of Money behinde them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the maintenance of the poore, which else must perish in their absence.

               <p>To forsake <hi>London,</hi> as one worthy Citizen did, were noble; it would deserue a Crowne of commendations: for hee, being determined to retyre into the Countrey, sent for some of the better sort of his Neighbours, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">A Phoenix in London.</note> their good wils to leaue them, and because (the poyson of Pestilence so hotly reigning) hee knew not whether they and he should euer meet againe, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deliuered to their hands, in trust, (as faithfull Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards) fourescore pounds to be distributed amongst the poore.

No (said he) helpe me to a Minister, who comming to him, and conferring together about the state of his soule, hee deliuered a summe of Money to the Minister, to see him well buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and gaue ten shillings to the Sexton to make his Graue, and departed not till he dyed.</p>
               <p>Now, suppose you are in <hi>Kent,</hi> where you shall see a <note place="margin">A Kentish tale, but truer then those of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> young handsome Maid, in very good apparell, ready to goe into the Towne, to a Sister, which dwelt there: but then as you cast an eye on her (comming into the City) so behold a company of vnmercifull, heathenish, and churlish Townesmen, with Bils and Glaues, driuing her by force backe againe; enter there shee must not (it being feared she came from <hi>London)</hi> neither could her Sister be suffred to goe forth to her. Whereupon, all comfort being denyed her, all doores bard against her, no lodging being to be had for her; shee, full of
<pb facs="tcp:5546:14"/>
teares in her eyes, full of sorrow in her heart, sighing, wailing, and wringing her hands, went into the open fields, there sickned, there languished, there cracked her heart-strings with griefe, and there dyed, none being by her: When she was dead, the Den of a Serpent was not more shunned then the place she lay in. It was death (in any Townesmans thinking) but to stand in the wind of it: there the body lay two or three daies, none da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to approach it; till at the last, an old woman of Kent, stealing out of the Towne, ventured vpon the danger, rifled her Purse and Pockets, found good store of Money, stript her out of her apparell, which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, digged a homely Graue (with the best shift she could make) and there in the field buried her.</p>
               <p>The Kentish Synagogue hearing of this, presently laid their heads together, and fearing lest the breath of an old woman might poison the whole Towne, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the doome of euerlasting banishment vpon her.

<pb facs="tcp:5546:15"/>
comforted himselfe, that carrying health about him, he should make shift to get to the City: but God had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwaies bestowed him, his time was come, the Glasse of his life almost runne out, and his iourney must bee shortned. For taking vp his lodging (by compulsion) in the open field, there he fell sicke, and wanting all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane helpe and comfort, there dyed. It was soone knowne by those that walked out of the Towne, into their grounds, that there he lay dead, and as soone did they consult together what to doe with his body. None was so valiant as to come neere it: It was an eminent danger, to suffer the Carkasse lye aboue ground, and a greater danger for any one (as they thought) to remoue it from thence. In the end, one more couragious then the other, was hyred (for money) to rid the Towne of this mortall feare; who (whatsoeuer should become of them) purposing to saue himselfe, muffled his mouth, went into the same field where the dead body lay, a far off digged a Pit (a Graue hee knew not how to make) and then, with a long Pole, hauing a hooke to it, taking hold of the young mans clothes, he dragged him along, threw him in, and buried him.</p>
               <p>The Master of this seruant, musing at his long stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being loth to lose both man and money, rode downe to see how both of them were bestowed; and vnderstanding, that the Money was paid, and which way his man went for <hi>London,</hi> came to the same towne, where (by ghesse) he thought he must needs put in for lodging; and vpon strict inquiry, if such a young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low had not beene seene amongst them; it was confest, Yes, with all the former Relations of his death, and where he lay buried. The much-perplexed Londoner
<pb facs="tcp:5546:15"/>
hearing this, did, by faire meanes and money, get his Graue opened, had his body in the clothes taken vp, and found all his Money about him, and then in the Towne bestowed vpon him, a friendly, louing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent buriall.</p>
               <p>It fell out better with a company of merry Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, <note place="margin">Madnesse in merriment.</note> who went not aboue ten miles from <hi>London;</hi> for they, getting with much adoe, into a country Victua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-house, were very iouiall, and full of sport, though not full of money. Beere and Ale they called for round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, downe it went merrily, and the Cakes were as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily broken. When the round O's beganne to increase to foure or six shillings, quoth one mad fellow amongst the rest, What will you say, my Masters, if I fetch you off from the Reckoning, and neuer pay a penny? A braue Boy, cryed all the company, if thou canst doe this. Hereupon, the Oastesse being called vp for t'other Pot, and whilest it was drinking, some speech being made of purpose, about the dangerous time, and the sicknesse, it fortuned that the Tokens were named. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, the Woman wondring what kinde of things they were, and protesting she neuer saw any, nor knew what they were like; this daring companion (who vndertooke the shot) clapping his hand on his brest; How (quoth hee) neuer saw any? Why then I feare, I can now shew you some about me; and with that, hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnbuttoning his Doublet, opened his bosome, which was full of little blue Markes, receiued by Haile-shot out of a Birding-piece through a mischance. At sight of these, his Comrades seemed to bee strucke into a feare; but the innocent Oastesse was ready to drop downe dead. They offred to flye, and leaue him there.

Shee fell on her knees, crying out, Shee was vndone. A reckoning then being call'd for, because they would be honest to the house; the poore woman cared for no reckoning, let them call for as much more (so they dranke it quickly) and there was not a penny to pay; prouided, that they would take the spotted man away with them.
