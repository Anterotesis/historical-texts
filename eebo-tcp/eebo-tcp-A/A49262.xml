            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The times wherein we live are famous for <hi>a Ferm of godlineſſe,</hi> and, no leſſe infamous for the want of the <hi>Power</hi> of it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more common then for men to hear and pray, and perform the outſide-duties of Religion. Nothing more rare then for man to do theſe things as becomes the Goſpel. Men have ſo inured themſelves to diſputes about the Circumſtantials of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that Subſtantials are loſt in the ſcuffle. And therefore it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in a Miniſter to reduce the
<pb facs="tcp:54214:3"/>
thoughts and hearts of people from needleſſe controverſies to the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals of Chriſtianity. As <hi>Socrates</hi> was commended for bringing down Philoſophie from high and ſublime ſpeculation, to uſe and practice.</p>
            <p>It was the caſe of this Reverend Author, not ſo much to gratifie the fancies of men, as to work upon their affections, and to direct them in the ordering of their converſation: and that the father, becauſe he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved moſt men had more heat in their Brains, then in their Hearts. That zeal that once appeared in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of this Nation, is evaporated. That violence that ſometimes was in the people of this Nation after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and all Ordinances, is now abated, and grown remiſſe; nay, in ſome, the hatred wherewith they hate the Ordinances and people of God,
<pb facs="tcp:54214:4"/>
is greater then ever was the love wherewith they loved them. That praying Spirit, that not long ago was ſhed abroad in the hearts of Gods people, is now as it were departed.</p>
            <p>It is therefore high time to be ſpeak this careleſſe Nation, or rahter the Profeſſors of this Nation, with that meſſage which GOD ſent to the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Remember from</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And oh! may theſe enſuing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons be uſefull to revive thoſe ſparks of zeal and importunity, that lie as it were under the aſhes. That was the end which the Author aimed at when he preached them to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and that is a main end that we look to and hope for in the
<pb facs="tcp:54214:4"/>
publication of them. The times wherein we live are times of much hypocriſie. There are many among us <hi>that ſay they are Jews, and are not,</hi> that have a <hi>name to live, and are dead:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9. 3. 1.</note> yea, there are many that <hi>ſeeme to be religious,</hi> and yet not only deceive others, but alſo <hi>deceive, their own ſelves.</hi> And therefore it is time for every man to ſearch and trie <hi>if there be any way of wickedneſſe in him.</hi> All is not gold that gliſters, nor are all Saints that ſo call themſelves, or are ſo called by others.</p>
            <p>Here then is a Touch-ſtone by which you may examine your ſelves: Here is a Balance of the Sanctuary, wherein you may weigh your graces, and ſee whether they be light or no. It is one of the vaineſt and moſt fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh things in the world for men to cheat themſelves of eternall happineſſe. We
<pb facs="tcp:54214:5"/>
count it folly for a man to ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be cheated in a bargain, and yet what is loſt in one bargain may be regained in another. But here he that is cheated, is cheated irrecoverably. The loſſe of the ſoul is irreparable. Precious is the redemption of ſouls, and it ceaſeth for ever. And yet there is a ſtrange ſtupidity among the ſons of men, whereby they are willing to be deceived, and jugled out of their ſoul-happineſſe. They are willing to reſt themſelves upon any groundleſſe preſumption, though it be ſo weak that they dare not put it to triall in their own hearts, themſelves being Judges. O all you poor deluded ſouls! <hi>How long will you love vanity, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>

And whereas <hi>Matthew</hi> tels us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>John preached, ſaying, Repent, for the Kingdome of heaven is at hand.

            <p>Suffereth violence] Violence is not to be taken as it is in our dayes of oppoſition, and as in the dayes of perſecution; as it is in our dayes in oppoſition to right and juſtice, and as it was at the firſt comming in of the Goſpel, when the wicked men of the world

did go about to oppoſe and obſtruct the publiſhing of the Goſpel, but it is an holy violence whereby men preſſe forward to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the grace of this Kingdome.

This doth take off that awe and majeſty that ſhould be in men to the Word. As on the contrary, the reaſon why the Miniſtery of <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo effectuall to the Theſſalonians, was this: <hi>Becauſe when they received the Word of God, they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) as the Word of God, which effectually worketh in them that believe,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13.</note> I know that ſome queſtion the lawfulneſſe of our Miniſtery upon this ground, becauſe miracles do not attend our preaching, as they did at the firſt promulgation of the Goſpel.

               <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> could work no miracles, yet no man doubts of their authority.

that God would ſanctifie the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their ſouls, and make it ſucceſſefull.

Moſt of the Statiſts and Politicians of this world are of this temper, which God will one day account a Laodicean lukewarmneſſe or timerous cowardize. Geographers, who write of the ſituation of <hi>England,</hi> ſay, that it is between the Torrid and the Frigid Zone, neither hot nor cold; I wiſh our hearts were not like our land.</p>
            <p n="9">9 This reproves thoſe that expreſſe more violence outwardly then they have inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>There are many men that wil hear Sermons on Lords dayes, &amp; Lectures on week-dayes, ſpeak well of religion, and of the wayes and people of God, but if you look to them in their families, and in their cloſets, you ſhall finde them of another temper. Theſe men are like pepper, hot in the mouth, but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54214:18"/>
cold in the ſtomack. I may reſemble ſuch to a pot boiling over the fire, hot at the top, cold at the bottome. So ſome men are boiling hot in the mouth, but their hearts are cold and frozen. As it is with men ſick of a feaver, the face and hands and other externall parts of the body burn, when the heart ſhakes and quivers with cold.</p>
            <p n="10">10 This reproves thoſe who all their life remain dull and ſluggiſh in religion, that like Carriers horſes keep their ordinary pace, they will not go beyond their bating place, they are like Dromedaries, ſwift in the wayes of ſin, but like the dull Aſſe, ſlow in the vvayes of God.

And thus much for the third particular, the diſcovery of this <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 21, 22.</note> holy violence. I novv come to the fourth.</p>
            <p>The fourth particular is the difference <note place="margin">4 The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a raſh and a holy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</note> betvvixt an heady and raſh, and an holy and religious violence. Novv I ſhall ſhevv that in 10 particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is moſt ſeen in triviall and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall matters. Such vvas the violence of the Phariſees, about vvaſhing their veſſels and their hands before meat, but they never lookt after the vvaſhing of the heart. So the Prelaticall party ſhevved much heat and violence about ceremonies, vvhereas they vvere lukevvarm, yea cold in more ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall matters, the obſervation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and the ſtrict exerciſe of holineſſe,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54214:25"/>
&amp;c. They were very violent for the linnen Ephod, though it may be there was a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous skin under it; they took great care to have railes about the Communion-table, but never took care to make a rail to keep prophane perſons from the prophanation of the Sacrament; but now a godly man is moſt converſant about that which may be moſt advantagious to him, which will bring him neereſt heaven, which will be of moſt uſe to him to glorifie God, and to ſave his ſoul.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is kindled by paſſion and vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the one, by a zeal and holy indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the other. Thus many men are zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the broaching of errours; when they cannot get glory by holding the truth, then they will give up themſelves to vent errours. Whereas true violence comes from a better principle, and aimes at an higher end. The fire of the Altar was to come from heaven, <hi>Levit.</hi> 9. 24. And when <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Levit</hi> 9. 24.</note> offered ſacrifice with ſtrange fire, it was not accepted, nay they were ſlain in their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. Our zeal ſhould be a fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. God accounts that ſtrange fire we fetch from our own hearts.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Violent raſh zeal makes a man go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of his place and calling. <hi>Samuel</hi> reprov'd <hi>Saul</hi> for his heady violence, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 13. When <hi>Saul</hi> had taken upon <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13 13.</note> him to offer ſacrifice, <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:54214:25"/>
               <hi>haſt done fooliſhly.</hi> Yet <hi>Saul</hi> pleaded a fair excuſe. <hi>verſe</hi> 11, 12. <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Becauſe I ſaw</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>that the people were ſcattered from me, and that thou cameſt not within the dayes appointed, and that the Philiſtines gathered themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Michmaſh, therefore ſaid I, The Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſtines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made ſupplication unto the Lord. I forced my ſelfe therefore, and offered a burnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee <hi>Saul</hi> had much to ſay, yet all would not ſerve to juſtifie his invaſion into the Prieſts office. Such was the violence of <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 26. 51. <hi>He ſtretched out his hand, and drew his ſword and ſtrook a ſervant</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 51.</note> 
               <hi>of the High Prieſt, and ſmote off his ear.</hi> But an holy violence makes a man zealous in his place. A zealous Magiſtrate will ſeverely puniſh ſin, let other Juſtices indulge it. A zealous Miniſter will be faithfull and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in the reproving of ſin, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers prove dumb dogs, or flatterers that ſowe pillowes under mens elbowes: So a zealous maſter of a family reſolves with good <hi>Joſhua, That he and his houſe will ſerve the Lord, Joſh.</hi> 24. 15. whatever other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and other families do. Fire in its place <note place="margin">

            <p n="10">10 Heady violence is accompanied with ſtoutneſſe of heart both towards God and men, it proceeds from a naturall raſhneſſe: But holy violence is accompanied with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 19.

            <p>We fall ſhort of them. 1 In regard of <note place="margin">1 In love.</note> their love and union. It was obſerved that the primitive Chriſtians were ſo full of love and affection to one another, that they could be acquainted together as well in half an hour as in half a year. In thoſe times they were ſo converſant in that duty of love, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>They needed not that he ſhould write to them concerning love,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 9. In thoſe dayes they were of one accord. The very Heathens took notice of <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 9.</note> it, and ſaid: Behold, how the Chriſtians love one another. But we are fallen into thoſe times wherein the love of men grows cold; we, upon whom the ends of the world are come, bite, and teare, and devour one another.</p>

            <p n="3">3. We fall ſhort of the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians herein alſo, that they vvere taken off from that form of religion vvherein they vvere born and bred up, and received a nevv form of religion.

An holy indignation makes him to reaſon thus within himſelf. Could I ſin worſe then others, and ſhall I now be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with leſſe grace then others? Could I be as ſwift as a Dromedary in the wayes of ſin, and ſhall I creep like a ſnail in the wayes of God? Have I been zealous for the committing of ſin, and ſhall I be cold in my motions after Chriſt? Such perſons are aſhamed of their former wayes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they now labour to take off that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach by making ſome reparations.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This proceeds from that ſenſe that is in ſuch perſons of an utter and abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of getting into Chriſt. You know a man that hath but cut his finger will not make much ado, but he that hath got a great and dangerous wound ſees a neceſſity of the cure, and that he is a dead man if
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54214:35"/>
he do not get help. So a man that lives in a common way of ſinning, he thinks his ſins are inconſiderable, he ſees no neceſſity of cloſing with Chriſt for cure. But a man that hath been much in ſin, and notorious in wickedneſſe, when God comes and opens his eyes by effectuall calling, he ſees a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of getting help by Jeſus Chriſt, and that if he have not Chriſt, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever, he ſhall periſh eternally. And thus I have finiſhed the doctrinal part: I proceed now to make application. And this doctrine is eminently uſefull to three ſorts of men. 1 To thoſe that have been formerly very vile and great ſinners, but are now converted. 2 To meer civill and honeſt men. 3 To thoſe that yet remain and go on in a ſinfull courſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To thoſe that have been formerly very great ſinners, but are now converted: To <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. To great ſinners converted</note> them I have two things to ſay.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Labour to follow this pattern that is here propounded in the Goſpel, and in this doctrine. Labour to proportion your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces now that you are converted, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and greatneſſe of your ſins before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. As you have been violent in ſin formerly, ſo ſee that now you be as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent after the things of heaven. So did <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> he was a great ſinner, he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Jeruſaſalem</hi> with blood, he was a groſſe Idolater, a deſtroyer of Gods worſhip,

               <hi>himſelf greatly before the God of his fathers.</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe he was a greater ſinner then the reſt of the Apoſtles; therefore he laboured more abundantly then they all. If therefore ſin hath abounded, ſee that grace doth abound alſo. As you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly added iniquity unto iniquity, ſo now ſee that you adde grace to grace. As you have with much eagerneſſe given up the members of your bodies, as inſtruments of unrighteouſneſſe unto ſin and uncleanneſſe; ſo ſee that you give them up as inſtruments of righteouſneſſe unto holineſſe. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, ſee that you do abound, 1 In the grace of humiliation. 2 In the grace of love. 1 In the grace of humiliation; lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle humiliation is not ſuitable to great ſins. That garment that hath moſt ſpots in it, muſt have moſt rinſing; that which hath moſt duſt in it, needs the moſt beating. There muſt be a <hi>ſicut,</hi> not onely <hi>qualitatis,</hi> but <hi>aequalitatis</hi> alſo, if poſſibly it can be. There ſhould be ſome equality between the ſtrength that was put forth in the ſervice of ſin, and that we now put forth in the ſervice of God. It is very obſervable, <hi>Levit.</hi> 11. 24, 25. <hi>He that toucheth an unclean thing, ſhall be</hi>

               <hi>unclean till even; but he that beareth an unclean thing, ſhall waſh his cloathes, and be unclean till even.</hi> Though a man be but defiled a little with ſin, if he doth but touch a ſin as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54214:36"/>
it were, commit a little ſin, he had need be humbled; but thoſe that wallow in ſinfull courſes, and bear ſin about them, they muſt look to be more humbled then otherswere.</p>
            <p n="2">2 See that you proportion your love to Chriſt to your ſinfulneſſe againſt Chriſt in times paſt. Haſt thou been a great and a vile ſinner before converſion, know that a little love to Chriſt is not anſwerable to thy great ſins. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 17. <hi>Her ſins which are many are forgiven her, therefore ſhe loved much.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt expects and requires more love of ſuch to whom he hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned much, then he doth of thoſe to whom little is forgiven.

                  </gap>, Loveſt thou me more then theſe?</hi> Jeſus Chriſt did not ask him, Loveſt thou me at all? nor, Loveſt thou me as theſe? but, Loveſt thou me more then theſe? Thou haſt ſinned more then theſe, doeſt thou love me more then theſe? Chriſt expected more love from <hi>Peter</hi> then from the reſt of the Diſciples. And ſo <hi>Peter</hi> did return more love to Chriſt then the reſt did. And though the book of the Acts be called the Acts of the Apoſtles, yet there is more ſpoken of <hi>Peter</hi> then of all the reſt of the Apoſtles that had ſeen Chriſt in the fleſh. <hi>Peter</hi> after his fall did ſhew more love then the reſt. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> preached the firſt Sermon after <note place="margin">

15. 2 <hi>Peter</hi> was the firſt that went into the Sepulchre after Chriſts death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. Although <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did run to the Sepulchre, &amp; <hi>John</hi> out-ran <hi>Peter,</hi> and came firſt thither, yet <hi>Peter</hi> firſt went down into the Sepulchre to ſee where Chriſt was laid, <hi>John</hi> 20. 6. 3 When Chriſt <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 20. 6.</note> after his reſurrection was walking upon the waters, <hi>Peter</hi> caſt himſelf into the Sea to go to meet Jeſus, he had no patience to ſtay till he came at him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 7. 4 <hi>Peter</hi> converted <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 21. 7.</note> more ſouls to Chriſt then all the reſt of the Apoſtles did, 3000 ſouls at one Sermon. 5 <hi>Peter</hi> died for Chriſt, he was crucified for Chriſt; and he deſired that he might be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with his head downward, becauſe he thought it was too much honour for him to die as his Maſter. So you ſee that as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had been more treacherous to his maſter then the reſt; ſo <hi>Peter</hi> was more ardent in his love to Chriſt then the reſt. And ſo you muſt all learn to ſee, that as your ſins have been more and greater then the ſins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; ſo your humiliation muſt be more, your love muſt be ſtronger. That is the firſt branch of the firſt Uſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This may teach you to magnifie the riches and freeneſſe of Gods grace, that God ſhould caſt an eye of grace and love upon ſuch a wretch as thou waſt; that God ſhould paſſe by ſuch men as the ſtrict Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, and pitch upon thee: that God

So much for the firſt Uſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This Doctrine is uſefull to men of a <note place="margin">

               </note> away juſtified rather then the Phariſee. <hi>Luther</hi> hath a notable gloſſe upon theſe words: It is far more eaſie for harlots and notorious ſinners to be ſaved, then for proud titular Saints; becauſe the former are eaſily brought to a ſenſe of their ſins, but the latter are like to periſh in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their own righteouſneſſe, except they be converted in an extraordinary manner. This I ſpeak, not that I would diſſwade you
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54214:37"/>
from a civill courſe of life, or draw you to in open profaneneſſe; but that you may not reſt upon your moral accompliſhments, upon your good meanings, and think that you are ſermon-proof, that the Miniſter can hardly meet with your corruptions and conſciences.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If God doth convert ſuch men uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are not ſo eminent in grace then others. This is expreſſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 43, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>So much for the ſecond Uſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This Doctrine is uſefull to profane men, to the looſer ſort.</p>

be great, yet they are not ſo great as the mercies of God. The mercy of God is compared to a ſea; the ſea, you know, is a very great deep.

            <p n="2">2 Becauſe Doctrines of comfort many men ſuck poyſon from, and ſo get their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; therefore I ſhall lay down a Caution or two. Take heed you do not abuſe this doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Do not make the converſion of any ſcandolous ſinner to be any ſtumbling block in your way to heaven. It was the great ſtumbling block in the way of the Phariſees, when they ſaw that Chriſt would eat meat with Publicans and ſinners, they ſaid, He was a friend of Publicans and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Do not entertain hard thoughts of Chriſt, not of the wayes of Chriſt for that. Indeed, if religion were any cloak for ſin, if it did countenance and incourage men in ſin, it were ſomething; but it is that which makes of a ſinner a Saint. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, though it finde us vile and bad, it doth not leave us ſo.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Take heed you do not ſuck this poiſon from it, that when you hear, the worſe men are before converſion, the better they will
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54214:39"/>
be after converſion. Some, it may be, will draw this inference from it: That it is the beſt to be as vile and wicked as one can, for ſo one ſhall be moſt zealous afterward. Take heed of that. For</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is a great queſtion whether God will convert thee or not; and if thou, be not converted, all thy ſins will be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cords to tie thee in hell, the aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy ſin will be additions to thy tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The deeper thou art in ſin, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt thy humiliation be. Will any wiſe man break his leg, becauſe a broken bone well ſet and knit again will be ſtronger then ever it was before. Knotty timber ſhall have moſt blowes.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The longer thou continueſt in ſin, the longer will God keep thee under ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it will be long before he vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth the comforts of his Spirit, he will fill thee with indignation and horrour. Though great ſins cannot <hi>vaſt are gratiam,</hi> lay waſte the grace of God, yet they may <hi>vaſt are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiam,</hi> lay waſte the peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; though it may be they will not put thee into a ſtate of ejection, yet they will bring thee into a ſtate of dejection; if thou art not caſt off; yet thou ſhalt he caſt down: and therefore take heed thou doeſt not abuſe this precious doctrine.</p>

Jeſus Chriſt indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it for a platforme, or a patterne to direct us in the making of our prayers; for there is nothing we ſtand in need of, and goe to God for; but it is to be found in theſe words; but he never intended to tye up his people to this forme.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> 2. A ſecond reaſon is this: Becauſe in  the recitall of the Lords prayer, by <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> there is much difference; and though the difference be not materiall, yet it is verball, which is enough to prove what I intend, to wit, that we are not bound to the words.

It is our duty, and it is very good to look to the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the heart in prayer, to look to the qualification of the duty; but the main work is to look after the qualification of the perſon, and to ſee whether thou art in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54214:46"/>
a ſtate of favour and reconciliation, with God; for if the perſon be not in favour with God, you may be confident the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will not be heard nor accepted, but God looks upon it as the corrupt breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thy ſinful and corrupt heart. You are to look therefore in the performance of duty, whether you can go to God, in prayer as a Father. There are many that look after the qualification of their duty; but few look after the qualification of the perſon, to ſee whether they be juſtified or no, whether God be their friend or not. But we ſhould mainly look to this: for let the heart of a man be never ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, (let us ſuppoſe it, for indeed no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconciled men can be well diſpoſed, to ſpeak properly) yet if thy perſon be not juſtified, thy prayer cannot be accepted. God cares not for the Rhetorick of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, how eloquent they are; nor for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick of prayers, how many they are; nor for the Logick of them, how rational and methodical they are; nor for the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of them, what an harmony and melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of words thou haſt; but he looks at the divinity of prayers, which is from the qualification of a perſon, from a juſtified perſon, and in a ſanctified manner. It is good to enquire, Is my heart right? Is my mind compoſed? Are my affections raiſed, kindled in prayer? But chiefly enqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>That a ſtate of friendſhip, or reconciliation with God, is not ſufficient to aſſure a man that God will give returnes to his prayers.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a man muſt be brought into a ſtate of, friendſhip and favour with God, before his, prayers can be heard: yet it is not a ſufficient ground for a man to believe, that God will give him an anſwer of all his prayers. <hi>He will give unto him, not becauſe</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>
               </label> The firſt particular is the reaſon, why God may, and doth ſometimes deny to hear the prayers of his friends: And that is this. Becauſe, God hath tied returns  of prayer, not onely to the qualification of the perſon, but alſo to the qualification of the dutie; that the dutie be performed, not onely by a fit perſon, but alſo in a right way, in a right manner, to a right end. God doth not ſay, Let a godly man pray how he will, I will hear his prayers; that were the way to make him to be careleſſe and remiſs in the performance of duties. Therefore the Lord expects qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of the dutie, as well as of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. God requires that duties be done with feeling, fervencie, faith, fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; they muſt be done in a right manner.</p>
            <p>There is a fivefold qualification that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54214:48"/>
God requires, even of his friends, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their acceptance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The heart muſt be prepared, Pſal. 10. <note place="margin">Pſal. 10. 17.</note> 17. <hi>Lord thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble, thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cauſe thine ear to hear.</hi> So Job 11. 13, 14, <note place="margin">Job 11. 13, 14, 15.</note> 15. <hi>If thou prepare thine heart, and ſtretch out thine hand towards him. If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedneſs dwell in thy tabernacle. For then ſhalt thou lift up thy face without ſpot; yea, thou ſhalt be ſtedfaſt and ſhalt not fear.</hi> That is the firſt particular.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sin muſt be removed. So you finde in the place laſt quoted, <hi>iniquity muſt be put far away,</hi> &amp;c. When Gods own people come to worſhip before God, they muſt not let any ſinne lye upon their conſciences, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of and indulged.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>Now put all theſe together: Our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will not be heard, except, 1. Our hearts be prepared. 2. Sin removed. 3. Our affections raiſed. 4. Our minds compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. 5. Our deſires inlarged. And judge,

whether this be not ground enough for the Doctrine, That a ſtate of friendſhip, is not ſufficient for the acceptance of our prayers.</p>

               <hi>ye aske amiſſe, that you may conſume it upon your luſts.</hi> So the mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> children, Matth. 20. 21. She ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Grant that theſe my two ſons may ſit, the one on thy right</hi>

Therefore Chriſt ſaid, <hi>You know not what you ask.</hi> Chriſt would not give any anſwer to her requeſt; he would not gratifie her pride and ambition.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. In caſe God ſees we are not able to uſe the mercy well when we have it. If
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54214:49"/>
you would ask gifts from God, it may be God ſees, that enlarged gifts would make thee proud, and that thou wouldeſt be puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up with them, and exalt thy ſelf above thy brethren, therefore God will deny thee. We read, Gen. 26. 1, 2. <hi>When there was a famine in the Land,—He went to enquire</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 26. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>of the Lord, whether he ſhould go down into Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, God anſwered, Go not down into Aegypt.</hi> God would not let him go; but in the dayes of <hi>Jacob</hi> there was a famine in the Land, Gen. 46. 3. <hi>and God ſaid to Jacob, Go down into Aegypt.</hi> Now what might be the <note place="margin">Gen. 46. 3.</note> reaſon, that God would have <hi>Jacob</hi> goe down into Aegypt, and not <hi>Iſaac.</hi> The raſon is this, <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a man of weaker Graces then <hi>Jacob</hi> was; and God ſaw, that if <hi>Iſaac</hi> had gone down into Aegypt for corne, he would have fallen into the ſinnes of the Land. Now <hi>Jacob</hi> was a ſtrong man in grace and in gifts; for as a Prince he wraſtled with God, and prevailed, and was called, <hi>Iſrael.</hi> God ſaw that <hi>Jacob</hi> would reſiſt their idolatrous wayes, and not be guilty of their ſins. So you may ask mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, and it may be you are not able to manage them well. And therefore God denies you; when as another askes the ſame mercy, and God gives it to him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſees he will uſe it well, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it to Gods glory. Therefore reflect upon thy ſelf; and when God denies thee
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54214:50"/>
a mercy, which thou haſt begged at his hands; Say to thy ſelf, this denial is in mercy, for he did not think me fit for it. If men would take this way to conſider of Gods dealing with them, it would ſilence all the murmurings and repinings of their hearts againſt God.</p>

               <hi>Seeing God doth not hear the prayers of his people in ſome caſes; How may we know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the denyal of our prayers be in mercy or no?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God doth not hear the prayers of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, he denies them in wrath; but his peoples prayers he denies in mercy; and that is in theſe caſes.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54214:50"/>
they pray for, but what is beſt for them. If God ſhould give his people all they ask, they would be undone. It is mercy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a mad man a ſword, for he would cut his own throat with it: To deny a child a knife, for he would cut his fingers with it. You have an inſtance in <hi>Peter,</hi> Luke 5. <note place="margin">Luke 5. 8.</note> 8. <hi>When Simon Peter ſaw him, he fell down at Jeſus his knees, ſaying, Depart from me, for I am a ſinful man, O Lord.</hi> Had Jeſus Chriſt granted Peter his requeſt, he had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever: Therefore he would not depart from him. So that this denial was in mercy. As on the other ſide, it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Gods wrath, many times, when God doth grant mercies to wicked men. So it was to Pharaoh, he deſired that God would remove the plagues from him; God granted it, thereby to harden <hi>Pharoahs</hi> heart, and make him ripe for deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. God denies in mercy, if that we ask would be an occaſion of ſinne. Suppoſe a man beg wealth; God ſees the having of wealth would make him a proud man: Now the denial of that is a mercy to him. <note place="margin">Concedit iratus quod negat propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos Deus non exaudit ad voluntatem, ut exaudiat ad ſalutem.</note> As in the forementioned inſtance. God would not let <hi>Iſaac</hi> go down to Aegypt, becauſe it would have been an occaſion of ſin to him. As he ſaid very well, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that in love, which he grants in anger. God doth not hear many in their deſires,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54214:51"/>
that he may hear them for their good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God denies a prayer in mercy, when he gives a better in lieu of it; It was the deſire of <hi>Moſes</hi> that he might goe into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but it was better to him to goe to the heavenly Canaan, and therefore God tranſlated him thither. So the Apoſtles deſired Chriſt to tell them, <note place="margin">Act 1. 7, 8.</note> when he would reſtore the Kingdome to Iſrael. He would not reſolve them that, yet he gave them a greater mercy, for he gave them the holy Ghoſt. So <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the life of that childe that was ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate; but God tooke away the baſtard (which would have been a living monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Aut dal it Deus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

            <p n="4">4. God may deny to returne this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in mercy, to quicken our he'res and affections in prayer, and to make us more eager in the purſuit after mercy.

            <p n="5">5.

            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. We have not to doe to ſearch into the ſecret will of God, we are to minde the revealed will of God, and not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; It concernes not us to know what

            <p>Though God can give a mercy without prayer, yet he hath not any where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give it without prayer. Prayer is the meanes that God hath appointed us to uſe for the obtaining of mercy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The decree of God muſt not make us to be remiſſe in prayer; for God hath decreed not onely the end, but alſo the meanes; as God hath decreed to give thee mercy, ſo he hath alſo decreed that thou ſhouldeſt pray for it. And therefore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the decree or purpoſe of God is mentioned, it is uſed as an argument, to ſtirre up the people of God to prayer. <hi>For thou oh Lord of hoſts, God of Iſrael, haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to thy ſervant ſaying, I will build thee an</hi>

And now oh Lord God, thou art God, that God and thy words be true, and thou haſt promiſed this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto thy ſervant. Therefore now let it pleaſe thee to bleſſe the houſe of thy ſervant, that it may continue for ever before thee: For thou oh Lord God haſt ſpoken it, and with thy bleſſing let the houſe of thy ſervant be bleſſed for ever.</hi> You ſee here God had purpoſed, and

No, <hi>David</hi> takes this hint, and uſeth it to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in his prayer. Another inſtance you have in <hi>Iſaac.</hi> God had decreed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be multiplyed as the ſtarres of the heaven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 5. and that this promiſed ſhould <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 5.</note> be accompliſhed in <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Did this make <hi>Iſaac</hi> neglect prayer?

            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. There is the moſt holy importunity in a man, when he lives under the cleareſt apprehenſion, and aſſurance of Gods love <note place="margin">Pſal. 42. 4.</note> in Chriſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 4. <hi>When I remembred theſe things, I poure out my ſoule in me:</hi> when he remembered, and conſidered the marks and tokens of Gods grace in him, and love to hm, this made him importunate. A Chriſtian may be compared to a Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold, which while the Sun ſhines upon it, opens it ſelfe, but afterwards ſhuts. Chriſtians, when the Sun of Gods favour ſhines upon them, their ſoules are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, their affections inflamed towards God; but when God hides his face, they are troubled, their hearts are ſtraitned, and they cannot pray as they uſed to doe. It is ſaid of the Nightingale, that when ſhe thinks any one is neere, ſhe ſings more ſweetly then when ſhe is alone in the wood. The ſoule, when it ſees that God is neare it, and that his favour is towards it, then it ſings moſt ſweetly, then it prayes moſt fervently; but when the love of God is clouded, and the ſoule left as it were alone; then the affections flag, and grow remiſſe in prayer.</p>

But it is otherwiſe with an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, he prayes for mercy, for pardon of ſinne, but he can reſt contented, though God doth not hear him; he can beg grace, but he can be very well ſatisfied without grace, Prov. 13. 4. <hi>The ſoul of the ſluggard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and hath nothing, but the ſoul of the diligent</hi>

This importunity, makes a man more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour againſt ſin then affliction; more to deſire ſaving, grace, then common mercies.

               <hi>harken to thy voice; cauſe me to hear it.</hi> But now an hypocrite, doth never care to have any ſecret communion with God; he cares not to pray alone; and if hee bee brought to that, hee takes no care of his heart, he curbs not his thoughts; all his care is in company, popular applauſe, and vain-glory, is as the wind to the ſails of a Ship, that makes their affections move the faſter. An hypocrite, in this regard, may be reſembled to a Nightingale, which ſings ſweeteſs when any man ſtands neer her. So carnal men when others are witneſſes of their actions, then they put forth the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their ability.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54214:59"/>
he is to prayer: The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he looks upon his enlargements, not as coming from the ſtrength of his natural parts or abilities, but as the free-gift, and gracious diſpenſation of Gods Spirit: and ſo he ſees he hath nothing whereof to boaſt; and ſo it makes him low in his own eyes. You know a violet, that is one of the ſweeteſt flowers, growes loweſt in the earth. The fulleſt ears of corn, do moſt hang down: The fulleſt barrels, make the leaſt noiſe: So the moſt gracious heart, is the moſt low and vile in its own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, is the neareſt earth, but duſt and aſhes. The fuller he is of divine diſcoveries, or enlargement, the leſs boaſting doth he make in the world. A ſhip, the heavier it is laden, the leſſe it is toſt with winds and waves; the more empty it is, the more it is lifted up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the water. ſo a man, the more empty, the more toſt too and fro with every wind of applauſe. Grace is, as it were, the balaſt of the ſoul, to keep down a mans ſpirits, and make him humble in the midſt of wit and parts. <hi>Be ye therefore ſober and watch unto prayer.</hi> Be ſober and not puffed up, do not <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 7.</note> boaſt of your enlargements. Though it is true, it doth refer to another thing, yet <hi>Byfield</hi> refers it to prayer; and he ſaith, That man that prayes to God, with moſt enlargedneſſe of affections towards God, that man cannot but he muſt watch and be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54214:60"/>
ſober. Sobriety is oppoſed to pride, for a man may be dumb with his own gifts and graces; and watchfulneſſe is oppoſed to remiſneſſe, and deadneſſe, and careleſneſſe of ſpirit in the performance of duties. Thus it is with a ſincere man, that hath this true importunity in him. But now wicked men, if ever they have enlargements in duty, it puffs them up. It is with them, as it was with, <hi>Uzziah</hi> 2 Chr. 26. 16. When God had helped him marvellouſly, til he was ſtrong. <hi>But when he was ſtrong, his heart was lifted up to his deſtruction.</hi> When God helps the ſoul of ſuch a man in duty, it makes him to lift up himſelf againſt God, and be puffed up above his brethren.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. He that hath this holy importunity  in him, his deſires are rather quickned, then abated by denials. You finde this in the woman of Canaan, Matt. 15. 22. She cryed unto Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Have mercy on me, O</hi>

There was another diſcouragement, which would have knocked off the deſires of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but ſhe continues her requeſt ſtill. Jeſus Chriſt himſelf anſwers her, <hi>I am not</hi>

               <hi>ſent, but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> verſ. 24. There is a third diſcouragement; and yet this doth not cool her affections, but ſhe comes afreſh upon Chriſt, ſhe came and worſhipped, ſaying, <hi>Lord, help me,</hi> verſ. 25. Yet ſhe found another repulſe, and that worſe then any of the former; <hi>It is not meet to take the childrens bread, and give it to doggs,</hi> verſ. 26. Chriſt you ſee calls her a dog; and yet all this doth not caſt her off, but ſhe takes encouragement, even from this diſcouraging anſwer: <hi>And ſhe ſaid, Truth Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their maſters table,</hi> verſ. 27. She was reſolved ſhe would not give over, till ſhe got what ſhe came for, till Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>O woman great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt,</hi> verſ. 28. Denials are to the Saints, as water to the Smiths-forge, when it is ſprinkled upon it, it is ſo far from cooling or quenching it, that it makes it burn with the greater heat: So the denials, and diſcouragements Gods people meet with, they ſerve for bellowes, to blow up thoſe ſparks that are in them into a flame, to make their deſires ſtronger, their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to burn the hotter. But now to an hypocrite, denials and diſcouragements, do take off the wheels of his affections, and make them to move ſlowly and heavily: Job 21. 15. <hi>What is the Almighty that we</hi>

               <hi>if we pray unto him?</hi> We get no good by it, the mercies we ask, are not yet in our hands. Now this argues a ſinful impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and a want of holy importunity.</p>

The true importunity is from above, it is a fire kindled, by God himſelf, in the hearts of his people. But there is another im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, that comes from natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, from natural abilities, a ſtrong memory, a profound judgement, a ready wit, a fluent tongue; and theſe are very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the duty.

Why now Sathan will fall in with you, he will jogge your arme, he will take off your eye from the marke, that you ſhall not be able to hit it. Thus he dealt with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as you heard before. Thus he dealt, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Now there was a day when</hi>

               <hi>the ſons of God came to preſent themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and Sathan came alſo among them.</hi> I am not ignorant that many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, by the ſons of God, doe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Angells, becauſe the Angells are called the ſons of God, <hi>Job</hi> 38. 7. but <note place="margin">Job 38. 7.</note> it cannot be ſo taken here; I will give but one reaſon to prove it; becauſe the place where the Angells are, is in heaven, and if ſo, then the Devill muſt be in heaven, which is by all denyed; he never was in heaven, ſince he was caſt out of it. And therefore <hi>Bolducius</hi> ſaith, that this day was the Lords day, and by the Sons of God are meant, the godly men, that lived in the time, and place where <hi>Job</hi>

               <hi>Joſhua the high Prieſt ſtanding before the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of the Lord, and Sathan ſtanding at his right hand to reſiſt him; And the Lord ſaid unto Sathan, The Lord rebuke thee O Sathan, even the Lord that hath choſen Jeruſalem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thee: is not this a firebrand pluckd out of the fire?</hi> You ſee how Sathan laboured to divert the thoughts, and diſtract the heart of the high Prieſt in the performance of religious duties. That is the firſt reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This importunity is wanting in our prayers, when we know and allow our ſelves in any one ſin, and let it lie upon our hearts unrepented of. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the 51 <hi>Pſalme,</hi> that all the while that <hi>David</hi> did lie in that ſin of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, all the time that ſin was unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, the heart of David was ſhut up that he could not pray, as he was wont to doe before, and as he did after he had repented of that ſin, at which time he writ that penitentiall Pſalme. You had
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54214:65"/>
need looke to your hearts, that there doe not lie there any ſin incouraged, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented of; for be ſure of this, if thy prayer doe not make thee leave ſinning, thy ſin will make thee leave praying. That is the ſecond reaſon of the want of importunity.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Another reaſon is this, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny  take unfit ſeaſons for the performance of dutie. It is the judgement of that learned and reverend man of God, Mr <hi>Bolton,</hi> that the taking of unfit ſeaſons for the performance of prayer, doth more obſtruct, and hinder this holy importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in prayer, then all the ſuggeſtions and inſtigations of Sathan.</p>
            <p>Now there are three unfit ſeaſons for the performance of this duty.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. When the body is ſleepy, and fit for  nothing but to take its reſt. A ſleepy and ſluggiſh temper, is a canker to eat out many ſweet affections, Cant. 3. 1. <hi>By night upon</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cant. 3. 1.</note> 
               <hi>my bed I ſought him, but I found him not.</hi> Some Inter preters take occaſion hence, to ſpeak againſt late prayers.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Another unfit ſeaſon is, when the  heart is filled with worldly care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, and the incumbrances of this preſent life; many men are guilty of this, they will ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>log themſelves with the cares of this life, that they cannot have a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time free from them. Some men will
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54214:65"/>
be down upon their knees, before the things of this world are out of their minds; and ſo they have no time to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or meditate, or to put the heart into a fit frame for that work. You know we are <hi>to attend upon the Lord without diſtraction,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 35. It was the fault of thoſe Jews in hearing, that when they came to hear <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 35.</note> the word, <hi>their hearts did go out after their covetouſneſſe,</hi> Ezek. 33. 31. That is another ſeaſon unfit for prayer. <note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 31.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Another ſeaſon is, when we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paſſionate diſtempers. When tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous  paſſions are up, holy affections are down, 1 Tim. 2. 8. <hi>I will that men pray every</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 8.</note> 
               <hi>where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting;</hi> to ſhew, that where there is wrath, the duty of prayer cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in an acceptable manner. And of the ſame mind was the Apoſtle <hi>Peter;</hi> who therefore gives this counſel, 1 Pet. 3. 7. <note place="margin">1 Pet 3. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Likewiſe, ye husbands, dwel with them according to knowledg, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker veſſel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> The Apoſtle wiſely fore-ſaw, that if man and wife lived in diſcontent and trouble, then their prayers would be hindred; and therefore he adviſeth them, to prevent the hinderance of their prayers, by avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſions of diſcontent. And that is the third ſeaſon, wherein people are are unfit
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54214:66"/>
for prayer: ſo they are diverted from that ſervency, and importunity they might have in their prayers. We ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chuſe the fitteſt ſeaſons for prayer. It is ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> by <hi>Vitus Theodorus,</hi> who was preſent with him at <hi>Coburge,</hi> and many times heard him at his private prayers, in a letter of his to <hi>Melanchthon,</hi> That there was no day paſſed over his head, wherein <hi>Luther</hi> did not ſpend three hours, at the leaſt, in prayers; and thoſe (not hours that he could beſt ſpare, unſeaſonable hours, but) ſuch hours as were the fitteſt for his ſtudy. And that was a reaſon, that <hi>Luther</hi> was very importunate in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as the ſame Author informs us; Good God, with how much reverence did I hear him pray! With how much boldneſſe and confidence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And on the contrary, one reaſon why men have ſo little of this holy importunity, is for want of taking fit ſeaſons for the work.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Another reaſon of the want of this  holy importunity is, the difuſe and neglect of prayer in your Chriſtian courſe. Many there are, that pray ſometimes, and leave off praying again; now this doth very much dull mens affections in prayer. There is a Proverb, <hi>Uſe makes perfectneſs;</hi> I am ſure it is ſo in the duty of prayer; let a Chriſtian pray often, and he will come to pray well, and to pray with much enlargedneſſe of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54214:66"/>
heart; and let him leave off prayer, and he will finde his heart exceedingly ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Take a Key, if you uſe it frequently, it will be bright, but if you lay it aſide, it will ſoon grow ruſty; thus will it be with a mans heart, uſe prayer much, keep it cloſe to the performance of duty, it is the way to have thy heart bright. Let this Key of prayer, which doth open heaven, be uſed, it will be kept bright, and thy prayer will enter into heaven; but let this Key of prayer be laid aſide, and do not thou often uſe it, and it will quickly grow ruſty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; thy prayers and performances, will not be able to enter neaven, and thou wilt not be able to perform duty in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that God expecteth. If thou doſt not watch unto prayer, with all carefulneſſe, thou wilt looſe thy zeal and ſervent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thy holy deſires after God in duty. As it is with a Pump, uſe it every day, and water will come, but if you forbear the uſe of it two or three dayes, water will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come ſo eaſily, nor ſo plentifully. If you do not pump out your holy deſires every day, they will quickly flag and grow remiſſe. Phyſitians obſerve, concerning the teeth, that that ſide of the teeth that is not uſed, is moſt ſubject to rheumes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillations. That heart that is not inured to prayer and holy duties, is moſt ſubject to Satans inſtillations and ſuggeſtions. This
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54214:67"/>
is the fourth reaſon.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ </seg>5</label> The fifth reaſon why this importunity is wanting, is this, becauſe men tye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to preſcript forms of prayer. I do not ſay, that it is unlawful to uſe ſet forms of prayer; we finde that Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf uſed a form, Matt. 26. 39.

The ſpirituall interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he partly made, and that we may make, is this; when the ſoule would mount aloft in prayer, and grow fervent, the cares of the world pluck it down, and coole it.

You muſt doe as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, when he went to ſacrifice, he left his ſervants and cattell at the bottome of the hill: So when you goe to offer to God the ſacrifices of prayer, you muſt get above the impediments and diſtractions of this preſent life.

            <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are fluent in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in prayer.</p>

4. Becauſe they pray by heart and not by book. Now all theſe are falſe grounds, and therefore I ſhall endeavour to diſprove them in order.</p>
            <p>The firſt ground of this deceit is this. There are ſome that conceive they have <note place="margin">Firſt falſe ground conſuted.</note> this importunitie, becauſe they have mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of words, and variety of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in prayer.</p>
            <p>Now this is no juſt ground for a man to conclude, that he hath this holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, in foure caſes.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. In caſe expreſſions come from the  ſtrength of naturall gifts, and parts, and not from ſaving grace. A man may have a ſtrong memory, and volubilitie of tongue, and good naturall abilities, and yet all this while fall far ſhort of this gracious importunitie.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. In caſe thou art full in expreſſion,  but emptie in affection. There are many men whoſe words doe outſlip their hearts, and their expreſſions exceed their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So did they, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 13. <hi>For aſ much as this people draw neare mee with their mouth, and with their lips doe honour me; but have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved their heart far from mee.</hi> Some men are like boyling water, when it boiles faſteſt, and boiles out of the top, then there is nothing at the bottome; All their prayers are at the top, in their mouth, and not in their heart and affections.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54214:72"/>
Their affections doe not carrie equipage with their words.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. In caſe thy importunate expreſſions be more uſed in company, then in ſecret,  it is a ſigne thou haft not this holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, but it comes from popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. It is not ſo with the people of God. Chriſt ſpeaks to his people, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>Thou that dwelleſt in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice, cauſe mee to heare it;</hi> to ſhew, that they ſhould not onely pray, and be importunate when the companions hearken to their voice, when they are in company, but even then when no eye ſees them, when no eare heares them, when none is preſent, but God alone; God expects that we ſhould pray in ſecret, as well as in company.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. In caſe thy fluencie of expreſſions doe make thee conceited of thy ſelfe, and of thy gifts, and to ſleight the gifts of other men, this is an argument thou haſt not this holy importunitie; for that makes a man humble, and low in his own eyes. When a man comes to deſpiſe other men, and exalt himſelfe above his brethren, this is a token thy importunitie comes not from a right principle. And ſo I have diſproved the firſt falſe ground, upon which many conceit they have this importunity. <note place="margin">A ſecond falſe ground conſuted.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Another falſe ground upon which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54214:73"/>
men conceive they have this importunitie, when they have not, is this; Becauſe they finde in themſelves ſome ſtirrings in their affections in prayer to God. But this is no juſt ground for that opinion in theſe caſes.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. In caſe thine affections are more ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red  up, for the removall of affliction upon thee, then corruption within thee. As it was with the Mariners in <hi>Jonah,</hi> they cried mightily unto God, but what was it for? not that they might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from their ſins and corruptions, but that God would bring them ſafe out of that tempeſt wherein they were.</p>

If theſe ſtirrings be fading; There are many that have a fluſhing in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,  that have no ſtanding affections in their hearts. They are like a man in a fever, that when the diſtemper is on him, he may be ſtronger by farre, then he

is in his ordinary courſe; now this is not the naturall ſtrength of the man, but onely the violence of his diſtemper, and the decay of nature. Juſt ſo the violence that ſome men have, doth not argue a ſtrength of grace, but a decreaſe of grace rather. And ſo much for the ſecond ground of that miſtake.</p>
            <p>A third ground upon which many miſtake, is this. Becauſe God gives them <note place="margin">A third ground confuted.</note> the mercy they aske: Now they thinke God would not give them what they ask, if he did not hear and accept their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: But neither is this a good ground, and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. God may give you mercy, not as  a returne of prayer, but as a fruit of his generall providence, whereby he doth take care for all his creatures; God giveh meat even to the Ravens that crie unto him. The Lord gives to every thing their meat in due ſeaſon. God heares the cries of the meaneſt of all his creatures in the time of need.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. God may hear thee, and grant thy requeſt in wrath, and not in mercy; So  it was with the Iſraelites; they were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that government that God had ſet over them, and they were very importunate to have a King; Nothing would ſatisfie them but a King. They refuſed to heare the voice of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſaid, nay, but we
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54214:74"/>
will have a King. Well, God heares their requeſt, and grants it, and gives them a King. Might they thence conclude, ſurely their prayers were accepted of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God did give them what they deſired? No, God tells us the quite contrary, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13. 11. <hi>I gave thee a King in mine anger.</hi> So in the 78. <hi>Pſal.</hi> The Iſraelites were very deſirous of meat. God heard them; <hi>Verſe</hi> 29. 30, 31. <hi>So they did eat and were filled, for he gave them their own deſire. They were not eſtranged from their luſt; but while the meat was in their mouthes, the wrath of God came upon them, and ſlew the fatteſt of them, and ſmote down the choſen men of Iſrael;</hi> So that Gods giving of a man the mercie he wants, is no argument to a man, to conclude that God accepts his prayers.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. If God hath heard thee, it may be  it is in temporall favours, but not in ſpirituall mercies. God gives thee a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall mercie, but he denies thee ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall mercies. It may be thou haſt begged riches, and God hath granted thee this requeſt, to make thee rich in the world; It may be thou haſt deſired honour, and thou art raiſed to places of honour; But remember thou doeſt beg Chriſt, thou doſt beg grace and glory; if God doth not give thee theſe, thou ſhalt never ſee the face of God; and conſider, what will all theſe doe thee good? They will but feed thee
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54214:74"/>
ſat for the day of ſlaughter, and make thee a ſweet morſell for wormes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills. Now conſider, what benefit this will be to thee, to have riches, pleaſures, and worldly contentments, and they prove a ſnare to thee. So then it is no juſt ground for a man to conclude, that he hath prayed aright, becauſe God hath anſwered him. That is the third ground.</p>
            <p>A fourth ground of mens preſumption, of the goodneſſe and acceptableneſſe of <note place="margin">A fourth ground confuted.</note> their prayers is this; they pray by heart, and not by booke, they uſe not ſet formes, they pray <hi>ex tempore.</hi> But this alſo is but a falſe ground, as appeares by theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is poſſible, and uſuall too for men to pray without booke, and yet without heart too. A man may pray a third way, he may pray, and yet neither pray with books, nor with heart, he may pray by the ſtrength of naturall parts, as I told you even now.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A man may pray without a forme, and yet make but a formall prayer. A formall prayer is not to uſe a forme of words; for that Jeſus Chriſt did; he prayed three times, ſaying the ſame words. A man may poſſibly uſe a forme of words, and yet not be formall. And on the other, a man may be formall, and yet not uſe a forme of words; that is, he may pray,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54214:75"/>
and yet not have his heart and affections wrought upon in that prayer.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Prayer is not a worke of the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,  invention or expreſſion, but a worke of the heart. Prayer doth not conſiſt in varietie of phraſes, or change of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and expreſſion uſed in prayer, but a worke on the affections. God doth not account that to be a prayer that doth not come from the heart, and is not accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the heart; And therefore you finde this expreſſion concerning the Saints prayers formerly; <hi>Hannah</hi> poured out her ſoule before the Lord; and ſo the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,</hi> he is ſaid to poure out his heart; and the Iſraelites are ſaid to poure out their hearts like water before the Lord. So that this proves to be a falſe bottome. And ſo much for the firſt uſe of Caution.</p>

            <p n="2">2. It may be thou doſt compare their expreſſion with thine affection, it may be there is more in thy affections, then in all the multitude of their expreſſions. Thou are not to compare thy affections with the multitude of other mens words.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54214:77"/>
that all men ſhould grow in grace alike. To this purpoſe I may apply, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 11. 17. <hi>Mattaniah the ſon of Micha,</hi>

God doth not intend that all ſhould be alike in grace, or gifts; God hath his firſt, ſecond, and third; one may fall ſhort of another, and yet all have truth of grace, yea, all have ſome growth in grace. Another may pray better, and yet thou pray well; Another may pray more affectionately, and yet thou pray as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably in the ſight of God: ſo much for Anſwer to the firſt reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Many a poore ſoule may ſay, I can remember ſince I could pray better, and <note place="margin">2. Reaſon confuted</note> more largely. Now if I could pray bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter formerly then now, I am now grown remiſſe, and want this holy importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But this is no ſound reaſon; for</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. It may be thou hadſt formerly more affection, but leſſe judgement, leſſe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,  leſſe ſpiritualneſſe in thy prayers. It may be now thou art more ſound in knowledge, thou makeſt a more inward progreſſe in holineſſe; thou canſt now make a more inward prayer to God, thou haſt now more inward communion with God. Now if this be ſo, thou haſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54214:77"/>
no cauſe to be diſcouraged. God loves a judicious prayer, as well as a large and affectionate prayer; you ſee what you want one way, you make up another way. A young carpenter gives more blowes, and makes more chips, but an old and experienced workman doth the moſt and the beſt worke. A young Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian can play more quickly and nimbly upon an inſtrument, but an old Muſitian hath more skill.</p>

It may be thou didſt formerly live under the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of an able godly miniſter. Now thou haſt loſt that opportunity. And ſo there are ſeverall other helps, that peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are now taken away from thee,</p>
            <p n="4">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54214:78"/>
now, yet ought not this to be matter of diſcouragement to thee.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it doth not proceed from a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary careleſſeneſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be not accompanied with hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and inſenſibleneſſe.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Another ground of doubting to the <note place="margin">A third Reaſon confuted.</note> people of God is this. They complaine they have not thoſe inlarged expreſſions in prayer, which Gods people uſe to have. For anſwer conſider theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. This hath many times been the caſe  of Gods own people, that they have wanted expreſſions, they could not finde a vent for their affections. Thus it was with <hi>Hannah,</hi> ſhe ſpake in her heart, but ſhe was not able to expreſſe her ſelfe. So it was with holy <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 77. 4. <hi>I am</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. It is better to have affections with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out  expreſſions, then expreſſions without affections. God lookes more to the deſires of the heart then the words of the mouth. It may be what thou wanteſt of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is made up in affection.</p>
            <p n="3">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
3. It may be what is wanting in words,  is made up in life; as thou art defective in expreſſion, ſo thou makeſt a recompence in converſation; and that is the beſt expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that can be. It is much better to live a prayer then to expreſſe a prayer. It is good to pray for grace, but it is better to live a life of grace. It is good to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, but it is better to live againſt ſin.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for anſwer to the third doubt.</p>
            <p>A fourth ground of doubting is this: <note place="margin">A fourth Reaſon confuted.</note> Many a diſconſolate Chriſtian is apt to ſay, I am troubled with wandring thoughts; with deadneſſe and dulneſſe of heart in prayer.</p>
            <p>I confeſs thy caſe is ſad, and to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for, and it is juſt matter of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: Yet even here is matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>

            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Though God doth give unto wicked men more then their hearts can wiſh, yet  God doth not give it as any return of prayer, but onely as fruits of general and common providence, as they are his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whom he will preſerve.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. God may give wicked men more then  their hearts can wiſh, and this is not in mercy, but in wrath. They may receive mercies, but not as mercies, not in mercy. And there are four demonſtrations when God hears a man in wrath.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. When he asks any thing of God that  is ſinful in its own nature; as the denial of it is an act of mercy, ſo the grant of it is a fruit of Gods anger. God doth many <note place="margin">Concedit i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus, quod negat propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</note> times give thoſe things in his anger, which he denies when he is well pleaſed. God will not hear his own people according to their wills, but according to his own will. It is in this caſe, as it is with a father, when his child, for want of knowledg, asks a knife of him, by which he may cut his fingers; the father will not give him the knife, except it be in wrath. So a man may ask mercies at the hand of God, and it may
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54214:81"/>
be God will give them in wrath to cut themſelves with them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. If you ask thoſe things of God, which though  they are not ſinful in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet if thy asking of theſe lawful things be to an unlawful end, God will deny theſe in mercy; and when he gives them it is in wrath. As if thou deſireſt temporal mercies to abuſe them to drunkeneſſe, or to live in any other ſin and wickedneſſe; if God give thee thoſe mercies, tis as a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his wrath to thee. So it was in the 78. Pſalm v. 18. <hi>They tempted God in their hearts,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 18.</note> 
               <hi>and asked meat for their luſt.</hi> There was the end of their deſires. They deſired a lawful thing for unlawful ends; But what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed? The wrath of God: <hi>For while the meat was in their mouthes, the wrath of God came upon them,</hi> verſ. 30, 31. <note place="margin">V. 30, 31. 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If you ask any thing of God, and he gives it in wrath, you may know by this; if it be an occaſion of ſin to thee, it is given thee in wrath. So it was with the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, even now mentioned, the meat that God gave them proved an occaſion of ſin, verſ. 32.<hi>—they ſinned ſtill, and believed not his wondrous works.</hi> When the mercies <note place="margin">Verſ. 32.</note> you enjoy becomes fuel to your luſts, thoſe mercies are accompanied with the curſe and wrath of God; and this uſing of mercies will turn to the aggravation of wrath.</p>

4. Mercies are given thee in wrath, when the enjoyment of them hinders thee from  the receit of greater mercies from God. Thus it was with the Devils, Matth. 8. 31, <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 31, 32.</note> 32. They beſought Chriſt that they might go into the Herd of Swine: Chriſt granted them that, he let them enter into ſwine, that they might not enter into men. When the giving of temporal mercies, hinders thee from the receit of ſpiritual mercies, they are given in wrath. There are many men to whom God gives temporal mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, they have riches in abundance, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at will, every thing they can deſire; but theſe mercies take off their thoughts and affections from better things; by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe they looſe Chriſt, and grace, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and eternal happineſſe. Now in theſe caſes, though God doth give mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, yet they are given in wrath; and ſo notwithſtanding this objection, the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Gods people, is much greater then the priviledg of wicked men.</p>
            <p>But it may be further objected and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; If this be ſo, that mercies are given to wicked men in wrath, and by a common providence,<note place="margin">

quicken the heart to beg for other mercies at the hands of God: when the mercy ſhall make thee more to love prayer, more to uſe prayer. This you finde proved by <hi>Davids</hi> experience, Pſal. 116. 2. <hi>Becauſe he hath</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 2.</note> 
               <hi>heard my voice, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</hi> You ſee here, becauſe God had heard <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, and given him the mercy he begged, he makes an argument, and an engagement to himſelf to pray as long as hee lived. So that to continue prayer, is a means to get more mercy; and the leaving off of prayer when you have a mercy, is a means to looſe that which you have obtained at the hands of God. But as for the wicked it is not ſo with them. Mercies received onely from a common, or general providence, have no ſuch efficacy, as you may ſee, Job 21. 7, 8, &amp;c. there <hi>Job</hi> tells you,<hi>—the wicked live, become old, yea,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job 21. 7, 8, &amp;c.</note>

Their bull gendereth, and faileth not, their cow calveth, and caſteth not her calf.</hi> And ſo he goes on, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing that happy condition that wicked men were in, and how God followed them with mercy after mercy. Well, what was the effect of this? Did this engage them to call upon God? Did this make them in love with prayer? No, it had a quite
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54214:82"/>
contrary effect, verſ. 14. <hi>Therefore they ſay</hi>

Mercies that are given as returns of prayer, do not onely make a man conſider  that they are from God, but drawes the heart to God, and put a man upon imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the ſervice, and to the honour of God. This we finde to be the temper of <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 Sam. 1. 27, 28. <hi>Hanuah</hi> had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 27, 28.</note> for a child, God gave her a ſon. Now what doth ſhe with this mercy? Obſerve, <hi>For this child I prayed, and the Lord hath granted my petition,—Therefore have I lent him to the Lord; as long as hee liveth.</hi> Seeing God hath heard my prayer and granted my requeſt, therefore will I give this mercy to God, to be imployed in this ſervice. So 1 Joh. 3. 22. <hi>And whatſoever we ask we receive of him, becauſe we keep his commandements, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 22.</note> 
               <hi>do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight.</hi> You ſee it is made an evidence, that what we receive is received as an anſwer to our askings; becauſe we make thoſe mercies helps to obedience to keep Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. But now mercies that come from a common providence, do not draw out the heart towards God; they rather draw them out towards ſin; as it was in the forementioned Iſraelites, Pſalm 78.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54214:83"/>
though God did give them their hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, yet were they not eſtranged from their luſt.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Mercies come from God as returns of  prayer, when they make you more to rejoyce in the God that hears your prayers, and gives you the mercy, then in the mercy you receive from God. Thus you finde it was in <hi>Hannah,</hi> ſhe asked a ſon, and God gave her a ſon, yet ſhe ſaith, 1 Sam. 2. 1. <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 1.</note> 
               <hi>My heart rejoyceth in the Lord.</hi> God gave her a ſon, ſhe rejoyced in that mercy, but ſhe rejoyced more in the God that gave it. So it was with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 85. 6. <hi>Wilt thou not</hi>

               <hi>revive us again, that thy people may rejoyce in thee?</hi> We will not rejoyce chiefly in the mercy, but in thee. But on the contrary, thoſe that receive mercies out of the basket of common providence, they rejoyce more in the mercy then in the God of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; they rejoyce in their wealth and glory, in the multitude of their riches; but as for God they bid him depart from them; they cannot rejoyce in God.</p>

his language is, This I have laboured for; this I have ventured my life for; this my friends left me; this I got by my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, providence, &amp; induſtry: thus they ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to their own nets; but ſeldom ſay, This is the return of prayers, this is the gift of God.</p>

That mercy that is given as a return of  prayer, is enjoyed with more inward quiet, and contentment of minde, then when it is given in by general providence. When <hi>Eli</hi> told <hi>Hannah</hi> that ſhe ſhould have a ſon, and that her prayer was heard, ſhe had ſo much inward joy and contentment of minde, that is ſaid, <hi>Hannah went away rejoycing; and her countenance was no more ſad:</hi> The conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that made her very much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. The reaſon is, becauſe mercies that are given in as returns of prayer, they are given in with a bleſſing, and inward quite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and contentment of minde. The mercies that God gives his own people, he gives them with joy and comfort, Prov 10. <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 22.</note> 22. <hi>The bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich, and he addeth no ſorrow to it.</hi> You read, 1 Chron. 4. 10. <hi>And Jabez called on the God of Iſrael,</hi>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54214:84"/>
grief to it. <hi>Iſaac</hi> he prayed for his wife, and God gave her to him to be a great comfort to him. It may be wicked men have wives and no content with them, but ſorrow added to them, becauſe they did not pray for them as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did; they have children, but ſorrow with them; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of riches, and ſorrow added to that; and all becauſe they have not the mercies as returns of prayer. The mercies that are given in a way of general provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, uſually are accompanied with vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atiouſneſſe and diſcontent, ſnares and ſorrowes mingled with the mercies. So it was, Pſal. 106. 15. <hi>He gave them their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, but he ſent leanneſs into their ſouls.</hi> God <note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 15.</note> gives wicked men indeed their requeſts; but how is it, with a bleſſing and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? No, no ſuch matter, they have a curſe with it. You know <hi>Saul</hi> gave <hi>Michal</hi> to <hi>David</hi> to be a ſnare to him, a croſſe and diſcontentment.

Mercies that come as returns of  prayer, may be known by this, If they are given in the time, when God doth draw out thine heart to ſeek him in holy duties.

and he came and knocked at the door of the houſe, where they were aſſembled. This was an evident ſigne, that God gave in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to them as a return of prayer. So <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 31. <hi>When they had prayed, the place was</hi>

Thus we read of <hi>Luther;</hi> That there was a young man that had made a Covenant, and ſealed a Bond with his own blood, to give himſelf, ſoul and body to the Devil; onely to live in pleaſure, and to do and have whatſoever he did deſire.

And laſtly, Mercies are given as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of prayers, in caſe you make care and  conſcience, to perform to God thoſe vowes which you made to God before you did enjoy the mercy. But when we promiſe God largely before we have the mercy, and when we have them, do not perform our vowes, it is an argument we have the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by general and common providence: Job 22. 27, 28. <hi>Thou ſhalt make thy prayer unto him, and he ſhall hear thee; and thou ſhalt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job. 22. 27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>pay thy vowes: thou ſhalt alſo decree a thing, and it ſhall be eſtabliſhed unto thee; and the light ſhall ſhine upon thy wayes.</hi> When thou beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt a mercy, and ſaieſt, Lord give me ſuch a mercy, and I will do thus and thus; I will walk ſo and ſo before thee, I will improve them to thy glory. Now when thou ſhalt thus ask for mercy, and make vowes to God, he will hear; but then thou muſt be ſure to perform thy vowes. This frame of heart we finde to be in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. <note place="margin">Pſal. 66. 13, 14.</note> 66. 13, 14. <hi>I will go into thine houſe with burnt offerings, I will pay thee my vowes which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath ſpoken when I was in trouble.</hi> You ſee <hi>David</hi> was
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54214:86"/>
in trouble, and he prayed to God, and made ſome promiſes and vowes, in caſe God would deliver him. Now God did deliver him out of trouble, and hee did make good his vowes. Now here was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of prayer. <hi>David</hi> you ſee did not grow ſecure and careleſſe, but he made conſcience to pay what he had promiſed to God. And ſo you ſee how you may diſcover, whether the mercies you receive from God be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of prayer, or onely fruits of common and general providence. And ſo much for Anſwer to that Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Another Objection, or caſe of conſcience is this; <hi>How can this be true, that God gives</hi>

               <hi>his people more then they need, ſeeing it is the complaint of Gods people many times, that they have been a long time begging mercy, and God doth not give them ſo much as they deſire.

God ſhould have his glory, and thou be without the mercy, then that thou ſhouldſt have the mercy, and God want his glory. An eminent inſtance of this you have, Joh. II. There was a prayer made by <hi>Mary</hi> and <note place="margin">Joh. II.</note>

I anſwer, It may be thou doſt not hear  God in his commands, and then it is no wonder God doth not hear thee in thy prayers. If thou doſt not hearken to the call of God, it may be expected that God ſhould not hearken to thy call. See Prov. 1. 24. <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed, I have</hi>

               <hi>would not hear, ſo they cryed, and I would not hear, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> It may be God hath been calling upon thee this many years to believe and to repent; to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, to forſake the evil of your doings; and thou haſt not heatd his calling; his mercies have not drawn thee; his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have not affrighted thee: and is it not juſt with God to let thee call, and he not hear thee?</p>
            <p n="3">

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54214:87"/>
he doth, as it were, deſire him to ſay him nay. So when man askes mercies of God, careleſsly and indifferently, this provokes God to give no anſwer. It may be thou prayeſt ſleepily and drouzily, and with a wandring heart: And doſt thou think God will hear that prayer, that thou doſt not hear thy ſelf? Doſt thou think that God will accept of that prayer, when thou knoweſt not what thou ſayeſt?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. God may give thee a mercy, and thou through thy incredulity, impatiency, and  inobſervancie, not minde the returns that God gives. God may hear thy prayers, and yet thou not take any notice of it. This you may ſee in <hi>Job,</hi> Job 9. 16, 17. <hi>If I have called and God anſwered, yet I will not believe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Job 9. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>that God hath heard me, becauſe thou breakeſt me with thy tempeſt—Job</hi> was in a fit of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and unbelief. And though God did give him returns of prayer, yet hee would not, did not obſerve them.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. God may deny thee the mercy, not that he is unable, or unwilling to hear thee  or relieve thee; but to make thee the more deſirous of, and ſo the more fit for mercy. It may be yet thou art not fit for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. The Philoſopher beg'd ſome mony of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> he gave him a Drachme: He ſaid, It is not for a King to give ſo little, a Talent had been a more ſutable gift. The King replied, Though a Talent is fit for me
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54214:88"/>
to give, yet thou art not fit to receive. So though God is alwaies fit and ready to give an anſwer to our prayers, yet we are not alwaies fit and ready to receive it. God bids us open our mouths wide, and I will fill it. God denies us, that we may open our mouths the wider, and enlarge our deſires the more after mercy. The Lord doth by his people, as a father by his child; a father may ſeem to withdraw and hide himſelf from his child, to try its love to him; and the child begins to mourn and cry, yet the father comes not to the child; but when he hears the child cry aloud, then he comes to it and takes it up in his arms. So the Lord many times, ſees his people pray, but he ſeems to withdraw from them, to hide himſelf from the prayers of his people; and goes as it were out of their ſight, until they begin to cry aloug, to be very earneſt and importunate in their prayers, till their deſires be enlarged to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; and then God graciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns their prayers into their boſom. Now this is a very good reaſon, why God denies the prayers of his people. Deſires defer'd, <note place="margin">Deſideria dilata creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt at cito data vileſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt.</note> grow the ſtronger; but if the mercies be ſoon given, the deſires grow cold, and the mercy growes contemptible. Mannah lightly come, is lightly ſet by. God doth by us as a Fiſher-man doth, he drawes back the bait, that ſo the Fiſh may come after it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54214:88"/>
the more eagerly, and bite the harder. God ſeemes to draw back a mercy, that wee may more earneſtly purſue it.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. Conſider this that Gods people have prayed and waited a long time, before God  hath given them the mercy they have asked, before God hath given them an anſwer of their prayers. God promiſed <hi>Abraham</hi> a ſon, that from him ſhould proceed ſuch an one, in whom all the families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed, that his ſeed ſhould be multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the ſtarres in the firmament; and yet it was fifteene yeares betweene the time of Gods making him that promiſe, and the accompliſhment of it. So likewiſe you finde it in <hi>Zacbariab</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they prayed for a Childe at the firſt beginning of their marriage, now God did heare their cryes and prayers; yet he did not give them a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne till they were old and ſtricken in yeares. So likewiſe it was with the Church, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Alſo when I cry and ſhout be ſhutteth out my prayer.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 44. <hi>Thou haſt</hi>

Conſider this for thy comfort, that  thy perſon may be accepted and thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers heard, and yet the thing thou prayeſt for not granted to thee. An inſtance of this you have in Chriſt himſelfe, he prayed, <hi>Father if it be poſſible let this cup paſſe from me,</hi> Mat. 26. <note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> yet this cup did not paſſe from him, but he did drink of it, and yet it is ſaid that Chriſt <hi>was heard in all that he prayed for,</hi> Heb. 5. 7. <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note>

Moſes</hi> did importunately deſire that hee might ſee the Land, and goe over <hi>Jordan</hi> to poſſeſſe it. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a godly man, and here he prayes for this mercy, but yet God was angry with him, &amp; bad him pray no more. God bad him goe up into the Mount and ſee the Land, but told him he ſhould not goe over. So when thou askeſt a particular mercy at the hand of God, God may deny
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54214:89"/>
them that mercy, and yet heare their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and accept their perſons.</p>

God may deny thee the mercy thou askeſt, and give thee a better in the roome  of it, he makes you to open your mouthes the wider, that he may give you the greater mercies. <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> might live. Now God did not heare his prayer in that as <hi>Abraham</hi> did deſire it, but he gave him <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and with him he eſtabliſhed the Covenant, which was a better mercy. <hi>Moſes</hi> was denied in his requeſt to go into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but he was tranſlated into a better place, into the true <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Kingdome of heaven.</p>

God may denie what we pray for in mercy, which ſhould he grant it would be  a token of his wrath; as if a man ſhould aske that which was ſinfull, or that which would be an unavoydable occaſion of ſin, or if he ſhould aske it for ſinfull ends, or in caſe a man ask that that would be a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſhame; all which caſes I have ſpoken to before, and therefore ſhall now ſay no more.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Thy mercies are double mercies: It  is a mercy to have mercy, but to have it in ſuch a way, is a double mercy, Pſal. 91. <hi>They ſhall call upon me, and I will anſwer them; and I will be with him in trouble,</hi> &amp;c. It is a

mercy to have deliverance out of trouble; but to have it through prayer, a deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that comes in by prayer, is a double, mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Theſe mercies are ſanctified mercies.  Mercies as you are creatures are good, but as returns of prayer they are ſanctified: And bleſt mercies, are much better to the ſoul that enjoyeth them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The mercies which thou haſt, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of prayer, are coſtly mercies. Mercies  that come in by providence, are eaſie and cheap, but mercies that come in by prayer are coſtly; they coſt the price of Chriſts blood to purchaſe them; and they coſt thee many a prayer and tear to obtain them.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. It is a ſeal to thee of an intereſt in Chriſts interceſſion.

            <p n="3">
