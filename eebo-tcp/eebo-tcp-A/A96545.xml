            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Prince of Orange's LETTER TO THE KING.</head>
            <p>HOVV great our Devotions have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been to your Majeſties Service in theſe Parts, we believe may be ſufficiently known, both by our ſo Faithful Service to your Majeſty, and by thoſe Favours which in lieu thereof, you have upon all Occaſions ſo Graciouſly conferred upon us; the ſame Zeal makes us now perhaps tranſgreſs the Rules of Reverence, that we may not prove faulty in thoſe of Loyalty. (Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty) at your Departure, left the Government of theſe Provinces to the <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> ſo vertuous a Princeſs, as ſhe hath fully the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of ſo worthy a Choice. It was believed that the Biſhop of <hi>Auras,</hi> now Cardinal, was left with her, to Counſel and Adviſe her, and not to be <hi>Arbiter</hi> in the Government, but he arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating unto himſelf the abſolute Diſpoſal of all things, and leaving nothing of Regent to the Dutcheſs, but the bare Name, diſpoſes of theſe Provinces, as he would do of his own private Houſe; He orders all things as he pleaſes, he handles and reſolves the weighty <hi>Affairs,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Knowledg of the Councel of State, and doth this ſo Imperiouſly, and with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all the Nobility, as the manner is more Odious, than the thing it ſelf. If the Evils which enſue from hence, did terminate in our own private Offences, we might at laſt reſolve to bare with them; but experience doth ſhew dayly more and more, that this Malady is already become Publick, and that not ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the Court, it certainiy paſſes, and breaks out into all the Provinces, with ſure and great danger, that the effects will ſtill prove worſe, as long as the Cardinal <hi>Granville</hi> ſhall tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſo long will theſe Inconveniencies and Diſorders Increaſe; and becauſe they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance in time ariſe to ſuch a height, that it will be too late to remove him from hence; We therefore have thought it ſuited with the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which the candour of our fidelity, and the Condition of our ſeveral Imployments, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth upon us to acquaint Your Majeſty with what hath been ſaid, to the end, that you may apply ſuch Remedy as is neceſſary, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conſiſts in taking the Cardinal from <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> as ſoon as may be; thoſe who are here of the beſt ſort, and generally all the reſt of the Provinces are of our Opinion: in which let not the Cardinal boaſt himſelf that he deſires the integrity of theſe Countries more then we: for we may rather juſtly glory, that had it not been for us the Liberties thereof would have been much more damnified and diminiſhed in them.</p>

            <p>I <hi>Am glad that I can Attribute all that which you have written touching Cardinal</hi> Granvill, <hi>to the particular reſpect of My Service. I commend your Zeal and am well pleaſed with the Courage; but on the other ſide I do not uſe for any Complaint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be made by others, to bereave any Officers of Mine and his Employments, without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſpeak for himſelf. Moreover it is fitting in Buſineſs of this Nature, to come from generalities to particular Offences, to the end that if the Accuſed cannot juſtifie himſelf, his Puniſhment may be the greater; but becauſe theſe are things which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may better be diſcuſt by word of mouth then by Letters, I think it beſt that you to that purpoſe come over to me in Perſon, with aſſurance of being here by me, both willingly heard and Honotrably receiv'd.</hi> See C. <hi>Bentev<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
