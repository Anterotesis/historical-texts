            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving formerly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated two Essays to the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> of the Anatomy of Plants; and both with good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance: and Your Majesty like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, upon Your view of them, having been pleased to speak well
<pb facs="tcp:34857:3"/>
of the same: I am now embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened most humbly to present a Third into Your Own Royal Hands.</p>
            <p>By which Your Majesty will find; That there are <hi>Terrae In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitae</hi> in Philosophy, as well as Geography: For the discovery of this Part whereof, I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to make an Adventure. And I may, without vanity, say thus much, That it was my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to be the first that ever gave a Map of the Country.</p>
            <p>Your Majesty will here see, That there are those things, which are little less admirable within a Plant, than within an Animal. That a Plant, as well
<pb facs="tcp:34857:3"/>
as an Animal, is constituted of several Organical Parts; some whereof may be called its Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. That every Plant hath Bowels of divers kinds, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers kinds of Liquors. That even a Plant lives partly upon Air; for the reception whereof, it hath peculiar Organs. So that a Plant is, as it were, an Animal in Queers; even as an Animal is a Plant, or rather several Plants, bound up into one Volume.</p>
            <p>Again, that all the said Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Bowels or other Parts, are as artificially made; and as punctually, for their Place and Number, composed together; as
<pb facs="tcp:34857:4"/>
all the Mathematical Lines of a Flower or Face. That the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Stuff is so exquisitely fine, that no Silkworm is able to draw so small a Thred. So that one who walks about with the meanest stick, holds a Piece of Natures Handicraft in his hand, which far surpasses the most ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate Woof, or Needlework in the World.</p>
            <p>That by all these Means, the Ascent of the Sap; the Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the Air; the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of several sorts of Liquors, as Lymphas, Milks, Oyls, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms; with other Acts of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, are all contrived and brought about in a Mechanical
<pb facs="tcp:34857:4"/>
way. In sum, Your Majesty will find, that we are come ashore into a new World, whereof we see no end.</p>

Lordship. You being, in some sense, His Majesties Chancellor in these Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and having highly justif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ed his choice of you, by that great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Integrity you have upon all occasions shewed herein.</p>
            <p>One Instance whereof hath been afforded us by this present Subject, <hi>sc.</hi> the Anatomy of Plants. Which having been some years since under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took; and since then Additions made thereunto; and both published by the Advice of the Royal Society, and the Order of their Council, wherein your Lordship presides: Your Lordship hath thought fit, notwithstanding, lately to give the same Order for the publishing of a like undertaking, by another (indeed a most accurate) Hand. As well knowing, That it would be no disadvantage to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of those Matters, which were so new and strange, to be offered to the World from a twofold Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb facs="tcp:34857:7"/>
For one, although he have no mind to deceive, yet may sooner be deceived, than two may be. Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally living in divers Countrys, and having had no correspondence. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that although the same Subject be prosecuted by two Hands; yet would it be still more Illustrated by the various Examples of Both. As also, that like as in other matters, so here the defects of both the Undertakers, would mutually be supplied.</p>
            <p>Of these, with Your Lordships leave, I shall give some Instances. In the third Chapter of my first Book I have assigned an Aerial Content to those I here call the Air-vessels; and in the second Chapter of that Book, have given a description of them. Yet so far only, as the unassisted eye would discover: having resolved, for divers reasons, to reserve the Microscopical Part for a second at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. But what could not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb facs="tcp:34857:8"/>
by the bare eye, the Learned <hi>Marcellus Malpighius,</hi> by the help of Glasses, did in his first Book (which the Learned Mr. <hi>Oldenburge</hi> calleth his Idea) superadd, <hi>sc.</hi> their Spiral Texture. By which Observation, I do say, in the words of the Learned <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the like occasion, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecisse me non diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>eor, quin gaudeo etiam glori√≥rque.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner, such observations as Signior <hi>Malpighi</hi> had not inserted into his first Book, were to be found in my first. As for example, A descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Florid Attire, in all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymbiferous, and other similar Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: of the Acetary in the center of all sorts of Pears: of the Stone in all sorts of Plums: of a third and inmost Cover, found in almost all Seeds whatsoever, and often analogous to a Secundine: The prodigious swelth of the Covers (especially in Stone Fruits) upon the Generation of the
<pb facs="tcp:34857:8"/>
seed, and their contraction afterwards; after the manner of the Womb in some Animals: with divers others: some whereof are now to be found in Signior <hi>Malpighi</hi>'s second Book, and some are there still wanting. The same worthy person being now plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed likewise, to use the self same Names which, having procured my Book (sent him by the Learned Mr. <hi>Oldenburge</hi>) to be translated into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, he saw I did therein give to some of the said described Parts.</p>
            <p>Again to his observation of the spiral Texture of the Air-vessels, in my second Book I have added a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther description of the said Vessels.</p>
            <p>Once more, whereas saying little of Roots, he hath applyed himself chiefly to discourse of Trunks: on the contrary, in my second Book, I have made it my business, to treat more largely, and to give the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative Anatomy of Roots. For this
<pb facs="tcp:34857:9"/>
amongst other reasons, that hereby the nature of both Parts might be still more fully and perspicuously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented betwixt us Both.</p>
            <p>Upon the consideration of all which I am, my Lord, very sensible, as of that great Justice you have done to the Subject treated of; so honour to my self, in having assigned unto me so eminent a Collegue.</p>
            <p>As to the following Anatomy, I shall give your Lordship the trouble of noting; That I have varied from Signior <hi>Malpighi</hi> in, I think, all the Examples here exhibited. As also, that some progress is here made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what your Lordship will find in the abovesaid Learned Author. As for example, in a further discovery of the Fabrick or Structure of the Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeducts; of the Air-vessels; and of the Pith: and in sundry particulars more. For which reason, I thought it more proper to follow the said
<pb facs="tcp:34857:9"/>
worthy Author, in the publishing hereof, rather than to precede him: although the Figures, your Lordship may remember, were presented to the Royal Society long ago, and most of them two years since. Lastly, that I have chosen to give my examples chiefly in the transverse Section; whereas those of Signior <hi>Malpighi,</hi> are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in cutting by the length. Which I have done chiefly for this reason, Because, that as the Variety of the parts (as to Size, Number, and Position) in every species; so their Regularity and Constancy in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals of each, are this way, much more clearly and certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented. Without a distinct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark of which circumstances, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the various kinds of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors in Plants, and divers other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, cannot possibly be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. All which your Lordship will best observe, by comparing our seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Figures together.</p>

               <p>And, for examples sake, I shall in the first place, describe the <hi>Trunks</hi> of six seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kinds of <hi>Plants,</hi> as they appear to, and are observeable by the naked eye. Which having done, I shall next proceed to a more particular Description of divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <hi>Trunks</hi> and <hi>Branches</hi> as they appear through the Microscope I made use of. In both shewing, not only what their several <hi>Parts</hi> are, as belonging to a <hi>Branch;</hi> but also by a comparative prospect, in what respects they are specifically distinguished one from another, in the several species of <hi>Branches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>LET</hi> the First <hi>Trunk</hi> then to be descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, be that of <hi>Borage:</hi> in a <hi>slice</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cut transversly, appears, first a tough, yet fine and transparent <hi>Skin.</hi> Within this <hi>Skin</hi> there is also a slender <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Sap-Vessels:</hi> which, without being crushed in the least, do yield a <hi>Lympha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next standeth the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Bark.</hi> Which is every where made up of a great number of very small <hi>Bubles</hi> or <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicles.</hi> Upon the inner <hi>Verge</hi> of this <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma,</hi> standeth another <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Sap-Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels:</hi> which also yeild a <hi>Lympha;</hi> and that different, as is probable, from the <hi>Lympha</hi> in the utmost <hi>Ring.</hi> Hitherto goes the <hi>Bark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Adjacent to the <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Sap-Vessels,</hi> on the inner <hi>Verge</hi> of the <hi>Bark;</hi> stand the <hi>Air-Vessels,</hi> on the outer <hi>Verge</hi> of the <hi>Pith.</hi> Not in a <hi>Ring;</hi> but in Several <hi>Parcels;</hi> some <hi>parcels</hi> in the figure of little <hi>specks;</hi> others in little <hi>arched</hi> lines, almost like an V

               <p>The <hi>Pith,</hi> in a well grown <hi>stalk,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hollow. But originally it is entire. It is wholly made up of a great number of <hi>Vesiculae;</hi> being pentangular, sexangular, and septangular. And most of them larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than those of the <hi>Bark;</hi> so as to be plainly visible to a naked eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>LET</hi> the next be <hi>Taraxacum,</hi> or <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delyon.</hi> In a <hi>slice</hi> whereof cut alike trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly, is seen, first a <hi>skin,</hi> then a simple, white, and close <hi>Parenchyma;</hi> made up like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of <hi>Vesiculae;</hi> but those exceeding small.</p>
               <p>Within this white and thick <hi>parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Ring,</hi> stand the <hi>Milk-vessels,</hi> in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral distinct <hi>Columns,</hi> of different size; each <hi>Column</hi> being made up of 7. or 8. <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched</hi> lines. Betwixt these <hi>Columns,</hi> run as many <hi>Diametral Portions,</hi> derived from the said white and thick <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> into or towards the <hi>Pith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next within these, stand the <hi>Air-vessels.</hi> Which are likewise divided, by the said <hi>Diametral Portions,</hi> into divers <hi>arched</hi> lines. The size of these <hi>Vessels,</hi> as well as their <hi>number</hi> is less than in <hi>Borage.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:34857:16"/>Within these stands the <hi>Pith,</hi> consisting of very small <hi>Bubles</hi> or <hi>Vesicles,</hi> as the <hi>Bark.</hi> 'Tis very small, the <hi>Diameter</hi> hereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing scarce one fifth of that of the <hi>Pith</hi> of <hi>Borage.</hi> But the <hi>Bark</hi> of <hi>Borage</hi> is not half so thick as this of <hi>Dandelyon.</hi>

                  <hi>A THIRD Trunk,</hi> shall be that of <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort.</hi> Wherein cut in like manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, may be observed, first a <hi>skin.</hi> Next to which, a very close and darkish <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma.</hi> Wherewith are mixed some few <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> which give it that hew.</p>
               <p>Within this stands a <hi>scalloped parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Ring,</hi> or a <hi>Ring</hi> of many short and slender white <hi>Arches.</hi> Which every where meeting together, run in so many white <hi>Diametral Portions</hi> into the <hi>Pith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next to the said white <hi>Arches,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the said <hi>Diametral portions</hi> stands as many small <hi>parcels</hi> of <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> like so many little <hi>half-ovals.</hi> Within each of which, is included a white <hi>Parenchyma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the inner <hi>verge</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> stands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother sort of <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> in one slender and entire <hi>Ring.</hi> And so far goes the <hi>Bark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next within this <hi>Ring</hi> stand the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> in several <hi>parcels,</hi> diametrically opposite to the said <hi>parenchymous parcels</hi> next without the <hi>Sap-Ring.</hi>

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:34857:16"/>Last of all, and more within the <hi>Pith,</hi> stand the same kind of <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> as those of the <hi>Half-ovals.</hi> Both these, by small lines, run one into another; thus on both sides, hemming in the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king altogether, so many little <hi>Pyramids.</hi>

                  <hi>LET</hi> a fourth be <hi>Holyoak.</hi> Wherein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut as before, next to the <hi>skin</hi> stands the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> somewhat close; and, in proportion thick.</p>
               <p>Towards the inner <hi>verge</hi> hereof, stand one sort of <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> postur'd in short <hi>Rays.</hi> These <hi>Vessels</hi> yield a <hi>Mucilage.</hi> And on the inner <hi>verge</hi> of the <hi>Bark,</hi> stands a thin <hi>Ring</hi> of other <hi>Sap-vessels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next within the <hi>Bark</hi> stand the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> postur'd likewise in short <hi>Rays,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametrically opposite to those in the <hi>Bark.</hi> In every <hi>Ray,</hi> there are about 12. or 16. <hi>Vessels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, and more within the <hi>Pith,</hi> there stand other <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> all in very thin or slender <hi>Chords;</hi> thus hemming in the several <hi>parcels</hi> of <hi>Air-vessels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For</hi> a fifth, I will take that of wild <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumer.</hi> Wherein first of all next to the <hi>skin,</hi> there is a <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Sap-vessels.</hi> Which <hi>Ring</hi> is also made up of <hi>rays,</hi> all poynting to, and most of them terminating on the <hi>skin.</hi>

               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>LET</hi> the sixth be the <hi>Trunk</hi> of <hi>Endive.</hi> In which, next to the <hi>skin,</hi> there is, first a thick and simple <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> Then there is a kind of <hi>undulated Ring</hi> of <hi>Milk-vessels.</hi> Within which stand a sort of <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> in several <hi>parcels,</hi> some in <hi>arched half-ovals,</hi> others in short slender <hi>rays.</hi> Betwixt these <hi>parcels,</hi> many of the <hi>Milk-vessels</hi> likewise stand.</p>
               <p>Next there is an <hi>undulated Ring</hi> of other <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> parting, as in most <hi>Trunks,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Bark</hi> and the <hi>pith.</hi> Within which are the <hi>Air-vessels.</hi> And within these more <hi>Sap-vessels.</hi> Both of them in small <hi>specks,</hi> answerable, or opposite to the <hi>rays</hi> in the <hi>Bark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the <hi>parts</hi> of these six <hi>Trunks,</hi> may as I have now described them, be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, without a <hi>Microscope:</hi> excepting only the number of the <hi>Air vessels.</hi> Yet three

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>I <hi>NOW</hi> proceed to a more particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of several <hi>Trunks</hi> and <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> as they appear through the best <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscopes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Trunk,</hi> or <hi>Branch</hi> of every <hi>Tree</hi> hath three general <hi>parts</hi> to be descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; <hi>sc.</hi> the <hi>Bark,</hi> the <hi>Wood,</hi> and the <hi>Pith.</hi> That likewise of every <hi>Herhaceous Vegetable,</hi> hath either the same three <hi>parts;</hi> or els three <hi>parts</hi> analogous; <hi>sc.</hi> the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> the <hi>Lignous,</hi> and the <hi>Pithy parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Bark</hi> consisteth of two <hi>parts, sc.</hi> the outmost <hi>skin,</hi> and the <hi>main Body.</hi> The <hi>skin</hi> is generally composed of very small <hi>Vesicles</hi> or <hi>Bladders,</hi> cluster'd together. That is, originally; but as the <hi>Plant</hi> grows, the the <hi>skin</hi> dries, &amp; the said <hi>Bladders</hi> do very much shrink up and disappear.</p>
               <p>Amongst these <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>skin,</hi> there are usually intermixed a sort of <hi>Lignous Fibers,</hi> or <hi>Vessels,</hi> which run through the length of the <hi>skin;</hi> as in <hi>Mallow, Nettle,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:34857:18"/>
                  <hi>Borage, Thistle,</hi> and most <hi>Plants.</hi> Which is not only argued from the toughness of the <hi>skin</hi> by means of the said <hi>Vessels;</hi> but in some <hi>Plants</hi> may be plainly seen, as in <hi>Teas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>le.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether they are <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> or <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessels,</hi> is dubious. For on the one hand, because they emitt no <hi>Sap,</hi> or <hi>bleed</hi> not, 'tis propable that they are <hi>Air-vessels.</hi> On the other hand, they may be <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> notwithstanding. Because the non-emissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sap</hi> is not an infallible and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing argument of an <hi>Air-vessel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For there are some <hi>Plants</hi> which <hi>bleed</hi> not. Which yet are furnished with <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessels,</hi> as certainly as any others which <hi>bleed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>skin</hi> of the <hi>Trunk</hi> is sometimes visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly porous. But no where more, than in the better sort of walking <hi>Canes;</hi> where the <hi>pores</hi> are so big, as to be visible even to the naked eye; like to those upon the ends of our fingers. See Fig. 7.</p>
               <p>The <hi>main Body</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> consisteth likewise of two <hi>parts,</hi> sc. <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> and <hi>Vessels.</hi> The <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is made up of an innumerable company of small <hi>Bladders</hi> clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered together. Differing in nothing from those aforesaid in the <hi>skin;</hi> saving that they are much larger; and generally roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:34857:18"/>This <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> is the same as to its <hi>substance,</hi> both in the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Trunk.</hi> Yet as to the <hi>Texture</hi> of its <hi>parts,</hi> in the one, and in the other, there is this observeable difference, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the <hi>Bark</hi> of the <hi>Root</hi> cut transversly, the said <hi>Parenchyma</hi> is usually more or less, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed into <hi>Diametral rays;</hi> running through the <hi>Bark,</hi> after the same manner, as do the <hi>hour lines</hi> through the margin of the <hi>Dial-plat</hi> of a <hi>Clock</hi> or <hi>Watch.</hi> Whereas here in the <hi>Bark</hi> of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> the said <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma</hi> is rarely thus disposed into <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral Rays:</hi> nor when it is, are those <hi>rays</hi> continued to the circumference of the <hi>Bark;</hi> as in the <hi>Bark</hi> of the <hi>Root</hi> they frequently are. What is further observeable in the <hi>Texture</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> I shall shew in the description of the <hi>Pith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Bark,</hi> are as I shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so shew, diversifyed many ways. But there are some things, wherein in all sorts of <hi>Plants,</hi> they agree. First, in standing, most numerously, or near, the inner Margin of the <hi>Bark.</hi> Secondly, in being always, and only <hi>Sap-vessels.</hi> I have viewed so many, that at least, I can securely affirm thus much, that if there be any heteroclital <hi>Plants,</hi> wherein they are found otherwise, there is not one in five hundred. Thirdly,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34857:19"/>
in being always <hi>conjugated</hi> or <hi>braced</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the form of <hi>Net-work:</hi> although the number and distances of the <hi>braces,</hi> are very different: as I have already shewed by divers <hi>Figures</hi> in my <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Roots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Properties, whereby the said <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> are specificated and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished one from an other, both in the same <hi>Plant,</hi> and in the several species of <hi>Plants</hi> are very many. Which properties are not accidental, but such as shew the constant and universal design of nature. All which shall be demonstrated by several <hi>Figures,</hi> representing so many <hi>quarters</hi> of the <hi>slices</hi> of so many kinds of <hi>Branches</hi> cut transversly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST</hi> then, for the eight first <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> are only of <hi>two kinds.</hi> And those likewise only <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeducts.</hi> Yet in all the eight, they are in respect both of their <hi>proportion,</hi> and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> very different. So in <hi>Hazel</hi> and <hi>Ash</hi> they are but few. In <hi>Holly</hi> and <hi>Barberry</hi> more. In <hi>Apple, Pear, Plum, Elm,</hi> still more numerous. And of those three <hi>Fruits,</hi> in an <hi>Apple,</hi> or <hi>Plum,</hi> more than in a <hi>Pear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, as their <hi>proportion,</hi> so likewise their <hi>position</hi> is divers. For in <hi>Holly,</hi> the inner <hi>Vessels</hi> next to the <hi>wood</hi> stand in <hi>rays,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:34857:19"/>
Yet so thick together, as to make one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <hi>Ring.</hi> In <hi>Hazel,</hi> they stand more in oblong <hi>parcels.</hi> In <hi>Barberry</hi> they stand like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in <hi>parcels,</hi> but they are so many <hi>half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ovals.</hi> The utmost <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> of all three, make three rings.</p>
               <p>Again, in <hi>Apple, Pear,</hi> and <hi>Plum,</hi> the inmost <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> are <hi>radiated.</hi> The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most are neither <hi>radiated,</hi> nor make an <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ring;</hi> but stand in <hi>peripherial parcels.</hi> Much after the same manner they also stand in <hi>Elm.</hi> In <hi>Ash,</hi> the said <hi>Vessels</hi> make two <hi>rings,</hi> but neither of them <hi>radiated:</hi> the inmost <hi>ring</hi> consisting of <hi>arched parcels,</hi> and the utmost of round ones. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in all the foregoing, the inmost are still contiguous to the <hi>wood;</hi> and the utmost more or less, distant from the <hi>cuts:</hi> here, on the contrary, the inmost are distant from the <hi>wood,</hi> and the utmost contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the <hi>cutis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the said <hi>Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Barks</hi> of the said eight <hi>Branches,</hi> though I call them <hi>Lymphaeducts;</hi> because I observe not any of them to emitt any <hi>liquour,</hi> but what is clear, &amp; less oyly: Yet are they not one, but two distinct kinds of <hi>Lymphaeducts.</hi> Which is evident, as from some other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, so from hence; In that their <hi>positions</hi> are altogether heterogeneous: Yet in both
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34857:20"/>
constant, regular and uniform. I say, there can be no reason given, why the self <hi>same kind</hi> or species of <hi>Vessels,</hi> should have a different, yea a contrary <hi>position,</hi> and that contrariety not accidental, but <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>constant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>OF the</hi> three next <hi>quarters</hi> sc. the ninth, tenth, and eleventh, the <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> are different in <hi>number, position, size,</hi> and <hi>kind.</hi> In <hi>Pine,</hi> which is the eleventh, they are fewer. In <hi>Wallnut,</hi> the ninth, more. In <hi>Fig,</hi> the tenth, most numerous.</p>
               <p>So for their <hi>position.</hi> In <hi>pine,</hi> the inmost make a <hi>radiated ring.</hi> The utmost stand stragling up and down, without any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain order. In <hi>Wallnut</hi> the inmost make also a <hi>radiated ring;</hi> The utmost make a <hi>doudle ring;</hi> not <hi>radiated,</hi> but of <hi>round parcels.</hi> In <hi>Fig,</hi> the inmost make also a <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated ring.</hi> But the utmost make a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and sometimes <hi>treble ring,</hi> not of <hi>radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,</hi> nor <hi>round,</hi> but <hi>arched parcels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, they are also different in <hi>kind.</hi> Those I think, of the two former, <hi>Wallnut</hi> and <hi>Fig,</hi> are thus different: those certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of the <hi>Fig,</hi> are so; being <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> and <hi>Lacteals.</hi> The <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> make the inmost <hi>radiated ring.</hi> The utmost, which make the other <hi>rings</hi> in <hi>arched parcels,</hi> are the <hi>Lactifers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:34857:20"/>That they are distinct <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Vessels,</hi> is evident from two reasons. First, from their <hi>position</hi> in the <hi>Bark,</hi> which is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlike, as hath been said. Secondly, from the most apparent diversity of the <hi>Liquours</hi> or <hi>Saps</hi> which they contain, and which upon cutting the <hi>Branch</hi> transversly, do distinctly <hi>bleed</hi> from them. Which is one way, whereby we do distinguish the <hi>Vessels</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> themselves. As in the <hi>Liver,</hi> it were hard to say, which is a <hi>Blood-vessels,</hi> and which is a <hi>Bile-vessel,</hi> where they are very small, if it were not for the <hi>contents</hi> of both.</p>
               <p>Those in the <hi>Bark</hi> of <hi>Pine,</hi> are likewise of two <hi>kinds.</hi> The inmost are <hi>Lymphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts,</hi> as in the two former. The utmost are not <hi>Milk-vessels,</hi> but <hi>Gum-vessels,</hi> or <hi>Resiniferous.</hi> Out of these <hi>Vessels,</hi> all the clear <hi>Turpentine,</hi> that drops from the <hi>Tree,</hi> doth issue.</p>
               <p>Besides the difference of their <hi>position,</hi> and of the <hi>liquor</hi> which they contain, and <hi>bleed;</hi> there is yet a third, and that is, their <hi>size.</hi> Most of them being of so wide a bore, as to be apparent to a naked eye. Whereas that of the <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> can hardly be discovered by the best <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same <hi>Resiniferous vessels</hi> of <hi>Pine,</hi> are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34857:21"/>
likewise, by their <hi>size,</hi> remarkably diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the <hi>Milk vessels</hi> of <hi>Fig.</hi> For those of <hi>Fig,</hi> are, in comparison, exceeding small; every <hi>Arch,</hi> not beeing a <hi>single vessel,</hi> but a <hi>parcel</hi> or <hi>cluster</hi> of <hi>vessels;</hi> whereof an hundred or two hundred may make up one <hi>arched parcel.</hi> Whereas one single <hi>Gum vessel</hi> in <hi>Pine,</hi> is sometimes as big as two whole <hi>Arched clusters,</hi> that is, as two or three hundred of the <hi>Milk vessels</hi> in a <hi>Fig tree.</hi> And the said <hi>Gum-vessels,</hi> or <hi>Turpentine-vessels</hi> of <hi>Pine,</hi> being compared with the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> of the same <hi>Tree,</hi> one <hi>Gum-vessel,</hi> by a moderate estimate, may be reckoned three or four hundred times wider than a <hi>Lymphaeduct.</hi> The like prodigious difference in the <hi>size</hi> of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Vessels</hi> of many other <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables</hi> may be observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE</hi> three next <hi>quarters</hi> of <hi>Branches,</hi> are of <hi>Oak,</hi> common <hi>Sumack,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Wormwood.</hi> In the <hi>Bark-vessels</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there is yet a farther variety observe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For in all or in most of the above named, there are only two <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Bark.</hi> But in each of these, there are three <hi>kinds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And first, in that of <hi>Oak</hi> there are two <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> and one of a sort of <hi>Resiniserous.</hi> The inmost <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> make
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34857:21"/>
a <hi>radiated ring,</hi> contiguous to the <hi>Wood.</hi> The utmost <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> make also a <hi>ring,</hi> but not <hi>radiated.</hi> Those which are a sort of <hi>Rosin-vessels,</hi> stand in round <hi>parcels;</hi> the greater <hi>parcels</hi> betwixt the two <hi>rings</hi> of <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> and the lesser betwixt the utmost <hi>ring</hi> and the <hi>skin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That these are different Vessels from both the other, is evident from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their <hi>position,</hi> as aforesaid. And that they are a sort of <hi>Resinous,</hi> is argued hence; In that, not only <hi>Galls</hi> are very full of <hi>Rosin,</hi> but that the <hi>Bark</hi> of <hi>Oak</hi> it self is also <hi>resinous.</hi> For the conveyance of whose <hi>resinous</hi> parts, it is most unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that any other <hi>Vessels</hi> should subserve, but a peculiar <hi>kind;</hi> which are therefore properly called <hi>Resiniferous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next is a <hi>Branch</hi> of common <hi>Sumach.</hi> In the <hi>Bark</hi> whereof, there are likewise three <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>vessels.</hi> First of all, there is a thick <hi>radiated ring</hi> of <hi>Lymphaeducts;</hi> standing on the inner <hi>margin</hi> of the <hi>Bark,</hi> contiguous with the <hi>Wood.</hi> These <hi>Vessels</hi> exhibit their <hi>Lympha</hi> very apparently. A second kind of <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> are situate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the outer <hi>margin</hi> of the <hi>Bark,</hi> and are composed into distinct <hi>Arched parcels,</hi> all running in a <hi>ring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Betwixt the two kinds of <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:34857:22"/>
stand the <hi>Milk-vessels.</hi> Every single <hi>Milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessel</hi> being <hi>empaled</hi> or hemmed in with an <hi>arch</hi> of <hi>Lymphaeducts.</hi> These <hi>Milk-vessels</hi> are extraordinary large, almost as the <hi>Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessels</hi> of <hi>Pine;</hi> so as easily to be observed without a <hi>Microscope;</hi> and without difficulty to admit a <hi>Virginal wyer;</hi> being two or three hundred times as big as a <hi>Lymphaeduct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last, is a <hi>Branch</hi> of common <hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</hi> In the <hi>Bark</hi> whereof, there are likewise three <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>vessels.</hi> First of all, there is a thin <hi>radiated ring</hi> of <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> contiguous with the <hi>Wood</hi> or on the inner <hi>margin</hi> of the <hi>Bark.</hi> But the <hi>ring</hi> is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, but made up of several <hi>parcels;</hi> which are intercepted by as many <hi>parenchymous Insertions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A second sort of <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> or some other <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> are situate about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the <hi>Bark:</hi> and are composed into <hi>arched parcels,</hi> which likewise stand all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a <hi>ring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beyond these <hi>Arches,</hi> and towards the outer <hi>Margin</hi> of the <hi>Bark,</hi> stand a third sort of <hi>Vessels,</hi> somewhat analagous to the <hi>Milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessels</hi> in <hi>Sumach.</hi> Yet different from them, in some part, both as to their <hi>situation size</hi> and <hi>Content.</hi> For in <hi>Sumach,</hi> the <hi>Milk-vessels</hi> stand within the <hi>Arched Lymphaeducts:</hi> whereas these in <hi>Wormwod,</hi> stand without them. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34857:22"/>
being the <hi>Vessels</hi> of an <hi>Herb,</hi> they are far less<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 
                  <hi>sc.</hi> about the compass or width of a spangle. Their <hi>content,</hi> is not a <hi>Milk,</hi> but a perfect <hi>Turpentine,</hi> or a <hi>liquid</hi> and most <hi>oleous gum.</hi> Or which, for its pleasant aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickness, may be called a <hi>Balsom.</hi> For it perfecty giveth whatever is in the <hi>smell</hi> and <hi>taste</hi> of <hi>Wormwood:</hi> being the <hi>Essence</hi> of the whole <hi>Plant,</hi> which nature treasur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up in these <hi>Vessels.</hi> There are divers other, both <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Trees,</hi> that in the like <hi>Vessels,</hi> contain a <hi>Turpentine</hi> or aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>Balsom;</hi> as <hi>Angelica, Enula campanae,</hi> and others: the <hi>Vessels</hi> being so very large, that they may be easily traced with a knife.</p>
               <p>Whether in some <hi>Plants,</hi> there are not more, I cannot say; though we may not have much reason to doubt of it. Because we see, there is so great a variety in the <hi>Viscera</hi> of <hi>Animals.</hi> For what the <hi>Viscera</hi> are in <hi>Animals;</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> themselves are in <hi>Plants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>CONCERNING</hi> the <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> I have one observation further to subjoyn, <hi>sc</hi> as to the <hi>Texture</hi> or <hi>Formation</hi> of the <hi>said Vessels.</hi> I have already said, and shewed, in my former Books of <hi>Plants,</hi> that the <hi>Lignous parts</hi> of all <hi>Vessels</hi> are <hi>Tubulary.</hi> That is, that the <hi>Sap</hi> is conveyed, by the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34857:23"/>
length of a <hi>Plant,</hi> through an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company of small <hi>Tubes, Pipes,</hi> or <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Question may be yet further put. If the <hi>stringy parts</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> are made of <hi>Tubes,</hi> what are these <hi>Tubes</hi> themselves made up of? I answer, that not only these <hi>Tubes</hi> or <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> are <hi>Organical</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but their very <hi>sides</hi> also, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of other <hi>Parts,</hi> which are <hi>Organical, sc.</hi> of <hi>Lignous Fibers:</hi> which <hi>Fibers</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing close or contiguous in a round, make one <hi>Tubulary Body,</hi> which I call the <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessel</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> And it is most probable, that these <hi>Fibers</hi> themselves, are also <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulary.</hi> That is, that a <hi>Sap-vessel</hi> is a small <hi>Tube,</hi> made up or composed of other yet much smaller <hi>Tubes,</hi> set round together in a <hi>Cylindrical Figure.</hi> As if we should ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a company of <hi>straws,</hi> which are so many small <hi>Pipes,</hi> to be joined and set round together, so as to make another greater <hi>Pipe,</hi> answerable to a hollow <hi>Cane.</hi> The <hi>Cane,</hi> I say, is as the <hi>Sap-vessels;</hi> and the <hi>straws,</hi> as the <hi>Fibers</hi> whereof it is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. By which also appears, the prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous smallness of these <hi>Fibers.</hi> For a small <hi>Sap vessel</hi> may, by an indifferent account, be reckoned fifty times smaller than a <hi>Horse hair.</hi> Allowing therefore but twenty of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34857:23"/>
aforesaid <hi>Fibers</hi> to one <hi>Vessel;</hi> that is to say, ten to compose its <hi>sides,</hi> and ten more to fill its concave; then one of the said <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> must be a thousand times smaller than a <hi>Horse hair.</hi> Whether the <hi>Fibers</hi> are not made up of other <hi>Fibers, He</hi> only, that made them knows.</p>
               <p>The first notice I took of these <hi>Fibers,</hi> and of the <hi>Sap-vessels</hi> their being compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hereof, was in a very white and clear peice of <hi>Ash,</hi> torn, with some care, by the length of the <hi>Tree,</hi> and objected to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Light. They are also sometimes discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in some other clear <hi>Woods,</hi> as in very white <hi>Fir, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divers considerations have confirmed me in the truth hereof. Whereof, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, I will mention these two. First, that herein the Analogy betwixt the <hi>Vessels</hi> of an <hi>Animal</hi> and a <hi>Plant,</hi> is very clear and proper. For as the <hi>sanguineous vessels</hi> in an <hi>Animal</hi> are composed of a number of <hi>Fibers,</hi> set round in a <hi>Tubulary Figure</hi> together: so are these <hi>Sap vessels</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> Secondly, in that herein, there is a more genuine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence betwixt these, and the other <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi> it self; <hi>sc.</hi> the <hi>Air-vessels;</hi> which are made up of a certain number of round <hi>Fibers,</hi> standing collaterally, or side to side, as I have also observed in my <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:34857:24"/>
of <hi>Roots.</hi> So that it is the less strange, that the <hi>Sap vessels</hi> should be made up of <hi>Fibers,</hi> since the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> are so likewise. Only with this difference, that whereas in the <hi>Air vessels,</hi> the <hi>Fibers</hi> are postured <hi>spirally,</hi> and so more horizontally or by the bredth of the <hi>Trunk:</hi> here in the <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessels,</hi> they stand and are continued in <hi>strait</hi> lines, by the length. And thus far of the <hi>Bark.</hi>

                  <hi>THE</hi> next general <hi>Part</hi> of a <hi>Branch</hi> is the <hi>Wood;</hi> which lyeth betwixt the <hi>Bark</hi> and <hi>Pith.</hi> And this likewise ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more consisteth of two general <hi>Parts, sc.</hi> of a <hi>Parenchymous part,</hi> and of <hi>Vessels.</hi> The <hi>Parenchymous part</hi> of the <hi>Wood</hi> though much diversifyed, yet in the <hi>Trunks</hi> of all <hi>Trees</hi> whatsoever hath this property, to be disposed into many <hi>Diametral rays,</hi> or <hi>Insertions,</hi> running betwixt so many por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Vessels,</hi> from the <hi>Bark</hi> to the <hi>Pith:</hi> as in any of the <hi>Quarters</hi> here before us may appear.</p>
               <p>But these <hi>Insertions</hi> are much diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied according to the several species of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34857:24"/>
                  <hi>Plants.</hi> So in <hi>Barberry, Ash, Pine, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> they are less numerous. In <hi>Elm, Wallnut, Fig, Sumach,</hi> they are more. And in <hi>Holly, Pear, Plum, Apple, Oak, Hazel,</hi> are most numerous.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Insertions,</hi> in <hi>Barberry, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and in <hi>Oak</hi> many of them are very thick. In <hi>Pine, Fig, Ash,</hi> of a middle <hi>size.</hi> In <hi>Pear, Holly,</hi> and most of them in <hi>Oak,</hi> are exceeding small. Again, in <hi>Barberry, Elm, Ash, Sumach, Fig,</hi> they are of an equal <hi>size.</hi> In <hi>Holly, Hazel, Pear, Plum, Oak,</hi> they are very unequal: some of those in <hi>Holly</hi> being four or five times thicker than the rest; in <hi>Plum</hi> six or seven times; and in <hi>Oak</hi> ten times at least.</p>
               <p>They have yet one more diversity, which is, that in divers of the said <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> they run not only through the <hi>Wood;</hi> but also shoot out beyond it, into some <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Bark,</hi> as in <hi>Elm, Sumach, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas in <hi>Pine,</hi> and some of the rest they either keep not distinct from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Bark;</hi> or are so small, as not to be distinguished there from.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Texture</hi> likewise of these <hi>Insertions</hi> is somewhat various. For in <hi>Wormwood,</hi> and most <hi>Plants</hi> they are manifestly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of small <hi>Bubles</hi> or <hi>Bladders:</hi> differing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34857:25"/>
in nothing from those of the <hi>Bark</hi> or <hi>Pith,</hi> saving in their being much less; especially in the <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Trees.</hi> But in <hi>Herbs</hi> they are much larger which leads to the better observation of them in <hi>Trees</hi> likewise. But in many <hi>Trees,</hi> as <hi>Apple, Pear, Plum, Pine,</hi> &amp;c. they are either quite lost, or so squeezed and pressed together by the hard <hi>Wood</hi> standing on both sides, as to be undiscern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. So that the difference betwixt a <hi>Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> in the <hi>Pith,</hi> and one of these in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions,</hi> is only this, that the one is as a <hi>purse</hi> expanded, and the other as the same <hi>purse</hi> contracted, and drawn up together with the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> they agree thus far; <hi>viz.</hi> To be of two general <hi>kinds;</hi> that is to say, <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessels</hi> and <hi>Air-vessels:</hi> whereas it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the <hi>Bark</hi> to have only <hi>Sap-vessels.</hi> Likewise betwixt the <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> or <hi>Lignous Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> and of the <hi>Wood,</hi> there is this difference; That those of the <hi>Bark,</hi> upon cutting the <hi>Branch</hi> transversly, do all of them immediately visibly <hi>Bleed.</hi> But these of the <hi>Wood</hi> do not, many of them, sometimes; and most of them never.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Sap-vessels</hi> of the <hi>Wood</hi> have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise some visible variety. Those much
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34857:25"/>
less than have the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> as shall be shewed. As for the reason why I call them <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> it is to be understood; That every year there grows a new <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessels</hi> on the inner <hi>margin</hi> of the <hi>Bark.</hi> Which <hi>Ring</hi> hardening by degrees, at the latter end of the year, is turned into a dry and hard Ring of perfect <hi>Wood.</hi> So that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year, the <hi>Bark</hi> of the <hi>Tree</hi> is divided into two parts, and distributed two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ways. The outer part falleth off to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>skin;</hi> and at length becomes the <hi>skin</hi> it self. In like manner, as the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticula</hi> in <hi>Animals,</hi> is but the efflorescence of the <hi>Cutis.</hi> I say, that the elder <hi>skin</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> is is not originally made a <hi>skin;</hi> but was once, some of the <hi>midle</hi> part of the <hi>Bark</hi> it self, which is annually cast off, and dryed into a <hi>skin:</hi> even as the very <hi>skin</hi> of an <hi>Adder,</hi> doth upon the gradual gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a new one underneath, in time, become a <hi>Slough.</hi> The inmost portion of the <hi>Bark,</hi> is annually distributed and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the <hi>Wood:</hi> the <hi>Parenchymous</hi> part thereof making a new addition to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions</hi> within the <hi>Wood;</hi> and the <hi>Vessels,</hi> a new addition to the <hi>Lignous pieces</hi> betwixt which the <hi>Insertions</hi> stand. So that a <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Sap-vessels</hi> in the <hi>Bark</hi> this year, will be a Ring of <hi>Wood</hi> the next: and so another
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34857:26"/>
                  <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Sap-vessels</hi> and or <hi>Wood</hi> successively from year to year. So the <hi>quarter</hi> for an <hi>Apple branch,</hi> sheweth one of three years growth; that of <hi>Barbery,</hi> of two; that of <hi>Sumach,</hi> of one only; that of <hi>Elm,</hi> of five. Whereby two things may be the better no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. First the difference betwixt the degrees of the <hi>annual</hi> growths of several <hi>Trees:</hi> three years growth in an <hi>Oak,</hi> being as thick as five in an <hi>Elm;</hi> as, by comparing the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth and twelfth <hi>quarters</hi> together, is seen. Secondly, the difference betwixt the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual</hi> growths of the <hi>same Tree;</hi> being not of a constant proportion, but varying in thickness, as it should seem, according to the <hi>season</hi> of the year: whereby it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, what <hi>season,</hi> or kind of year, doth most of all favour, the latitudinal growth, or the <hi>thickening</hi> of any <hi>Tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is likewise some further variety in these old <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> whereof the true <hi>Wood</hi> consists; represented in <hi>Wallnut, Fig,</hi> and <hi>Oak.</hi> Wherein, a certain smaller num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them stand in a contrary position, to that of the rest; <hi>viz.</hi> either in small and white <hi>Rings,</hi> as in <hi>Oak;</hi> or else in divers white and crooked <hi>parcels,</hi> as in <hi>Wallnut</hi> and <hi>Fig.</hi> For it seemeth, that, at least, in many <hi>Trees,</hi> some portion of all the <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Bark,</hi> are not only annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34857:26"/>
distributed to the <hi>Wood,</hi> but do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise therein retain the same, or very like <hi>position,</hi> which they originally had in the <hi>Bark.</hi> So that as all those bigger and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er portions of the <hi>Wood,</hi> were originally, nothing else but the <hi>radiated Lymphaeducts</hi> of the <hi>Bark:</hi> so the little white <hi>circles,</hi> or <hi>parcels</hi> of <hi>circles,</hi> in the same <hi>Wood<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:34857:27"/>The varieties hereof are very many; in respect both of their <hi>number, size,</hi> and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;</hi> being the same, in no two <hi>species's</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> whatsoever. Frst in respect of their <hi>number.</hi> So in <hi>Hazle, Apple, Pear,</hi> they are very numerous; but in different degrees: and are represented in the same Figures, by all the black spots in the <hi>Wood.</hi> In <hi>Holly, Plum, Barberry</hi> somewhat nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. In <hi>Oak, Ash, Wallnut</hi> fewer. In <hi>Pine,</hi> and others of that <hi>kindred,</hi> very few; <hi>sc.</hi> fewer than in any other kind whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in respect of their <hi>size;</hi> which from the first or greatest, to the least, may be computed easily to about twenty Degrees. Thus many of those in <hi>Elm, Ash, Wallnut, Fig, Oak,</hi> are very large. In <hi>Barberry</hi> and <hi>Plum,</hi> not so large. In <hi>Hazle, Sumach,</hi> smaller. In <hi>Holly, Pear</hi> of a still smaller size. So that many of those in <hi>Elm,</hi> or <hi>Oak,</hi> are twenty times bigger, than those in <hi>Holly</hi> or <hi>Pear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as they have a different size in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds of <hi>Plants;</hi> so likewise, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the place where they stand, in the self same. So in <hi>Holly, Hazle, Apple,</hi> their <hi>size</hi> is equaller throughout the bredth of the <hi>Tree.</hi> But in <hi>Barberry, Elm, Oak, Ash,</hi> their <hi>size</hi> in each is very different; not fortuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously

                  </gap>ys much after the same manner. For in all the named <hi>Branches,</hi> the <hi>Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessels</hi> that stand in the inner <hi>margin</hi> of each annual <hi>Ring,</hi> are all vastly bigger, than any of those that stand in the outer part of the <hi>Ring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly these <hi>Air-vessels</hi> are also diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in their <hi>situation.</hi> So in <hi>Apple, Wallnut, Fig,</hi> they are spread all abroad, in every annual <hi>Ring;</hi> not being posited in any one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Diametral,</hi> or <hi>Peripherial.</hi> So in <hi>Holly</hi> they are <hi>radiated,</hi> or run in even <hi>Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral lines</hi> betwixt the <hi>Pith</hi> and the <hi>Bark.</hi> So also are some of them in <hi>Hazle;</hi> and some few in <hi>Wallnut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether they stand <hi>irregularly,</hi> or are <hi>radiated,</hi> it is to be noted, that Nature for the most part, so disposeth of them, that many of them may still stand very near the <hi>Insertions.</hi> So in <hi>Apple,</hi> she will rather decline making an even <hi>line;</hi> or in <hi>Holly,</hi> will rather break that <hi>line</hi> into <hi>parcels,</hi> than that the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> shall stand remote from the <hi>Insertions.</hi> To what end she doth this, shall be said hereafter.</p>
               <p>Again, in <hi>Ash,</hi> the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> are none of them <hi>radiated,</hi> but most of them stand in <hi>Circles</hi> on the inner <hi>Margin</hi> of every an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34857:28"/>
                  <hi>Ring.</hi> Which <hi>Circle</hi> is sometimes very thick, as in <hi>Ash</hi> and <hi>Barberry.</hi> In others but thin, the <hi>Vessels</hi> standing for the most part single throughout the <hi>Circles;</hi> as in <hi>Elm.</hi> Sometimes again, they both make a <hi>Circle,</hi> and are spread abroad; as in <hi>Pear</hi> and <hi>Plum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those likewise which are spread abroad, are sometimes <hi>regularly</hi> posited. So in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi> besides those larger, that make the <hi>Circle,</hi> there are other smaller ones, that stand, in oblique <hi>lines,</hi> athwart one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; almost like the <hi>Bend</hi> in an <hi>Escut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon.</hi> In <hi>Oak,</hi> they make rather certain <hi>Columns,</hi> in the posture of the <hi>Bar.</hi> And in <hi>Elm,</hi> they make, as it were, many <hi>cross Bars,</hi> in the posture of the <hi>Fess.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This great difference in the <hi>size</hi> and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> of the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> in the same indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual <hi>Plant,</hi> is one ground, for which I think it probable, that there are <hi>divers kinds</hi> of <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> as well as of <hi>Sap-ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</hi> Even as in <hi>Animals</hi> there are divers kinds of <hi>Organs</hi> for <hi>spiration,</hi> and the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Air: Fishes</hi> having their <hi>Bronchiae;</hi> land <hi>Animals</hi> their <hi>Lungs;</hi> and those in <hi>Frogs, &amp;c.</hi> of a somewhat peculiar <hi>kind.</hi>

                  <hi>THE</hi> third general <hi>Part</hi> of a <hi>Branch,</hi> is the <hi>Pith.</hi> Which though it have a different name from the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> in the <hi>Bark,</hi> and the <hi>Insertions</hi> in the <hi>Wood;</hi> yet as to its <hi>substance,</hi> it is the very same with them both. Whereof there is a double evidence, <hi>sc.</hi> the sameness of their <hi>Texture,</hi> and their <hi>Contin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ity.</hi> Their <hi>Texture</hi> shall be shewed presently. As to their <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,</hi> it is to be noted, that as the <hi>skin</hi> is continuous with the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Bark;</hi> and this <hi>Parenchyma</hi> likewise, with the <hi>Insertions</hi> in the <hi>Wood;</hi> so these <hi>Inserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> again, running through the <hi>Wood,</hi> are also continuous with the <hi>Pith.</hi> So that the <hi>skin, Parenchyma, Insertions,</hi> and <hi>Pith,</hi> are all <hi>one entire piece of work;</hi> being only filled up diversly, with the <hi>Vessels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>size</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> is various, being not the same in any two <hi>Branches</hi> here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented. In <hi>Wormwood, Sumach, Fig, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi> 'tis very large; <hi>sc.</hi> betwixt 5, and 7. <hi>Inches Diameter,</hi> as it appears through the <hi>Microscope.</hi> In <hi>Pine, Ash, Holly, Wallnut,</hi> not so large; from 3. Inches <hi>Diameter</hi> to 4. In <hi>Oak, Apple, Pear, Hazel,</hi> lesser, scarce from 2. to 3. In <hi>Damascene,</hi> not above an
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34857:30"/>
Inch and half. And in <hi>Elm<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                  </hi> scarce an Inch <hi>Diameter.</hi> Note also, that of all <hi>Plants, Herbs,</hi> and <hi>Shrubs,</hi> have generally the largest <hi>Piths,</hi> in proportion with the other <hi>parts</hi> of the same <hi>Branch,</hi> as in <hi>Sumach, Fig, Barberry</hi> is manifest.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pith</hi> for the most part, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, in the <hi>Branch,</hi> as well as <hi>Root,</hi> is compounded of two <hi>parts, sc.</hi> a <hi>Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and <hi>Sap-vessels.</hi> The <hi>Vessels</hi> are here usually postured so, as to make a <hi>Ring</hi> on the <hi>Margin</hi> of the <hi>Pith.</hi> Where they are more numerous, or large, they are more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident; as in <hi>Wallnut, Fig Pine,</hi> and others. They are also of divers <hi>kinds</hi> answerable to those in the <hi>Bark;</hi> as in <hi>Wallnut Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeducts,</hi> in <hi>Fig Lactents, in Pine Rosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of <hi>Bladders.</hi> Which are the very same with those in the <hi>Bark,</hi> and in the <hi>Inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> within the <hi>Wood.</hi> Only these in the <hi>Pith,</hi> are of the largest <hi>size;</hi> those in the <hi>Bark,</hi> of a lesser; and those of the <hi>Inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> least of all: for which reason they are less obvious than in the <hi>Pith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Pith,</hi> though always comparatively great, yet are of very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>sizes.</hi> Being easily distinguished, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as to their <hi>horizontal Area,</hi> to twenty
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34857:30"/>
degrees. Those of <hi>Fig, Barberry,</hi> and some others, are large. And of many <hi>Plants,</hi> as of <hi>Thistle, Borage,</hi> and others, three times as big again; appearing in the <hi>Microscope,</hi> like to the largest <hi>Cells</hi> of an <hi>Honey-comb.</hi> These of <hi>Plum, Wormwood, Sumach,</hi> less. Of <hi>Elm, Apple, Pear,</hi> lesser, Of <hi>Holly</hi> and <hi>Oak,</hi> still less. So that the <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> in <hi>Borage</hi> or common <hi>Thistle,</hi> are of that <hi>size,</hi> as to contain, within the compass only of their <hi>Horizontal Area,</hi> about twenty <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> of <hi>Oak.</hi> Wherefore one whole <hi>Bladder</hi> in <hi>Thistle,</hi> is, at least an hundred times bigger, then another in <hi>Oak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the <hi>size</hi> of these <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Pith,</hi> 'tis also to be noted, that it doth not at all follow the <hi>size</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> it self; but is still varyed, according as nature designeth the <hi>Pith</hi> for various use. Thus whereas the <hi>Pith</hi> of <hi>Sumach</hi> is larger than that of <hi>Barberry;</hi> it might be thought, that the <hi>Bladders,</hi> whereof it is composed, should be likewise larger; yet are they three times as small again. So the <hi>Pith</hi> of <hi>Plum,</hi> is far less than that of <hi>Pear;</hi> yet the <hi>Bladders</hi> 4. or 5. times as big. So the <hi>Pith</hi> of <hi>Hazel</hi> is almost three times as little again, as that of <hi>Holly;</hi> yet the <hi>Bladders</hi> in <hi>Hazel,</hi> are ten times bigger, than in <hi>Holly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:34857:31"/>The <hi>shape</hi> of the <hi>Bladders</hi> hath also some variety. For although, for the most part, they are more round; yet oftentimes they are angular: as in <hi>Reed-grass,</hi> a <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant;</hi> where they are <hi>Cubical;</hi> and in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Thistle,</hi> and many others, where they are <hi>pentangular, sexangular</hi> and <hi>septangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the <hi>Texture</hi> of the <hi>Bladders,</hi> 'tis also to be noted, that many times, the <hi>sides</hi> of the greater <hi>Bladders</hi> are composed of lesser; as is often seen in those of <hi>Borage</hi> and some other <hi>Plants.</hi> In the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as the <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> are but greater <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> made up of lesser.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pith,</hi> though always originally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of <hi>Bladders,</hi> and so <hi>one entire piece;</hi> yet in process, as the <hi>Plant</hi> grows up, it hath divers openings or <hi>Ruptures</hi> made in it: oftentimes very regularly, and always for good use, and with constancy observed in the same <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi> In <hi>Wallnut</hi> it shrinketh up into transverse films or <hi>Membranes;</hi> as likewise in <hi>Spanish-broom.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Membranes</hi> reach not from side to side, but about half way, running one against another by a reciprocal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture: somewhat after the manner of the <hi>Valvulae Conniventes</hi> in the smaller <hi>Gutts.</hi> Sometimes bored with divers <hi>Caverns</hi> by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34857:31"/>
the length: sometimes with one great one throughout the <hi>stalk;</hi> and sometimes reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>knot</hi> to <hi>knot;</hi> by which it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into several <hi>stories:</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I SHALL</hi> conclude this discourse with a further illustration of the <hi>Texture</hi> of the <hi>Pith,</hi> and of the whole <hi>Plant,</hi> as conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereupon. I say therefore, (and have given some account hereof in my <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Roots</hi>) that as the <hi>Vessels</hi> of a <hi>Plant, sc.</hi> the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> and <hi>Sap-vessels,</hi> are made up of <hi>Fibers;</hi> according to what I have in this discourse above said; so the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> or the <hi>Bladders</hi> whereof the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> consists, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise made up of <hi>Fibers.</hi> Which is true also of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Bark.</hi> And also of the <hi>Insertions</hi> in the <hi>Wood.</hi> Yea, and of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> and all other <hi>Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> I say, that the very <hi>pulp</hi> of an <hi>Apple, Pear, Cucumber, Plum,</hi> or any other <hi>Fruit,</hi> is nothing els but <hi>a Ball of small transparent threds or Fibers, all wrapped and wreathed up</hi> (though in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manner) <hi>close together.</hi> And even all those <hi>parts</hi> of a <hi>Vegetable,</hi> which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther formed into visible <hi>Tubes,</hi> nor into <hi>Bladders,</hi> are yet made up of <hi>Fibers.</hi> Which though it be difficult to observe in any of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34857:32"/>
those <hi>parts</hi> which are closer wrought; yet in the <hi>Pith,</hi> especially of some <hi>Plants,</hi> which consisteth of more open <hi>work,</hi> it is more visible; and so introduceth the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof, in all other <hi>Parenchymous parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence it follows, that the whole <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> or all the <hi>parts</hi> of a <hi>Vegetable,</hi> so far as <hi>organical,</hi> they are also <hi>Fibrous.</hi> Of all which <hi>Fibers,</hi> those of the <hi>Vessels,</hi> run up by the length of the <hi>Plant:</hi> these of the <hi>Pith,</hi> and other <hi>Parenchymous parts,</hi> run cross by the bredth or <hi>horizontally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BY WHICH</hi> means, the said <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymous Fibers,</hi> in fetching their <hi>horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal circles,</hi> they first of all <hi>weave,</hi> and make up the <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> in <hi>open-work.</hi> And the same <hi>Fibers</hi> being continued; they next <hi>weave</hi> and make up the <hi>Insertions</hi> in <hi>close work.</hi> Amongst which <hi>Insertions</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> standing, many of the said <hi>Fibers wrap</hi> themselves also about them; thus <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> many of them together; and making those several <hi>Conjugations</hi> and <hi>Braces,</hi> of the <hi>Vessels</hi> which I have formerly described. And as some of these <hi>Parenchymous Fibers wrap</hi> about the <hi>Vessels;</hi> so also about the very <hi>Fibers,</hi> whereof the <hi>Vessels</hi> are, as is above said, composed. By which means it is, that all the said <hi>Fibers</hi> of the <hi>Vessels</hi> are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34857:32"/>
                  <hi>tacked</hi> or <hi>stitched</hi> up close together into one coherent piece. Much after the same manner, as the <hi>perpendicular splinters</hi> or <hi>Twigs</hi> of a <hi>Basket,</hi> are, by those that run in and out <hi>horizontally.</hi> And the same <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchymous Fibers,</hi> being still further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the <hi>Bark;</hi> they there compose the same <hi>work</hi> over again: only not so <hi>open</hi> as in the <hi>Pith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SO THAT</hi> the most unfeigned and proper resemblance we can make of the whole <hi>Body</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> is, to a piece of <hi>fine Bone-lace,</hi> at such time, as the women are working it upon the <hi>Cushion.</hi> For all the <hi>Parenchymous parts,</hi> as the <hi>Pith, Insertions,</hi> and <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Bark,</hi> are nothing els but <hi>Lace-work;</hi> the <hi>Fibers</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> running <hi>Horizontally</hi> as do the <hi>threds</hi> in the <hi>Lace:</hi> and bounding the several <hi>Bladders</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> and <hi>Bark;</hi> as the <hi>threds</hi> do the several <hi>holes</hi> of the <hi>Lace:</hi> and making up the <hi>Insertions</hi> without <hi>Bladders,</hi> or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry small ones, as the same <hi>threds</hi> likewise do the <hi>close</hi> parts of the <hi>Lace;</hi> which they call the <hi>cloath-work.</hi> And lastly, the <hi>Vessels,</hi> standing <hi>perpendicularly,</hi> run cross to the <hi>Horizontal Fibers;</hi> even as in the <hi>Lace,</hi> the <hi>Pins</hi> do to the <hi>threds.</hi> And this is the true <hi>Texture</hi> of a <hi>Plant:</hi> and the <hi>general compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> not only of a <hi>Branch,</hi> but of all the

               <hi>HAVING</hi> already given the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy</hi> of <hi>Trunks,</hi> I shall next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to see, what <hi>use</hi> may be made thereof; and principally, to explicate the manner of their <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> In doing which, that former <hi>Method,</hi> which I used in shewing the manner of the <hi>growth</hi> of <hi>Roots,</hi> I shall not exactly follow. For so, the general <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Trunk</hi> being the same, and consequently the <hi>Nutrition</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical</hi>

               <hi>parts</hi> of both, being effected in the same way; I should hereby be obliged to the repetition of many things already said: which would be nauseous and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto those, who have been pleased to peruse them. The explication therefore of all those things that more especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Trunk,</hi> or are more apparent therein, and not spoken of, or not so fully in my former Books, will be my present task. The chief <hi>Heads</hi> whereof, shall be these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven following. <hi>viz.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST,</hi> as to the <hi>course</hi> of the <hi>Sap,</hi> there are three <hi>parts</hi> by which it <hi>moveth; sc.</hi> the <hi>Pith,</hi> the <hi>Wood,</hi> and the <hi>Bark.</hi> First the <hi>Pith;</hi> by which the <hi>Sap</hi> moveth the first year, and only the first year. Or, it is <hi>Proprium quarto modo,</hi> to the <hi>Pith</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Annual growth,</hi> and to the <hi>Pith</hi> of such a <hi>growth</hi> only, <hi>to be succulent.</hi> That is, whether of a <hi>sprout</hi> from a <hi>seed,</hi> or of a <hi>sucker</hi> from a <hi>Root,</hi> or of a <hi>Cyon</hi> from a <hi>Branch;</hi> The <hi>Pith</hi> is always found the <hi>first</hi> year full of <hi>Sap.</hi> But the <hi>second</hi> year, the same individual <hi>Pith,</hi> always becomes <hi>dry,</hi> and so it continues ever after.</p>
               <p>One cause whereof is, that the <hi>Sap-ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi> in the <hi>Bark,</hi> being the first year adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to the <hi>Pith,</hi> they do all that time trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse part of their <hi>Sap</hi> into it, and so keep it always succulent. But the same <hi>Sap ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi> the year following, are turned into <hi>Wood;</hi> and the <hi>Vessels</hi> which now carry the <hi>Sap</hi> stand beyond them, in the <hi>Bark.</hi> So that the <hi>Sap</hi> being now more remote from the <hi>Pith,</hi> and intercepted by the new <hi>wood,</hi> it cannot be transfused with that sufficient force and plenty as before into the <hi>Pith;</hi> which therefore from the first year always continues dry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:34857:35"/>
                  <hi>THE SECOND part</hi> by which the <hi>Sap moves sub forma liquoris,</hi> is the <hi>Wood.</hi> Which yet is not in all <hi>Plants,</hi> but only in some, and visibly in few; as in the <hi>Vine:</hi> in which, I say, the Sap doth <hi>visibly ascend</hi> by the <hi>Wood.</hi> And this it doth not only the first year, but every year, so long as the <hi>Vine</hi> continues to grow. But although this ascent by the <hi>Wood</hi> be every year, yet is it only in the spring, for about the space of a month; <hi>sc.</hi> in <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>April.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many other <hi>Trees,</hi> besides the <hi>Vine,</hi> wherein at the same time of the year, (and perhaps in all the other <hi>Trees</hi> a little before or after) wherein, I say, the <hi>Sap ascendeth,</hi> though not so copiously, yet chiefly, by the <hi>Wood.</hi> For taking a <hi>Branch</hi> of two or three years old, suppose of <hi>Sallow,</hi> and having first cut it trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly, if the <hi>Bark</hi> be then in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner crushed somewhat hard with the back of the knife, near the newly cut end; the <hi>Sap</hi> will very plainly rise up out of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Wood.</hi> And if it be crushed in the same manner, about an inch lower it will ascend out of every <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Wood</hi> to the center. Yet at the same time, which is to be noted, there <hi>ariseth</hi> no <hi>Sap</hi> at all out of the <hi>Bark.</hi> Which sheweth the error of that so common opinion, that <hi>the Sap</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:34857:35"/>
                  <hi>always riseth betwixt the Wood and the Bark.</hi> For in the <hi>beginning</hi> of spring, it <hi>riseth,</hi> neither <hi>betwixt</hi> the <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Bark,</hi> nor in the <hi>Bark;</hi> but only in the <hi>Wood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE THIRD part</hi> by which the <hi>Sap</hi> ascends is the <hi>Bark,</hi> as may be observed in almost any <hi>Branch,</hi> cut cross in the <hi>late Spring</hi> and <hi>Summer;</hi> either as the <hi>Sap</hi> is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth spontaneously, or upon crushing as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid. So that when the <hi>Sap</hi> ceaseth to ascend, <hi>sub forma liquoris,</hi> by the <hi>Wood,</hi> then it begins to ascend by the <hi>Bark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides the difference of time, the <hi>Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal parts</hi> likewise, by which these two <hi>Saps</hi> ascend, are divers. For in the <hi>Bark,</hi> it ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>visibly</hi> only by the <hi>Sap-vessels.</hi> Whereas in the <hi>Wood,</hi> it ascendeth only by the <hi>Air-vessels.</hi> That is to say those <hi>Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Wood,</hi> which in the beginning of <hi>Spring</hi> do often times carry <hi>Liquor:</hi> when the <hi>Tree</hi> begins to thrive, and many new parts to be formed and fed, are filled only with <hi>Air; sc.</hi> a <hi>Vegetable Air.</hi> The said <hi>Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Wood</hi> have likewise a quite different <hi>Structure;</hi> being composed of <hi>spiral,</hi> but those in the <hi>Bark</hi> of <hi>rectile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>near Fibers;</hi> as we have lately shewed. In which <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> all the <hi>specifical liquors</hi> of every <hi>Tree</hi> are chiefly contained.</p>
               <p>FROM what hath been said, we may understand, what is meant by <hi>Bleeding</hi> of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34857:36"/>
                  <hi>Plants.</hi> If we take it generally, it properly enough expresses <hi>the eruption of the Sap out of any Vessels;</hi> and so, almost all <hi>Plants</hi> in <hi>Summer</hi> time, do <hi>Bleed:</hi> that is, from <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi> either in the <hi>Bark</hi> or <hi>verge</hi> of the <hi>Pith:</hi> the <hi>Saps</hi> they <hi>Bleed,</hi> having either a <hi>sower, sweet, hot, bitter,</hi> or other <hi>tast.</hi> At which time, the <hi>Vessels</hi> also, in the <hi>Bark</hi> of a <hi>Vine Branch,</hi> do <hi>bleed</hi> a <hi>sower sap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which is <hi>vulgarly</hi> called <hi>bleeding,</hi> as in a <hi>Vine,</hi> is quite another thing; both as to the <hi>liquor</hi> which issueth, and the <hi>place</hi> where it issues: that is to say, it is neither a <hi>sweet</hi> nor <hi>sower,</hi> but <hi>tastless Sap;</hi> issuing not from the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> in the <hi>Bark.</hi> So that there is as much difference betwixt <hi>Bleeding</hi> in a <hi>Vine,</hi> or the <hi>Rising</hi> of the <hi>Sap</hi> in any other <hi>Tree,</hi> in <hi>March,</hi> and in <hi>July;</hi> as there is betwixt <hi>salivation</hi> and an <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage;</hi> or betwixt the <hi>course</hi> of the <hi>Chyle</hi> in the <hi>Lactiferous Vessels,</hi> and the <hi>Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi> in the <hi>Arteries</hi> and <hi>Veins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW the cause whence it comes to pass, that the <hi>early spring Sap</hi> of a <hi>Vine,</hi> and other <hi>Trees,</hi> ascendeth by the <hi>Wood,</hi> is in that the young <hi>Sap-vessels</hi> of the <hi>Bark,</hi> by which the <hi>Sap</hi> ascendeth all the <hi>Summer,</hi> are as yet but begun to be formed. So that the <hi>Sap</hi> having not yet these <hi>Vessels</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34857:36"/>
it, it therefore runs up the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> in the <hi>Wood.</hi> But so soon as the said <hi>Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Bark</hi> begin considerably to encrease, the <hi>Sap</hi> quitting the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> betakes it self to <hi>these,</hi> as its most proper Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
               <p>The cause else, why the <hi>Vessels</hi> of almost all <hi>Plants,</hi> upon cutting, do yield <hi>Sap,</hi> or <hi>Bleed;</hi> is the <hi>pression</hi> which the <hi>Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> makes upon them. For the <hi>Pith</hi> and other <hi>Parenchymous parts</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> have upon the reception of <hi>liquor,</hi> a <hi>Conatus</hi> to <hi>dilate</hi> themselves: as is manifest from <hi>spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> which are a substance of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and have a somewhat like structure: as also from <hi>Cork,</hi> which is but the <hi>paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> I say therefore, that the <hi>parenchyma</hi> being fill'd and swell'd with <hi>Sap</hi> hath thereby a continual <hi>Conatus</hi> to <hi>dilate</hi> it self; and in the same degree, to crush together or contract the <hi>Vessels</hi> which it surroundeth. And the said <hi>Vessels</hi> being cut, their actual <hi>contraction,</hi> and the <hi>erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Sap,</hi> do both immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>It may also be noted, that the <hi>Trunk</hi> or <hi>Branch</hi> of any <hi>Plant</hi> being cut, it always <hi>bleeds</hi> at both ends, upward and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, alike freely. Which, as well as divers other <hi>experiments,</hi> plainly shews,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34857:37"/>
that in the <hi>Sap-vessels</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi> there are no <hi>Valves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM what we have now above, and elsewhere formerly said, we may also understand the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>ascent</hi> of the <hi>Sap.</hi> As to which I say <hi>first,</hi> that consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what height and plenty, the <hi>Sap</hi> sometimes ascends; it is not intelligible, how it should thus ascend, by virtue of any one <hi>part</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi> alone; that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by virtue of the <hi>parenchyma,</hi> nor by virtue of the <hi>Vessels alone.</hi> Nor by the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma</hi> alone. For this, as it hath the nature of a <hi>Sponge</hi> or <hi>Filtre,</hi> to suck up the <hi>Sap;</hi> so likewise, to suck it up but to such an height, as perhaps about an inch, or two and no more.</p>
               <p>Nor by the <hi>Vessels,</hi> alone for the same reason. For although we see, that small glass <hi>pipes</hi> immersed in water, will give it an ascent for some inches; yet there is a certain <hi>period,</hi> according to the <hi>bore</hi> of the <hi>Pipe,</hi> beyond which it will not rise. We must therefore join both the <hi>Vessels</hi> and the <hi>parenchyma</hi> together in the service; which we may conceive performed by them in this manner following.</p>
               <p>Let AB be the <hi>Vessel</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> Let GH be the <hi>Fibers</hi> whereof it is composed. Let CEDF be a number of <hi>Vesiculae</hi> of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34857:37"/>
the <hi>parenchyma,</hi> wherewith it is surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I say then, that the <hi>Sap,</hi> in the <hi>pipe</hi> BA would of it self rise but a few inches, as suppose from D to L. But being sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the <hi>Vesiculae</hi> DP the said <hi>Vesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culae</hi> being swelled with <hi>Sap,</hi> press upon the said <hi>pipe</hi> BA. Which being pervious by its <hi>Fibers</hi> GH the <hi>Vesiculae</hi> at the same time <hi>filtre</hi> or transfuse part of their <hi>Sap</hi> thereinto; which will therefore be forced to rise higher therein. And the said <hi>pipe</hi> or <hi>Vessel</hi> being all along surrounded by the like <hi>Vesiculae,</hi> the <hi>Sap</hi> therein is still forced higher and higher. Wherefore the <hi>Vesiculae</hi> of the <hi>parenchyma,</hi> are as so many <hi>Cisterns</hi> of <hi>liquor,</hi> which being, throughout the length of the <hi>pipe,</hi> contiguous to it, afford it every where a continual supply of <hi>Sap.</hi> So that by the supply and pressure of the <hi>Cisterns</hi> or <hi>Vesiculae</hi> FD the <hi>Sap</hi> riseth to L; by those at QL it rises to M; by those at NM, it rises to I; by those at OI, it rises to K; by those at PK, it rises to E; and so to the top of the <hi>Tree.</hi> And thus far of the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>Sap.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>THE NEXT</hi> enquiry to be made, is into the <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>course</hi> of the <hi>Air.</hi> Where this question will first of all be asked; <hi>sc.</hi> which way the <hi>Air</hi> first <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> the <hi>Plant;</hi> whether at the <hi>Trunk, Leaves,</hi> and other <hi>parts</hi> above ground; or at the <hi>Root?</hi> I answer, <hi>that it enters in part at them all.</hi> For the <hi>inception,</hi> as well as <hi>extramission</hi> whereof, the <hi>pores</hi> are so very large, in the <hi>Trunks</hi> of some <hi>Plants,</hi> as in the better sort of thick walking <hi>Canes,</hi> that they are visible, to a good eye, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>glass,</hi> but with a <hi>glass</hi> the <hi>Cane</hi> seems, as if it were stuck top full of holes with great <hi>pins:</hi> being so large, as very well to resemble these <hi>pores</hi> of the <hi>skin</hi> in the ends of the <hi>fingers</hi> and <hi>ball</hi> of the <hi>hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>leaves</hi> of <hi>Pine,</hi> they are likewise, through a <hi>glass,</hi> a very elegant show; standing all, most exactly, in <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>file,</hi> throughout the length of the <hi>leaves.</hi> The <hi>figure</hi> whereof shall be given hereafter, when I come to the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of the <hi>Leaf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But although the <hi>Air</hi> enters, in <hi>part,</hi> at the <hi>Trunk</hi> and other <hi>parts,</hi> especially in some <hi>Plants;</hi> yet its <hi>chief</hi> entrance, is at the <hi>Root.</hi> Even as some parts of <hi>Air,</hi> may
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34857:38"/>
continually pass into the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> by the <hi>habit,</hi> or <hi>pores</hi> of the <hi>skin;</hi> but chiefly, at the <hi>mouth.</hi> And what the <hi>mouth</hi> is, to an <hi>Animal;</hi> that the <hi>Root</hi> is to a <hi>Plant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if the chief entrance of the <hi>Air,</hi> was at the <hi>Trunk;</hi> then, before it could be mixed with the <hi>Sap</hi> in the <hi>Root,</hi> it must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend; and so move in a contrary course to the <hi>Sap</hi> throughout the <hi>Plant.</hi> As by its reception at the <hi>Root,</hi> and so its ascent from thence, it hath a more natural and easy motion of ascent: for that the <hi>Sap</hi> of the same <hi>Plant</hi> should continually ascend, and the <hi>Air</hi> descend, would be somewhat strange.</p>
               <p>The same is further argued from the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and smallness of <hi>diametral Portions</hi> in the <hi>Trunk,</hi> in comparison with those in the <hi>Root:</hi> which nature hath plainly there designed, for the <hi>separation</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> from the <hi>Sap,</hi> as they are both together re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the <hi>Root.</hi> So that the <hi>reception</hi> and <hi>course</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> is made on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Air</hi> being a <hi>springy</hi> body, it insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates into all the <hi>Pores</hi> and cranies of the <hi>earth;</hi> and so is perfectly mixed with the soyl. Whereupon, as the <hi>Sap</hi> enters the <hi>Root,</hi> more or less <hi>Air</hi> still intrudes it self
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34857:39"/>
together with it. The <hi>liquid</hi> portion of the <hi>Sap</hi> swells and fills up the succulent parts of the <hi>Bark.</hi> The <hi>Airy</hi> part is, as was said, separated from the <hi>liquid</hi> into the <hi>Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral portions.</hi> By which it is conveyed from the <hi>Bark,</hi> and so into the <hi>Air-vessels;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt which <hi>Vessels,</hi> the said <hi>Diametral portions</hi> run from the <hi>Bark</hi> towards the center of the <hi>Root.</hi> The <hi>Air</hi> thus received into the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> and the reception thereof, by the same means, continued; it is by them advanced into the <hi>Trunk.</hi> In which advance, it is again, more or less, disbursed into all the <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> as it goes. <hi>Partly</hi> inwards to the <hi>Pith.</hi> From whence the <hi>Pith</hi> is always at length filled with <hi>Air. Partly</hi> into the <hi>Insertions;</hi> by which it is conveyed outward into the <hi>Bark.</hi> Wherein, it is in part transfused through the <hi>Sap;</hi> and so the rest, with part of the <hi>Sap,</hi> remitted in <hi>perspirations</hi> back again into the <hi>Air.</hi> So that, whereas the <hi>Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral portions</hi> in the <hi>Root,</hi> do serve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the <hi>Air</hi> from the <hi>Sap</hi> into the <hi>Air-vessels:</hi> on the contrary the <hi>Insertions</hi> here in the <hi>Trunk</hi> serve to convey the <hi>Air</hi> from the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> into the <hi>Sap.</hi> Wherefore, as the <hi>Air-vessels advance</hi> the <hi>Air;</hi> or the <hi>Airy part</hi> of the <hi>Sap,</hi> and so convey it by the <hi>length</hi> of the <hi>Trunk;</hi> so the <hi>Insertions filter</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:34857:39"/>
it, and convey it by the <hi>bredth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND that the <hi>Insertions</hi> have this <hi>office</hi> of <hi>subservience</hi> to both <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Vessels;</hi> doth yet further appear, if we consider, that the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> are always so postured, as to touch upon the said <hi>Insertions,</hi> or at least to stand very near them. For either they are large, and so do frequently touch upon them on both sides; as in <hi>Elm, Ash, Wallnut</hi> &amp;c. Or if they are small; then they either run along in even lines colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral with the said <hi>Insertions,</hi> as in <hi>Holly:</hi> or at least, are reciprocally, some on one side, and some on another, inclined to them; as in <hi>Apple.</hi> By all which means, the <hi>Air</hi> is more readily conveyed from the <hi>Vessels</hi> into the <hi>Insertions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, a further evidence hereof is that generally, the bigger and the more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> are; the bigger, or at least, the more numerous also are the <hi>Insertions:</hi> especially if the comparison be made (as in all other cases it ought to be, as well as here) betwixt the several <hi>species</hi> of the same <hi>kind.</hi> So <hi>Corin,</hi> which hath small <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> hath also very small <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions.</hi> But the <hi>Vine</hi> hath both very large: and so for others.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, the <hi>Insertions</hi> minister be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> and the <hi>succiferous;</hi> in

               <p>A <hi>THIRD</hi> enquiry, is into the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and <hi>Structure</hi> of <hi>parts.</hi> The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner whereof I have already endeavoured to <hi>explicate</hi> from the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of the <hi>Root,</hi> throughout all particulars. Some whereof I shall yet further clear.</p>
               <p>As first the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> to the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Tree.</hi> Contrary to the common opinion, <hi>That they are not continuous;</hi> but that the <hi>Bark</hi> only surrounds the <hi>Body,</hi> as a <hi>scabbard</hi> doth the <hi>sword,</hi> or a <hi>glove</hi> the <hi>hand.</hi> As also seemeth to be proved, by the easy <hi>sliping</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> of <hi>Willow,</hi> and most other <hi>Trees,</hi> when full of <hi>Sap,</hi> from the <hi>Wood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:34857:40"/>But notwithstanding, this, they are as truly continuous, as the <hi>skin</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> is with the <hi>flesh: sc.</hi> by means of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma,</hi> which is one entire <hi>Body,</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the <hi>Bark</hi> into the <hi>Wood,</hi> and so uniting both together.</p>
               <p>Now the reason why the <hi>Bark</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less slips so easily from the <hi>Wood,</hi> is plain, <hi>viz.</hi> Because most of the young <hi>Vessels</hi> and <hi>Parenchymous parts,</hi> are there every year successively formed; that is, betwixt the <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Bark:</hi> where the said <hi>parts</hi> new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formed, are as tender, as the tenderest <hi>Vessels</hi> in <hi>Animals.</hi> And we may imagine, how easy it were at once to tear or break a thousand <hi>Vessels</hi> or <hi>Fibers</hi> of an <hi>Embrio,</hi> of a <hi>Womb</hi> or <hi>Egg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE</hi> same <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>braced,</hi> and gradually fall off toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> into the utmost <hi>Rind.</hi> Hence it is, that the <hi>Barks</hi> of many <hi>Trees</hi> are as it were, latticed with several cracks or <hi>fissures,</hi> of divers sizes, in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of <hi>Rhombs:</hi> the said <hi>fissures</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the <hi>Position</hi> and <hi>Tract</hi> of the <hi>Vessels</hi> in their <hi>Braces.</hi> Hence also it is, that the <hi>Bark</hi> of some <hi>Trees,</hi> as of <hi>Corin, Cherry,</hi> &amp;c. falleth off in <hi>Rings, sc.</hi> because the <hi>Sap-vessels</hi> are posited in the same manner in the <hi>Bark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:34857:41"/>The <hi>Sap vessels,</hi> as they are generated at the inner verge of the <hi>Bark:</hi> solikewise, in a small quantity, at the utmost verge of the <hi>Pith.</hi> Hence it is, that is, by the annual accretion of these <hi>Vessels,</hi> that the <hi>Pith</hi> is sometimes less in the <hi>Trunk,</hi> than in the <hi>Branches;</hi> and less in the elder <hi>Branches,</hi> than in the younger; and sometimes 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most wholly filled up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SOMETIMES</hi> also it breaks and shrinks up, thus making the <hi>Trunk</hi> a <hi>Pipe.</hi> The cause whereof, is either the <hi>Largness</hi> of its <hi>Pores,</hi> or the <hi>Thinness</hi> of the <hi>sides</hi> of the said <hi>Pores;</hi> upon both which accounts, the <hi>Pith</hi> doth more easily tear, and upon tearing shrink up, and so become hollow: as in Cichory, Lampsana, Sonchus, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, Brownwort, and others; wherein the <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Pith</hi> are <hi>large,</hi> and the sides of the Pores <hi>thin.</hi> Whereas, upon contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry accounts the <hi>Piths</hi> of most <hi>Trees,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main perpetually entire.</p>
               <p>THE Reason why <hi>Plants</hi> are made thus to become <hi>hollow,</hi> is <hi>partly,</hi> for the <hi>ripening</hi> of the <hi>Fruit</hi> or <hi>Seed;</hi> which is the better effected by a more plentiful supply of <hi>Air</hi>

                  </gap>tinually received into their hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Trunks.</hi> By means of which <hi>Air,</hi> part of the <hi>Sap,</hi> is dryed up, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of it made warmer, and so sooner matured.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:34857:41"/>
                  <hi>Partly,</hi> for the better determining the due <hi>Age</hi> of the <hi>Plant.</hi> Hence it is, that the greater part of <hi>Annual Trunks,</hi> are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: the <hi>Air</hi> contained in that hollow, drying up the <hi>Sap,</hi> and shrinking up the <hi>Sap-vessels</hi> so far, as to hinder the free mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Sap</hi> therein; from whence the <hi>Plant</hi> must needs perish. So that as the <hi>Content</hi> of the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> is a kind of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Air,</hi> whose office is to <hi>Attenuate,</hi> and <hi>Ferment</hi> rhe <hi>Juyces</hi> of <hi>Plants:</hi> so the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> of these <hi>cavities,</hi> is a more <hi>natural Air,</hi> designed chiefly, so soon as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, to <hi>dry</hi> them up.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, though the <hi>Pith</hi> break, yet not into one <hi>pipe,</hi> but many <hi>cross Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,</hi> as in <hi>Wallnut</hi> and <hi>Spanish-broom.</hi> Because here the dilatation of the <hi>Branch,</hi> and of the <hi>Pith</hi> therein, being much less, in proportion, than its growth in length; the <hi>Pith</hi> therefore, being stretched most by its length, will soonest tear the same way and consequently shrink up into so many <hi>Membranes</hi> by the bredth of the <hi>Trunk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AGAIN, as to the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> divers questions may be asked. As how it comes to pass, that they are generally less in the <hi>Trunk</hi> of the same <hi>Plant,</hi> than in the <hi>Root?</hi> The cause whereof is, that here in the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34857:42"/>
                  <hi>Trunk,</hi> they are more under the power of the <hi>Air;</hi> both that which entereth in at the <hi>Trunk,</hi> and that which of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ascendeth up into it from the <hi>Root.</hi> For the <hi>Air,</hi> as we have elsewhere said, is the <hi>mould</hi> of the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> to the crooked particles whereof the <hi>Saline,</hi> and other <hi>principles</hi> concurring to their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, do conform. To which they do best, the smaller they are: the <hi>Fibers</hi> of the larger <hi>Air-vessels</hi> making greater <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and so coming nearer to a <hi>right line,</hi> answerable to the <hi>figure</hi> of the Particles; not of the <hi>Aerial</hi> but of the <hi>saline prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore as the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served still to be dilated or widened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the lower parts of the <hi>Root;</hi> the <hi>Aerial principle</hi> being there less predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the <hi>Saline</hi> more: So towards the upper part of the <hi>Trunck,</hi> to be contracted or grow smaller; the <hi>Aerial prniciple</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here more predominant, and the <hi>Saline</hi> less.</p>
               <p>FOR the same cause, it may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> of the several years succeeding the <hi>second</hi> year, are near of one size: but those of the <hi>second</hi> year, are usually much larger than those of the <hi>first, viz.</hi> as being under a less power of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34857:42"/>
the <hi>Air.</hi> For the first year, the <hi>Pith</hi> being full of liquor, the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> themselves, are the only <hi>Repositories</hi> of the <hi>Air.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as after the first year, the <hi>Pith</hi> becoming dry, or another great <hi>Repository</hi> for the <hi>Air;</hi> the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> are henceforth filled with a moisture and more <hi>vapourous</hi> and <hi>saline Air,</hi> and so made to grow wider.</p>
               <p>For the same cause it is, that the dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity betwixt the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> of the first and succeeding years, is not, where the <hi>Pith</hi> is small, so visible. Because being never capable of containing many <hi>airy</hi> parts of the <hi>Sap,</hi> the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> themselves conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue still the chief <hi>Receptacles</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> and so to be still more equally sized: as in <hi>Hazel, Elm,</hi> &amp;c. is seen.</p>
               <p>Hence the very <hi>size</hi> of the <hi>Pith,</hi> hath much <hi>influence</hi> upon the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> and the manner of <hi>nutrition,</hi> and the <hi>Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>liquors</hi> in <hi>Plants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LASTLY, for the above said cause, the <hi>time</hi> when the <hi>Vessels</hi> begin every year to be formed or to appear, is always <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> at least, with respect to the <hi>season</hi> of the <hi>Tree.</hi> So that whereas the <hi>Sap-vessels</hi> begin to be formed in spring: these, not till the latter end of <hi>Summer,</hi> or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; at least not till about that time to <hi>appear.</hi> That is, when the <hi>Sap</hi> begins to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34857:43"/>
decrease, and to grow more <hi>airy;</hi> and so more fit matter for the <hi>generation</hi> of the said <hi>Air-vessels.</hi>

               <p>UPON the <hi>Structure</hi> and <hi>Formation</hi> of the <hi>parts,</hi> dependeth the <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>liquors,</hi> as was lately intimated. The <hi>manner</hi> whereof I have formerly shewed, in discoursing of the <hi>Root.</hi> Yet some things I shall here further <hi>explicate.</hi> And <hi>first,</hi> what we have formerly asserted <hi>sc.</hi> That the concurrence of two <hi>specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> distinct <hi>liquors,</hi> is as necessary to <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition</hi> in <hi>Plants,</hi> as in <hi>Animals.</hi> Which appears, as from divers other considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so from the very <hi>Structure</hi> of a <hi>Plant:</hi> where in all the organical <hi>parts,</hi> that is the <hi>parenchyma</hi> and the <hi>Vessels,</hi> are every where mixed together <hi>per minima,</hi> that is, <hi>per minimas partes Organicas,</hi> or <hi>Fiber</hi> with <hi>Fiber</hi> of several <hi>kinds.</hi> So that every small part of a <hi>Tree</hi> or of the <hi>Bark</hi> of a <hi>Tree,</hi> is as I may say, a sort of <hi>Linsy Woolsey.</hi> So that there is not the least part of the <hi>Sap,</hi> which is not impregnate with divers <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial tinctures,</hi> as it is continually <hi>filtred</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:34857:43"/>
from the <hi>Fibers</hi> of <hi>one kind,</hi> to those of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; standing every where <hi>twisted</hi> and <hi>stitched</hi> up together for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>FROM the special <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>structure</hi> of the <hi>parts,</hi> the <hi>liquors</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>specified.</hi> The <hi>Vessels</hi> being the chief <hi>Viscera</hi> of a <hi>Plant.</hi> For all <hi>liquors</hi> in a <hi>Plant,</hi> are certainly made by that <hi>Plant.</hi> And since the <hi>Plant</hi> hath no <hi>Viscera</hi> (so called) I would then know, what its several <hi>liquors</hi> are made by? If in the <hi>parenchyma,</hi> sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that <hi>parenchyma.</hi> If in the <hi>Vessels,</hi> by the <hi>Vessels.</hi> And if of divers <hi>kinds,</hi> by divers <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Vessels.</hi> So that what the <hi>Viscera</hi> are in <hi>Animals,</hi> the <hi>Vessels</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are in <hi>Plants.</hi> That is to say, as the <hi>Viscera</hi> of an <hi>Animal,</hi> are but <hi>Vessels conglomerated:</hi> so the <hi>Vessels</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> are <hi>Viscera drawn out at length.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AGAIN, as the <hi>specifying</hi> of the <hi>Sap</hi> dependeth chiefly on the special <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>parts:</hi> so partly upon the <hi>structure</hi> of the <hi>whole.</hi> Whereby every <hi>part</hi> is still better accommodated with its own <hi>Juyce.</hi> Thus the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> are necessary, not only and barely for a <hi>supply</hi> of <hi>Air;</hi> but also by their <hi>number, size,</hi> and <hi>position</hi> to <hi>adjust</hi> the quantity of that <hi>Air,</hi> to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>nutrition,</hi> and the <hi>generation</hi> of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34857:44"/>
the <hi>specificall liquors</hi> of every <hi>Plant.</hi> Which is evident from hence, in that they do not follow the <hi>size</hi> of the <hi>Plant;</hi> but are great and many, in some small <hi>Plants;</hi> and small and few, in some others that are large. So <hi>Vines,</hi> and <hi>Corn,</hi> as we have formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, have proportionably a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> and those very large. By which means the <hi>Sap</hi> is <hi>attenuated</hi> and less oylie and more copiously impregnated with a subtle, <hi>volatile</hi> and winy <hi>spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the same reason <hi>Canes,</hi> which yield that sweet <hi>juyce,</hi> whereof <hi>Sugar</hi> is made, and which also aboundeth with a <hi>volatile</hi> and inflameable <hi>spirit:</hi> these, I say, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the like over proportion of <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> to what we see in most <hi>Plants.</hi> Hence also it is, that none of the said <hi>Plants</hi> have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny considerable <hi>Bark;</hi> that so the attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating and subtilizing <hi>Air,</hi> may have a more easy and plentiful admission at the <hi>Trunk</hi> also. For which reason likewise the <hi>pores</hi> of the <hi>skin</hi> of some <hi>Canes</hi> are, as hath been observed, remarkably wide.</p>
               <p>Hence also it is observable, that of the same <hi>species</hi> or <hi>kindred,</hi> those <hi>Plants</hi> which have the most, and especially the largest <hi>Air-vessels;</hi> have also the greatest abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance either of a <hi>sweet,</hi> or of a <hi>winy liquor.</hi> So in <hi>Apple,</hi> they are larger than in <hi>Crab;</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:34857:44"/>
In <hi>Warden,</hi> larger than in <hi>Quince;</hi> and in <hi>Pear tre,</hi> larger than in <hi>Warden.</hi> So also in <hi>Corin,</hi> larger then in <hi>Goosbery;</hi> and in <hi>Vine,</hi> larger than in <hi>Corin:</hi> and so in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>AND as the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> by their <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> and <hi>Largeness,</hi> are accommodated to the better making of a <hi>winy sap:</hi> so by their <hi>fewness</hi> and <hi>smallness,</hi> of an <hi>oylie.</hi> As is remarkably seen in <hi>Fir,</hi> and other <hi>Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niferous Trees:</hi> these having, if not the <hi>smallest,</hi> yet the <hi>fewest Air-vessels</hi> of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Trees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF it be asked, how a <hi>Plant</hi> comes to have any <hi>Oyl</hi> at all in any <hi>part?</hi> Since we see, that the <hi>Sap</hi> by which the <hi>Root</hi> is fed, seemeth to be nothing else but <hi>water:</hi> and that many <hi>Plants</hi> which yield a great deal of <hi>stillatitious Oyl,</hi> as <hi>Mint, Rue,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, will yet grow in <hi>Water:</hi> I say, if it be enquired how this <hi>Water,</hi> is made <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Oyl?</hi> I answer, that there is no such matter. But that the <hi>Oyl,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Vegetable principles</hi> are actually exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent in, and mixed <hi>per minima,</hi> though in an extraordinary small proportion with the water. Even as we see the distilled <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Anise seeds, Penyroyal,</hi> and the like, to be impregnated with their own <hi>Oyls,</hi> which give the <hi>tast</hi> and <hi>smell</hi> to such <hi>Waters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:34857:45"/>Wherefore as a certain quantity of any <hi>salt</hi> may be dissolved in <hi>Water;</hi> beyond which, it will not mix therewith, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains under its own <hi>form:</hi> So is there a certain proportion of <hi>Oyl,</hi> though far less, which may also be perfectly mixed with <hi>Water;</hi> and is certainly so, more or less, with all the <hi>Water</hi> in the world. But if that proportion, or degree of impregnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be once exceeded; the particles of <hi>Oyl</hi> do then, and not till then, gather into a body, and appear under their own <hi>form.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say therefore, that all kinds of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Principles,</hi> are either in or together with the <hi>Water,</hi> with less difference first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into a <hi>Plant.</hi> But when they are once therein; they are then <hi>separated,</hi> that is to say, <hi>filtred,</hi> some from others, in very different <hi>proportions</hi> and <hi>conjunctions</hi> by the several <hi>parts;</hi> the <hi>Watery</hi> by one <hi>part,</hi> the <hi>Airy</hi> by another, the <hi>Oily</hi> by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so the rest: and so every <hi>Part</hi> is the <hi>Receptacle</hi> of a <hi>liquor,</hi> become peculiar, not by any <hi>Transformation,</hi> but only the <hi>percolation</hi> of <hi>parts</hi> out of the <hi>common Mass</hi> or <hi>stock</hi> of <hi>Sap.</hi> And so all those parts of the <hi>Sap.</hi> which are <hi>superfluous</hi> to any kind of <hi>Plant,</hi> are at the same time, discharged back by <hi>perspirations,</hi> into the <hi>Air.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hence, that nature, in the various
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34857:45"/>
                  <hi>percolations</hi> and separations of the <hi>Sap,</hi> may still the better answer her end; hence, I say it is, that she carefully seeth, not only to the special <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Organs,</hi> by which she doth her work; but likewise to their very <hi>position.</hi> Thus it is observable, that whereas the <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> which carry a more <hi>watery liquor,</hi> are still placed on the inner verge of the <hi>Bark,</hi> next to the <hi>Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vEssels:</hi> the <hi>Lactiferous</hi> and <hi>Resiniferous vessels</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> to whose <hi>Oylie liquor</hi> a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of much <hi>Air</hi> is incongruous; do usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally stand, neither on the inner, nor the outer verge of the <hi>Bark;</hi> but in the <hi>midle.</hi> By which means, they are at the greatest distance, and so most secure from the <hi>Air;</hi> either that which enters the <hi>Bark,</hi> at the circumference; or from the <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Pith.</hi>

               <p>AND because the <hi>Resinous liquors</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> are more <hi>Oylie</hi> than their <hi>Milky;</hi> their security therefore, from the approach of the <hi>Air,</hi> is yet further contrived. In that in <hi>Pine,</hi> and other <hi>Resinous Trees,</hi> the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametral portions</hi> are never found; at least not <hi>visible:</hi> which yet in other <hi>Trees,</hi> are <hi>conspicuous;</hi> being those <hi>parts,</hi> whose office it is, to introduce the <hi>Air</hi> from the <hi>Wood</hi> into the <hi>Bark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AGAIN, the <hi>Milky liquors</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:34857:46"/>
being thinner than the <hi>Resinous,</hi> and having a considerable quantity of <hi>water</hi> mixed with their <hi>oyl;</hi> hence it is, that in <hi>Milky plants,</hi> as in <hi>Rhus,</hi> there are a greater number of <hi>Lymphaeducts;</hi> and those stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer to the <hi>Milky vessels,</hi> than they do in <hi>Pine,</hi> and the like, to the <hi>Resinous.</hi> By which means they are better fitted to affuse their <hi>aqueous</hi> parts more plentifully to the said <hi>Milky liquor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM the <hi>mixture</hi> of <hi>watery</hi> parts with the <hi>Oylie,</hi> it comes to pass, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all <hi>Lympha</hi>'s, <hi>Mucilages,</hi> and <hi>Rosins</hi> are transparent; the <hi>Aquae-oleous liquors</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> are <hi>milky</hi> or white, or otherwise <hi>opacous.</hi> For the same thing is the cause of the whiteness of <hi>Vegetable,</hi> as of <hi>Animal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milk:</hi> that is to say, a more copious mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>watery</hi> and <hi>Oylie</hi> parts <hi>per minima,</hi> or into one body. For even the <hi>serous</hi> and <hi>Oylie</hi> parts of <hi>Animal milk,</hi> when through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly separated one from the other, they both become very transparent. So the <hi>stillatiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oyl</hi> of <hi>anise seeds,</hi> is most transparent and <hi>limpid,</hi> even as <hi>water</hi> it self: yet there is a known sort of <hi>White anise-seed water,</hi> as it is commonly called: that is to say, wherein the <hi>Oyl,</hi> in distillation, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and is mixed more plentifully with the <hi>water.</hi> And the <hi>water,</hi> wherein the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34857:46"/>
stillatitious <hi>oyl</hi> of any <hi>Vegetable</hi> is dissolved becomes a perfect white <hi>Milk;</hi> as in this <hi>Honourable and Learned Presence,</hi> I have formerly had occasion to Demonstrate.</p>
               <p>AND that the <hi>Milky liquors</hi> of all <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables</hi> whatsoever, are likewise more <hi>Oylie</hi> than their <hi>Lympha</hi>'s, is most certain. For all those <hi>Gums,</hi> which dissolve in <hi>Oyl</hi> or <hi>water</hi> as <hi>Galbanum,</hi> and the like, are ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally the <hi>Milky Juyces</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi> And if you take the <hi>Milk</hi> of any <hi>Plant,</hi> as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the <hi>Milk</hi> of common <hi>Sumach,</hi> or of any <hi>tast, bitter, astringent, hot, cold,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other whatsoever; and having well <hi>dryed</hi> it, and then fired it at a candle; it will thereupon burn with a very bright and durable flame, even like that of <hi>Tar</hi> or <hi>Turpentine</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>FROM what hath been said, we may likewise gather the most genuine import of the word <hi>Gum,</hi> and the distinction thereof both from a <hi>Rosin</hi> and a <hi>Mucilage.</hi> First a <hi>Rosin,</hi> is originally a <hi>Turpentine,</hi> or <hi>Acido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oleous liquor,</hi> having an exceeding small quantity of <hi>watery</hi> parts mixed therewith; and which, for that reason, will not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved therein, but only in <hi>Oyl.</hi> Of this kind are <hi>Mastick, Benzoine, Taccamahac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and divers others, commonly, in our <hi>Bills</hi> to <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> called <hi>Gums.</hi> Yet,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34857:47"/>
in strict speaking they are all so many <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly a <hi>Gum,</hi> and every oylie <hi>Gum,</hi> is originally a <hi>milky liquor,</hi> having a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er quantity of <hi>water</hi> mixed with its <hi>oylie</hi> parts; and which, for that reason, will be made to dissolve either in <hi>Water</hi> or <hi>Oyl.</hi> Of this kind are <hi>Sagapen, Opopanax, Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>The third sort of <hi>Gum,</hi> is that which is <hi>unoylie,</hi> and which therefore dissolveth only in <hi>water,</hi> as <hi>Gum-arabick,</hi> the <hi>Gum</hi> of <hi>Cherry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi> and others such like. This <hi>Gum,</hi> though commonly so called, yet is properly but a dryed <hi>Mucilage:</hi> being originally nothing else but the <hi>Mucilaginous Lympha</hi> issuing from the <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Tree.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as it doth from <hi>Cumfry, Mallow,</hi> and divers other <hi>Plants:</hi> and even from the common <hi>Cucumer.</hi> The <hi>Vessels</hi> whereof, upon cutting cross, yield a <hi>Lympha,</hi> which is plainly <hi>Mucilaginous,</hi> and which being well dryed, at length becomes a kind of <hi>Gum,</hi> or rather a hardened <hi>Mucilage.</hi> In like manner, the <hi>Gums</hi> of <hi>Plum-tree, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-tree,</hi> and the like, are nothing else but <hi>dryed Mucilages.</hi> Or, if we will take the word in its widest sense, then all <hi>Gums</hi> are originally, either a <hi>Turpentine,</hi> or a <hi>Milk,</hi> or a <hi>Mucilage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>I HAUE</hi> made many other Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>tasts, smells,</hi> and <hi>colours</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> and of their <hi>contents,</hi> since those I last published: and that both for the finding out the true <hi>causes</hi> of their <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and also the applying of them unto <hi>Medical use.</hi> As also to <hi>Mechanical;</hi> and particularly the making all sorts of <hi>Paints,</hi> or <hi>Tinctures</hi> out of the several <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> for <hi>drawing</hi> in <hi>Water-colours.</hi> In the choice whereof there is much difference to be made. For there are many <hi>Plants</hi> whose <hi>Colours</hi> are very clear and radiant, in the <hi>Plants</hi> themselves; yet when they come to be used, will not hold, but change and and grow <hi>foul.</hi> But these things, because they belong more properly to the <hi>Flower,</hi> and other <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> I therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, till if <hi>God</hi> give me life and health, I come hereafter to speak of those <hi>parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that I might the more fully inform my self and others in these matters; it may be thought requisite, that all kind of exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick parts of <hi>Plants,</hi> as well as those grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongst us, should likewise be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. For the procuring whereof, both from the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies,</hi> I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready bespoke the care of some Persons. To whom I have likewise given direction, how to preserve them in such sort, as that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34857:48"/>
I may have them fresh, as if they were newly taken from the <hi>Plant</hi> or <hi>Tree.</hi> And thus far of the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Liquors.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Fifth Head,</hi> shall be, of the <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration</hi> of <hi>Trunks.</hi> Which also, as well as the <hi>making</hi> of <hi>liquors</hi> dependeth upon the <hi>Structure</hi> of the <hi>Parts.</hi> As <hi>first,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all <hi>shrubs</hi> (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) have a greater number of <hi>Air-vessels;</hi> and those of a smaller size; and consequently much spread abroad, as most easily yielding to the <hi>magnetick</hi> power of the <hi>air,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as we have more fully demonstrated, in speaking of the <hi>Vegetation</hi> of <hi>Roots:</hi> as in <hi>Elder, Hazel, Fig, Sumach,</hi> and the like. By which spreading, the said <hi>Air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessels</hi> do sooner, and more easily strike into the <hi>Bark,</hi> and so produce <hi>collateral Buds and Branches,</hi> and that upon the first rising of the <hi>Body</hi> from the <hi>Root:</hi> that is, the <hi>Plant</hi> becomes a <hi>shrub.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT if the said <hi>Air-vessels</hi> are very large, they will not yield so easily to shoot out collaterally; and so the <hi>Trunk</hi> grows up taller and more entire: as in <hi>Oak,</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:34857:48"/>
                  <hi>Wallnut, Elm,</hi> &amp;c. wherein they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding large, is seen. Hence also the <hi>Vine,</hi> if it be but supported, will grow to a prodigious height. And <hi>Hops</hi> and <hi>Bryony,</hi> are some of the tallest, amongst all <hi>Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al growths:</hi> the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> of all which are very large. Whereas <hi>Borage,</hi> and other like <hi>Plants,</hi> although the <hi>pores</hi> of their <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma,</hi> are vastly wide, and filled with <hi>Sap;</hi> yet because their <hi>Air-vessels</hi> are small, they are therefore but <hi>dwarf plants.</hi> Wherefore the tallness or advancement of a <hi>Plant</hi> or <hi>Tree,</hi> dependeth not upon the <hi>plenty of Sap,</hi> how great soever, but on the <hi>largness</hi> of the <hi>Air-vessels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, as a <hi>Plant</hi> or <hi>Tree</hi> grows either <hi>shruby,</hi> or <hi>Tall,</hi> according to the <hi>size</hi> of the said <hi>Vessels:</hi> so from their <hi>position,</hi> doth it grow <hi>slender</hi> or <hi>thick.</hi> So where they keep more within the compass of a <hi>Ring,</hi> as in <hi>Elm,</hi> and <hi>Ash,</hi> the <hi>Tree</hi> in proportion, usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally grows taller and less thick. But where the said <hi>Vessels</hi> are spread more abroad, and especially are postured in <hi>Rays,</hi> as they are in <hi>Oak</hi> the <hi>Tree</hi> grows very thick. Because the said <hi>Vessels</hi> thus standing all along nearer to the <hi>Insertions,</hi> there is a more ready and copious passage of the <hi>Air</hi> out of the one into the other; and so the <hi>Diametral</hi> growth of the <hi>wood</hi> is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:34857:49"/>Lastly, from the same general cause it is, That the <hi>Trunks</hi> of <hi>Vegetables</hi> are either <hi>Round</hi> or <hi>Angular.</hi> Those of all <hi>Trees</hi> are <hi>round.</hi> Because the <hi>Bark,</hi> being here thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> bound up with a greater quantity of <hi>Wood;</hi> the <hi>Air</hi> hath not sufficient power to move them, and the <hi>Bark</hi> with them, into those various positions or figurations, as the <hi>Trunks</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> yield to.</p>
               <p>Yet the cause of the various <hi>shapes</hi> of the <hi>Trunks</hi> is not the <hi>Air</hi> alone; but partly the <hi>principles</hi> of the <hi>Plants</hi> themselves, in conjunction therewith: according to the predominion whereof, as chiefly of some certain kind of <hi>Salt</hi> (as I may possibly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after more particularly explicate) the <hi>Trunk</hi> is <hi>square, triangular, pentangular,</hi> or otherwise figured. And thus much in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the <hi>figuration</hi> of <hi>Trunks.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Motions</hi> also of <hi>Trunks</hi> are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. Principally <hi>four; sc. Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Descending, Horizontal,</hi> and <hi>Spiral.</hi> The cause of the <hi>ascent</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Magnetick correspondence</hi> betwixt the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34857:49"/>
                  <hi>air</hi> and the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> the <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>tendency</hi> whereof the whole <hi>Plant</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. This I have asserted, and I think, clearly demonstrated in my first and second <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Anatomy of Plants.</hi> I will here add this plain <hi>experiment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take a Box of Moulds, with a hole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the bottom, wide enough to admit the <hi>stalk</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> and set it upon stilts half a yard or more above ground. Then lodge in the mould some <hi>Plant,</hi> for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a <hi>Bean,</hi> in such sort, that the <hi>Root</hi> of the <hi>Bean</hi> standing in the moulds may point upwards, the <hi>stalk</hi> towards the ground. As the <hi>Plant</hi> grows, it will follow, that at length the <hi>stalk</hi> will rise upward, and the <hi>Root</hi> on the contrary arch it self downward. Which evidently shews, that it is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that the <hi>Root</hi> hath <hi>Earth</hi> to shoot into, or that its <hi>motion</hi> was only an <hi>appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite</hi> of being therein lodged, which way soever that be: but that its nature is, though within the <hi>Earth</hi> already, yet to change its <hi>position,</hi> and to <hi>move down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi> And so likewise of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> though already in the free <hi>air</hi> above ground, yet now to make a new <hi>Motion</hi> upwards.</p>
               <p>BUT although the <hi>natural motion</hi> of the <hi>Trunk</hi> be to <hi>ascend;</hi> yet is it forced
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34857:50"/>
oftentimes to <hi>descend.</hi> For the <hi>Trunk-Roots</hi> growing out of some <hi>Plants</hi> near the ground, and striking thereinto, do like so many Ropes, pluck the <hi>Trunk</hi> annually lower and lower into the ground toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them; as may be seen in <hi>Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phularia, Jacobaea,</hi> and many other <hi>Plants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF these <hi>Trunk-roots</hi> break out only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>bottom</hi> of the <hi>Trunk,</hi> as in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid <hi>Plants,</hi> then the <hi>Trunk</hi> gradually <hi>descends</hi> into the <hi>earth,</hi> and is turned into a <hi>Root.</hi> But if it be very <hi>slender,</hi> and the <hi>Trunk-roots</hi> break forth <hi>all along</hi> it, then it <hi>creeps</hi> horizontally; the said <hi>Roots</hi> tether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as it trails along, to the ground; as in <hi>Strawberry, Cinquefoyl, Mint, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>AS to their <hi>Spiral motion,</hi> it is to be noted; That the <hi>Wood</hi> of all <hi>Convoivula's</hi> or <hi>Winders,</hi> standing more close and round together in or near the center, thereby making a round, and slender <hi>Trunk.</hi> To the end, it may be more tractable, to the power of the external <hi>Motor,</hi> what ever that be: and also more secure from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by its winding <hi>motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, <hi>Convovula</hi>'s do not wind by any peculiar nature or <hi>Genius,</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Trunks</hi> have not; but because their <hi>parts</hi> are disposed so, as to render them
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34857:50"/>
sequaceous to the external <hi>Motor.</hi> Even as the <hi>Claspers</hi> of a <hi>Vine,</hi> having the like <hi>Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> have also a <hi>motion</hi> of <hi>Convolution:</hi> whereas the <hi>Branches</hi> themselves upon a contrary account, move in a <hi>strait</hi> line.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Convolution</hi> of <hi>Trunks,</hi> is made not <hi>one,</hi> but <hi>divers</hi> ways; some moving by <hi>South</hi> from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West;</hi> and others from <hi>West</hi> to <hi>East.</hi> Wherefore it seemeth, that as the <hi>efficient cause</hi> of <hi>Convolution,</hi> is not within the <hi>Plant,</hi> but external: so also, that it is not <hi>one,</hi> but that there are <hi>two great efficients</hi> of this <hi>Motion; s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE last thing I purposed to speak of, is those several <hi>Qualities</hi> of <hi>Trunks,</hi> or of <hi>Timber,</hi> by which they are fitted for
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34857:51"/>
                  <hi>Mechanical use.</hi> As <hi>hardness, softness, fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, clevesomeness, toughness, brittleness, durableness;</hi> of any of the same <hi>qualities</hi> compounded. The <hi>visible</hi> causes whereof are observable <hi>partly</hi> in the <hi>structure</hi> of the several <hi>parts; sc.</hi> the <hi>Insertions, Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessels,</hi> and <hi>Air-vessels;</hi> as to the <hi>number, size,</hi> or <hi>position</hi> of any of them. And <hi>partly</hi> in the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>parts;</hi> I mean such as is <hi>manifest to sense.</hi> According to our clear and distinct observing of all which causes, we may understand, wherefore any <hi>Wood</hi> is made use of for this or that purpose. And also, wherein fitly to apply it to further <hi>use.</hi> In order to which, a compleat History of the <hi>Mechanical uses</hi> of <hi>Vegetables</hi> would very much conduce. I shall for the present give some <hi>Instances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS <hi>first,</hi> some <hi>Woods</hi> are <hi>soft,</hi> as <hi>Deal</hi> and <hi>Sallow.</hi> Yet from different causes. <hi>Deal,</hi> from the great <hi>porosity</hi> of the <hi>Wood</hi> it self, or the large <hi>Pores</hi> amongst the <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vessels.</hi> But <hi>Sallow,</hi> not from the porosity of the true <hi>Wood,</hi> but the great number of <hi>Air-vessels</hi> spread all over it. For the same cause, though they are both <hi>soft,</hi> yet will not serve for the same purposes; <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> being well wrought upon, which way soever you cut it: but <hi>Deal,</hi> especially the white <hi>Deal,</hi> if it be cut cross, it tears, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34857:51"/>
will never polish or work smooth.</p>
               <p>Again, in <hi>Sallow,</hi> by the equall spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> the <hi>softness</hi> is equal or alike in all parts. For which cause it maketh an excellent <hi>coal</hi> for <hi>Painters Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets.</hi> Because it doth not only make a <hi>light,</hi> but every where a <hi>certain stroak,</hi> and so doth not disturb the even motion of the hand. For the same cause, <hi>Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers</hi> also make use of it for their <hi>Carving-boards.</hi> Because being every where equally soft, it turns not the edg of their <hi>Knives.</hi> Which <hi>Deal</hi> would presently do; because though very soft in some places, yet in others 'tis hard; that is to say, on the inner verge of every annual <hi>Ring</hi> of <hi>Wood,</hi> where the old <hi>Sap-vessels</hi> grow much more compact and close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <hi>Oak</hi> is the most <hi>Cleavesome,</hi> or <hi>splitteth</hi> the most <hi>easily.</hi> The cause whereof is, <hi>partly</hi> the largeness of the <hi>Insertions,</hi> and <hi>partly</hi> the <hi>diametral</hi> or radiated <hi>position</hi> of most of the <hi>Air-vessels:</hi> upon both which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, whereever a <hi>crack</hi> is begun 'tis easily continued throughout the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the <hi>Trunk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AGAIN, some <hi>Woods</hi> are <hi>hard, fast,</hi> and <hi>tough.</hi> So is <hi>Ash,</hi> and especially <hi>Beech-Hard</hi> and <hi>fast,</hi> from some of the same cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as <hi>Elm. Tough</hi> not from the <hi>structure,</hi> but from the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>parts; viz</hi> as being a less <hi>oylie Wood,</hi> and so not <hi>Brittle.</hi> Wherefore <hi>London-Cars</hi> have the <hi>Rings</hi> of their <hi>Wheels</hi> of <hi>Beech;</hi> because it <hi>tears</hi> more difficultly than even <hi>Ash</hi> it self. Whence also for <hi>large screws,</hi> there is no <hi>Wood</hi> like it. But for <hi>small screws,</hi> of about an <hi>Inch diameter, Birch</hi> is the best; as being, though not so <hi>hard,</hi> yet more <hi>tough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE more <hi>Brittle</hi> a <hi>Wood</hi> is, 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise usually the most <hi>durable.</hi> So <hi>Oak,</hi> which is not a <hi>tough,</hi> but very <hi>brittle wood,</hi> is almost as <hi>durable</hi> as any. Whereas <hi>Beech, Birch,</hi> and the like, although very <hi>tough;</hi> yet for <hi>duration,</hi> are of no service; for there are no <hi>Woods</hi> will rot sooner: and therefore, though strong enough, yet unfit to make any standing parts of <hi>Building</hi> or of <hi>Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:34857:53"/>
especially in wet and moist places. Because, being as is said, <hi>unoylie woods,</hi> they are apter to imbibe the moisture even of a <hi>dank Air;</hi> by which moisture, they either rot or breed <hi>worms,</hi> which destroy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>HENCE</hi> it is, that what we call the <hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>Timber,</hi> as it is more <hi>brittle,</hi> so also more <hi>durable; sc.</hi> Because more <hi>oylie.</hi> So that which is called the <hi>Sap</hi> of <hi>Oak,</hi> is much more <hi>tough</hi> than the <hi>Heart;</hi> although the <hi>Heart</hi> be more <hi>durable.</hi> That is to say, the older the <hi>Wood</hi> is, the <hi>watery</hi> parts are the more evaporated, the <hi>oylie</hi> still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, as a kind of <hi>Tincture</hi> in the <hi>Wood.</hi> Even as we see, that the older <hi>Seeds</hi> of the same <hi>kind,</hi> are more <hi>oylie</hi> than those that are green and young. So that the <hi>oylie</hi> or <hi>rosinous</hi> parts of the <hi>Sap,</hi> are a kind of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming</hi> to the <hi>Heart,</hi> or older part of a <hi>Tree,</hi> securing it from the destructive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of the <hi>Air.</hi> For the same cause it is, that <hi>Oak, Yew, Cocus, Guajacum,</hi> &amp;c. Which are <hi>oylie woods,</hi> have always much <hi>Heart:</hi> whereas <hi>Birch, Alder, Beech, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> which are very <hi>unoylie,</hi> have <hi>never</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM hence likewise we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the cause of the <hi>toughness</hi> of <hi>Flax:</hi> what we call <hi>Flax,</hi> being only the <hi>Sap-vessels</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:34857:53"/>
of the <hi>Bark.</hi> And generally, the <hi>Bark</hi> of any <hi>Tree,</hi> as of <hi>Willow</hi> (whereof are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made a sort of <hi>Ropes</hi>) is very <hi>tough.</hi> The <hi>Vessels</hi> being here younger, and less <hi>oylie</hi> than in the <hi>Wood.</hi> So likewise <hi>Hemp,</hi> is nothing else but the <hi>Sap-vessels</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> of the <hi>Plant</hi> so called. And <hi>Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath,</hi> is only the <hi>Housewifry</hi> of the same <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> of <hi>Nettle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHENCE it is very probable, that there are many other <hi>Plants,</hi> as well as the above named, whereof might be made good <hi>Toe.</hi> And of some, especially in some respects, better than of <hi>Flax</hi> it self. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that even <hi>Hemp,</hi> although it will not make so fine a <hi>Staple,</hi> as <hi>Flax</hi> (for all our fine <hi>Hollands</hi> are made of <hi>Flax</hi>) yet <hi>Flax,</hi> which is but of the same fineness as <hi>Hemp,</hi> will never, by all the art yet known, be made so white as <hi>Hemp</hi> is made. The <hi>qualities</hi> therefore of the best <hi>Toe,</hi> that can be in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are that the <hi>Staple</hi> be <hi>long, small, tough,</hi> and <hi>white.</hi> So that if in the <hi>Bark</hi> of any <hi>Plant,</hi> we can find these <hi>qualities</hi> to excell, we may be sure it will be of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter use, in some respects, for the making of <hi>Cloath</hi> than <hi>Flax</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>I WILL conclude with one <hi>Instance</hi> more, &amp; that is as to <hi>Grafting.</hi> The good and happy success whereof, doth certainly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34857:54"/>
depend upon the suitableness or respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence betwixt the several <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>stock</hi> and <hi>Cyon;</hi> as the <hi>Bark, Wood,</hi> and <hi>Pith:</hi> and that both as to the <hi>number, size,</hi> and <hi>position</hi> of the said <hi>parts,</hi> and of their several <hi>Pores</hi> or <hi>Vessels:</hi> according to the degrees whereof, the <hi>Conjunction (caeteris paribus)</hi> will be more or less prosperous. So that of all such <hi>Conjunctions</hi> as are found to be apt and taking, and which some have learned not without long pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and experience; another, only by comparing the <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Trees</hi> together, may with little trouble, and in much less time, inform himself. By the same means, some <hi>Conjunctions</hi> which seem to be strange, as <hi>Quince</hi> and <hi>Pear, White-thorn</hi> and <hi>Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> &amp;c. do yet, by the respondence of their <hi>parts,</hi> as well as by <hi>experience,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be good. And there is no doubt, but that many <hi>Conjunctions</hi> not yet tryed, or not known to have been so, may upon the same ground, be tryed with good success.</p>
               <p>The chief use of <hi>Grafting</hi> and <hi>Inoculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> is that they <hi>accelerate</hi> the growth of <hi>good fruit.</hi> The <hi>cause</hi> whereof, is the <hi>knot,</hi> which is always made in the <hi>Conjunction.</hi> By means whereof all the <hi>Sap</hi> is <hi>strained,</hi> and so ascendeth up into the <hi>Graff</hi> or <hi>Bud,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:34857:54"/>
                  <hi>purer</hi> and in less <hi>quantity;</hi> and is therefore better and sooner concocted. Hence, the smaller the <hi>Fruit</hi> of any <hi>Tree,</hi> though it be not the best, yet the <hi>Sap</hi> being there in <hi>less quantity,</hi> is the <hi>sooner ripe.</hi> On the contrary, where the <hi>Sap</hi> ascendeth too freely, it doth not only <hi>retard</hi> the growth of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> but produceth <hi>Barrenness;</hi> as is seen in those luxuriant <hi>Branches,</hi> where it runs all up to <hi>Leaves.</hi> Hence also <hi>Vines,</hi> by <hi>Bleeding,</hi> become more <hi>fruitful:</hi> that is, by the effusion of part of the <hi>Sap,</hi> there is a more easy <hi>melioration</hi> of that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. Even as <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> doth oftentimes produce a more healthful and better <hi>habit</hi> of our own <hi>Bodies.</hi> To conclude, the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening the quantity, and thereby the meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oration of the ascending <hi>Sap,</hi> by <hi>knots,</hi> is <hi>Natures</hi> own contrivance; as is seen in <hi>Sugar cane, Corn,</hi> and other <hi>Plants.</hi>
