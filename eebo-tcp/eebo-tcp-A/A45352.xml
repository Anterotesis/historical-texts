            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Conjunction of <hi>Mercies,</hi> which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſo eminently and peculiarly wrought on this Day for our Church and <hi>Nation,</hi> makes this Day an <hi>High Day,</hi> a very great and glorious <hi>Feſtival.</hi> A Day, which, upon a double Account, ought to be had in everlaſting Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: Not only for the Providential Diſcovery of the Snares of Death laid this Day for our <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> but for the late happy and aſtoniſhing Deliverance of us, their <hi>Poſterity,</hi> from the imminent Danger of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power.</hi> The impure Streams of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition</hi> had gone even over our Souls, the proud and inſulting Waves, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> had triumph'd over us (for they began to rage horribly, and ſwell, they gnaſh'd upon us with their Teeth, when their ſmall Stock of Arguments was ſpent; and by this time of Day we ſhould have found their <hi>Teeth Spears and Arrows, and their Tongue a ſharp Sword</hi>) the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> I ſay, had triumph'd over us, had not God ſent us, on this bleſſed Day, a <hi>Deliverer</hi> to reſcue us from <hi>Popiſh Tyranny,</hi> when we were ſo near ſinking under it. Great Reaſon therefore have we to ſay, with St. <hi>Paul, God deliver'd us from ſo great a Death, and doth deliver: in whom we truſt that he will yet alſo deliver us.</hi>

               <hi>Who deliver'd us from ſo great a Death, and doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver: in whom we truſt that he will yet alſo deliver us.</hi> But firſt.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place conſider we the <hi>great Death</hi> from which the Holy Apoſtle was delivered by God.</p>
            <p>By Death may be underſtood Troubles and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, extream or uttermoſt Dangers: Troubles and Afflictions in a Superlative, in the higheſt Degree: He <hi>was preſs'd out of Meaſure, above Strength;</hi> inſomuch, that he had almoſt black and deſponding Thoughts, <hi>he deſpair'd even of Life:</hi> If he had not found more than ordinary Aſſiſtances of the good Spirit of God, he had certainly ſunk under them. This is the doleful Account which he himſelf gives us at the Eighth Verſe, with the place too, where thoſe Troubles came upon him, namely, <hi>Aſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the Troubles were which he met with in <hi>Aſia,</hi> we are informed by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> in the 19th of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the 23d Verſe, where we read of a <hi>Riot,</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Aſſembly, a great Stir raiſed by one <hi>Demetrius,</hi> a Silver-ſmith, and the Workmen of like Occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, about the Doctrine of the Goſpel; becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> had preach'd againſt the Images which they made
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109046:5"/>
and worſhipp'd, <hi>as confounded be all they that worſhip carved Images, and that delight in vain Gods, worſhip him all ye Gods;</hi> becauſe he had perſuaded much Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they be no Gods which are made with Hands; they came upon him in a furious and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary Manner. <hi>Further;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 15.32. we read, <hi>if after the manner of men I have fought with Beaſts at Epheſus, what advantageth it me, if the dead riſe not?</hi> Some interpret thoſe Words of his Conflict with the ſame <hi>Demetrius</hi> and the Silver-Smiths, who were like Beaſts in their Conditions and Manners: Others are of Opinion, that he really was expoſed in the Theatre to furious Beaſts; tho', peradventure, he was only ſo <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, in the Purpoſe of Men; the Magiſtrates had ſentenced and condemned him to that Death, but <hi>Divine Providence</hi> interpos'd and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued him from the Execution of the Sentence: Thus probably theſe Words of my Text relate to his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at <hi>Epheſus, when God delivered him from ſo great a Death. Further;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Second Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 11.23. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That he ſuffered more than any of the very Twelve Apoſtles, <hi>in Labours more abundant, in Stripes above Meaſure, in Priſons more frequent, in Deaths oft,</hi> that is, in eminent Perils of Death; it is an <hi>Hebraiſm,</hi> the <hi>Hebrews</hi> expreſs great Dangers, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, Conflicts or Agonies by the Name of Death; thus <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18.4, 5. the <hi>Royal Pſalmiſt,</hi> when his Blood-Thirſty Enemies were ready, as a Torrent, to overwhelm him, complains, <hi>the Sorrows of Death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed me, and the Floods of ungodly Men made me afraid, the Sorrows of Hell compaſſed me about, the Snares of Death prevented me.</hi> And thus in <hi>Deaths

oft,</hi> that is, in Deadly Accidents and Dangers: And what they were, the Verſes following ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. <hi>Of the Jews, five times received I forty Stripes ſave one: thrice was I beaten with Rods: once was I ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: thrice I ſuffered Shipwrack: a Night and a Day I have been in the Deep.</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, There are ſome, who, according to <hi>Theophylact,</hi> aſſert this to have been the Name of a Well in which he hid himſelf after his great Danger at <hi>Lyſtra, Acts</hi> 14.19.

And

oh! how did he endure them with an undiſturbed Patience, and an entire Reſignation to the Divine Will! How did he bear up againſt them with all Chriſtian Courage, with a vigorous and undaunted Reſolution! How perfectly pleas'd with, how did he <hi>glory of his Infirmities,</hi> that is, his Sufferings? He very well underſtood that the <hi>Sufferings of this preſent World are not worthy to be compar'd to the Glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi> Tho' the Floods of Sorrow aroſe, tho' the Winds of Perſecution blew and vehemently beat upon him, yet he fell not; he had in Proſpect the beautiful and fair Haven of Eternity: His ſole Truſt and Confidence was in the Lord his God, whom <hi>the Winds and the Seas obey.</hi> Thus, <hi>tho' he was troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed, tho' perplexed, yet not in deſpair; though he was perſecuted, yet not forſaken; tho' caſt down, yet not deſtroy'd; no! God delivered him from ſo great a Death, and doth deliver: in whom we truſt that he will yet alſo deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this brings me to the Second thing, namely, That God, in this, as well as in the Apoſtolical Age, doth ſtill deliver from Death.</p>
            <p>In the 13th Chapter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Ver. 8. we read, <hi>Jeſus Christ the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever:</hi> The Faith in him, the entire Religion of Jeſus Chriſt is not only unchangeable, conſtantly the ſame throughout all meaſures of time, but alſo his Care and Love to his Myſtical Body, and all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it is immutable throughout all Times and Ages of the World; <hi>with the Lord our God is no Variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, neither Shadow of Turning.</hi> God never did leave, God never will forſake ſuch, whoſe Lives are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his Laws, as are Pure and Holy in all Manner of Converſation.

now, and ever will cover ſuch as fear him with the Wings of his Divine Providence, will give them his immenſe Favour and Almighty Protection, ſo long as the Sun and the Moon ſhall endure. It is God who made, who governeth, preſerveth and taketh Care of the World, he ſees all the Springs of Motion, all Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions here below, all Things are naked and opened to the Eyes of him with whom we have to do. Tho' his glorious Reſidence and Habitation be in the Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Bliſs above, yet <hi>he ſo far humbleth himſelf, as to behold the things done upon Earth;</hi> and therefore tho' <hi>wicked Men encourage themſelves in Miſchief and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune of laying Snares ſecretly, and ſay, who ſhall ſee them? tho' they imagine Wickedneſs and keep it ſecret among themſelves, every Man in the Deep of his Heart, yet God ſhall ſuddenly ſhoot at them with a ſwift Arrow, that they ſhall be wounded;</hi> yea, by his good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>their own Tongues ſhall make them fall, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that whoſo ſeeth them ſhall laugh them to Scorn:</hi> Thus, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.21. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>there are many Devices in a Man's Heart: nevertheleſs, the Counſel of the Lord, that ſhall ſtand.</hi> There are many Deſigns and Contrivances in the Minds of Men, which, they think, are ſo well laid, that they cannot miſcarry; but are all defeated by the over-ruling Counſel of the Lord.

Generation or Men: how hath this Church and Nation of ours been and ſtill is plagued by them? They are under a Holy League and ſolemn Oath to purſue our Ruine and the Deſtruction of our excellent Religion, and to effect this, they have all along acted, and ſtill do act under any Maſque; they turn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Proteus like,</hi> into any Shape to enkindle Strife and Contention amongſt us. Alas! all our Schiſms and unhappy Diviſions flow from this bitter Fountain. Oh that we would become wiſe and ſuffer our ſelves no longer to be cajol'd and deluded by them!

            <p>I ſay, it is not the moſt refined Policy that can out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy the Strength of Heaven: This the Helliſh Project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the <hi>Gun-Powder-Treaſon</hi> found to be infallibly true; the <hi>Arch-Plotter Garnet,</hi> a perfect <hi>Achitophel,</hi> a Man that could give and hide his Counſel as deep as Hell, with whom his Friends would embark in any deſign tho' never ſo black and dangerous, yet how far infatuated was this cunning <hi>Politician?</hi> Alas! he conſider'd not that ſome of the <hi>Conſpirators,</hi> who were willing to work a publick Miſchief for his Pleaſure, might alſo have a Deſire to ſecure their private Friends from Danger, by giving them ſome general or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Admonition: And, indeed, that one of them ſhould hint in a Letter to his honourable Friend the inſtant Danger, was not extraordinary, ſave only in this, that ſo much Tenderneſs of Heart, ſo much good Nature could be left in his Breaſt, who had conſented to his Country's Ruine.

ſtrange, that ſuch a Man ſhould put on the Bowels of Compaſſion for a private Friend as had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd his Country's perpetual Deſolation: Where was then this Piety? Where was then this Religious Affection? Alas! all Nature, all Humanity, all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Laws both Divine and Humane were then quite abandoned, there was then no Conſcience made to extirpate the whole Nation, and all for a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Zeal to the Catholick Religion. Can this be the Chriſtian Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No, the eſſential Mark, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Character of the Chriſtian Religion is Love and Charity: This is a Religion which hath all of the Dove, and nothing of the Vulture in it, which is <hi>Wiſdom from above,</hi> which is <hi>first pure and then peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> it is a charitable Religion, and none can juſtly pretend to it, whoſe Doctrines are <hi>Earthly, Senſual</hi> and <hi>Deviliſh;</hi> who breathe nothing but Curſes. and Slaughters, who hold it lawful to deſtroy all ſuch as differ from them in Matters of Faith, to extirpate by Fire and Sword all ſuch as <hi>worſhip God after the Way which they call Hereſie;</hi> and ſuch are the bloody Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Roman Religion:</hi> Principles diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite to the Doctrine and Practice of the Author of the Chriſtian Religion, the ever <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus.

Zeal to the Catholick Religion; a horribly miſtaken blind Zeal, <hi>a Zeal not at all according to Knowledge.</hi> Alas! <hi>They know not what manner of Spirit they are of.</hi> But God deliver'd <hi>the King, the Queen, the tender Princes, the Nobles,</hi> the whole Kingdom from their deſign'd Deſtruction. <hi>God deliver'd them from ſo great a Death. Death!</hi> How exorbitant was that <hi>Death</hi> in its Nature? How tranſcendently wicked in its Deſign? How barbarous and unnatural? Such a prodigious Cruelty as is beyond the Example of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, as is not to be parallell'd in all the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous Records of time from the Beginning of the World. The Plot was deeply laid, it was hatch'd and contriv'd in the dark, they kept it ſecret, every Man in the Deep of his Heart, and not without Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Religion; Ay, they ſwore by the <hi>Bleſſed Trinity,</hi> and by the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> never to diſcloſe it directly, nor indirectly, by Word or Circumſtance: But, by the good Providence of God, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd upon the Houſe-tops. A moſt wonderful Proclamation, and never enough to be reflected upon with Praiſe and Thankſgiving; ſuch a Diſcovery as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himſelf confeſſes to have been miraculous. Had it taken effect, as it was juſt ripe for Execution, my Blood chills, I tremble to think of the diſmal Conſequences of it: We had then been depriv'd of <hi>King, Queen, Princes,</hi> and <hi>all the Nobility:</hi> It would have been a moſt miſerable Deſolation: How would this poor <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> have laid a bleeding? Peace and Happineſs would preſently have taken the Wing and flown from this <hi>Britiſh Iſle;</hi> there would then have been nothing but inteſtine War, Bloodſhed, and the greateſt Confuſion.

Treaſon that could ever be imagin'd by any, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made or writ of Laws, was <hi>Crimen laeſae Majeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> the violating the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of the <hi>Prince:</hi> But the <hi>Gunpowder-Treaſon</hi> wants a Name ſufficient to expreſs it; it tended not only to the Hurt, but to the Death of the <hi>King;</hi> and not to the Death of the <hi>King</hi> only, but of his whole Kingdom, to the Deſtruction of the beautiful Frame, the Diſſolation of the Noble Fabrick of this Ancient, Famous, and Flouriſhing <hi>Monarchy,</hi> even the Deletion of our whole Name and Nation.</p>
            <p>No Mantle of Holineſs can cover ſuch a Treaſon, no Pretence of Religion can excuſe it, God and Heaven condemn it, all Souls of a truly Chriſtian Temper and Diſpoſition muſt deteſt and abhor it. <hi>Six and Thirty Barrels of Powder,</hi> with Bars of Iron, Stones and Wood upon them! What a great Breach, what a fiery Tempeſt, what a Motion and Commotion of Earth and Air would there have been? But God deliver'd our <hi>Anceſtors from ſo great a Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Secondly, God doth ſtill deliver from Death.</p>
            <p>Ay, God hath lately deliver'd us, their <hi>Poſterity,</hi> from Death and Deſtruction. It is not many Years ago ſince we had a ſad and melancholy Proſpect of Affairs; it is not long ſince a thick and black Cloud hung over our Heads, which, in all probability, would have broke and pour'd down upon us a Deluge of Waters, if it had not been timely diſpell'd by the comfortable Appearance of a <hi>Bright and Glorious Star</hi> in our <hi>Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere,</hi> by the happy Arrival of <hi>King William</hi> upon this Day. I need not acquaint you how our <hi>Popiſh</hi> Enemies attempted to deſtroy both our Laws and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It was an excellent Reply which an ancient and eminent <hi>Serjeant at Law</hi> gave the <hi>King,</hi> when he complemented him upon his Arrival: <hi>His Majeſty</hi> told
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109046:9"/>
him he had out-liv'd moſt of his Profeſſion; and he truly anſwer'd, that if his <hi>Majeſty</hi> had not come over, he ſhould have out-liv'd the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelf. We flatter'd our ſelves indeed with a Belief that it was impoſſible to have the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion ever introduced here, becauſe a thing ſo abſolutely againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution; that let the Principles of the <hi>Prince</hi> be what they would, the Adminiſtration of the <hi>Laws</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity run in the ſame Channel he found them in: But we ſoon ſaw how the Courſe of the River was forc'd, and the Stream turn'd ſo as to run over our Soul; we were quickly made ſenſible of our groſs Miſtake and Deluſion, we preſently underſtood that there is no Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment too hard for a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> to cut in ſunder, no Conſtitution ſo ſtrong as to wreſtle with a <hi>diſpenſing Power.</hi> Thus our Religion, our Laws, our Liberties, all that is near and dear to us would have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, had not God deliver'd them from ſo great a Death, by ſending us the beſt of <hi>Princes,</hi> who this Day ſet his Foot on the <hi>Britiſh Shore:</hi> It was <hi>he</hi> alone whom God made the happy Inſtrument of our Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it was he who ſtop'd our furious Enemies in their Career, who prevented their baſe Deſigns by a ſudden and an unexpected Change of the Scene, by ſuch an aſtoniſhing Revolution of Affairs, as no Age, peradventure, can parallel.</p>
            <p>A moſt happy <hi>Revolution,</hi> whatſoever our <hi>Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> think of it. Alaſs! when once the Minds of Men are darkned with Ambition, Pride, Revenge, Hatred, Malice and Envy, let Acts of Providence be never ſo <hi>illuſtriouſly</hi> viſible, they will not ſee them, ſuch Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is thick to Admiration, <hi>how great is that Darkneſs!</hi> It was, I ſay, a moſt happy <hi>Revolution:</hi> Tho' it is true indeed, the Conſequence of it hath been a vaſt Expence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109046:10"/>
of <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Treaſure:</hi> but ſtill we have the leaſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to murmur or complain: This <hi>Blood</hi> hath not been ſpil'd, this terrible <hi>War</hi> hath not rag'd in our own, but in a Foreign Land; all the <hi>Havock</hi> which hath been made, all the Devaſtations by Fire and Sword were not here, but in other Countries. Taxes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions indeed we have not been freed from, but what then? <hi>our Yoke hath been eaſy, and our Burden light,</hi> and if Judgment may be form'd according to the <hi>Sumptuous</hi> way of living, according to the little Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there hath been, ever ſince the War commenc'd, either of Diet, ſplendid Attire, or other expenſive Diverſions, all the Charge we have been at is <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively</hi> as nothing. It is a <hi>Queſtion</hi> whether greater Injury hath been done to the <hi>Publick,</hi> whether the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in general hath ſuffer'd more by <hi>impairing the Coin,</hi> than by the War: the Prevention of which great Miſchief for the future, is ſuch a glorious Act as ought never to be forgotten: To have call'd in our <hi>baſe Money</hi> at a time when we ſlept upon the downy Bed of Peace, would have been a matter of far leſs Difficulty; but to regulate the Coin, when we were engag'd in a bloody and expenſive War, this Act no Age peradventure can parallel. It is a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> I ſay, whether the Nation in general hath ſuffer'd more by <hi>impairing the Coin</hi> than by the War: I heartily wiſh that <hi>ſuch</hi> as have thus been guilty of plunging the Nation into calamitous Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, may be deeply touch'd and affected with the Conſideration of it, that they may Repent of the <hi>great Wrong and univerſal Robbery</hi> which they have committed, and demonſtrate the Sincerity of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by giving the Wealth they have gotten by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, Fraud, and Deceit, to <hi>Charitable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes.</hi> If they do not, the time will come, when they will wiſh they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109046:10"/>
had not <hi>enriched themſelves by others Poverty;</hi> that they had mov'd in a low Sphere, and been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a mean Condition, that they had caſt themſelves naked into the Arms of <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and known nothing of Temporal Affluence and Proſperity. <hi>Oh! What is a Man advantaged, if he gain the whole World, and loſe himſelf, or be a caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away? Luke</hi> 9.25. <hi>Oh! what ſhall a Man give in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his Soul? Mat.</hi> 16.26.

            <p>But, bleſſed be God, <hi>the Tables of the Money Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are now overturn'd,</hi> this great and dangerous <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper</hi> which the Nation hath long labour'd under, is now healed, this <hi>baſe Art,</hi> as well as the <hi>terrible War,</hi> hath had its happy Period and Concluſion; and if we would but put away from us all Bitterneſs and Wrath, Anger and Clamour, Malice and Envy, and live in Chriſtian Love and Charity, if we would but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace, what could hinder us from being the <hi>happieſt People</hi> upon the Face of the Earth? <hi>What complaining could then be in our Streets?

made the War to ceaſe, it is he who is the Author of all our Deliverances, <hi>it is he who maketh Wars to ceaſe in all the World, who breaketh the Bow, and knappeth the Spear in ſunder, and burneth the Chariots in the Fire:</hi> God, I ſay, hath made the War to ceaſe, thro' the Noble Conduct and Heroick Valour of our <hi>Great King,</hi> God hath given unto us the Bleſſings of <hi>Peace.</hi> God Land him ſafe again on our <hi>joyful Shore,</hi> let him return with the greateſt Glory and Triumph, with the loudeſt Shouts and Acclamations, God Almighty give him always the Hearts of his <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his <hi>People;</hi> O <hi>Young Men and Maidens, Old Men and Children,</hi> cry, <hi>God Save King William;</hi> for he it is by whom God hath deliver'd us from Death, from innumerable Dangers, and doth deliver: In <hi>whom we truſt, that he will yet alſo deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this brings me to the Third and the Laſt thing; Namely,</p>
            <p>What Method we muſt of abſolute neceſſity take to endear the Lord our God, to oblige him ſtill to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and deliver us from Death.</p>
            <p>And here, if ever, we hope to endear the God of Heaven to us, to oblige him to protect and deliver us from Death; this is the Method which we muſt of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity take: We muſt lead an holy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Life, we muſt endeavour, as much as in us lies, to be Pure and Holy in all manner of Converſation. Do we pretend to truſt in the Lord our God? Alas! without Holineſs, we truſt in vain; unleſs we purify our ſelves, we can have no ſure and certain Hope, no rational Aſſurance of the <hi>Divine Protection.</hi> No <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> under Heaven have more liberally taſted of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and loving Kindneſs of the Lord, than we. No <hi>People</hi> in the World have ſtronger Obligations to Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vertue than we. What is it that the Lord could
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109046:11"/>
have done for this our Nation, and he hath not done it? God hath given us the beſt Religion, the beſt Government, the beſt Laws, and the beſt of <hi>Princes,</hi> and by him the beſt of Bleſſings, <hi>Peace.</hi> How many Deliverances from Death have we had? The Time and your Patience would fail me to give you a particular Enumeration of them; they are more in Number than I am now able to expreſs. How often hath the Lord been pleas'd to deliver our <hi>Glorious Prince</hi> from Death; and in <hi>him</hi> us? for if this our <hi>Light,</hi> our <hi>Lamp</hi> had been quench'd in Battel, <hi>What a Day of Darkneſs and Gloomineſs, what a Day of Clouds and thick Darkneſs would there have been?</hi> He may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſtly be call'd the <hi>Light</hi> of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for, the Splendor and Greatneſs, the Beauty and Glory, the Conduct and Direction, the Comfort and Safety, the Welfare and Happineſs of us his <hi>People</hi> flow from and depend upon him. How often, I ſay, hath the Lord been pleas'd to deliver <hi>him</hi> from Death? From Perils in the Field, from Perils in the Sea, from Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils by his own <hi>Subjects,</hi> from a treacherous and bloody, an horrid and barbarous <hi>Aſſaſſination.</hi> And God will ſtill deliver him and us, if we be but obedient and conformable to his Divine Laws. But if we will not be obedient, if theſe manifold Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Mercies of the Lord will not influence and perſuade us to Purity of Life and Holineſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, how fatal will the Conſequence be? What can we look for but Ruine and Deſtruction? Oh! <hi>We ſhall be conſumed both we and our King.</hi> We may aſſure our ſelves, that all Engines are now at work to diſturb our Repoſe, our Peace and Tranquility. Oh! that all ſuch as move in ſublime and honorary Orbs would have a vigilant Eye upon all the Enemies of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109046:12"/>
our Conſtitution. Oh! that all <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> would unanimouſly reſolve to watch and ſtudy to preſerve the People committed to their reſpective Charges, in Peace and Godlineſs. We may aſſure our ſelves, there will be <hi>Helliſh Plots</hi> and <hi>damnable Contrivances,</hi> ſo long as there is either a <hi>Devil</hi> or a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> in the World. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will always bear us the ſame implacable Hatred, we ſhall find them of the ſame diabolical Temper and malicious Diſpoſition. Now, who can confound their Devices? Who can deliver us from their Machinations but God? and nothing can challenge or oblige him to do ſo but Piety and Vertue. Alas! if we do wickedly, if we do not leave off our Ingratitude and Impiety, our unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Murmurings and Repinings, if we ſtill provoke him by Sins and Tranſgreſſions, what terrible Effects will not theſe Things produce? <hi>Oh! we ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed both we and our King:</hi> For ſearch the lively Oracles of God, the holy Scriptures, and you will find there, that God hath all along darted the Rays of Proſperity, hath ſhowr'd down all imaginable Bleſſings upon ſuch Nations as <hi>feared him and wrought Righteouſneſs;</hi> and on the contrary, God hath pour'd down the fierceſt Inſtances of his Anger and heavy Diſpleaſure upon ſuch Kingdoms as trampled upon his Laws, as affronted him by Wickedneſs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety; this hath been the conſtant Courſe of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> and in all probability will be ſo to the end of the World. That was good and wholeſome Advice which <hi>Achior</hi> gave <hi>Holofernes</hi> concerning the <hi>Jews.</hi> Judith 5.21, 22. <hi>My Lord and Governour, If there be any Error in this People, and they ſin againſt their God, this ſhall be their Ruine; but if there be no Iniquity in their Nation, let my Lord now paſs by, leſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109046:12"/>
their Lord defend them, and we become a Reproach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world:</hi> And this ſalutary Advice we find confirm'd by <hi>Judith</hi> her ſelf in the 11th Chapter, and the 9th and 10th Verſe, <hi>As concerning the Matter which</hi> Achior <hi>ſpoke in thy Councel, we have heard of it. O Lord, and Governour, reject not his Word, but lay it up in thine Heart, for it is true; our Nation ſhall not be puniſh'd, neither can the Sword prevail againſt them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they ſin againſt their God.</hi> And, indeed, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how God dealt with his own <hi>peculiar People,</hi> the <hi>Children of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p>When they walk'd in his Statutes, and kept his Commandments, how tranſcendently great then was their Affluence and Proſperity? the ineſtimable Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Peace</hi> was then within <hi>their Walls, and Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs within their Palaces;</hi> Quietneſs and Eaſe, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Love, all imaginable Happineſs they enjoy'd at home, and the Almighty made them victorious and triumphant abroad; they rejoyc'd under the Shadow of his Wings: But when they became corrupt and abominable in their Doings, when there was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Declenſion from the Faith and Practice of True Religion, then they ceas'd to be a happy and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous People; they were then led into Captivity, <hi>their Enemies then oppreſſed them, and had them in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> put upon their Necks the Chains of Bondage and intolerable Slavery. Now theſe things happen'd unto them for <hi>Enſamples;</hi> theſe things are written for <hi>our Learning and Admonition.</hi> If we conſtantly walk before God in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, we ſhall then enjoy Happineſs and Tranquility, Peace and Plenteouſneſs: But if we apoſtatize from God and Goodneſs, he will then have a Controverſie with us, Fire and Famine, Sword and Peſtilence, his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109046:13"/>
will then rage amongſt us: For if <hi>God ſpar'd not the natural Branches,</hi> how can we expect he will ſpare us? If <hi>we continue not in his Goodneſs;</hi> that is, if we ſtand not faſt, if we perſevere not in the Faith, in ſuch a Faith as worketh by Love, as lives and acts by Charity, as is productive of all noble and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions; thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> argueth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.21, 22. It is infallibly true, that Wickedneſs and Vice draws down God's Wrath and Vengeance upon any People, that Looſeneſs of Life, and Corruption of Manners brings the moſt flouriſhing People to Ruine and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay. Oh! then let the Conſideration of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Truth oblige and enforce us to live up to the Precepts and Inſtitutions of our excellent Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. God then will be our conſtant Friend and Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, <hi>God then will ſtabliſh the wonderful Things He hath been graciouſly pleas'd to work for us;</hi> God then will continue to deliver our <hi>Sovereign</hi> Lord the <hi>King,</hi> and us his People from Death, from all the impious Plots and Conſpiracies of his and our Enemies, both at home and abroad; God then will bleſs him and us with Temporal Peace and Happineſs in this World, and with eternal Peace and Happineſs in the World to come.</p>

            <head>THE POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>IN part of the fore-going <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> I have ſlightly touch'd upon the unhappy <hi>Schiſms,</hi> and much to be lamented <hi>Diviſions,</hi> which now furiouſly rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; and have ſhewed you the <hi>Spring</hi> from whence they flow, namely, the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and other <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is that <hi>Church</hi> which hath, ever ſince our <hi>Bleſſed Reformation,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly ſown the Seeds of Contention amongſt us, and, it is much to be feared, <hi>She</hi> hath now more than ever, a pleaſing Proſpect of a plentiful Harveſt. It was that <hi>Church</hi> which was the Source and Origin of all the late Troubles and Confuſions; and <hi>She</hi> ſtill endeavours with the ſame implacable Malice to ſet us at <hi>Variance</hi> and <hi>Strife</hi> amongſt our ſelves. This is the <hi>Engine</hi> which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have all along made uſe of, and ſtill do, to effect our Ruine and Deſtruction. They very well underſtand, that <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> is the only Gate which can poſſibly give <hi>Popery</hi> an entrance into this <hi>Kingdom.</hi> That this hath been their conſtant Practice, I could produce infinite. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies out of very Authentick <hi>Hiſtorians;</hi> but now, I ſhall only recommend theſe Two <hi>following Letters</hi> to your ſerious Peruſal and Conſideration, which are not only of unqueſtionable Authority, but clearly evince, and ſufficiently diſcover the <hi>Roman</hi> Contrivances and Deſigns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:109046:14"/>I pray God we may obviate them by our Vigilance and Circumſpection, by our timely ſeeing the Things which belong unto our Peace, by a vigorous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Reſolution, to be all of one Heart, and of one Mind, and <hi>to be henceforth no more Children, toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine, by the Sleight of Men, and cunning Crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>AS I am here employ'd by our Sovereign Lord the King, your Grace can teſtifie, that I have left no Stone unturn'd for his Majeſty's Advancement; neither can I omit (whenever I meet with Treacheries or Conſpiracies againſt the Church and State of <hi>England</hi>) the ſending your Grace an Account in general. I fear Matters will not anſwer your Expectations, if your Grace do but ſeriouſly weigh them with Deliberation: For be you aſſur'd, the <hi>Romiſh Clergy</hi> have gull'd the miſled Party of our <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> and that under a <hi>Puritanical Dreſs;</hi> for which the ſeveral <hi>Fraternities</hi> of that Church, have lately received <hi>Indulgencies</hi> from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Council of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> for to educate ſeveral of the young Fry of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who be Natives of his Majeſty's Realms and Dominions, and inſtruct them in all manner of Principles and Tenents contrary to the <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be in the Town of <hi>Hague,</hi> to my certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, two dangerous <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> of whom I have given notice to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who have large Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences granted them, and known to be of the Church of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109046:15"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> although they ſeem <hi>Puritans,</hi> and do converſe with ſeveral of our <hi>Engliſh Factors.</hi> The one, <hi>James Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Man, and the other, <hi>John Napper,</hi> a <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Blade. The main Drift of theſe Intenſions, is, to pull down the <hi>Engliſh Epiſcopacy,</hi> as being the chief Support of the <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> of our Nation: for which, purpoſe above Sixty <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy-men are <unclear>gone</unclear> within theſe two Years out of the Monaſteries of the <hi>French <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing</hi>'s Dominions, to preach up the <hi>Scotch</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> his Deſcriptions and Rules with in that <hi>Kirk,</hi> and to ſpread the ſame about the Northern Coaſts of <hi>England.</hi> Let therefore his <hi>Majeſty</hi> have an inkling of theſe Crotchets, that he may be perſuaded, whenever Matters of the Church come before you, to refer them to your Grace, and the Epiſcopal Party of the Realm: For there be great Preparations making ready againſt the Liturgy and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and all evil Contrivances here and in <hi>France,</hi> and in other Proteſtant Holdings, to make your Grace and the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy odious to all Reformed Proteſtants abroad. It has wrought ſo much on divers of the Foreign Miniſters of the Proteſtants, that they eſteem our Clergy little better than Papiſts. The main things, that they hit in our Teeth, are, our Biſhops to be called Lords; the Service of the Church; the Croſs in Baptiſm; Confirmation; Bowing at the Name of Jeſus; the Communion Tables placed Altar-ways; our Manner of Conſecrations: And ſeveral other Matters which be of late buzz'd into the Heads of the Foreign Clergy, to make your Grievances the leſs regarded in caſe of a Change, which is aimed at, if not ſpeedily prevented. Your Grace's Letter is carefully delivered by my Gentleman's own Hands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prince.</p>

            <p>I Thank God I do take my Pilgrimage patiently, yet I cannot but condole the Change of the Church and State of <hi>England:</hi> And more in my Pilgrimage than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe I dare not witneſs and declare to that ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flock of our Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> who have miſled them, and who they are that feed them. But that your Lordſhip may he more ſenſible of the Church's Calamities, and of the Dangers ſhe is in of being ruin'd, if God be not merciful unto her, I have ſent you a Part of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109046:16"/>
and it from credible Hands, at this preſent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo ſure a Meſſenger, and ſo fit an Opportunity.</p>
            <p>It plainly appears, that in the Year <hi>1646,</hi> by Order from <hi>Rome,</hi> above a Hundred of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy were ſent into <hi>England,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>Engliſh, Scotch,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who had been educated in <hi>France, Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> part of theſe within the ſeveral Schools there appointed for their Inſtructions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In each of theſe <hi>Romiſh</hi> Nurſeries, theſe Scholars were taught ſeveral Handicraft Trades and Callings, as their Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities were moſt bending, beſides their Orders or Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Church. They have many yet at <hi>Paris</hi> a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up to be ſent over, who twice in the Week oppoſe one the other; one pretending <hi>Presbytery,</hi> the other <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> ſome Anabaptiſm, and other contrary Tenents, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and prejudicial to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to all the Reformed Churches here abroad. But they are wiſely preparing to prevent theſe Deſigns, which I heartily wiſh were conſidered in <hi>England</hi> among the Wiſe there.</p>
            <p>When the Romiſh Orders do thus argue <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> there is appointed one of the Learned of thoſe Convents to take Notes and to judge: and as he finds their Fancies, whether for <hi>Presbytery, Independency, Anabaptiſm, Atheiſm,</hi> or for any new Tenents, ſo accordingly they be to act, and to exerciſe their Wits: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon their Permiſſion when they be ſent abroad, they enter their Names in the Convent Regiſtry, alſo their Licences: if a <hi>Franſciſcan,</hi> if a <hi>Dominican,</hi> or <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> or any other Order, having ſeveral Names there entered in their Licence; in caſe of a Diſcovery in one Place, then to fly to another, and there to change their Names or Habit.</p>
            <p>For an Aſſurance of their Conſtancy to their ſeveral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they are to give Monthly Intelligence to their Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, of all Affairs wherever they be diſpers'd: ſo that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109046:16"/>
the Engliſh Abroad know News better than ye at home. When they return into <hi>England,</hi> they are taught their Leſſon, to ſay, (if any enquire from whence they come,) that they were poor Chriſtians formerly that fled beyond Sea for their Religion Sake, and are now returned, with glad News to enjoy their Liberty of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>The Hundred Men that went over, <hi>1646.</hi> were moſt of them Soldiers in the Parliaments Army, and were daily to correſpond with thoſe Romaniſts in our late King's Army, that were lately at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and pretended to fight for his Sacred Majeſty: For at that time, there were ſome Roman-Catholicks who did not know the Deſign a contriving againſt our Church and State of <hi>England.</hi> But the Year following, <hi>1647.</hi> many of thoſe Romiſh Orders, who came over the Year before, were in Conſultation toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, knowing each other. And thoſe of the King's Party asking ſome why they took with the Parliament's Side, and asking others. Whether they were bewitch'd to turn <hi>Puritans?</hi> not knowing the Deſign: But at laſt, ſecret Bulls and Licences being produced by thoſe of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's Side, it was declared between them, there was no better deſign to confound the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than by pretending <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi> It was argued then, That <hi>England</hi> would be a Second <hi>Holland,</hi> a Common-Wealth; and if ſo, what would become of the King? It was anſwered, Would to God it were come to that Point. It was again reply'd, Your ſelves have Preached ſo much againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Holineſs, that <hi>Rome</hi> and her Romaniſts will be little the better for that Change: But it was anſwered, You ſhall have Maſs ſufficient for <hi>100000</hi> in a ſhort ſpace, and the Governors never the Wiſer. Then ſome of the mercifulleſt of the Romaniſts ſaid, this cannot be done unleſs the King die: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which Argument, the Romiſt Orders thus licenced, and in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109046:17"/>
Parliament Army, wrote unto their ſeveral Convents, but eſpecially to the <hi>Sorboniſts,</hi> whether it may be ſcrupled to make away our late <hi>Godly King,</hi> and his Majeſty, his Son, our King and Maſter; who, bleſſed be God, hath eſcaped their Romiſh Snares laid for him? It was returned from the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> that it was lawful for <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to work Changes in Governments for the Mother-Churches Advancement, and chiefly in an Heritical Kingdom; and ſo lawfully make away the King.</p>
            <p>Thus much, to my <hi>Knowledge,</hi> have I ſeen and heard ſince my leaving your Lordſhip, of which I thought it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry requiſite to inform your Grace; for my ſelf would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have credited theſe things, had not <hi>mine Eyes</hi> ſeen ſure Evidence of the ſame. Let theſe things ſleep within your gracious Lordſhip's Breaſt, and not awake but upon ſure Grounds, for this Age can truſt no Man, there being ſo great Fallacy amongst Men.
