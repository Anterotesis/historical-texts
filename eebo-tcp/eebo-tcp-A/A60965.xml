            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Best part of the Fortune of my last Play <hi>(The Innocent Adultery)</hi> was, that it gave me an Opportunity of making my self known to Your Grace. You were pleased to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the Advances which I had been a great while directing and aiming at You, and have since encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd me into an Industry, which, I hope, will allow me in this Play to own (which is the only way I can) the great Obligations I have to You.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50837:3"/>
I stand engag'd to Mrs. <hi>Behn</hi> for the Occasion of a most Passionate Distress in my Last Play; and in a Conscience that I had not made her a sufficient Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, I have run further into her Debt for <hi>Oroonoko,</hi> with a Design to oblige me to be honest; and that every one may find me out for Ingratitude, when I don't say all that's sit for me upon that Subject. She had a great Command of the Stage; and I have often wonder'd that she would bury her Favourite Hero in a <hi>Novel,</hi> when she might have reviv'd him in the <hi>Scene.</hi> She thought either that no Actor could represent him; or she could not bear him repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented: And I believe the last, when I remember what I have heard from a Friend of hers, That she always told his Story, more feelingly, than she writ it. Whatever happen'd to him at <hi>Surinam,</hi> he has mended his Condition in <hi>England.</hi> He was born here under Your Grace's Influence; and that has carried his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune farther into the World, than all the Poetical Stars that I could have sollicited for his Success. It was Your Opinion, <hi>My Lord,</hi> that directed me to Mr. <hi>Verbruggen;</hi> and it was his Care to maintain Your Opinion, that directed the Town to me, the Better Part of it, the People of Quality; whose Favours as I am proud of, I shall always be industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to preserve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I know the Respect and Reverence which in this Address I ought to appear in before You, who are so intimate with the Ancients, so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb facs="tcp:50837:3"/>
a Knower of the several Species of Poetry, and so Just a Judge in the Trials of this kind. You have an Absolute Power to Arraign and Convict, but a prevailing Inclination to Pardon and Save; and from the Humanity of Your Temper, and the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Difficulties of succeeding this way, never aggravate or insist upon Faults

The Favour of Great Men is the Poets Inheritance, and all Ages have allow'd 'em to put in their Claim; I only wish that I had Merit enough to prefer me to Your Grace: That I might deserve in some measure that Patronage which You are pleased to bestow on me: That I were a <hi>Horace</hi> for such a <hi>Mecoenas:</hi> That I could describe what I admire; and tell the World what I really think, That as You possess those Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Advantages of Nature and Fortune in so Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a degree; that as You so far excel in the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Body and Mind, You were design'd and fashion'd a Prince, to be the Honour of the Nation, and the Grace and Ornament of the Court. <hi>Sir,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50837:4"/>
In the Fulness of Happiness and Blessings which You enjoy, I can only bring in my Wishes for the Continuance of 'em; they shall constantly be devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you, with all the Services of,</p>

            <l>AS when in Hostile Times two Neighbouring States</l>
            <l>Strive by themselves, and their Confederates;</l>
            <l>The War at first is made with awkard Skill,</l>
            <l>And Soldiers clumsily each other kill:</l>
            <l>Till time at length their untaught Fury tames,</l>
            <l>And into Rules their heedless Rage reclaims:</l>
            <l>Then every Science by degrees is made</l>
            <l>Subservient to the Man-destroying Trade:</l>
            <l>Wit, Wisdom, Reading, Observation, Art;</l>
            <l>A well-turn'd Head to guide a Generous Heart.</l>
            <l>So it may prove with our Contending Stages,</l>
            <l>If you will kindly but supply their Wages:</l>
            <l>Which you with ease may furnish, by retrenching</l>
            <l>Your Superfluities of Wine and Wenching.</l>
            <l>Who'd grudge to spare from Riot and hard Drinking,</l>
            <l>To lay it out on means to mend his thinking?</l>
            <l>To follow such Advice you shou'd have leisure,</l>
            <l>Since what refines your Sense, refines your Pleasure:</l>
            <l>Women grown tame by Use each Fool can get,</l>
            <l>But Cuckolds all are made by Men of Wit.</l>
            <l>To Virgin Favours Fools have no pretence:</l>
            <l>For Maidenheads were made for Men of Sense.</l>
            <l>'Tis not enough to have a Horse well bred,</l>
            <l>To shew his Mettle, he must be well fed:</l>
            <l>Nor is it all in Provender and Breed,</l>
            <l>He must be try'd and strain'd, to mend his speed:</l>
            <l>A Favour'd Poet, like a Pamper'd Horse,</l>
            <l>Will strain his Eye-balls out to win the Course.</l>
            <l>Do you but in your Wisdoms vote it fit</l>
            <l>To yield due Succors to this War of Wit,</l>
            <l>The Buskin with more grace shall tread the Stage,</l>
            <l>Love sigh in softer Strains, Heroes less Rage:</l>
            <l>Satyr shall show a Triple Row of Teeth,</l>
            <l>And Comedy shall laugh your Fops to death:</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:50837:5"/>
Wit shall refine, and <hi>Pegasus</hi> shall foam,</l>

            <l>And since the Nation's in the Conquering Fit,</l>
            <l>As you by Arms, we'll vanquish <hi>France</hi> in Wit:</l>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Well.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, I'll keep you in countenance. The Young Fellows, you know, the dearest part of the Town, and without whom <hi>London</hi> had been a Wilderness to you and me, had forsaken us a great while.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                     <p>Forsaken us! I don't know that they ever had us.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Well.</speaker>
                     <p>Forsaken us the worst way, Child; that is, did not think us worth having; they neglected us, no longer design'd upon us, they were tir'd of us. Women in <hi>London</hi> are like
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50837:6"/>
the Rich Silks, they are out of fashion a great while before they wear out.—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                     <p>The Devil take the Fashion, I say.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Well.</speaker>
                     <p>You may tumble 'em over and over at their first coming up, and never disparage their Price; but they fall upon wearing immediately, lower and lower in their value, till they come to the Broker at last.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                     <p>Ay, ay, that's the Merchant they deal with. The Men would have us at their own scandalous Rates: Their Plenty makes 'em wanton; and in a little time, I suppose, they won't know what they would have of the Women themselves.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Well.</speaker>
                     <p>O, yes, they know what they wou'd have. They wou'd have a Woman give the Town a Pattern of her Person and Beauty, and not stay in it so long to have the whole Piece worn out. They wou'd have the Good Face only discover'd, and not the Folly that commonly goes along with it. They say there is a vast Stock of Beauty in the Nation, but a great part of it lies in unprofitable hands; therefore for the good of the Publick, they wou'd have a Draught made once a Quarter, send the decaying Beauties for Breeders into the Countrey, to make room for New Faces to appear, to countenance the Pleasures of the Town.</p>

                     <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis very hard, the Men must be young as long as they live, and poor Women be thought decaying and unfit for the Town at One or Two and twenty. I'm sure we were not Seven Years in <hi>London.</hi>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Well.</speaker>
                     <p>Not half the time taken notice of, Sister. The Two or Three last Years we could make nothing of it, even in a Vizard-Masque; not in a Vizard-Masque, that has cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many a man into an old acquaintance. Our Faces began to be as familiar to the Men of Intrigue, as their Duns, and as much avoided. We durst not appear in Publick Places, and were almost grudg'd a Gallery in the Churches: Even there they had their Jests upon us, and cry'd, She's in the right on't, good Gentlewoman, since no man considers her Body, she does very well indeed to take care of her Soul.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Well.</speaker>
                     <p>Then, you may remember, we were reduc'd to the last necessity, the necessity of making silly Visits to our civil Acquaintance, to bring us into tolerable Company. Nay, the young Inns-of-Court Beaus, of but one Term's standing in the Fashion, who knew no body, but as they were shewn 'em by the Orange-Women, had Nicknames for us: How often have they laugh'd out, There goes my Landlady; Is not she come to let Lodgings yet?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Well.</speaker>
                     <p>And that we must have come to. For your part, what Trade cou'd you set up in? You wou'd never arrive at the Trust and Credit of a Guinea-Bawd: You wou'd have too much Business of your own, ever to mind other Peoples.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                     <p>That is true indeed.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Well.</speaker>
                     <p>Then, as a certain sign that there was nothing more to be hop'd for, the Maids at the Chocolate-Houses found us out, and laugh'd at us: Our <hi>Billet-doux</hi> lay there neglected for Waste-Paper: We were cry'd down so low we cou'd not pass upon the City; and became so notorious in our galloping way, from one end of the Town to t'other, that at last we cou'd hardly compass a competent change of Petticoats to disguize us to the Hackney-Coachmen: And then it was near walking a-foot indeed.</p>

                     <p>To prevent which, with what Youth and Beauty was left, some Experience, and the small Remainder of Fifteen hundred Pounds apiece, which amounted to bare Two hundred between us both, I persuaded you to bring your Person for a Venture to the <hi>Indies.</hi> Every thing has succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Voyage: I pass for your Brother: One of the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Planters here happening to dye just as we landed, I have claim'd Kindred with him: So, without making his Will, he has left us the Credit of his Relation to trade upon: We pass for his Cousins, coming here to <hi>Surinam</hi> chiefly upon his Invitation: We live in Reputation; have the best Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

Lord, there's a great deal in saving a Decency: I never minded it before: Well, I'm glad you spoke first to excuse my Modesty. But what, Modesty means nothing, and is the Virtue of a Girl, that does not know what she would be at: A Widow should be wiser. Now I will own to you; but I won't confess neither; I have had a great Respect for you a great while: I beg your Pardon, Sir, and I must declare to you, indeed I must, if you desire to dispose of all I have in the world, in an Honourable Way, which

I don't pretend to be any way deserving your consideration, my Fortune and Person, if you won't understand me without telling you so, are both at your service. Gad so! another time—</p>

                     <p>There's no danger of that, Mrs. <hi>Lackitt.</hi> I am divided in my thoughts. My Father upon his Death-bed oblig'd me to

see my Sister dispos'd of, before I married my self. 'Tis that sticks upon me. They say indeed Promises are to be broken or kept; and I know 'tis a foolish thing to be tied to a Promise; but I can't help it: I don't know how to get rid of it.</p>

                     <speaker>Well.</speaker>
                     <p>We had best stay a little I think, to see things settled agen, had not we? Marriage is a serious thing you know.</p>

                     <p>What do you talk of a serious thing, Mr. <hi>Welldon?</hi> I think you have found me sufficiently serious: I have marry'd my Son to your Sister, to pleasure you: and now I come to claim your promise to me, you tell me marriage is a serious thing.</p>

                     <p>Fidle fadle, I know what it is: 'tis not the first time I have been marry'd, I hope: but I shall begin to think, you don't design to do fairly by me, so I shall.</p>

                     <p>Why indeed, Mrs <hi>Lackit,</hi> I am afraid I can't do as fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I wou'd by you.

                     <p>Marry'd! you don't say so I hope! how have you the Conscience to tell me such a thing to my face! have you abus'd me then, fool'd and cheated me? What do you take me for, Mr. <hi>Welldon?</hi> do you think I am to be serv'd at this rate? but
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50837:27"/>
you shan't find me the silly creature, you think me: I wou'd have you to know, I understand better things, than to ruine my Son without a valuable consideration. If I can't have you, I can keep my Money. Your Sister shan't have the catch of him, she expected: I won't part with a Shilling to 'em.</p>

            </head>
            <l>YOU see, we try all Shapes, and Shifts, and Arts,</l>
            <l>To tempt your Favours, and regain your Hearts.</l>
            <l>We weep, and laugh, joyn mirth and grief together,</l>
            <l>Like Rain and Sunshine mixt, in <hi>April</hi> weather.</l>
            <l>Your different tasts divide our Poet's Cares:</l>
            <l>One foot the Sock, t'other the Buskins wears:</l>
            <l>Thus, while he strives to please, he's forc'd to do't,</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Volscius,</hi> hip-hop, in a single Boot.</l>
            <l>Criticks, he knows, for this may damn his Books:</l>
            <l>But he makes Feasts for Friends, and not for Cooks.</l>
            <l>Tho' Errant-Knights of late no favour find,</l>
            <l>Sure you will be to Ladies-Errant kind.</l>
            <l>To follow Fame, Knights-Errant make profession:</l>
            <l>We Damsels flye, to save our Reputation:</l>
            <l>So they, their Valour show, we, our Discretion.</l>
            <l>To Lands of Monsters, and fierce Beasts they go:</l>
            <l>Wee, to those Islands, where Rich Husbands grow:</l>
            <l>Tho' they're no Monsters, we may make 'em so.</l>
            <l>If they're of English growth, they'll bear't with patie<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">

Nor envy poor <hi>Imoinda</hi>'s doating blindness,</l>

            <l>Death with a Husband ne'er had shewn such Charms,</l>
            <l>Had she once dy'd within a Lover's Arms.</l>
            <l>Her error was from ignorance proceeding:</l>
            <l>Poor Soul! she wanted some of our Town Breeding.</l>
            <l>Forgive this <hi>Indians</hi> fondness of her Spouse;</l>
            <l>Their Law no Christian Liberty allows:</l>
            <l>Alas! they make a Conscience of their Vows!</l>
            <l>If Virtue in a Heathen be a fault;</l>
            <l>Then Damn the Heathen School, where she was taught.</l>
            <l>She might have learn'd to Cuckold, Jilt, and Sham,</l>
