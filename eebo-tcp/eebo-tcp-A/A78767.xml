            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">Object.</note> But you will ſay, In what reſpect may the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of a Saint be called a vile body?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> The bodies of the Saints may be ſaid to be <hi>vile</hi> in
regard of his primitive creation, before it was defiled
with ſin; for the body of man was made of the duſt of
the earth, <hi>ex pulvere terrae,</hi> not made of excellent materials,
as ſilver and gold; nor of Celeſtial materials, as Sun,
Moon and Stars, but of periſhing and contemptible
materials, the body was made of duſt, of clay and
muddy duſt, <hi>ex luto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And more eſpecially ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> our
bodies are called vile bodies, becauſe ſubject to vile
diſeaſes; there is no diſeaſe ſo vile, but the body of
a Saint is ſubject to it: take the example of <hi>Job,</hi> a
man eminent in godlineſſe, yet his body full of ſores and
boyles, from the crown of the head to the ſole of the
foot; and he ſaies of himſelf in <hi>Job 7. 5. My fleſh is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with wormes, and clods of duſt, my skin is broken and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
loathſome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. They may be ſaid to be vile becauſe ſubject to
vile abominations, to vile wickedneſſes and impieties;
for ſince the fall, our bodies are become the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of iniquity unto iniquity, unto drunkenneſſe
and adultery, to murders, and theeveries, and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. In the beſt of the Saints, their bodies are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118677:5"/>
to their nobler ſouls, and therefore the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is called <hi>vincula animi,</hi> the bonds and fetters of the
ſoul, that hinders the ſoul from, and in heavenly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>5. The body may be ſaid to be vile in reference to
its finall corruption and diſſolution; for when the ſoul

            <p>6. The body may be ſaid to be vile in compariſon
of the precious ſoul; for the body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as one ſaies, is but the

               </gap>ſſe the ſhell, the box of the ſoul,
<hi>Intus est quod homo eſt,</hi> it is the ſoul of a man that is the
man of man; the ſoul is like an Angell dwelling in
the body, as in a houſe of clay. The ſoul is not made
of the duſt, as the body is, but the ſoul is made of the
breath of God, <hi>ex ore Dei,</hi> (as one ſaies) not made of the
eſſence of God, but of the breath of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in that reſpect, in compariſon of the ſoul, the body

            <p>7. And laſtly, the body may be ſaid to be vile in this
life, in compariſon of what it ſhall be at the glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,

the fall of man, but eſpecially vile ſince the fall of
man; ſubject to vile diſeaſes and abominations: and
one thing more which I forgot before, and that is, they
are vile becauſe ſubject to be abuſed by wicked perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and by malicious tyrants, for though a tyrant
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118677:5"/>
cannot hurt the <hi>ſoul</hi> of a Saint, yet he may torment the
<hi>body;</hi> and therefore in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. it is ſaid of the holy
Saints; that <hi>they underwent cruell mockings and ſcourgings,
and bonds and impriſonment, and wandred up and down in

all which is underſtood of their bodies, and
therefore vile bodies becauſe ſubject to be abuſed, and
ſubject to all manner of wickedneſſes; but eſpecially
<hi>vile</hi> in compariſon of the precious <hi>ſoul,</hi> and in reſpect of
what their <hi>bodies</hi> ſhall be <hi>hereafter.</hi> Now let this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
teach us theſe Leſſons.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Leſſon 1.</note> Let this epithet teach you a leſſon of <hi>humility;</hi> the
bodies you carry about you are <hi>vile bodies,</hi> let us not
then be proud of them: <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlates the words, <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
humilitatis,</hi> a body of humility: on purpoſe it was
that God made the body of the loweſt elements, that
we might not be lifted up with pride of our bodies,
but have a mean and low eſteem of them; and hence it
is that the body in Scripture is compared to things that
are very mean and contemptible, as to the <hi>graſſe of the
field,</hi> to <hi>hay,</hi> and <hi>dry ſtubble,</hi> as in <hi>Job</hi> 13. 2. to a <hi>leaf dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

<hi>garment</hi> that is <hi>moth-eaten,</hi> in the 28 verſe of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it is compared to ſuch mean things, that we might
learn to have a mean eſteem of our bodies. Why art
thou proud oh <hi>duſt</hi> and <hi>aſhes?</hi> what is thy handſome
body, but <hi>gilded rottenneſse?</hi> what are all your riches and

lay your <hi>honour</hi> in the <hi>duſt.</hi> Every bird makes her neſt
of that thou are made of; every beaſt treads that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
feet that thou art made of; every creeping thing
diſpoſeth of that thou art made of; every blaſt of
winde ſcatters that which thou art made of; and why
then art thou proud oh <hi>duſt</hi> and <hi>aſhes?</hi> what is man but
<hi>rottenneſſe</hi> and <hi>corruption,</hi> but <hi>worms meat?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remember what I have once read in a manuſcript
concerning a ſtone that was preſented to <hi>Alexander</hi> the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118677:6"/>
Great, the nature of it was this, that being put into
one part of the ballance, it weighed down what ever
was put in the other part of it; but if a little duſt
were caſt upon the ſtone, then every thing weighed
down the ſtone; and he that brought the ſtone being
demanded what he meant by it, he anſwered. <hi>Oh</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
<hi>thou art this ſtone, thou whileſt thou liveſt, doeſt weigh
down all that are againſt thee, and treadeſt down all before
thee; but when thou comeſt to die, and there is a little duſt thrown
upon thee, then every man will outweigh you, and then you
will be leſſe then any man in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Remember you are but duſt, <hi>duſt you are, and to duſt
you muſt return,</hi> Oh therefore caſt duſt upon your beauty,
caſt duſt upon your riches, caſt duſt upon your bodies,
and be not proud of your vile bodies. This is one Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

            <p>It is a ſad thing to conſider how moſt people, even

do ſpend the beſt of their time, and cares and affections
upon theſe <hi>vile bodies,</hi> and in the mean time neglect to

this by a ſimilitude, Suppoſe a man ſhould invite
a <hi>Noble man</hi> to his houſe, and only provide provender for
the noble mans <hi>horſes,</hi> without any proviſion at all

for them, but take no care at all of our noble

for all our worldly wealth, nor are our ſouls the finer
for all our golden clothes. I have read a prayer that
I have oftentimes wondred at, and that is the prayer of
S. <hi>John</hi> concerning <hi>Gaius,</hi> in 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. he does there
pray, that <hi>his body might proſper and be in health, even as his

them, for if they had no <hi>better bodies</hi> then they have <hi>ſouls,</hi>
they would have very <hi>leanbodies.</hi> You ſhould labour ſo

might pray that God would proſper your bodies even

            <p>Once more in the fifth place,<note place="margin">Leſſon 5.</note> Let us from this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet

time for thy <hi>body,</hi> this is the time for thy <hi>ſoul</hi> wherein
thou ſhouldſt labour to get that adorned with grace and
holineſſe, and then Chriſt will come on purpoſe from
heaven to make thy body glorious hereafter. Do not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118677:9"/>
therefore miſtake your time, ſtudy to get good and
gracious ſouls here, and you ſhall be ſure to have glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
bodies hereafter: and you that defile and pollute
your ſouls, and ſtarve them by living in ſin and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
you that have vile ſouls here, ſhall be ſure to have
miſerable and wretched bodies hereafter.</p>
            <p>There are many rare Uſes that may be made of this
point,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> give me leave to name one of them to you, and
that ſhall be to all you that have gracious ſouls, I hope
I ſpeak to many ſuch this night, whoſe ſoules are ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the robes of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, to all you
that minde heavenly things, who have your converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in heaven; to all you that are members of Chriſts
Myſticall body; conſider I beſeech you what a glorious
condition your vile bodies ſhall be in at the great day
of Chriſts appearing, conſider it, and that in theſe two
particulars.</p>
            <p>1. Let this conſideration comfort us againſt the fear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of death, and let me ſay to you as God ſaid to <hi>Jacob</hi> in
<hi>Gen 44. Fear not to go down into Egypt</hi> (ſaies God) <hi>for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
I will bring thee out again.</hi> So ſay I to you that are
the Saints of God, fear not to go down to the houſe of
rottenneſſe, fear not to lay down your heads in the
grave, for God will certainly bring you out again, and
you ſhall come out a glorious body; fear not to have
this houſe, this tabernacle of thy body pulled down,
for God ſhall raiſe it up again, and make of it a glorious
ſtructure.</p>
            <p>2. Let this comfort us againſt the death of our godly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
friends; when a childe of God dies, nothing dies in him
totally and finally but ſin, his ſoul doth not die at all,
and his body ſhall be raiſed again a glorious body, <hi>it is
ſowen in corruption, it is raiſed in incorruption; it is ſowen in
diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory; it is ſowen in weakneſſe, it is
raiſed in power; it is ſowen a naturall body, it is raiſed a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This body of ours in the grave is a member of Chriſt,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118677:10"/>
and united to Chriſt, even in the grave; and this duſt of
thine is precious, and therefore we are ſaid to <hi>die in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Text that did very much refreſh this our
Brother (upon his death-bed) which I never took ſuch
ſpecial notice of before, and that is in <hi>Job</hi> 21. 33. ſaies <hi>Job</hi>
there, <hi>the clods of the valley ſhall be ſweet unto me;</hi> they made
their graves in the valleys, and ſaies <hi>Job, the mould and
clods that fils the grave ſhall be ſweet unto me:</hi> the earth ſhall
be ſweet to the Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And then again let this comfort any of Chriſt Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
body, any of Gods children that have deformed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
or diſeaſed bodies; you that are troubled with the
Stone, Gout, Diſſineſſe in the head, that makes you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable
to God in your places, and unable to doe
what good you would; here is comfort for you at the
glorious reſurrection, our vile bodies ſhall be changed,
and all our diſeaſes ſhall be cured, our Stone, and Gout,
and Head-aches, and infirmities ſhall be cured.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And then again, let this comfort us and encourage us
to be willing, if God cals us to it, to loſe our ears for
Chriſts ſake, to loſe our hands for Chriſts ſake, and to
loſe this vile body if God call us to ſuffer for him: let
us be willing to loſe a member for Chriſts ſake, for you
ſhall have all reſtored to you again at the reſurrection;
therefore the day of judgement is called the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of all things, wherein God will repair all our
breaches: as in that ſtory in the book of Martyrs of the
ſeven Children that were put to death; and one of
them, his tongue going to be cut out, comforted his
mother in telling her, <hi>he ſhould have a better tongue at the
reſurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> From the conſideration of this, let us be exhorted,
and oh that I could ſpeak ſo that my words might be
effectuall, and operative upon all your hearts, let me
humbly beſeech you to <hi>glorifie God in your bodies.</hi> Oh you
that are the Saints of God, whoſe <hi>bodies</hi> by grace are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> let me beſeech you by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118677:10"/>
the mercies of that God, that hath ſanctified your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and made them inſtruments of his ſervice, that you
would yeeld up your <hi>bodies,</hi> and <hi>preſent them a living ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
holy and acceptable unto God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> 
               <hi>which is your reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:</hi>
make your bodies more and more the inſtruments
of righteouſneſſe unto righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>And let us that are Miniſters think of this, let us not
think it much to wear out our bodies in Gods ſervice,
at the day of Judgement we ſhall then have glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
Let us not think we can do God too much
ſervice with our bodies, eſpecially when we conſider
how glorious our bodies ſhall be at the reſurrection,
even <hi>conformable to the glo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ious body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is another Uſe I ſhould make of this,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> which I
ſhall but name to you, and that is a divine project how
to make your bodies glorious: If there were ſuch a
Phyſician amongſt you that could cure all your defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and diſeaſes, and make your bodies immortall,
how would you prize him? Beloved, I have this day
told you of ſuch a Phyſician, and that is the Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt,</hi> that ſhall one day come from heaven, and
make our <hi>vile bodies</hi> like to <hi>his glorious body.</hi> Hearken to
me, thou proud duſt and aſhes, thou that ſpendeſt all
thy time in decking and adorning thy body with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
deckings, conſider thy madneſſe, that whileſt thou
takeſt more care for thy <hi>vile body</hi> then for thy <hi>precious
ſoul,</hi> thou doeſt ruine and deſtroy both. Do but hearken
to me, and I will ſhew you a way how to get <hi>glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
and <hi>glorious ſouls</hi> too; labour to get <hi>gracious</hi> ſouls here,
and you ſhall be ſure to have <hi>glorious</hi> bodies and ſouls
hereafter; labour to have your <hi>converſations in heaven</hi>
here, and then at the great day of Judgement, <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> will let out ſome of his glory to make you glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
he ſhall <hi>change our vile bodies, and faſhion them like
unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby, he is
able to ſubdue all things to himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt forbear and leave things imperfect, becauſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118677:11"/>
there is another text that I muſt ſpeak a little to.</p>
            <p>It hath pleaſed God now of late to take away many
worthy and godly and learned Miniſters from amongſt
us. And certainly my brethren this is a great Judgement,
and ſo much the greater, becauſe people are ſo little ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of it. And it is not only a great Judgement it ſelf,
but alſo a preſage of a greater.</p>
            <p>The Jewes had a ſaying, <hi>That it was an ill ſign to the
world, when the Luminaries of heaven were eclipſed.</hi> God hath
lately eclipſed many Luminaries, and put out many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
lights. I need not put you of this city in minde of
Dr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gatiker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Strong.</hi>
I need not put thoſe of the Univerſity in minde of
Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> and now this reverend and worthy Miniſter
Dr. <hi>Samuel Bolton</hi> Maſter of <hi>Chriſts Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
If I ſhould enter into his commendations, I might juſtly
ſay that which another ſaid in the like caſe, <hi>That
there is more fear, leſt we ſhould ſay leſſe, then he deſerved; then
that we ſhould praiſe him above his deſerts.</hi> He was a <hi>burning
and a ſhining light</hi> in this our <hi>Iſrael;</hi> he was an <hi>Interpreter one
of a thouſand,</hi> a man of excellent miniſterial abilities, a
workman that <hi>needed not to be aſhamed, dividing aright the
word of truth;</hi> he was one that did not only <hi>preach well,</hi>
but <hi>live well;</hi> he was one whoſe <hi>life</hi> was an excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
upon his <hi>Sermons.</hi> As <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaid of <hi>John</hi>
the Baptiſt, who is called <hi>the voyce of the cryer,</hi> ſaies he,
<hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was (<hi>tota vox,</hi>) all voice in his prudence, all
voice in his habit, all voice in his diet, all voice in his
dwelling, all voice in his converſation: ſo was our
dear Brother all voice; he was a voice in his life, as well
as in his Doctrine: and let me tell you, that the life of a
Miniſter preacheth as much as his Doctrine; it was a
ſaying that <hi>Ruffinus</hi> hath of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> which I
may apply to this our Brother, he not condemning
himſelf by living contrary to what he preached, but he
did do thoſe things himſelf that he taught to others:
He had not only <hi>dona ſanata,</hi> but <hi>dona ſalutifera,</hi> not only
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118677:11"/>
gifts for the good of others, but grace for the good of
his own ſoul. Many Miniſters have rare gifts and parts,
but they are like a <hi>Pearl</hi> in a <hi>Toads head,</hi> becauſe their
Lives give a lye to their Doctrines; but this our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was one that not only had gifts for the good of
others, but grace for the good of his own ſoul, and that
is his greateſt commendation, he was an humble Saint.
There are 4. things, ſaies <hi>Luther,</hi> that make a Miniſter,
<hi>prayer, reading, meditation,</hi> and <hi>temptation;</hi> our Chriſtian
Brother was not only a man of reading, prayer, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
but a man aſſaulted with many temptations,
more I beleeve then many hundreds of Miniſters are; he
was much aſſaulted with temptations, and therefore the
better able to comfort thoſe that were tempted, with
thoſe comforts where withall he was comforted. And let
me take the boldneſſe to tell you, that he hath left a
writing behinde him, wherein he hath recorded all the
outgoings of God toward him, and all the experiences
of Gods ſhining with the light of his countenance upon
him, and alſo of his withdrawings and hiding his face
from him; both thoſe times when God was at a diſtance
from him, and when he approached nearer to him. He
was ſo zealous in his Miniſteriall function, that though
he was head of a Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
for many years together, he preached freely
without any ſalary, at the publique Church in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And this puts me in minde of what was ſaid in a
Sermon in print of that reverend and godly man Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Hill,</hi> that he preached the Goſpell without any
charges to them that heard him: and ſo did this our
Brother for many years; and for three or four years he
was Lecturer in this place, where he preached to the great
ſatisfaction of the godly, both here and in many other
places of the City, that duly waited upon his Miniſtry.
And though he be now dead, yet he ſtill ſpeaks, not only
by the holineſſe of his life and graciouſneſſe of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
but alſo by the many books that he hath left in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118677:12"/>
print behind him, in which books you may ſee a fair
character of his piety and Miniſteriall abilities. He was
very orthodox and ſound in Judgement, no ſpirituall
leproſie in his head, witneſſe thoſe two Books of his, <hi>The
Arraignment of Errors,</hi> and <hi>A Vindication of the right of the
Law, and of the Liberties of Grace.</hi> He was a man of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
ſpirit, witneſſe that Book of his, <hi>A Work in ſeaſon
to a ſinking Kingdome.</hi> He was very carefull in his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
admiſſion, when he had a place wherein to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
his Miniſtry; he was very exact in that particular,
witneſſe that Book of his called <hi>The Wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the time of ſickneſſe it was long, tedious, and
conſtant; and yet notwithſtanding it pleaſed God to
meaſure out to him a great deal of patience and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and it is obſervable, and may be for the comfort
and encouragement of thoſe Miniſters or people that
meet with a great many croſſes, and troubles, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
in their life times, they do commonly receive
the greateſt comforts at their death.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed God to come in to this our godly Brother
with a great deal of comfort, in ſo much, that before he
dyed, he ſaid, <hi>his heart was as full of comfort as it could hold,</hi>
and ſaies he, <hi>though the providences of God have been very dark
towards me, yet I thank God I have light within me.</hi> When I
was laſt with him, he was wonderfull deſirous to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
and to be with Chriſt; and I heard him ſay, <hi>Oh
this vile carkaſſe of mine, when will it give way that my ſoul
may get out, and goe to my God? Oh this vile carkaſſe, when
will thou be conſumed, that I may goe to my God?</hi> And when he
did ſee any ſymptomes of death, any thing that did
threaten death, which he called the <hi>the little creviſes</hi> at
which his ſoul did peep out, it was the joy of his heart.</p>
            <p>It was his deſire to be buryed without any Funerall
pomp, which puts me in minde of good <hi>Pell,</hi> when he
was a dying, the Scholars of the Univerſity came to
him and asked him whether he would be buried in his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118677:12"/>
Scholaſtick habit or no, ſaies he, <hi>No, I deſire to die as an
humble Chriſtian, not as a Doctor, as a humble Saint, not as a
learned man; and I truſt I ſhall appear at the great day, not
clad with my Doctors Robes, but with the Robes of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</hi>
And this was the deſire and the hope of our
dear brother, and this Text that I have preached on, he
did with a great deal of earneſtneſſe of ſpirit rejoice in,
when he conſidered of that day when this <hi>vile body</hi> of his,
ſubject to ſo many diſeaſes, ſhould be <hi>made like to the
glorious body of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> in whoſe bleſſed Armes we
leave this our dear Brother, beſeeching God that he
would make up this great loſſe of him, to the Church of
God in generall, and to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> in
particular.</p>
