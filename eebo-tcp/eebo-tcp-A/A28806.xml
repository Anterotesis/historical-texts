            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Should not afford ſo ſhort a diſcourſe as this, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of a Preface, were it not chiefly deſign'd to apologize for its brevity. For I doubt I ſhall be blam'd for endeavouring to wrap up, or rather hint at ſo great and uſeful Truths in ſo few words, without many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, or much circumlocution, though I produce ſome here and there, and enough (as I conceive) to convince the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and impartial. I confeſs, I have aſſiduouſly avoided running into long controverſies, and taken up only what lay in my way, and was neceſſary for a very ſhort elucidation of my <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.</hi> And this I choſe to do for two Reaſons: Firſt, That my Reader might in ſhort ſee <hi>Helmont</hi>'s, and other the ableſt and trueſt Adeptiſts, chief foundation, main aim and method of curing, without leading him into the confuſion, which a Labyrinth of Arguments may do. And Secondly, Sith I intend this only as a preliminary diſcourſe to an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy of <hi>Helmont,</hi> which I deſign (if God ſend me life and health) to prepare for the Preſs in ſome time; I thought it not fit to anticipate, or rob that noble Author, but let him ſpeak for himſelf, ſith he abounds with ſo many, ſo excellent, and ſo clear Arguments, as will beyond controverſie evince the truth of this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and all its dependencies. Neither would I have you think, that I eſteem <hi>Helmont</hi> to be the only man that was Maſter of the nobleſt <hi>Arcana</hi>'s, but that I have the like veneration for a great many other mens Medicines; but I rather chooſe to call this, a Key to him, becauſe he hath writ more fully of the Chymical Theory and method of curing, than any other I know; the diſcovery of which to the world, is my chief deſign. And though I here promiſe the Reader, that
<pb facs="tcp:45212:3"/>
I will render theſe parts of him which are fundamentally Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, as plain, ſhort, and as intelligible as poſſibly I can; yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect not, that I will proſtrate thoſe Medicines of his (which I underſtand) to every vulgar capacity, but ſhall faithfully report them in his own words, ſith I am very ſenſible, that ſuch prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in ſetting the ignorant, careleſs and covetous to work, will ſpeedily be the ruin of the nobleſt <hi>Arcana</hi>'s. And though 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Helmont</hi> was good in pulling down, and not in ſetting up; I preſume, that what is ſaid in this little diſcourſe, the ground and reaſon whereof I borrowed from him, being well conſider'd, and duely proſecuted, will convince the partial world, that there was never ſo true, ſo ſound, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, and ſo uſeful a ſtructure built in Phyſick. I ſhall only deſire thee, Reader, impartially to conſider it, and operate accordingly; and I am confident, that thou wilt never want Medicines to ſatisfie thy ſelf, and all that will ſee, of the truth of this Doctrine, though perhaps thou maiſt not attain to Medicines of the higheſt <hi>Claſs</hi> now known. That it may proſper for the good and relief of miſerable mortals, is, and ſhall ever be my main end and endeavour, whilſt I remain,</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> What are the true Principles of Natural Bodies?</head>
               <p>THE groſs Errors of the Schools, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principles, and their uſeleſs Philoſophy, are ſo well known and exploded by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive, and therefore ſagacious Age, that it's needleſs to endeavour to confute them. As for the other opinion of ſome Chymiſts, who would have the <hi>quinta,</hi> or <hi>tria prima,</hi> to be the Principles of Bodies, ſith it hath had, and perhaps yet hath very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed favourers of this Age, I ſhall according to my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded brevity only offer this, That if they are Principles, they ought to be unalterable; whereas theſe are eaſily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd and turn'd one into another. So it is certain, that ſuch and ſuch a manner of operation produceth ſuch a product, and ſuch and ſuch a manner produceth another guiſe; and there are ſome bodies-that no Art yet known can extract theſe Principles (erroniouſly ſo call'd) from. Whence I infer, that they obtain'd ſuch Textures from the fire, and were not pre-exiſtent in the concrete.</p>
               <p>As for that opinion of <hi>Tachenius</hi> and ſome others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the principles of things which they would have to be <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alcali,</hi> though more intelligible and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the practice of Phyſick than either of the former, yet are not really ſo, being reducible in Water. It's ſtrange, that Chriſtians (who in matters of Faith wholly rely on the Scripture, and firmly believe all the Hiſtorical parts of it,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45212:4"/>
that are either Eccleſiaſtical, Political, Succeſſive or Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, ſhould take very little, or no notice of the hints to Natural Hiſtory that are in in it, eſpecially ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> doth profeſſedly give us a ſhort account of the beginnings of Natural Bodies, which though ſhort, is abundantly more ſatisfactory to ſenſe, and conſequently reaſon, than any of the other Opinions: We believe therefore with him and the profound <hi>Helmont,</hi> that Water is the ſole mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Principle of Generation, and that the <hi>Spirit of God that moved on the Waters,</hi> or as the <hi>Latin</hi> hath it, <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Dei incubabat ſuperficiei Aquae,</hi> as a Bird on her Eggs for procreation ſake, is the formal cauſe. Indeed <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not ſay poſitively, that that incubation of the Spirit on the Waters was the cauſe of Creation, but we find the Creation follow in the next words; and conſidering the brevity of that Hiſtory, the manner of expreſſion in other places, I preſume it's plainly imply'd, that God by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power made theſe the immediate cauſes of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Pray think not this too precarious, ſith ſenſe it ſelf doth prove the material Principle of it, eſpecially in Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, whoſe mucilaginous ſeeds do ſpeedily diſſolve into Water of themſelves: nay, a Child imperfectly born, will in a little time diſſolve into Water, and the hard ſeed of vegetables become like a Gelly at the time of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, whoſe Gelly-like ſubſtance, by an eaſie digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is turn'd into Water alſo; and the great Philoſophers tell us, that by their Liquor <hi>Alcaheſt,</hi> they could converr the hardeſt into liquid ſubſtances: and experience telleth us, that many vegetables may be ſolely nouriſh'd from Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not to mention the ſeveral experiments of this nature by many worthy modern Authors. Think it not ſtrange, that from Water ſuch hard Bodies ſhould be produced, ſith it will not only cauſe Bodies to petrefie, but is petre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it ſelf. As to ſubterrane Bodies, as Mettals, Minerals,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45212:4"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we are told, they are fed and augmented by a green and Viſcous Water. Now here I underſtand not, by the Spirit moving on the Waters, an abſolute immaterial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or the rational ſoul of man, but the ſenſitive, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to us and Beaſts, and only comparatively immaterial in reſpect of groſſer ſubſtances. I conceive it to be ſuch an active, brisk, aetherial ſubſtance, as was and is able to rend pliable Water into infinitely different corpuſcles, and thereby to mould them into as different forms or textures as we ſee in the World, and as it form'd us, it goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us, and preſerveth our textures, and ſeveral kinds, as long as poſſible. But here I foreſee that I ſhall meet with an Objection of ſome learned and inquiſitive Philoſophers, whoſe Opinion is, that the diverſity of Natural Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the products of different Textures, and thoſe Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ariſe from the Poſition or Figures of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Corpuſcles. I readily grant them both, being well aſſured, that the aptneſs or unaptneſs of Textures, make things grateful or ungrateful, hot or cold to us; and ſo of all other qualities. Yet pardon me if I cannot conceive, that either vegetable or animal things that beget their like, can poſſibly be produced by the fortuitous coincidence of Corpuſcles, without the help of a guiding ſpirit; nay, I ſuppoſe, that dead bodies would (I ſay not, could) not be generated without the aſſiſtance of ſuch a ſpirit alſo, which coagulateth or mouldeth ſuch different Textures; for though there be many excellent and luciferous produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of this nature Mechanically obtain'd, which plainly ſhew that there are ſuch things in nature, yet I hope it will be granted, that they would not be without the art and guidance of the humane ſoul; and if ſo, why ſhould we think that the world hath not an <hi>Aura vitalis,</hi> or guiding ſpirit in it. Now as ſpirits, the Governours of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſories, that have a diſtinguiſhing faculty in them, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45212:5"/>
good, and rejecting offenſive things to the utmoſt of their power, are affected, ſo it acts for good or evil; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how could it be, that the ſame Medicine, which is but a dead thing of humane facture, at the ſame time given in the ſame quantity and vehicle, ſhould act contraries in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral bodies; nay, in the ſame body at ſeveral times; nay, in the ſame body at the ſame time, as in Womens caſes it may happen, the Spirits being aſſiſted, exalted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by enabled to do all things for the beſt, and to ſupply Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in her ſeveral indigencies, for the better and longer preſervation of the concrete. I could produce you many other Inſtances, but for brevity ſake I paſs them by, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming that this one is enough to convince the conſiderate, if it be ſo <hi>de facto</hi>; ofw which I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more hereafter. Now what ſort of Water this is, it matters not to my deſign, ſith it is enough to ſupport my <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> if it be granted, that all things are made of Spirit and Matter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> A Conſideration of the Actions of the vital Spirit as tend to our purpoſe.</head>
               <p>IF the vital Spirit form'd us according to the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent decree, I preſume 'twill be eaſily granted, that the ſame Spirit preſerves us in that form, and is the ſole active and ſenſitive part of the body; for having taken its flight
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45212:5"/>
from us, we are no longer capable of Diſeaſe or Cure.</p>
               <p>I ſhall preſume to give my ſentiments, how that Spirit doth univerſally act for us and againſt us, and thereby hope to elucidate that ſaying of <hi>Helmont, that the cauſe of life is the cauſe of death.</hi> I muſt firſt premiſe, that all creatures in the univerſe are ſuſtained by nouriſhment, which I call the converſion of ſome other parts of the Creation into a ſymbolizing nature to the creature nouriſhed, which is ſaid to be altered by vertue of the ferments; but what nature the Leven of theſe ferments are, is rather gueſſed at than known. It hath been endeavoured to be deſcrib'd by manifeſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as <hi>Heat, Acidity, Acid</hi> and <hi>Alkali,</hi> but the coldneſs of Fiſhes, and ſweetneſs of healthy Ventricles, being ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and without terror deſtroyed, overthrow the two former. And if <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alcali</hi> be unequally mix'd, it would be taſted alſo, if equally I could never find (out of the body), that it had any power to digeſt, corrode or putrifie, but is <hi>e contrà agreat,</hi> preſerver of bodies from putrefaction. Praeternatural <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Acidity,</hi> are the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual concomitants of Diſeaſes; and we well know that a diſeaſed perſon cannot digeſt well according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s <hi>Aphoriſm, Corpora impura quò magis nutrias eò magis laedas,</hi> a Rule as little taken notice of by many Phyſicians as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to Nurſes, who think they can never do the ſick right longer than they are ſuggeſting ſomething to eat, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thinking whatever groſs ſubſtance they take, that is the object of digeſtion, is converted by a deprav'd ferment into filthy matter fit to feed the diſeaſe; for 'tis not ſo much what we eat or drink, as how our Alterative faculty is: The ſame Joynt of meet that nouriſhes the well, loads the ſick; nay, will be converted into Dogs-fleſh, Swines-fleſh, Fiſh-fleſh and Birds-fleſh; in a word, into the ſeveral <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of all creatures that will eat of it. And we ſee the poor that feed on the courſeſt of fare, as vigorous and as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45212:6"/>
ſtrong as thoſe that feed moſt opiparouſly. But pardon me this digreſſion. I lament therefore, that ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and induſtrious men, have and do ſtill ſpend ſo much precious time to find out the cauſes of vital ferments, thinking it to be ſo material, as to be diſcovered by their ſenſes; whereas it ſeems to me moſt rational, that that which gave us our formation, ſhould alſo prepare our aliment, and diſtribute to us fit Juices for our preſervation, and ſo to unform the aliment (if I may ſo ſpeak it) to form ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the preſervation of its own concrete out of it. If ſo, we ſhall never know it <hi>a priori,</hi> being too ſubtile for our moſt aſſiſted ſenſes, but muſt be contented to gueſs at it <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> by its effects and parts it inhabits in. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I confeſs and acknowledg, that theſe ingenious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers have found cut ſeveral curious and different parts in the Ventricles, and other parts of things of different <hi>ſpecies,</hi> undoubtedly filthly adapted to work with to alter food of ſuch and ſuch a Texture, to ſuch an end. But I muſt beg their pardon, that I cannot think them the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of fermentation, ſith of themſelves they are but dead things, longer than they are animated by the vital Spirits; but conceive them as Engines ſtupendiouſly fitted for the vital Spirits to operate withal. We ſee, that creatures of different <hi>ſpecist</hi> delight in different foods, which no doubt are ſuch that beſt agree to the Textures of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and are moſt fit to be digeſted by their peculiar fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now ſith it's undeniable, that we being depriv'd of the ſenſitive ſoul, we are uncapable of ſickneſs and health, and all ſenſation whatſoever, and all ferments, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the putrefactive one ceaſe; though when preſent and active the ſmalleſt prick of a pin, or any other the leaſt injury given to the remoteſt parts, offend all the whole body, by ſtartling the vital Spirits, whoſe reſentments of injuries, and diſturbance thereby, cauſe them to form mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45212:6"/>
                  <hi>Ideas,</hi> either through its own paſſions, or other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal accident, or deprav'd matter. So we ſay with <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> that though there may be millions of irritative ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial cauſes, or external accidents, yet the ſole formal cauſe is the vital Spirit, which either being enrag'd, tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſuppreſſed, frame diſeaſes accordingly. Patients are alter'd according to the energy and deſign of the Agents. Now in all bodies the vital Spirit muſt be the Agent, (as the Excellent Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Natural Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Exper.</hi> 98. being the only active part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the reſt being but a dead lump when that is gone, or become unactive, abſolutely inſenſible, and conſequently uncapable of Diſeaſe or Cure. When this Agent acts vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly placidly, and without diſturbance, he doth all things for the beſt; but if diſturb'd, it ſtirreth up ſuch a hurry and diſorder in him, that he mouldeth pretern u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Forms or Textures; and thence we affirm, that the cauſe of life and health, when in order, is the cauſe of ſickneſs and death when in diſorder. Now the vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the occaſion of diſeaſes of it ſelf, as it admits of ill <hi>Impreſſes or Ideas,</hi> by the ſenſes from without, as we ſee the ſame Spirit that is now pleaſant and ſedate, will on a ſudden degenerate into paſſions of different, nay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effects, according to the nature of the irritative cauſe from without, or the diſeaſed matter diſturbing the free exerciſe and government of the vital Spirits within variouſly, according to the quantity, quality, and tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſuch morbifick matter; But it cannot be ſaid, that they are firſt or laſt in point of time, they being as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and Patient, and therefore corival and co-exiſtent, though in reſpect of the irritative cauſe, we compute them one before another. For the vitals can be no ſooner from their duty, but matter will in ſome meaſure degenerate for want of its due preſerver; and there can be no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45212:7"/>
matter in the body, but muſt in ſome degree affect the vitals, though many times it be ſo little that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern it. Hence cometh the inſenſible creeping on of Chronick Diſeaſes.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Where and how the Vitals do perform their chief Operation.</head>
               <p>I Conceive the chief and regular Operation of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, is extended for the preſervation of the concrete, which is by aſſimulating things out of other bodies to the nature of the body it inhabits. Now this great work is done principally in the ſtomach, where meat is converted into aliment and excrement; and as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, <hi>A good craſis in this firſt digeſtion, is ſeldom, or by accident per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in the ſecond, but never amended.</hi> This is the place in which the Juices of our bodies take the main impreſs, and are either made good or evil. Pardon me Reader, if for the better underſtanding the thing, I bring thee this homely compariſon. I look on the vital Spirit, to be the Cook and the Stomach, the Cook-room or Kitchen, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Juices are prepared, and according to the craſis of them, to impreſs our nouriſhment with a good or evil tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now if either the Cook be ſluggiſh, froward or forgetful, or the Kitchen or its Veſſels be foul, we can never expect well dreſſed Victuals; and indeed a bad Cook maketh a bad Kitchen, and a foul Kitchen injures the beſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45212:7"/>
Cook. Here I cannot but take notice of the vain humors of ſome men, who cry out, the blood is foul, purge the blood, purge the blood, and never endeavour to rectifie the fountain from whence it cometh, which maketh their endeavours ſo ineffectual. The wiſe people of <hi>Marah</hi> threw ſalt into the fountain, not into the Rivulets. Is't poſſible, that a foul and diſturb'd fountain can afford clear Rivulets? Or is it poſſible, that the draining of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets ſhould purge the fountain? If not, away with the common uſe of Phlebotomy, Iſſues, Cuppings and Scarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, unleſs it be at a pinch, to gain a little time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſo potent a Medicine as may rectifie the diſorder of the vitals, can be obtain'd. I ſay, away with thoſe deluding means, which too often, God knows, by minoration doth ſo palliate (for it cannot meliorate for the reaſon aboveſaid), that it cauſeth abundance to rely on them, until they become incurable; and ſometimes relieveth them of an acute diſeaſe, and leaveth them in a Cronick, as too often we ſee in <hi>Quinancies</hi> and <hi>Pleuriſies,</hi> &amp;c. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times altering the diſeaſe from one ſhape to another, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Opinion in one of his Epiſtles to King <hi>Demetrius,</hi> viz. <hi>that one diſeaſe degenerated into another,</hi> which I rather conceive to proceed from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Art than Nature. It's alſo manifeſt, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cure of mad people is effected by drawing away their Spirits, and ſo making them ſottiſh and fooliſh. Now when the office of the ſtomach is well perform'd, we need not doubt the other parts (unleſs deprav'd through na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deformity, or external accidents), becauſe there is no bad Chyle cometh to offend them; but that being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, the offenſive Chyle that it ſendeth out, doth by degrees pervert all the other ferments, and then we call it, a <hi>high Scurvey,</hi> until it hath begot daughter or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as <hi>Dropſie, Aſtma, Vertigo, Cholick</hi> and <hi>Iliack paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45212:8"/>
&amp;c. and then the lurking <hi>Scurvey</hi> hath loſt its name again, and the daughters give their mother their own denominations. I cannot conceive that any diſeaſe can befall a man without paſſion, or undue digeſtion, except it be by external accidents. And truly I think a diſeaſe occaſion'd by ſuch accidents, attain their height by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing the vitals, and thereby cauſing a diſorder'd and vitious ferment; ſo that undue digeſtion, though hardly perceptible at firſt, I conceive to be the beginning of all internal diſeaſes.</p>

               <p>THE Object of the digeſtive faculty, I conceive to be all gummous, viſcous and ſolid bodies, that are digeſtible, or agreeing to ſuch and ſuch a <hi>ſpecies.</hi> Not ſpirituous or incorruptible things, which the ferment hath no power to alter. Theſe things, if friendly and pure, are, as it were, ſnatched away by the vitals: Nay, though impure, yet the vital ſpirit doth ſo delight in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous part of them, that it immediately attracts them to himſelf, as we ſee in ſwooning people. Hence I conceive the reaſon to be (as I have often obſerved), that Brandy, though very good in its kind, will do a great deal more hurt, and enflame more than duly rectified Spirit of Wine, becauſe the vitals greedily embracing the noble Spirit, draws into its curious receſſes upon the wings thereof, foulneſs and lavid flegm (wherewith the beſt Brandy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth), which afterwards doth grate and diſturb the vitals. Not that I commend the uſe of either; for I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45212:8"/>
think even the beſt Spirit of Wine very hurtful, as it is of it ſelf: I mean, to be taken inwardly, if this be ſo, what courſe then ſhall we take to reſtore a decayed fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſith whatever is given, that is the Object of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, is putrified rather than digeſted, and becometh fit fuel to augment the diſeaſe? for all ferments make <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod tertium quod non fuit anie,</hi> either a good or bad <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> according to the ſtrength and regularity, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and irregularity of the alterer. What then, muſt the ſick Patient have nothing to ſupport him? Yes, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous pure and incorruptible ſubſtances, ſo adapted, as that they joyn amicably with the vital Spirits, without giving the leaſt diſturbance, intoxication or inflamation, though taken in great quantity. And though ſuch things, if volatile, ſeem as a potential fire, yet they quench thirſt, and allay preternatural heat, commonly giving a period to <hi>Fevers</hi> before the firſt <hi>Criſis,</hi> as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ipſe eſt Medicus non qui expectat, ſed facit Criſin.</hi> Which I humbly conceive they do effect, as they do comfort eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and friendly joyn with the vital Spirits; or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the purer parts of the Juices, wherein they inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, thereby aſſiſting and corroborating the ſaid vitals, ſo as to impower them to debellate, and caſt off preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural heat, or rather morbifick matter the occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. As for inſtance, a <hi>Fever</hi> I know is generally taken to be an extraordinary and preternatural heat, cauſing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition, or undue fermentation of the Blood. But I muſt beg leave to recede from this common Opinion, ſith I am convinc'd, that the preternatural heat is but a ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, not the cauſe of the diſeaſe, which I conceive to be a conteſt between nature and morbifick matter, each ſtriving for victory, and thereby cauſing a great motion in the Juices of the body, which motion produceth ſo violent heat. The vitals being enforc'd into that diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45212:9"/>
motion, to make good their poſt, until they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer or are conquered I muſt aſſure you, that I have ever found, that the hotter a man is in a <hi>Feaver,</hi> the more hopes there is of him, as arguing, that Nature is ſtrong, and maketh a luſty reſiſtance, whereas ſmall external heat in a <hi>Fever</hi> argues the contrary, and is abundantly a more mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſymptom. We find, that generally <hi>Agues</hi> and <hi>Fevers</hi> begin with coldneſs and ſhivering of the external parts, which ſeems to me, as if Nature call'd in the heat, ſtrength and ſpirits that us'd to guard theſe parts, and concentred them with thoſe internal, the better to withſtand the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Enemy; and at that time we find a great drought to attend ſuch perſons, which argueth a preternatural heat within, occaſion'd, as I conceive, by the conteſt, which being over, and the Spirits remitted to their uſual charge, they carry away with them their inflamed parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Now what ſhould we do? ſhould we clog and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our Champion, the vitals, with naſty depaupara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting flegms and groſs ſubſtances? or ſhould we ſend pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and true aſſiſtance to him?

I could never obſerve any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantange the poor had of the labouring Yeoman-like ſort of people, but that at a pinch, inſtead of uſing thoſe cooling ſlops, they implor'd ſome Cordial-water of ſome charitable Lady of the Neighbourhood; or for want of that, did procure a drachm of Brandy, or other ſtrong-water, to ſupport their declining Spirits.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> An account of the ſeeming potential fire, before mention'd.</head>
               <p>I Mention'd in the Chapter preceeding, a Liquor, that was to ſenſe as a potential fire, yet would quench thirſt and allay heat in <hi>Feavers</hi>: a thing, I doubt, the prepoſſeſs'd world will hardly credit, until they are evinc'd of it by experience: Of which, that they may be induc'd to make tryal of for their ſatisfaction, I ſhall preſume to give the beſt account I can, and offer my weak Reaſons with all humility and ſubmiſſion for the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>I am entred on an abſtruſe matter; but being certain, that it's ſo <hi>de facto,</hi> rather then it ſhould paſs without ſome notice taken, I am reſolv'd to tender my mean ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if be it but to put more ingenious men on the conſideration of it. I confeſs, I was Maſter of ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana's before I conſidered the Reaſon of their ſo benign Operation in mans body. When calling to mind the words of the Ancients, <hi>viz. ſeparate and unite, purifie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn, deſtroy and revive,</hi> &amp;c. For 'tis the <hi>Hermophrodite</hi> that doth the great matters in Nature. I eaſily ſaw, that all the Noble Medicines that would raiſe Nature to act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, whether fix't or volatile, that I knew, were of an Hermophroditical compoſure; and then I conceiv'd, and ſtill do, that by ſuch an union the parts ſatiated one another: Of which Opinion I was ſo fond, that with an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> I acquieſced in it a long time, until upon farther conſideration, I found I had taken too ſhort a meaſure to give my ſelf a ſatisfactory proſpect. And though I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45212:10"/>
ſaw ſuch Textures moſt agreeable to the vitals, yet it did not ſatisfie me, why it ſhould be ſo; and then I call'd to mind the Doctrine of <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> which I had read in my youth, concerning the Analogy and diſproportion of bodies, wherein he ſhews, that things of like Texture do eaſily and friendly joyn; and things of inconrguous particles, difficultly and diſturbantly, and ſometimes not at all. At length, happily meeting with the excellent Books of the honourable and incomparable <hi>Robert Boyle,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> his Origine of Forms, and Mechanical production of Forms, I was wonderfully enlightned and confirmed in <hi>Des Chartes</hi>'s Doctrine. And then I caſt about, to find what Analogy of Texture might be between thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines and the vital Spirits. And ſith the vital Spirits are too ſubtle for the beſt aſſiſted ſenſe to apprehend, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd by the ſame Doctrine, to trace them in the parts where they lived and inhabited; concluding with theſe Learned Authors, that nothing could delight, lye eaſie, well, or long continue in a diſproportionate manſion; and the blood being allowed to be the vehicle, if not the ſeat of the vitals, I eaſily found the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts (not principles) of the purer parts thereof to conſiſt of oleaginous, ſaline and ſulphureous particles. I was then convinc'd, that a volatile, pure and incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible body, which ſhould conſiſt of the like particles, muſt readily and amicably joyn with the purer and more active parts of the blood, ſith it conſiſted of parts Anala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous to it. Certain it is, that there is no more poſitive or innate heat, in Spirit of Wine, or ſaline Spirits, than in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water: For ſet them in one place, where let them ſtand until all accidental or adventitious heat be waſted, and then try them with an accurate Thermoſcope, and you ſhall find them of equal coldneſs. If ſo (as no one that hath or ſhall experience it, but will evidently find),
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45212:10"/>
then it's plain, that it's no innate heat in thoſe ſpirituous bodies that ſeemeth to enflame us, but as their particles affect our ſenſories, common Water, whoſe Atomous parts we conceive to be globular and ſmooth, paſſeth ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cooleth. The Spirits, though as cold in themſelves, yet by reaſon of the ſubtle, penetrating, pungent and ſharp Texture of their parts, prick and ſtimulate our tender parts and ſenſories, thereby cauſing heat, inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and intoxication. Now as the Water conſiſted of too dull particles, to joyn with, or aſſiſt our vitals, ſo the Spirits of themſelves are too pungent and ſharp to agree with our Juices as they are, being but ſeveral parts of bodies made pure, and conſequently cannot have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Analogous Texture, with all the pure parts uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as the refineſt part of our Juices are. But if theſe bodies be firſt ſeparated for purification ſake, and then in a due proportion, according to the Analogy of the blood conjoyn'd (which though it be no ſmall Art to perform, yet I'le aſſure you very feaſible to be attain'd by the induſtrious), will no longer prick, ſtimulate or enflame, but on the contrary, will joyn ſo amicably with the vitals, as immediately to ſtrengthen, refreſh and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them, advancing natural heat and vigour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by enabling Nature to debellate all preternatural heat, fermentation, acidity, and what not that is offenſive in the body. If you take any pure part of it it ſelf in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, it will offend; for ſulphureous Spirits will enflame and intoxicate; ſaline, ſtimulate, acid corrode; oleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous nauſeate and enflame; whereas a pure body (for ſo give me leave to call it) hath none of theſe ill effects in it: It's ſo far from intoxicating, that it retrieves the intoxicated perſon even in the very act of drinking, from ſtimulating, and much more corroding, that it's the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt healer of wounds, ſcalds, burnings, ſoreneſs of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45212:11"/>
mouth, throat or ſtomach, that ever I ſaw, from nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, as to eradicate it. I have always obſerv'd upon drinking Spirit of Wine or Brandy, that it affects the mouth, throat and ſtomach too, with a burning heat; whereas a pure body doth affect the mouth and upper part of the Gula only, but is never found to give the leaſt offenſive heat to the ſtomack. Away then with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt hot things, ſith they may be ſo compos'd as to refreſh, quench thirſt, and cool. And ſurely the vital Spirits by no other volatile means can be ſo truly, ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inoffenſively aſſiſted, as by ſuch a pure, incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, Balſamick and Analogous body. I'le not preſume to ſay, that this is the volatile <hi>Hermophradite</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, though according to my beſt conſtructions or (if you will) conjectures of their aenigmous ſayings, and the effects, I conceive it is. They tell us, that bodies purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conjoyned, produce an <hi>Hermophrodite</hi> which is wonderfully aſſiſtant to Nature. They only ſay, there is ſuch a thing, and what effect it hath; but I cannot find the leaſt footſtep in them, to lead me to believe, that they ever knew the reaſon or cauſe of it's ſo doing: but if I have hit any thing near the mark, we are beholding to the two forenamed excellent Authors for it.</p>
               <p>Thus have I ſhot my bolt, earneſtly beſeeching the moſt judicious and inquiſitive Philoſophers to conſider it, that ſo uſeful a <hi>Phaenomena</hi> may be improv'd to the utmoſt.

               <p>I Know that it's held negatively in the Schools; and truly, according to their Principles, it ſeems impoſſible: for allowing ſo many formal cauſes of diſeaſes as they do, it's not to be ſuppos'd, that one and the ſame thing ſhould be an adequate removal of them all: but according to my <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> I conceive there may: for if there be but one formal cauſe of diſeaſes, and that that cauſe in it ſelf be homogeneal, and an enemy to diſeaſes, and is forc'd into this diſorder through affronts without, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie matter within, and ſtill whilſt curable, inclining to return to his regular, wonted, and due compoſure and government, why may not the Spots and Idea's which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave the ſame, be (though of different colours) oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by one Medicine, which is truly adapted to aſſiſt its homogeneity, and natural addiction, and thereby enable it to caſt off its enemy, of what Nature ſoever, as a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that defends, and maketh a man victorious, though to be us'd in ſeveral manners, and to ſeveral purpoſes, as the Combatant's exigency ſhall require, all tending to the main end of ſelf-preſervation and victory. I would not be here underſtood that I mean by a <hi>Panacea,</hi> a Medicine that infallibly cureth all diſeaſes (for to ſuch I preſume there was no ſober man ever pretended to, though our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries would ſo conſtrue it, and thereby impoſe on the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and credulous), but ſuch a one that will cure all diſeaſes curable. We ſee ſometimes diſeaſes of the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45212:12"/>
denominations to be ſo circumſtantiated, as to admit of no remedy; and on the other hand, many of the moſt feral, that are liſted among the incurable, to be conquer'd. It ſometimes, though rarely falls out, that the vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are ſo ſubjugated, that Art cannot raiſe them again. Now there are Medicines of univerſal tendency, and of univerſal potency. By univerſal tendency, I underſtand, a Medicine that adjuvates Nature to do in ſome caſes for the beſt; and, as I formerly ſaid, ſo ſtrengthen the vitals an particular caſes, as to ſupply the exigencies of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, though by contrary effects, and is univerſally good, though ſpecifically potent: as for inſtance, the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine that preventeth miſcarriage, even when the wiſeſt Midwives think it impoſſible, being given in equal Doſe and ſame Vehicle when labour cometh, expediteth it; nay, it impowers Nature to turn the Child in the Womb, and bring it away, even when hopes are almoſt paſt, and without a hand, ſaving half the pains, making the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pains as nothing, ſuffering neither <hi>Fever,</hi> or any other ill accident to happen, invigorating the perſon, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all things for the beſt; inſomuch, that I never ſaw the leaſt danger in any Woman lying-in, that us'd it; and the like contrary effects it will produce in other feminine ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. A Medicine that generally very gently purgeth, yet of it ſelf, without purging, ſafely cures venereous or cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entous diſſenteries. The like I may ſay, in ſome caſes or other, of all others I prize 'em. Such as theſe are ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that I wonder how men can practiſe untouch'd in conſcience, without them. Were it to gain the World, I would not give a Medicine, but is ſo endowed. But for thoſe of univerſal potency, I fear there are none now in being; though I doubt not, but that I have ſeen ſuch a thing, and that within this Twenty years; and therefore I do the rather believe the Ancients aſſertions, that it's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45212:12"/>
And truly I have a Medicine of my own, and have ſeen others of other mens, that will ſpeak fair for <hi>Panaceas,</hi> and do well deſerve the name of <hi>Polyaceas.</hi> As far as I have experienc'd mine, which hath been now theſe Sixteen years, it ſeldom or never fail'd in any caſe where there was a probability of Cure; nay, many times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond. I could never ſee any Specifick yet, though of univerſal tendency, as aboveſaid, to exceed it: Nay, when I have been call'd in deſperate caſes, when the nobleſt Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick, I knew, would not do it, it hath done, except in caſe of madneſs, wherein, though I have found it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Medicine, and very conducible to the Cure, yet I prefer to it a Specifick drawn from <hi>Venus,</hi> of an Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditical texture and effect alſo; for it raiſeth the droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dejected, and reclaimeth the tranſported Spirits. Yet theſe <hi>Polyceas</hi> of others and mine, fall mighty ſhort of thoſe of the Ancients: for theirs, it ſeems, would cure the ſtubborneſt Chronick diſeaſes in One, Two or Three Doſes, and thoſe almoſt incredibly ſmall. Now ours muſt be taken in large quantities, in reſpect of theirs, and the Doſe very often repeated in ſuch caſes. They would give theirs exactly in one Doſe for all diſeaſes; we muſt give ours with ſome care and modification; for by how much the worſe and weaker the Patient is, by ſo much the more we ought to give. Indeed it would do no hurt if we gave as much to every one. But theſe Medicines are not eaſily obtain'd, and <hi>fruſtra fit perplura,</hi> &amp;c. I could here produce many other Arguments, to enfortiate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of obtaining <hi>Panaceacal</hi> Medicines; but for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſake, which I aſſiduouſly aim at, I ſhall only add, That if we can produce Medicines, and that not a few of univerſal tendency, as above aſſerted, why ſhould we deſpair of purchaſing Medicines by our indefatigated la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, of ſo noble purity, tecture, and extraction, as to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45212:13"/>
enable Nature to perform all things poſſible for its preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that in few and ſmall Doſes?</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> A ſhort account of the fixt Hermophrodite.</head>
               <p>WHat I have hitherto ſaid concerning Medicine, is only to give the beſt and ſhorteſt account I can, concerning the volatile Hermophrodite. There is alſo (that I can produce) a fixt Hermophrodite, which ſith it is compos'd upon the ſame reaſon, means, and end, the volatile is, I ſhall not trouble my Reader with a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs repetition; only, that as that conſiſteth of volatile parts made pure, and then united, ſo this conſiſteth of fixt parts made pure, and proportionately married. The Ancients tell us of a grand Hermophrodite, which, if I underſtand them aright, is produced by the confection concentrating, or in true proportion, uniting the volatile and the fix'd, which Art I earneſtly labour and pray for, hoping and imploring the Almighty's bleſſing on my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours: And to which I am daily the more and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, as I obſerve the wonderful effects of my <hi>Polyacea,</hi> which I acknowledg to be but the purer bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> volatile and fix'd, mix'd, not united.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now give the Reaſons, how this operateth, and produceth ſuch great effects; but ſhall wave it at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, for Reaſons given in my Epiſtle to the Reader.</p>
               <p>Pluck up your Spirits, you true Sons of Art, and mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all the oppoſitions, calumnies, and falſe aſſertions of your ignorant, inſolent, negligent, ſloathful and intereſs'd

               <p>Let it comfort, nay, eſtabliſh you againſt all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, That God, to whom all glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath given you the knowledg to heal your wounded brethren, beyond the pompous pretenders; that you can conquer when they palliate; that you can eradicate, whilſt they alter from better to worſe; you can purge the blood by invigorating the Spirits, thereby enabling them to cleanſe and ſtrengthen its Fountain, and caſt off heterogeneous matter, when they only pretend to it, and ſeek to do it by diminiſhing them, in draining the Rivulets, or other ineffectual, if not hurtful, means.

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> A word or two in defence of Chymical Medicines.</head>
               <p>BEfore I conclude this ſhort Introduction to the true way of curing Chymically, I find my ſelf obliged to offer ſomething in defence of true Spagyrick Medicines. I know, that partly through ignorance, partly through prejudice, partly intereſt, the never-to-be ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged endeavours of conſcientious, ingenious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Artiſts, are condemned, and the cry, Oh Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical, Chymical Medicines, take care, take care, is bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed out by the ignorant, and ſupported by the intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But let us ſee what reaſon there is for this outcry; and let us examine, what the Spagyrick Art is, as it relates to Phyſick. It's not agreed from what Language the words <hi>Chymia</hi> or <hi>Chemia</hi> are deduc'd; and ſo men agree not in the meaning of the word. The word <hi>Spagyria</hi> ſeems to ſignifie the Art of diſſolving and re-uniting of bodies, and is underſtood the ſame with <hi>Chemia,</hi> as it tends to Phyſick. But to leave words, and to the matter. Sure I am, it is an Art of dividing, purifying, and conjoyning bodies, to give them their greateſt energy in Medicines, as well as to other ends. The diviſion is neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the purification. The deſign of purification, is to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate nauſeous, venomous, crude, and filthy matter from the more noble and pure parts, ſo as to render them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to be laid hold on, or alter'd by any ferment, that they may freely paſs to aſſiſt the drooping Spirits; and then they ought to be conjoyn'd for the Reaſons aforeſaid.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45212:14"/>
I confeſs, the vain boaſts of ignorant or unworthy Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, hath done this neceſſary Art a world of hurt, who pretend great matters, when many of them cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the two firſt parts well, very few the latter; yet ſuch are the Chymical Medicines ſold in Shops, and preſcrib'd in moſt Bills; and indeed, which do what is done, but are very unſafe, as the common ſaying is, <hi>Either cure or kill ſpeedily.</hi> But what are theſe in reſpect of noble Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines? A true Artiſt ſeldom troubleth himſelf to make them, but buyeth them at the Operators, or the Shops, and beginneth where they end. And truly, did theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers know what care, pains, and time after that, muſt be taken, before they become fit Medicines for the body of man, they muſt judg, that the Medicines were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully advanc'd in vertue and ſafety by it; or thoſe that wrought on them, were not in their right Wits. Now what ſort of Chymical Medicines ought to be condemn'd let the Reader judg; either thoſe that are half dreſſed, or thoſe that are perfectly ready; or either thoſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with naſty excrements and crudities, or thoſe that are ſo purified from their feculencies, that they are become incorruptible. See now how the Vulgar are deceived dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, taking ſuch things as they juſtly condemn, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning theſe noble products to them unknown, which would be of wonderful advantage to them, if they could open their eyes to ſee it, and diſentangle themſelves from the idolatrous opinions they have entertain'd of ſuch or ſuch perſons or methods. But now you would object, Why ſhould not there be as good Medicines in the Shops, as in the private Laboratories? I anſwer, firſt, becauſe there are no better publickly known and call'd for; and for the <hi>Apothecary</hi> to buy what he cannot ſell, were impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Again, Many, or moſt of theſe Operators, that prepare for the Shops, do nothing elſe, and know not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45212:15"/>
how to go farther; or if they did, would it be worth their labour. For what they aim at, is to make great quantities to ſerve many Cuſtomers; and ſuch as will ſell to the Shops with moſt profit, is fitteſt for their purpoſe; whereas a man that prepares for his own practice, is very tender and careful in his Operations, and always ſtudying to advance them, both in energy and ſafety, for his Reputation (the ground of his profits) ſake. And truly he that hath an ordinary practice, will find enough to do to procure ſuch noble Medicines for it: I mean, diligently to overſee the preparation, though he hath Operators under him; They are things of difficult and tedious acqueſt. I know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I could never rightly well obtain under Sixteen or Eighteen months time. But ſome will ſay, What need any Chymiſtry at all? They may as well ſay, what need we any Cookery at all? For if the things that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the neceſſary ſuſtentation of our lives, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a previous preparation, <hi>è fortiori,</hi> it will be that there ought to be the like in Phyſick. None will agree, that Wheat or Barley in its own nature, crude and unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, is wholeſom; yet we ſee when it hath paſt the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linary Chymiſtry, how delicious and nutrimental it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, being then fitted for the digeſtive faculty of our ſtomacks. How much care ought there then, think you to be, to prepare ſuch pure ſubſtances, as, when there is a neceſſity, may evade the alteration of a foul and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſtomack, and paſs to the vitals in quantity, to bear up, and ſtrengthen the Spirits, until they have obtain'd power enough to caſt off the <hi>ſordes,</hi> and repair the injur'd and weaken'd tunicles of the ventricle. And if crude Wheat and Barley be unwholeſom, what may we expect from crude <hi>Rhubarb</hi> and <hi>Senna</hi>; nay, from <hi>Opium, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> and <hi>Antimony?</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> A Character of a true Medicine.</head>
               <p>IT hath been oftentimes objected to me, You pretend to good Medicines, and ſo do all other profeſſors; but how ſhall we know to diſtinguiſh betwixt the good and bad, truth and falſhood, in matters we are not ſeen in? Wherefore once for all I think fit to preſent theſe ingenious Gentlemen with as many hints to diſtinguiſh by, as at preſent occur to my memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then, Diſcourſe the Phyſician, and ſee whether he can give a ſatisfactory Reaſon on the foregoing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for what he is about to do; if ſo, and he be a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer in the fire for his own practice, and not for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſale; for ſuch men (though they take ſeveral methods in their operations) ſeldom or never fail of good and ſafe Medicine; but if either of theſe circumſtances be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you have good cauſe to ſuſpect him: if the former, becauſe if he hath it, it's not of his own acqueſt; and it's a rare and an unwarrantable thing, for true Artiſts to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ſuch ſecrets to men unacquainted with their Theory and method of curing: if the latter (though it's not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that good Medicines may be put into mens hands that know them not), yet theſe men have, and can manage them but as Empericks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Enquire of the ground, or the matter from whence the Medicine was made; if from <hi>Narcoticks,</hi> ſee that it be diveſted from all ſtupefactive qualities; which you may do, either by the firſt tryal on your ſelf, or on others
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45212:16"/>
experience: If from <hi>Emetick</hi> or <hi>Cathartick</hi> drugs, ſee they be diveſted of thoſe crude and poyſonous qualities, and become only Cordial. But of this you cannot judg on your ſelves; for it's poſſible your bodies may require purging or vomiting; if ſo, a true Cordial that power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſiſteth the Vitals, will cauſe either; ſo that the ſame thing in quantity and vehicle, vomiteth one, and purgeth another, doth both with another, ſweats one, compoſes another, and purgeth another by Urine only; in ſhort, hath all the operations of Phyſick in it on the ſick, as the Diſeaſe requireth, to each one's greateſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; yet to the perfectly well, ſignifieth no more than a large draught of liberal Wine, which heightneth a man to pleaſantneſs, not tranſport; if from acids, be ſure they be made ſweet; if from Volatiles, ſee they are in due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure fix'd; if from fix'd, ſee they are in like meaſure vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliz'd.; but if from the dangerous <hi>Proteus Mercury,</hi> ſee it be perfectly fix'd and unalterable; for if acids or <hi>Alcalies</hi> will reduce it into <hi>Mercury</hi> again, it's an unſafe thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> See on the experience of others and your ſelves, that it will act much differently at leaſt, if not contrarily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let it be ſuch, as the weaker the perſon is, the greater quantities ought to be adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let it be ſuch, as though never ſo often ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſhall not grow ſo familiar or habitual (as all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtible things do) as not to produce its wonted ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That the Patient being recover'd, ſhall not at all deſire or long after it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Whether it be a volatile or fix'd, or both, let them be ſo truly purified, as to be incorruptible, and conſequently indigeſtible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:45212:16"/>
                  <hi>Eightly,</hi> Adventure not on that which is given with caution to avoid ſleeping, eating, drinking, or the like; taking cold only excepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Avoid ſuch things as cauſe gripes or convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the working.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> It ought to ſtrengthen the weakeſt to go through its operation, and give a ſenſible relief preſently after it is ended, if the perſon be capable of recovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleventhly</hi> and laſtly, It ought to be ſo ſafe, as to be given to women with child, or in child-bed.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> A Word of Advice to the Chymiſts in general.</head>
               <p>THough we have ſo many enemies, dear Brethren, that one would think it were a madneſs in us to injure one another, much leſs that honourable and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Art we all pretend to; yet ſuch is the pride, avarice, or other depravity of humane nature, that we find <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſſes</hi> in our little Family. There are a ſort of men which paſs generally under our denomination, which may be duly call'd <hi>Myſochymiſts,</hi> which have never read, or are capable to read the Chymical Theory, and do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe the portentous promiſes of Authors, and only can talk of the 3. or 5. Principles, the uſual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of their own fire, depending plainly on <hi>Recipes</hi> which they take out of Authors; and perhaps being more induſtrious than common Operators, excel the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Medicines that are ſold in the Shops; or have got a good <hi>Recipe,</hi> or more, by Tradition, which if duly and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45212:17"/>
modeſtly limited, would anſwer in many caſes the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the ſick, far beyond the common practice; who are ſo tranſported at a few good effects of their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, that they preſently poſt it up for an Univerſal one; which proving otherwiſe, begets an ill name and opinion of the Art, and its trueſt Sons. What theſe men do, is meerly accidental and Emperical, being not able to give the leaſt ſhew of reaſon for its manner of operation, or cauſe of its effect.</p>
               <p>There are another ſort amongſt men of our Character, which well deſerve the name of <hi>Pſeudochymiſts,</hi> that poſt up Univerſals alſo from <hi>Recipes</hi> only; well knowing that they will not anſwer the expectation of the Patients, or the Character they give them; and this they do for filthy lucre ſake, equally producing bad reflections with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I could heartily wiſh, and it ſhall be my endeavour, That the judgment of the former may be rightly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Villany of the other detected and corrected, and the Art and its Sons diſtinguiſhed from ſuch Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors. If any one of theſe men, or any other, have found ſo noble a Medicine plainly preſcribed, as will aſſiſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do contraries, or act as is commonly ſaid, <hi>quo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra vergit,</hi> they have had more happineſs than I, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others that I know; and if they have not, I (for the reaſons aforeſaid) reject all others.</p>
               <p>But here may be objected, That though theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines be not of the nobleſt nature; yet being much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than thoſe of the Shops, why ſhould we not uſe them? It ſeems to me but reaſon indeed, until better be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the beſt known ſhould be made uſe of; but then do not give them a better Character than you are certain they deſerve; and acquieſce not in them, but ſeek for greater things. I conceive it cannot conſiſt with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of thoſe that know better, to uſe worſe; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution

Neither want there faults among very good Artiſts, who are too apt to prize their beſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements at ſuch a rate, as to keep them <hi>Arcana</hi>'s indeed even from their fraternity, which I preſume proceeds from the narrowneſs of their ſpirits, for want of taking a due proſpect of affairs; for ſuch men doubt, that ſhould they part with their Medicines to others, they ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd and abridg'd in their Practice; whereas the truth is, conſidering the number and intereſt of our Oppoſers, and the peoples adherencies to them, we cannot have too many to vindicate and promulgate ſo uſeful truths: for though (as 'tis commonly ſaid) Truth will ſpeak for it ſelf; yet it cannot, if through the prepoſſeſſion of ſome, and the oppoſition of others, it be not ſuffer'd to ſpeak at all. There are thoſe in every corner bellowing or whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering to the people againſt ſuch as will not worſhip their <hi>Diana</hi>; and leſt the offerings of the ſaid Diſſenters to a truer Deity ſhould be obſerved by the deluded Vulgar, they'l not vouchſafe to ſee them themſelves, but confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently condemn what they know not; what need is there then of a vaſt number to vanquiſh ſo numerous an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to meet them in their ways, detect their actions, and convert the people? It is not want of miſerable people, but for want of their being convicted of the truth, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men have not their deſerv'd employment; and how to do ſo great a work with few hands, I cannot divine. And then how great an improvement of Medicine might be made by a true and plain diſcovery amongſt Artiſts, I can hardly gueſs at, much leſs deſcribe. Sure I am, that all true Artiſts work to the ſame end; and though they take many ways, yet they come to one center, <hi>viz.</hi> producing Medicines adapted to corroborate the vital ſpirits. Now were there a communication of their ſeveral Meandrous
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45212:18"/>
progreſſes, I think the ſtreighteſt, neareſt, eaſieſt, cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, pleaſanteſt and ſafeſt path would ſoon be found out. Do not miſtake me, brethren, as if I adviſe you to impart ſuch your ſecrets to every one, but only your fellow-workers, who are able to add ſomething to the <hi>Corban</hi>; or ſuch as are ſo convinced by Theory and practice, as to become ſincere Proſelytes to truth. For I'le aſſure you, how to deliver over my mean acqueſts to Poſterity with ſafety, hath much perplex'd me; and I can find no other way, but by tradition of them into worthy hands. And if ſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider I beſeech you, how many ought we to inſtruct in our time, leſt thoſe excellent Medicines have the ſame fate of thoſe more excellent of the Ancients. Do not we all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole the loſs of <hi>Paracelſus</hi>'s, <hi>Lullye</hi>'s, <hi>Helmont</hi>'s and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine</hi>'s Arcana's? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſhall we be guilty of the ſame our ſelves? God forbid. As for my part, I ſhall ever think it great uncharitableneſs; nay, unparallel'd folly, to deny the eager traveller a true direction in his way, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if his painful Journey be undertaken for the good of my brethren and children: wherefore you that are travelling, and are deſirous to find out the right way, come to me, and I'le ſhew you the beſt I can with ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity.</p>

Reſolve to truſt your own ſenſes to inform your Reaſons, and do not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly adhere to the <hi>Ipſe dixit</hi> of another.</p>
               <p>When you are thus prepar'd, come ſee, and gratefully admire the wonderful Vertues God hath placed in his Creatures, if duly managed. Then ſhall you ſee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>Fevers</hi> generally cured in Five or Six days, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; an Intermittent one in Two or Three Fits, <hi>Agues</hi> in Two, Three or Four at the moſt, and that by rational and radical means, without the <hi>Peruvian-bark,</hi> or danger of reciduation, leaving the Patient healthy and vegete. You ſhall likewiſe ſee by Gods bleſſing, <hi>Pleuriſies, Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> cur'd, <hi>citius, tutius &amp; jucundius,</hi> without Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, than with, and without danger of Chronick diſeaſes to enſue; the <hi>Small Pox</hi> generally without danger, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſiderable ſickneſs, within Six hours after the firſt adminiſtration, preſerving the beauty in a great meaſure; and alſo all peſtilential <hi>Fevers</hi> that I have ſeen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:45212:19"/>I never ſaw the <hi>Plague,</hi> I confeſs; but I doubt not the efficacy of my <hi>Febrifage</hi> in that caſe, <hi>Deo juvante.</hi> You ſhall alſo ſee <hi>Cholick</hi> and <hi>Iliack paſſions</hi> taken off in an hour or Two, and perfectly eradicated in Three or Four Weeks. You ſhall ſee a Specifick ſo advanc'd, as to cure all ſorts of <hi>Kings Evil</hi> that I have yet ſeen, though I have ſeen the <hi>Joynt Evil.</hi> And as for the <hi>Scurvey,</hi> that hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly crept upon us, through undue digeſtion, and in time grown obſtinate; nay, hath begot a daughter or daughters, as <hi>Aſthma, Vertigo, Dropſies,</hi> &amp;c. you ſhall ſee ſo ſubdued in a Months time at moſt, if the parts are found, as that neither you nor the Patient will doubt of a recovery; nay, many of thoſe that are accounted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive, reſtored. But as theſe diſeaſes have a long time of growth, ſo they require a long time to be deſtroy'd; for in a radicated <hi>Scurvey,</hi> the ferments through the whole body are deprav'd, ſo that they muſt have time for a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual reſtoring; which being reſtored to their former vigor and purity, will ſoon alter the whole Maſs of blood; nay, it's done together; inſomuch, that perſons that have ſcarce any thing that deſerve the name of <hi>ſanguis</hi> in them, will in time have as pure blood as any perſon whatſoever: Of which I have ſome inſtances at hand. I thank God, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw any one yet, if the parts were ſound, though languiſhing under an hereditary <hi>Scurvey,</hi> but have been mightily relieved, if not cured: The <hi>Jaundice</hi> cured in Two or Three days. You ſhall alſo find Womens Labours to be no longer dreadful, as I have ſaid before.</p>
               <p>Pray Sirs, have ſo much vertue, as not to condemn the things you know not. What would it advantage me to aſſert theſe things, if I had not found them by long and large experience to be ſo, ſith I know you wont believe me, unleſs you are convinc'd by matter of fact? To that therefore I invite you; wherein, ſhould I fall ſhort of what

I here aſſert, underſtood in a modeſt ſenſe, I were the veryeſt fool in Nature. And to give you greater encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to enquire into the truth of it, I hereby faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully promiſe you, that whoſoever will give himſelf the trouble to be ſatisfied of the <gap reason="foreign">

And if the elder ſort of learned and judicious men think it too late, or beneath them to learn, come you of the younger <hi>Claſs,</hi> and heartily welcom: For 'tis from you, Worthy and Learned men, that I expect the beautifying and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of this Art. It's by your Aſſiſtance that I hope to ſee the preſent known Medicines advanc'd, and the admirable Arcana's of the Ancients retriev'd. In a word, the Art of Medicine ſo meliorated, as nothing but irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Old Age, and Death it ſelf, may be inſuperable: Which to ſee, is the humble and hearty prayer, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of</p>
