         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>lebrated yet unhappy ſubject the Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>GERMAN PRINCESS</hi> was too much of
this gay flanting humour, her towring ſpirit was too
large for her narrow fortunes, whoſe ſhort wings ſhe
ſtrove to imput with the gawdy plume of ingenious
deceits. and thereby vainly thought to have ſoar'd in a
higher ſphear of reputation, above the groveling Level of
the vulgar Rabble.</p>
            <p>Her aims were great and high, but dazled with falſe
appearances, ſhe miſt the proper means to attain them; For
deſpairing to arrive at glory, by the difficult, yet only
direct Road of vertue, ſhe fondly purſued it in the crooked
By-paths of ſubtilty, and Circumventing all that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
her: Whereby although ſhe brought her ſelf
to the Juſtice of an Ignominious Death, yet in this her
ambition might be a little gratified, that ſhe has afforded
matter of diſcourſe to the whole Nation, and ſet all the
Tongues of Fame on work to tell ſtories of her.</p>
            <p>To ſay where ſhe was born is a little difficult, ſince as
many Towns lay claim to that honour, as there did Cities in
the days of <hi>Yore</hi> fall together by the ears about the Birth
place of <hi>Homer:</hi> Nor are the Heralds leſs at variance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
her Pedigree and Bearing.</p>
            <p>Some alledge that ſhe was only Daughter to the great
Duke of <hi>Oundenia,</hi> and Heireſs to vaſt Teritories of his, in
the Mountains of the Mo<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n. Others, that ſhe was born at
<hi>Cullen</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Daughter of an advocate, who left
her the proper inheritance of his profeſſion, a large portion
of Confidence, and a voluble charming Tongue. Nor want
there ſome ſerious Coffee-drinkers who will depoſe they
knew her Father a <hi>Scotch</hi> Pedler, who rambling abroad ſtole
a mighty Jewel, that weigh'd four pound, and a half out
of the grand Seignours Turbant, and was for that (like
<hi>Saboths Levi</hi>) flead alive, till he dyed at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101078:3"/>
But the moſt credible and currant opinion, is that the
World was firſt bliged with her preſence at <hi>Canterbury</hi> in
<hi>Kent,</hi> being the generous off-ſpring of a jolly Fidler; one ſo
excellently skilled in the Melodious Art, that like a ſecond
<hi>Orpheus</hi> he has often drawn hither all the Brutes and Savages
about the Town to admire and dance after the harmony of
his Crowd; for whoſe better accommodation, her mother
ſold a cup of nappy Ale, and lived by theſe two excellent
Myſteries to the envy of moſt of their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>As for the Age of our Illuſtrious <hi>Heroina</hi> any man might
gueſs of late by her aſpect that it was ſomewhat above
Thirty years ſince her loving Parents made uſe of the means
to beget her.</p>
            <p>But I that am curious to gratifie inquiſitive Readers in
ſuch weighty circumſtances, can be much more exact, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received from a very able Artist the Scheam or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the Heavens at the moment of her birth, which I
could not but publiſh to the World for the ſake of the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Arteſt, as not knowing wheth<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Nativities obtruded on the World, there be any thing
more of truth, or that ſo remarkably demonſtrates the
veriety of celeſtial influences and Infalibility of the ſtar
reading Art.</p>
            <p>Born ſhe was the 10th. of <hi>April</hi> 1639. At which time
(as thoſe that are capable to judge, will find, if they pleaſe
to erect the Figure) the Princely Sign ♌ aſcends, and the
Sun Lord of it poſited with ☿ in the Houſe of Honour <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
This ſpeaks the Native, Brave, Magnanimous, Majeſtick,
and Ingenious ♄ afflicting. The ſecond argues her perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
wanton deſire, at leaſt of money, occaſioned by her
own profuſeneſs, which ſly <hi>Mercury</hi> prompts her to ſupply
by irregular courſes, the aſcendent coming by direction
to the ſquare of <hi>Mars</hi> (which happens in <hi>Leo, Leo</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
and juſt now began to operate) pronounces her fatal
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101078:4"/>
Doom by the hand of Juſtice, and Sentance of a Magiſtrate,
as ☉ in the 10th. very oppoſitely ſhews.</p>
            <p>But to proceed—Scarce had our famous Native took
leave of her ſtanding ſtool, and got the uſe of her
pratling Tongue, but ſhe began to promiſe ſomething
more than ordinary in all her words and geſtures.</p>
            <p>At Five years Age ſhe read Engliſh perfectly, and play'd
with rare dexterity on the Virginals and Violins; ſhe
would always obtrude her ſelf into the company of the
beſt Children in the City, with whoſe Relations, her
winning Deportment, and ingenious anſwers on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
ſoon did ingratiate her, inſomuch that ſeveral
perſons of good quality frequently took her home as a
Play-mate for their little ones for a week together: Nor
were her Infant fingers (if report ſpeak true) free from
Birdlime, and that attractive quality, which could even
then ſlily convey any pretty thing ſhe lik'd, without the
leaſt ſuſpition or diſcovery: She ever was (like moſt of
her Sex) a great lover of finery, and would therefore
with a very good grace either leg, or by ſome other
Mercurial ſtratagem procure cloaths above her fathers
Purſe or Condition; but had an irreconcilable Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to all kind of laborious drudgery, and many a
pitch Battel there happened betwixt her mother and ſhe
on that occaſion, till the prudent old Matron perceiving
that this buſie little Bee brought moſt Honey to the
Hive from abroad (for ſhe never returned home but
fraught with a large carge of Victuals, Cloaths, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more conſiderable prize) quietly permitted her to
make uſe of her Tallent, which ſhe ſo improved, as in
ſhort time to grow very expert in Writing, Dancing,
Singing, and all curioſities of the Needle, all which
ſhe attain'd by her own happy ingenuity, that ſeem'd
(like the Philoſophers firſt matter) capable of all forms,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101078:4"/>
and rendred every thing ſhe ſaw done eaſie for her to
imitate.</p>
            <p>Thus ſhe continued till ſhe was entred into her four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
year, when a young Lady in her journey to <hi>Dover,</hi>
in Order to Embarque for <hi>France,</hi> coming to <hi>Canterbury</hi>
reſolved to ſpend a few days in viewing the Antiquities of
that Eminent Place and eſpecially the Renowned Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral,
which yet ſome rude Sacrilegious hands had then
lately Rob'd of its chiefeſt beauties, <hi>Confident Mall</hi>
(for by that name was our Princeſs then generally call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
underſtanding this Lady intended for <hi>France,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
dreſt her ſelf to the beſt advantage, goes to her
Lodging, and being admitted to her preſence, briskly
acquaints her, That ſhe was a <hi>Poor Mans Child of that
City, and though her Education had not been coſtly, ſhe
had ſome ſmall ſmattering in thoſe common qualities that
Embeliſh a Woman; For the Refineing and perfecting which,
ſhe had a great deſire to ſerve ſome perſon of Quality, and
never wiſht for any thing with more paſſion, then that ſhe
might have an opportunity to viſit</hi> France, <hi>whither ſhe heard
her Ladyſhip was then going, and that if her Ladyſhip would
pleaſe to admit her to wait on her thither, ſhe wonld by her
future ſervices endeavour to merit pardon for the boldneſs,
of the preſent Addreſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lady not a little ſurprized to hear ſuch a requeſt
ſo handſomely expreſt by a meer Stanger ſo young,
ask'd her ſeveral queſtions, whereof ſome perhaps might
be impertinent as any thing in this Narrative, and
therefore we ſhall omit them here.</p>
            <p>But in fine, ſhe took her in, as part of her retinue,
and with that Family, within three weeks after ſhe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at <hi>Paris.</hi> She is now in that Accademy of <hi>Europe.</hi>

               <l>In <hi>France!</hi> the ſtaple of new Modes,</l>

            </q>
            <p>Here ſhe continued four years, high in her Ladies
favour, during which time ſhe made her ſelf Miſtreſs
of that Courtly language, and the <hi>French</hi> aſſurance
which our young Gallants travel to acquire, in her was
natural.</p>
            <p>She was at that age a plump ſucculent Girl, with a
face no way contemptible, but a fine Wit, a charming
Tongue, and a humour ſo brisk and gay, as if no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Elements but fire and Air had club'd to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p>Theſe attractions, and her petulant deportment
drew on a number of Monſiers to Court her, for that
Trifle which men ſo much covet to enjoy, and women
to be rid of, but ſhe like a diſcreet market-woman
plotting to ſell her ware to the beſt advantage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them all equally with promiſing ſmiles, and
diſpenced the ſame endaering Careſſes to every one. This
brought her in a large Harveſt of preſents; and the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101078:5"/>
better to draw them in ſhe would for ſuch a Diamond
Ring, rich Bracelet, or Necklace of Pearl, promiſe
ſome Cully the great kindneſs, but be ſure aforehand
would order one of their other Maids always at the
time and place appointed, to diſturb and prevent the
aſſignation.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the reſt a dapper Tailor that work'd to her
Lady would needs have been tampering with her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies,
and though ſhe ſcorned his louzy addreſſes, and
had often ſharply repulſt him, yet he preſenting her ſtill
with his importunities, ſhe reſolving to be reveng'd on
his ſawſineſs, pretends to comply, and for the value
of Threeſcore Crowns to be paid in hand, promiſes to
let him in at a back-door about midnight to her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces.
The overjoyed Taylor pawning ſome, odd move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables
he had, raiſes the ſame and gave it her, but
being that morning to carry home ſome Garments of
her Ladies to alter, ſhe cunningly wrapt up therein
two or three pieces of her Ladies plate, which he
coming home found with great admiration, but fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
'twas only a frolique of his Miſtreſſes kindneſs to
return him part of ſatisfaction for the threeſcore Crowns
he had given her, without acquainting any body, lays them
up and with much impatience waits for the bleſſed hour,
That night ſhe (who had the charge of every thing)
ſtayd up late, left the back-door and two other doors
unlock'd, and ſubtily taking away the reſt of her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Plate, to a great value, hid it in a place, whence
ſhe might at any time ſecretly remove it: Then to bed
ſhe goes, but keeps her ſelf awake with laughing till
ſhe hears her eager Gallant entred the houſe, and got
groping in the dark in the Chamber next to her, where
the Plate uſually ſtood: then all on a ſudden ſhe crys
out as loud as ſhe could bellow, <hi>Thives, Thieves.</hi> Poor
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101078:6"/>
Stitch amaz'd at the unexpected outcry, had almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray'd
himſelf, and ſpoil'd the room through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of his fears, but ſhe continuing her dreadful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
he found no hopes of ſafety but in ſpeedy
flight, which he no ſooner attempts, but mi-ſtepping
rould down headlong a whole pair of ſtairs, to the
great camage of his ſhins and elbows, and riſing with
an excellent dexterity at bottom, unhappily run his
noddle againſt a cruel poſt, which cut his forehead al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to the skul, and thus rufully mauld, with much
adoe made his eſcape.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Alarm is taken, the Ladies
frighted, the people of the houſe get up, and finding
the doors open, and all the Plate gone: Miſtreſs <hi>Mary</hi>
proteſts ſhe is almoſt frighted out of her wits, and hoarſe
with crying out, that ſhe heard the Rogues very plain,
that one tumbled down ſtairs, and ſhe ſuppoſed hurt
himſelf, for ſhe heard him cry, <hi>Mon Dieu, Mon Dieu!</hi>
and was confident it was no other voice then her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Tailors, who by his familiarity in the houſe might
have got falſe keys, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Loath they were to ſuſpect him, but her evidence
perſwades them however for ſatisfaction to get an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
to ſearch his houſe next morning, whom they find
in his bed all be-mortified, and three pieces of plate
with the Ladies Arms on it, in his Trunk. The ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
fellow in vain makes proteſtations of his innocence:
before a Magiſtrate he is carried, who threatens him
with the wrack to diſcover the reſidue of the plate, and
his Confederates, but at the good natur'd Ladies requeſt
that was waved, and he only cenſured to be branded, and
ſoundly whip'd, which being executed accordingly our
mercileſs Princeſs to upbraid the afflicted innocent, very
gravely asks whether ſuch a cure of the Letcherous Itch
was not well worth 60 Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:101078:6"/>
At laſt her Lady taking ſome notice of her extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
they part, not without ſome diſadvantage to the
Lady: and our Lady Errant returns for <hi>England,</hi> and for
a ſmall time lives very ſoberly at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where a Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
that had a very good ſtock of money falls in love
with her, and by his importunities and her fathers, ſhe is
prevailed with to Marry him: But their Nuptial bed
was ſcarce warm, when her active Genious weary of ſuch
a dull life began to plot to ſhift the Scene; and thereupon
carrying it exceeding fondly to her husband without ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whilſt he is from home ſhe packs up the beſt of her
apparel, and all the money ſhe had, being about 14 pounds,
and ſlips to <hi>Margaret,</hi> and thence to <hi>Harwich,</hi> where get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Maid as good as her ſelf, ſhe in the Packet-boat, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

aſſumes the quality of a great <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady, by the Title
of <hi>Dutcheſs of Rumford,</hi> that for ſome particular reaſons
deſired to remain there a while Incognito.</p>
            <p>Here ſhe ſends for an eminent Jeweller, who ſeveral times
attended her, and at laſt ſhe made choice of as many Jewels
as ſhe bargained to pay him two thouſand pounds for; but
told him ſhe had not money at preſent, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
ſhe might ſeal them up in that box which he uſed to
bring them in, and that he would keep them for her three
weeks, in which time at fartheſt her money would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
and not offer to diſpoſe of them till then. Whereas
ſhe having obſerved the box at his ſeveral comings, had in
the mean time cauſed another to be made exactly like it, and
kept it by her ready ſealed up, and when he gave her his to
ſeal by an excellent Legerdemain ſhe put the change upon
him, and ſoon after removed into <hi>England,</hi> leaving poor
Sweating <hi>Hans</hi> at the three weeks end to look for his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
and open his ſealed box, where be finds nothing but

<hi>Rumney-Marſh</hi> in <hi>Kent:</hi> And making him believe ſhe
was an Eminent Citizens Daughter, inveigled him to
be a Suitor to her, with whom after ſeveral treats in
Town, ſhe attended with her Maid, goes down to <hi>Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end;</hi>
There he ſpends all the Money he had taken for
his Cattel in <hi>London,</hi> and then ſhe takes him aboard a
Ship, makes him drunk with a Bowl or two of Punch,
takes ten Guinnies of the Maſter for him, and leaves
him faſt aſleep, bound to ſeek his Fortunes at <hi>Barbado's.</hi>
But juſt as the Tiltboat went off, and ſhe was returning
for <hi>London,</hi> ſhe ſends a Letter to the Mayor of <hi>Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end,</hi>
(who by that Office is a Juſtice of Peace) in her
Cullies Name, intreating his aſſiſtance to bring him off,
which the Mayor did, and the Maſter had his ſhare in
the Cheat as well as the Countryman.</p>
            <p>Fluſht with theſe late Succeſſes ſhe lays the Plot of a
Nobler Comedy, which conferred on her the gay Title of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101078:7"/>
               <hi>GERMAN PRINCESS</hi> ever after; All the way
in her Paſſage ſhe ſpoke either Dutch or Broken Engliſh,
and pretended ſhe was juſt come from beyond the Seas; The
Tiltboat arrived about Midnight, and ſhe is forced to go
as far as a Tavern neer the Royal <hi>Exchange</hi> with a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
whoſe civility to a ſuppoſed Stranger oblig'd him
to take care for Lodging for her: There they find people
up, and ſhe and her Maid are houſed for that Night: Next
day, being dreſt very ſplendidly, ſhe Complements her
Landlady, and agrees to continue her Lodging there: ſhe
was brave in her Deportment, and Noble in her Expences,
which tempted the woman of the houſe to be Inquiſitive
what ſhe was, whilſt ſhe on all occaſions induſtriouſly
avoided the declaring of her Quality or Concerns; till
finding the People wrought up to a high expectation,
ſhe writes two Letters, and deſires the Woman to get
them ſent to the Forraign Poſt-houſe; who greedy of
that opportunity, breaks them open, but finding them
Dutch, is forced to call her Husband (who had formerly
been in <hi>Holland</hi>) to read them; He finds one directed
to a great Prince, by the Name of Brother: an other
to her Steward, ordering great ſumms of Money, and
other Gallantries to be returned and ſent to her, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<hi>Henrietta Maria de Woolway,</hi> Princeſs.</p>
            <p>The Letters were ſent away no body need care whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and our witty ſtranger ſoon found the Plot had
took, by the additional reſpects the whole Family paid
to her new Vampt Highneſs. But the Vintners Wife
was big with other thoughts, conſidering that if ſhe
could Match this Illuſtrious perſon to ſome of her
friends, ſhe and her Husband would be made for ever.
At laſt ſhe pitches on her Cozen Mr. <hi>Charlton,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſervant to a Scrivcher, but then Uſurping the

            <p>Rich Cloaths are taken up, a Coach and Foot-boy
in Livery hired, and a Noble Dinner beſpoke at this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
for my Lord, whom the <hi>German</hi> Lady with many
Intreaties was prevailed with to Honour with her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
There ſeveral Complements paſt, in fine (to make
ſhort of a well known Story) after ſeveral Treats,
and above two Hundred pounds, ſpent in Courtſhip,
they are Married, and take Noble Lodgings in the
<hi>Strand,</hi> and <hi>Charlton</hi> fancies nothing leſs than to be
made a Duke, or ſome ſtrange Mammamouchy-Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lado;
When all theſe Magnificent Dreams are diſturb'd
by a ſorry Journeyman-ſhoomaker; who coming in
his Maſters abſence to bring her Highneſs ſome Shooes,
knew her to be Wife to the before mentioned Shoomaker
at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with whom he had been Prentice; This
he divulges amongſt the Neighbours, and the Buze at
laſt reaches Mr. <hi>Charltons</hi> Fathers Ear, who being a
wary old Gentleman, ſpake with the Fellow, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him perſiſt in his aſſertion, gets a Warrant, and
has her Pageant Highneſs before a Juſtice, where moſt
of her Jewels are found Counterfeit, and ſhe on a
charge of having two Husbands, is committed to the
<hi>Gate-houſe:</hi> There the Old Bricklayer hears tidings of
her, and very kindly came to Inquire for his Wife:
This ſhe underſtanding dreſſes up another Woman that
ſomewhat reſembled her, to perſonate her: which ſhe
acted ſo to the life, that the Old man (though he
made uſe of his Spectacles for that purpoſe) took her
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101078:8"/>
for the ſame, and diſcourſed with her for two hours
accordingly, before the Keeper and ſeveral others.</p>
            <p>Next Seſſions our Princeſs is tryed at the <hi>Old Bayly</hi> for
her Life, for having three Husbands: the Shoomaker,
the Bricklayer, and Mr, <hi>Charlton:</hi> the laſt ſhe owned,
the firſt could not be found, the other was not much
regarded, ſince it was proved he had charged another
woman with it in the Priſon, and therefore 'twas
thought he Doated, and did not know whom he have
for his Wife.</p>
            <p>Thus with applauſe ſhe was Acquitted, and after
acted her own part on the publique Theater in the
Play made on that Occaſion, called; <hi>The GERMAN
PRINCESS:</hi> but 'twas the General Vogue of the
Wits, ſhe acted much better to the life in the World,
than on its Epitome, the better, and therefore ſhe ſoon
left that, and for ſome time Imployed her ſelf in ſeizing
ſilver <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ankards in all the Taverns and Victualing
Houſes about. Town, takeing Lodgings, makeing the
Servants Drunk, and then Jilting their Maſters. At
this ſport ſhe at laſt was Caught; and being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
at the Seſſions, was Tranſported into <hi>Virginia.</hi>
There ſhe kept up her Old Grandeur, lived high for ſome
time, and then boldly returns for <hi>England,</hi> in deſpight
of the Sentence.</p>
            <p>Then ſhe ſtudies new Pranks, and amongſt the reſt
this pleaſant Adventure.</p>
            <p>Underſtanding there was a young Apothecary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> newly ſet up, with a very good
ſtock, ſhe engages an Old Woman very often to go
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101078:9"/>
for odd things to his Shop; who one day takeing her
opportunity, asks why he did not Marry; He replies,
with all his heart, if he could meet with a Virtuous
Woman, with any thing of a Fortune; Whereupon
ſhe told him ſhe was very Intimate with a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Neice to an Eminent Citizen in <hi>London,</hi> who
kept her, and had Two Thouſand pounds of hers, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
at the day of Marriage, in his hands: and tells
him the Name, and where they lived, telling him he
might Inquire of the truth of it; and that if he
thought fit, ſhe did not doubt but to bring her into
his Company, and drive the Bargain between them:
The young man Civilly thanked her, and next day
made diligent Enquiry amongſt ſome of this Citizens
Neighbours, and finding all things as ſhe had related,
he longed to ſee his intended Miſtris. But Mrs. <hi>Wheadle</hi>
the Matchmaker firſt gets him to Seal a Bond of One
Hundred Pound Penalty, to pay Fifty Pound on the
day of their Marriage, and then appoints him a day
for their meeting, but fails him once or twice, on
purpoſe to heighten his Appetite, and at laſt brings him
our Princeſs to act the Citizens Neice, whom he Treats
Nobly, and ſeveral Meetings they had: In fine, ſhe
confeſt her kind Inclinations to him, which he no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
heard, but in an Extaſie of Joy he urges a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
forthwith, which ſhe excuſes for want of Cloaths,
and alledged it was impoſſible ſhe ſhould get any from
her Uncles without ſmoaking the Deſign, whereupon in
a gay humour he flings a Hundred Peices into her
Lap, and bids her provide what ſhe pleaſed, being
reſolved before ſhe returned to her Uncles, to Marry
her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:101078:9"/>
Accordingly next morning Married they were, and
having lain with him two Nights, ſhe told him 'twas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
ſhe ſhould go back to her Uncles, but deſired
him the next day to come and demand her, and her
Portion, which ſhe knew could not be denied him;
He was well ſatisfied, and the next day went thither,
Inquiring for the Grave Cittizen, who demanding his
buſineſs, he told him, he came there in a civil way to
demand his Wife, who was in his Houſe, and he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
he would not keep her from him. The Old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
ſtarted at this, inquires who was his Wife, he
replies, your Neice, Sir: and you know there is a
certain ſum of Two Thouſand Pound that in her right
belongs to me, which I likewiſe expect.</p>
            <p>The Old Man thinking by his confidence that it was too
true, in a rage runs up ſtairs, and meeting his Neice,
Oh you Baggage (quoth he) I thought this you would
come to, there's your goodly Husband below come for
you, en get you gone to him: The Girl that knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the matter, verily believed her Uncle was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted,
and began to vow ſhe knew not any thing he
meant. Nay, never deny it (fays he) but be gone to
him, and with that drags her by the Arm down
ſtairs, and puſhing her towards the Apothecary; Here
take her, he cries, and leave my Houſe: As for the
Portion you ſpeak of, I ſhall not ſo eaſily part with
it, but endeavour to preſerve ſomething for her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
if ſhe have any: The Apothecary with this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no leſs ſurprized, cries: What mean you Sir! I
never ſaw this Gentlewoman in my life before. This
put them all into a greater maze, but at laſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary
telling all the Hiſtories of his Amour, they
concluded he was horribly cheated, and pitty, the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101078:10"/>
helpleſs ſalve for miſery, was all the comfort they could
give him.</p>
