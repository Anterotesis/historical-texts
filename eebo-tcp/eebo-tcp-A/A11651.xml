            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

holden at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the twenty eighth
day of June, the yeare of God, 1633.
THE THREE ESTATES of
Parliament being assembled, having
taken to their consideration the many
blessings, which this nation doth enjoy
under his Majesties most wise, happy,
and peaceable government, whereof
each Estate is most sensible, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
royall zeale for propagating the
Gospel of Jesus Christ, his care for
providing sufficient maintenance for the Clergie, his extraordinary paines
taken for uniting the disjoynted members of this Common-wealth, and
extirping of all roots of discords, releeving the oppressed, and with so
eaven and fatherly a hand curing the wounds of this Common-wealth, as
the wisest eye can finde no blemish in the temper of all his royall actions:
And last, the great comfort they have by enjoying his Majesties royall
presence, paines taken, and expences disbursed by his Majestie in this his
Majesties journey: with a most thankfull acknowledgement, are most
earnestly and humbly to entreat his sacred Majestie, to accept of this their
voluntary offer of one taxation to be imposed, collected, and payed to his
gracious Majestie, in manner, and at the termes following: That is to say,
The Dukes, Marquesses, Earles, Vicounts, Lords, and Commissioners
of Shires for the temporall Estate, have granted, that there shall be uplif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of every pound land of old extent within this Kingdome, pertaining
to Dukes, Marquesses, Earles, Vicounts, Lords, Barons, and Freehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and Fewers of his Majesties proper lands, the summe of thirty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
money at every one of the six severall termes following: <hi>viz.</hi> The
summe of thirty shillings money at the feast &amp; terme of Martinmas, in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23168:3"/>
year of God, 1634. The summe of other thirtie shillings mony at the feast
and terme of Martinmas, in the year of God 1635. The summe of other
thirty shillings money at the feast and terme of Martinmas, in the yeare
of God, 1636. The summe of other thirty shillings money at the feast and
terme of Martinmas, in the year of God, 1637. The summe of other thirty
shillings money at the feast and terme of Martinmas, in the yeare of God,
1638. And the summe of other thirty shillings money at the feast and
terme of Martinmas, in the yeare of God, 1639. AND the Archbishops
and Bishops for the spirituall Estate, have granted that there shall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifted
of all Archbishopricks, Bishopricks, Abbacies, Pryories, and other
inferiour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enefices within this Kingdome, at every one of the six termes
above-specified, the just taxation thereof, as they have beene accustomed
to be taxed unto in all time by-gone, whensoever the Temporall lands of
this Kingdome were stinted to thirty shillings the pound land of old ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:
And the same taxation to be payed at every one of the six severall
termes above-specified. AND the Commissioners of Burrows for
their Estate have granted, that there shall be uplifted of all the Burrows
within this Kingdome, at every one of the six termes above-specified, the
just taxation thereof as they have been accustomed to be taxed unto in all
time by-gone, whensoever the Temporall Lands of this Kingdome were
stinted to thirty shillings the pound land of old extent. And the said Taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be payed at every one of the six severall termes above-written.
AND in regard that his Majestie hath erected sundry Prelacies in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Lordships, whereby the owners thereof may claime to be taxed
with the Barons of the Temporall Estate, and thereby his Majestie will
be defrauded of a great part of the said Taxation.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE THE SAID ESTATES ordaine, that
all erections of Prelacies, and other small Benefices, in whole or in part in
Temporall Lordships, shall in payment of the said Taxation pay to the
Collectour thereof so much of the same Taxation (<hi>pro rata</hi>) as if they
were no wayes erected, and as they were subject to do before the erection
of the same. AND such like it is statute and ordained, that all dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Benefices within this Kingdome, in whole or in part, shall be subject
in payment of so much of the same taxation (<hi>pro rata</hi>) as they would have
beene subject to pay, though the same had not beene dissolved. And that
those parties, who have gotten any part or portion of any Prelacies or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inferior Benefices dissolved, &amp; new securities made unto them by his
Majestie of that part and portion thereof so dissolved, shall be subject in
payment of the Taxation thereof to the Prelate or other beneficed person
for his reliefe of the same Taxation, as they would have been, so the same
had not beene dissolved, notwithstanding of any condition contained in
the infeofments and securities made by his Majestie to them in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thereof.</p>
            <p>AND FURTHER, his Majestie and the said Estates annull and
discharge all priviledges and immunities whatsoever, whereby any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
may think themselves free of payment of this present Taxation (The
priviledges granted to the ordinary Lords and Senators of the Colledge
of Justice, and the taxation of Benefices, given, disponed, and mortified
for entertainment of the Universities, Colledges, and Hospitalls within
this Kingdome onely excepted.) AND further, the said Estates, for a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23168:3"/>
more ample testification of their exceeding great affection to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
service, have (beside and attour the ordinary taxation above-written)
made a free and willing offer to his Majestie of one yearly extraordinarie
taxation of the sixteenth penny of all annual rents which any person or
persons within this Kingdome hath freely due and payable to them
yearly or termly (Their own annuall rents, wherein they are adebted to
others being first deduced): The first termes payment whereof shall bee,
and begin at the Feast and terme of Martinmasse, in the yeare of God,
one thousand six hundred thirty foure years, and so forth yearly and
termly at Whitsunday, and Martinmasse for the space of six years, while
the said six years and twelve termes payment thereof bee full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely
out-run.</p>
            <p>AND for the better triall of every man his annuall-rents, which hee
hath yearly or termly due to him: It is ordained, that this act be publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the Market Crosse of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and of the whole head bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
of the Sheriffedomes, Stewartries, bayleries, and Regalities, within
this Kingdome, whereby all his Majesties Lieges may have true notice
thereof. AND therewithall the said Estates will, command, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
all his Majesties subjects that have any annuall rents payable to
them, That they compeir within the head burgh of the Sheriffedome,
Stewartrie, baylerie, or Regalitie, or the head burgh of any of those
Jurisdictions, wherein the head Courts are holden, and where the said
annuall renters dwell, and have their ordinarie residence in any court day
in one of the two last weeks immediately preceding, and in one of the
two first weeks immediately following Whitsunday, and Martinmasse.
At which time the Sheriffs, Stewards, Bayliffs, and Bayliffs of Regalities,
&amp; Provest, and bayliffs of free burrows within the bounds of their Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
shalbe obliged to hold Courts weekly, to the effect after specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And the Lieges resorting to the said Courts, shall give up one inventar
to the Clerk thereof, of the whole summes of money for which annuall
rent is due to them yearly or termly, with the names of their debtors,
designed by name and sirname, and the ordinarie place of their residence.
As also the whole summes of money for which they are subject in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of annual rents to others, with the names of their creditors, to whom
the same is due, designed likewise by name and sirname, and the place of
their ordinarie residence, whether the same annuall rent be in victuall, or
in silver: the annuall of victuall to be esteemed according to the stock of
money for which it is payd, at eight for ilk hundred thereof. And shall
cause the parties, up-givers of the said inventars, everie partie subscribe
his own inventar himselfe, if hee can write; and if hee cannot write, the
Clerk of the said Court shall subscribe the said inventar in face of the
court before the members thereof. And also the sheriffs, stewards, bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs,
bayliffs of regalities, provest, and bayliffs of free burrowes within
the bounds of their jurisdictions: And the clerks themselves shall make
and give up an inventar of the debts owing to themselves, and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as said is. IT IS alwaies provided, that if any person impedit
by reason of sicknesse, or distracted by some other just occasion, shall
not be present himselfe to give up the said inventar, It shall be lawfull for
him to cause any honest respons all man within the jurisdiction where hee
dwels, compeir and give up his inventar, providing the same be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23168:4"/>
by himselfe, or any notar at his command, which the ingiver
shall declare to be one true deed, and shall abide at the same upon the like
hazzard and danger, as the principall partie should underlye: which shall
be als sufficient, as if the inventar had beene given personally up by the
principall partie himselfe. And an inventar being once made and given
up, shall still stand, and be a ground to charge any person, during the time
of the six years of the said taxation, unlesse the partie change, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
employ his summes: and then he shall give up a new inventar, which
shall be a new ground of a charge, and the former shall cease. And the
said Clerke shall make a Record in his Register of the said whole inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars:
which inventars being so recorded, shall bee extracted by the said
Clerke, and subscribed with his hand, And three extracts made of the
same; one to be given to the partie, if he require the same; another to be
sent by the said Clerke to the Collector of the same taxation; and the
third to be sent by the said Clerke, to the CLERKE of His MAIESTIES
REGISTER, to be kept amongst the Records of his Majesties Exchequer,
to the intent it may bee knowne how far everie party is lyable in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the said extraordinarie taxation. For the which extract and
note made in Register, the said Clerk shall have of every person, up-giver
of an inventar, the summe of foure shillings money. And if by sloth or
malice the Clerke shall happen to delay, or shift the Lieges, resorting to
the said courts to the effect foresaid, (complaint being made thereof to
the Lords of his Majesties privie Councell) the said Clerks shall bee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
accordingly, at the discretion of the said Lords. And at any court
day, in any of the said two weekes preceding or immediately following
any terme, it shall be leasome to any person to compeir and offer to give
up his inventar (hee making payment of the taxation due for the same)
which the Clerk and Judge shall be astricted to receive.</p>
            <p>AND albeit it be declared, that an inventar once given up shall still
stand, and bee a ground to charge any person during the whole termes of
the said taxation, except the same be changed in manner foresaid: Yet
because sundry, who have this liberty, delay to make payment of the taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their moneys after the time be expired, THEREFORE it is
provided and declared, that if they failye to make payment of the due
taxation of their moneys within twentie dayes after each terme, that the
partie so failying, shalbe subject in payment of the triple of the said taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for each terme wherein he failyes, and letters shall be direct against
them, for payment thereof in forme as effeiris.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, for the better observation of this Act, It is declared,
that whosoever receives, retaines, or conditions to receive any annuall
rent, and concealeth the same, or any part thereof: Or in giving up his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventar
of debts and annuals owing by him to his just creditors, giveth
up more than he is justly adebted, the up-giver thereof shall forfeit that
termes annuall to his Majesties use. AND whosoever first discovers,
or reveales, eyther the annuall concealed, or annuall which is more than
the up-givers just debt; shall for his reward have the halfe of that terms
concealed annuall, and as much as the halfe of that annuall which shall
be discovered to have beene unjustly given up. AND in case it shall
happen any person or persons whatsoever, by vertue of his up-given
inventar, to be charged for payment of his taxation, and at the time of his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23168:4"/>
charge to declare in presence of a Judge by his great oath solemnly
sworne, that his debter is a bankrupt, whereby he is disabled to make pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his taxation, and is content the Kings Majestie shall have the whole

have the leading and drawing of their owne teind, the same being first
truely and lawfully valued, and they paying therefore the price after-spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
incase they be willing to buy the same: or otherwise paying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the rate of teinde after specified. Like as his Majestie and Estates find
and declare, that the just and true rate of teinds, is and shall be the fift part
of the constant rent which each land payeth in stock and teind where
the same are valued joyntly, and where the teinds are valued apart and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,

reserving alwayes liberty to such as shall finde themselves enormly hurt
by the leading of the said valuations, to persue for rectifying of the same,
before the commissioners appointed by his Majestie and Estates for that
effect. And also his Majestie, with consent of the three Estates, finds and
declares, that the price of all teinds which may be sold and annalied, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting

that incase the impediment of not selling induring the space fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
flow from the titular by reason of his minority or other inhabilitie,
in that case the heritor who offereth himselfe ready to buy his own teind
within the space foresaid, shall have place so soone as the impediment is
removed, to buy his teinds, notwithstanding of the expiring of the
yeares and spaces above-expressed. And it is declared that if the heritor
be minor, and his Tutors neglect the buying of his teinds within the space
foresaid, the minor shall have action against his Tutors <hi>pro Damno &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresse,</hi>
but not action to compell the titular after the expiring of the space
foresaid, for selling of the said teinds: And where the said teinds are
coft by the heritors as said is, finde that the heritor shall bee obliged to
give to the life-renter of the said lands, having right thereto by contract
of marriage, life-rent, infeftment, conjunct-fee, or reservation forth
of the infeftment of fee, the leading of the teinds of their said life-rent
lands, for payment of the rate of the teind of the same. And sicklike finds
that in all cases where teinds are not coft, that the heritors or life-renters
of lands, who have the leading of their owne teinds by themselves, their
tennants, and others in their name, shall be obliged to pay to the titulars
of teinds the yearely rate thereof, according to the valuation of the same
made or to be made, and to give securitie thereof, according to the order
set downe and prescribed by the Commissioners of surrenders and teinds,
or to be set downe by the Commissioners appointed, or to be appointed
by his Majestie with consent of the Estates of this present Parliament,
deducing so much thereof as shall be assigned to the Minister for his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
It is alwayes declared, that whether the said teinds be sold or
not, his Majestie shall have his annuitie forth of the same, according to
the tenor of the act of annuitie: And because sundrie questions may arise
both anent the valuation of teinds, and price of the same in divers parts
of the countrey, and anent the securities to be made by the titulars to the
heritors who buy their teinds, and by the heritors to the titulars of the
price to be payed for the same where the teinds are coft, or for payment
of the rate of teind where the same is not coft: And sicklike anent the
provision of the Kirkes, with competent maintenance, and for division
of the price of teinds betwixt the heritors and life-renters, and rectifying

his Majesties royall Antecessors, and Estates of the Realme then assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
found the erection of that honourable Consistorie (which is a biding

royall service, but also necessary and profitable for the peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and to the seene good and comfort of all the subjects. And consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that the provision allowed of before to the Lords of Session, was
no wayes sufficient for defraying of their charges, and that through

losses thereby sustained by them.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, and to the effect the said Senators, and Lords of
Session present and to come, may be more encouraged to goe on, and to
persist as they doe in their zeale and affections to his Majesties service,

lands and meanes, which with his Majesties consent foresaid, they ordaine
to be collected &amp; payed to the effect, in manner, and at the termes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That is to say, The Duke, Marquesses, Earles, Vicounts, Lords, and
Commissioners of Shires for the temporall Estate, have granted that
there shall be up-lifted of every pound land of old extent within this
Kingdome, pertaining to Dukes, Marquesses, Vicounts, Lords, Barons,
and Free-holders, and Fewars of his Majesties proper lands, the sum of
ten shillings money, at every one of the foure termes following, viz. The

yeares: and the sum of other ten shillings money, at the feast and terme
of Martinmasse, 1636 yeares. And the Archbishops, and Bishops for the

Bishopricks, Abbacies, Pryories, and other inferior Benefices,
within this Kingdome, at every one of the foure termes above-specified,
the just taxation thereof, as they have beene accustomed to be taxed in
all time by-gone, whensoever the temporall lands of this Kingdome
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:23168:28"/>
were stented to ten shillings the pound land of old extent: And the same
taxation to be payed at every one of the foure termes above-specified.

owners thereof may claime to be taxed with the Barons of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Estate, whereby the said Lords of the Session would be defrauded
of a great part of the said taxation, destinate and appointed as said is.</p>
            <p>Therefore the said Estates ordaine that all erections of Prelacies, and
other small benefices, in whole or in part, in temporall Lordships, shall
in payment of the said taxation, pay to the collectors thereof, so much
of the said taxation; (<hi>pro rata</hi>) as if they were no wayes erected, and as
they were subject to doe before the erection of the same. And sick like,
it is statute &amp; ordained that all dissolved benefices within this kingdome
in whole or in part, shall be subject in payment of so much of the same
taxation (<hi>pro rata</hi>) as they would have beene subject to pay, though the
same had not beene dissolved. And that the parties who have gotten any
part or portion of any Prelacies, or other inferior benefices dissolved, and
new securities made unto them by his Majestie, of that part and portion
thereof so dissolved, shall be subject in payment of the taxation thereof
to the Prelate, or other beneficed person for his reliefe of the same taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as they would have beene, so the same had not beene dissolved, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

these presents give and grant full power and authoritie to the said Lords
