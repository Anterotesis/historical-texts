            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in, that God himſelfe ſeems to affect the glory of Arms, when he cauſeth himſelfe to be as it were ſir-named THE LORD OF HOSTS. The beams of this glorious name puts ſome luſtre upon the meaneſt in an Army; What a luſtre then doth it put upon your Excellencie, who ſtand ſo neare it? Happy the time that ever you were borne to be made uſe of by God and his people in ſo noble and honourable a ſervice as this. We reade ZECH. 3. 3. of Joſhua, that great inſtrument of Reformation, in the returne of JUDAH from her Captivity, that he ſtood in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy garments, but the Angel ſpake to thoſe who ſtood before him, ſaying, Take away the filthy garments from him: and unto him he ſaid, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I have cauſed thine iniquity to paſſe from thee, and I wil cloathe thee with change of ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thoſe who ſtand up moſt eminent and forward in the cauſe of God and his people, ſhal ever have ſome who wil ſeek to ſtain their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by ſlanders and reproachfull names, to put them into vile garments: what viler garment can there be then the garment of Treaſon and Rebellion? But the Angel ſtands by to take off theſe vile garments, and to clenſe his ſervants even from this nominall iniquity: he will put
<pb facs="tcp:95477:3"/>
change of rayment upon them, he will one day make it appeare that there were none ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God, their King and Countrey, as they: The Lord that hath choſen Jeruſalem, ſaith the Text, ver. 2. wil rebuke them who thus ſtand up againſt his ſervants. The Lord who hath ſet his heart to bring mercie to Jeruſalem, to his Church, will certainly rebuke ſuch as ſtand to reſiſt the great inſtruments thereof. Wherefore that which the Angel of the Lord proteſted to JOSHUA, v. 6. I may in the name of the Lord with a little change proteſt unto your Excellencie, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, if you will walke in my wayes, and if you will keepe my charge, then you ſhall have an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie in my houſe, and I will give you places among theſe that ſtand by.</hi> That is, among the bleſſed Angels in the heavens.

            <p>Wherefore moſt noble Lord of our Hoſts, yea of the Hoſts of God, Goe on with true He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke magnanimity, and proſper, in the name of this glorious Lord of hoſts. The prayers of the Churches are for you, the bleſsings of the

            <p>It is a title that God hath heretofore delighted much, yea gloryed much in; we find it not leſſe then two hundred times in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and moſt

            <p>Times of Reformation, Temple-work, uſually meets with much, with ſtrong oppoſition. We had need therefore to have this name of God in our eye, and ſanctifie it in our hearts, in ſuch times, while ſuch work is on foot.</p>
            <p>It is true, God did this work without bloud-ſhed, it was done <hi>not by power or by might, but by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> as we have it <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 6. but becauſe the work was ſuch, as in regard of ſecond cauſes, needed an Army to effect it; although God did it himſelfe, yet his Name was to be ſanctified in it, as <hi>the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> In the New Teſtament we ſeldome find this title; it is but twice that I remember in all the New Teſtament, and in one of thoſe two places it is quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Old Teſtament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 29.

               <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as many take it. There is a great difference between theſe two, <hi>The Lord of Sabbath,</hi> and <hi>The Lord of Sabbaoth:</hi> The one is <hi>the Lord of reſt,</hi> the other is <hi>the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> thoſe words come from a different root

in the Hebrew. The ſecond place is <hi>James</hi> 5. 4. and there you have not the Engliſh word <hi>Hoſts,</hi> but the Hebrew word <hi>Sabbaoth</hi> likewiſe. In the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have Gods Titles fuller of ſweetneſſe and grace, as <hi>The Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, The God of all conſolation, The Father of mercies, The God of peace, &amp;c.</hi> The more cauſe have we to be humbled, who live in the times of the Goſpel, and yet are come to ſuch times wherein God hath changed as it were his name, and even in the times of the Goſpel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us in this dreadfull name of his, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Title is in it ſelfe a very fearfull one, and yet before we have done with it we ſhall find it like that name of Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Thy name is as an ointment poured forth, a ſweet refreſhing pleaſant ointment.</hi> In the 2. of <hi>Sam. Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. the Lord ſpeaks of this name of his ſet between the Cherubims, <hi>Whoſe name is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of the Lord of Hoſts that dwelleth between the Cherubims.</hi> Now you know the Mercy-ſeat was between the Cherubims, and that which I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour this day is, To ſhew you this name of the Lord of Hoſts written upon the mercy-ſeat between the Cherubims. Although it be dreadfull in it ſelfe, yet all Gods Saints ſhall have it this day preſented to them from the mercie-ſeat: A name as full of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy, as our hearts can deſire. We have already ſeen in this Kingdom the Lord of Hoſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Mercy-ſeat, making this his dreadfull title to be amiable and lovely to us, from thence diſpenſing grace and abundance of mercy in the manifeſtation of this his glorious title. It is comfortable to behold the Lord of Hoſts ſitting upon his Mercy-ſeat: and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95477:7"/>
thus am I to preſent him this day unto you.</p>
            <p>Now God is called <hi>The Lord of Hoſts</hi> in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects <note place="margin">Why God is called <hi>The Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
               </note>:</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe all creatures in heaven and in earth are his armies. He is the abſolute great Lord over <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> them all; The Angels, Sunne, Moon, Stars, the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, the Deeps, the Fire, Haile, Snow, Wind, the Mountains, Trees, Cedars, the Beaſts, and all creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, the flying Fowles, the Kings of the earth, and all people are the Hoſts of the Lord. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in regard of that ſpeciall providence of God in the great affaires of wars and battels in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> world. It is true, the providence of God is over the leaſt things in the world, but God challengeth a more ſpeciall and peculiar ackowledgment of his work of Providence about War-like affaires, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof he takes this title to himſelfe, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I ſhould ſpeak of the firſt, the time would ſoon be gone, for there is much in it, it is more generall: therefore I will confine my ſelfe to the ſecond, the more ſpeciall, and now moſt ſeaſonable.</p>
            <p>God is the God of Armies. That he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe himſelfe the more clearly, and fully intereſted in War-like affaires, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 3. he ſtyles himſelfe <hi>A man of War.</hi> God ſeemes to glory much in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings about War-like affaires. Hence <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 8. <hi>Who is the King of glory? The Lord ſtrong, mighty, the Lord mighty in battell.</hi> The Providence of God is great in all wars, but eſpecially in thoſe wars that concerne his people, whether in a way of chaſtiſing them, or defenſive to ſave them, or offenſive in avenging
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95477:8"/>
himſelfe upon their enemies.</p>
            <p>I doe not know any one thing wherein the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence <note place="margin">Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Warre.</note> of God is more fully ſet out in Scripture, then in the workings of it about Wars, as in theſe many particulars will be fully preſented to you:</p>
            <p>Firſt, God works in the raiſing of Warres, when and how he pleaſeth. He is the great Generall, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all battels are appointed by him. He calls for them before they come; and when he calls, they certainly come upon a people. <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. 29. <hi>Behold I begin to bring evill upon the City which is called by my name, &amp;c. for I will call for a ſword.</hi> God doth not onely call for a ſword upon the heathen, but upon the Cities called by his name. Certainly there is as much of God in this City, as in any City this day in the World; yet God may call for a ſword upon you, be not you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; Yea doe you not heare God now calling for it upon you? <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. 26. <hi>God will hiſſe for the Nations from the ends of the earth, and behold they ſhall come with ſpeede ſwiftly.</hi> And <hi>Eſay</hi> 7. 18. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe in that day, that the Lord ſhall hiſſe for the Fly that is in the uttermoſt part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the Bee that is in the Land of Aſſyria, and they ſhall come.</hi> Let God but give a hiſſe, the leaſt intimation of his mind, and they ſhall come. It was a proud ſpeech of <hi>Pompey,</hi> when <note place="margin">Plutarch. vita ejus.</note> one of his Officers told him they wanted men, Let me (ſayes he) but ſtampe with my foote upon the ground of <hi>Italy,</hi> and I ſhall have men enough, Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Horſemen come from every corner. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was a proud ſpeech in him, and when it came to he was diſappointed, yet it is alwayes true of this <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> let him but ſpeak the leaſt word, doe the leaſt thing to gather Armies, they preſently
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95477:8"/>
come together, to fight his battels: when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he can ſtir up the hearts of the <hi>Kings of the earth to hate the whore, to make war with her, Rev.</hi> 17. 16. <hi>The ten Kings ſhall hate the whore, and make her deſolate and naked; they ſhall eate her fleſh, and burne her with fire.</hi> It is a wonder that they ſtay all this while, that they riſe not with a ſpirit of indignation againſt her, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what baſe bondage they are in under her. It is ſuch a bondage, wherein both ſoule, and body, and eſtate is in ſuch a ſervile ſubjection to her, as one would think the ſpirit of a <hi>man</hi> could not beare it, much leſſe the ſpirit of a <hi>King.</hi> But when Gods time is come, the ſpirits of <hi>the Kings of the earth</hi> ſhall be ſuddenly raiſed <hi>to war againſt her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is an obſervation of <hi>Abulenſis</hi> upon 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 14. 8. that Gods providence was very obſervable towards <hi>David,</hi> that he ſhould have no wars raiſed againſt him by the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> thoſe ſeven yeers he was in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron,</hi> which time he was but weak, being King onely over the houſe of <hi>Judah;</hi> but when all <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to him, and he was eſtabliſhed King over them all, then came the Philiſtims againſt him: So doe wee not ſee the mighty providence of God towards us, that he did not call for the ſword againſt us all this time till now, untill we had a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that made indiſſoluble but by their owne conſent, untill our <hi>Militia</hi> in the Kingdome was well-nigh ſetled, until we had an Army to reſiſt? If God had called for the ſword before theſe things, what had become of us? Oh the mercifull providence of God towards <hi>England</hi> in this thing! God is much ſeen in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations to wars, conſultations about them, encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mens hearts to them, taking them off from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95477:9"/>
peace, &amp;c. It was from the Lord that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart was ſo hardned againſt the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to goe forth to battel againſt them, <hi>becauſe God had a purpoſe to deſtroy him.</hi> It was of God that <hi>Rehoboam</hi> was ſo ſet to hearken to the counſel of young <hi>Cavalliers,</hi> and to harden his heart againſt his wiſe Counſellors, that God might rend ten Tribes from him. It was of God that <hi>Ahab</hi> ſhould be ſo ſet to goe to war againſt <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth Gilead,</hi> that he might be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Lord ſets up his <hi>Standard</hi> in Warre: Thus he expreſſeth himſelfe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. 26. <hi>He will lift</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>up an Enſigne to the Nations.</hi> Whoſoever is the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard-bearer, it is God himſelfe that ſets up the Standard.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is God that <hi>muſters</hi> up the Army, <hi>Eſay</hi> 13. 4. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts</hi> muſtereth the Hoſt of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts</hi> is himſelfe the <hi>Muſter-maſter</hi> in Armies. He thus condeſcends in his expreſſions, that he might the more particularly, and ſo the more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew the workings of his Providence in Military affaires.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Lord brings forth <hi>weapons</hi> out of his Armory, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 25. <hi>The Lord hath opened his Armory,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
               <hi>and brought forth the weapons of his indignation, for this is the work of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> God hath his Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine, his Armory that he opens in times of Warre: From whenceſoever Armes come, from beyond Sea or elſe where, not one Peece can come but out of Gods Magazine. If God did not open his Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, neither we nor our enemies could have Arms.</p>
            <p>There was a time when God ſhut up his Armory from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and then <hi>there was neither ſword nor ſpeare found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95477:9"/>
               <hi>and Jonathan, onely with Saul and Jonathan there was found.</hi> 1 Sam. 13. 22.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, It is the Lord that gives his people their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
               <hi>Banners</hi> to diſplay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60. 4. <hi>Thou haſt given a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to them that fear thee, that it may be diſplayed becauſe of the truth.</hi> There are a generation of men that fight againſt the truth, they would take away the Goſpel from them, and becauſe of this <hi>thou haſt given them Banners that they may be diſpayed,</hi> becauſe <hi>of this truth;</hi> God would have us contend for the <hi>truth,</hi> Jude 1. 3. Yea <hi>earneſtly contend,</hi> fight for it, if that comes in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> if we be in danger to loſe <hi>that,</hi> God gives us our Banners, not to be folden up, but to be <hi>diſplayed</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the truth.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, God himſelfe comes into the field with his people, he tels them often that he is with them there. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 
               <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 4. <hi>The Lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight.</hi> When God ſayes, <hi>I am with you,</hi> you may write down what you will to make up this promiſe a compleat one for your ſafety and comfort; As thus, <hi>I am with you</hi> to aſſiſt you, <hi>I am with you</hi> to direct you, <hi>I am with you</hi> to encourage you, to bleſſe, to ſave you, to comfort you, to reward you, &amp;c. <hi>I am with you,</hi> ſaies God. This is as it were a piece of a line that our faith muſt make up; If we once have this promiſe got into our hearts, whatſoever we want, we may adde to it, and then our peace and joy may be full.</p>
            <p>We reade, <hi>Judges</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Barak</hi> would not goe into the field, except <hi>Deborah</hi> would goe with him. It is ill going into the field, except God goe with you; but if you have this promiſe in your hearts, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but have ſtrength in your hands. <hi>Zac.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>They ſhall be as mighty men which tread downe their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:95477:10"/>
               <hi>as mire in the ſtreets, in the battell, and they ſhall fight, becauſe the Lord is with them, and the riders on horſes ſhall be confounded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. God is not onely with his people in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> fight, but he goes before them, as their Captain to lead them. That one place will ſuffice for all, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaw a man <hi>with his ſword drawn in his hand, and Joſhua went to him, and ſaid, Art thou for us, or for our adverſaries? And he ſaid, Nay, but a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the hoſt of the Lord am I now come.</hi> It is apparent this was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for <hi>Joſhua fell on his face, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and ſaid, What ſaith my Lord unto his ſervant? And the Captaine of the Lords Hoſt ſaid unto Joſhua, Looſe thy ſhoes from off thy feet, for the place where thou ſtandeſt is holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. God condeſcends lower, even to be the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 
               <hi>Trumpeter</hi> in the wars of his people. It is accounted too mean a work for a <hi>Generall</hi> to blow the Trumpet to his Armie; but this great Generall, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> that he might encourage his people the more in his battels, he blows the Trumpet himſelfe to them, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>And the Lord ſhall blow the trumpet, and ſhall goe with the whirle-winds of the South.</hi> Why of the South? Thoſe winds are hotteſt, and therefore ſwifteſt. <hi>If ye ſee the South-wind, ye ſay it will be hot,</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>and ſo it commeth to paſſe, Luk.</hi> 12. 54, 55. If we think <hi>our</hi> General follows too ſlowly, <hi>this</hi> great General, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> follows ſwiftly enough. In the words before, <hi>The arrowes of the Lord</hi> are ſaid to <hi>goe forth like lightning.</hi> Swiftneſſe in an Army is of great conſequence, it hath been a ſpecial advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to our adverſaries. We doe little, except in this we equall them.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:95477:10"/>
9. God is the <hi>Rereward</hi> of his people in times of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 12. <hi>Ye ſhall not go out with haſte, nor by ſlight:</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 
               <hi>for the Lord will goe before you: and the God of Iſrael</hi> will be <hi>your Rereward.</hi> Not the <hi>Reward,</hi> but <hi>Rereward,</hi> the guard &amp; defence behind. When an Army is ſtrong in the Rereward as wel as in the Front, it is ſafe, God is both before and behind in the Armies of his people.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Gods providence in Wars works in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of them. How long they ſhall abide in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Land, and when they ſhall ceaſe, is wholly from the appointment of the Lord of Hoſts. He workes in the upholding parties, bringing in ſupplyes, breaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder treaties, &amp;c. We are ready preſently to cry out, <hi>How long ſhall the ſword devour?</hi> but when God gives Commiſſion to the ſword, it muſt ſtay; it muſt goe on devouring till the Commiſſion be out. <hi>Jer.</hi> 47. 6, 7. <hi>Oh thou ſword of the Lord, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thy ſelf into the ſcabbard, reſt and be ſtill.</hi> The anſwer is there, <hi>How can it be quiet, ſeeing the Lord hath given it a charge againſt Askelon, &amp; againſt the ſea ſhore? there hath he appointed it.</hi> Hoſ. 11. 6. <hi>The ſword ſhall abide on his cities, and conſume his branches, and ſhall devour them, becauſe of their own counſels.</hi> We are troubled at the ſword comming <hi>neare</hi> our Cities; but how ſore would the miſery be, if it ſhould come <hi>into</hi> our Cities? but if abide in our Cities, what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſpoile and ruine would there be? If wee would be delivered from ſo great an evill, let us take heed of our own counſels: If God leaves Parliament or City to their own counſels, the ſword will abide amongſt us longer time then we for the preſent ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, even until it hath devoured. God uſually is a long time before he draws his ſword; he is whetting,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95477:11"/>
preparing, delaying it; but when it is once drawn, he many times will not put it up again, untill it bee ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, filled, fatted, ſatiated, drunke with blood. All theſe expreſſions we finde in Scripture. <hi>Eſay</hi> 34. 5, 6. <hi>My ſword ſhall be bathed in heaven, it ſhall come downe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Idumea, upon the people of my curſe.</hi> When Gods ſword hath to deale with the people of his <hi>curſe,</hi> then it ſhall be bathed indeede; And ſurely God hath a people of his curſe amongſt us this day; who they are, is eaſie to know: You may know them to bee curſed of God by the horrid blaſphemies, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous, unheard-of curſes that come out of their mouthes. The earth was never ſtained with ſuch dreadfull execrations and blaſphemies ſince man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the face of it, as now it is by theſe men. Surely the brand of Gods curſe is upon them, feare them not. <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. it is ſaid, <hi>The ſword of the Lord is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with blood, it is made fat with fatneſſe:</hi> and <hi>Jer.</hi> 46. 10. <hi>The ſword ſhall devoure, it ſhall be ſatiate and drunke with their blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when God is pleaſed to give the word, hee <note place="margin">God ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth wars.</note> makes wars to ceaſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 9. <hi>He makes wars to ceaſe unto the end of the earth, he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the ſpeare in ſunder, he burneth the chariot in fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of Gods worke in ſtilling wars, we have a moſt admirable example, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 21. we have not the like in all the Booke of God, neither was there ever the like before or ſince in the world. King <hi>Rehoboam</hi> was incenſed againſt the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> falling off from him, he was in as great a heat and rage againſt them as we can imagine a man could be put into. This fire of his rage was blowne up to the height by thoſe young daring <hi>Cavaliers</hi> that were about him, he had
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95477:11"/>
got an Army together, ſtrong enough, an hundred and foureſcore thouſand men, a mighty force, and it was but to bring the Kingdome to the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi> Well, their power was great, their rage was fierce, their cauſe they queſtioned not, they were going forth with a high hand, with cruel and bloody intentions. How was all ſtilled now? You ſhall find, that <hi>The word of the Lord came to Shemaiah the Prophet, ſaying, Speak to Rehoboam,—Thus ſaith the Lord, Ye ſhall not goe up to fight againſt your brethren, returne every man to his houſe.</hi> The Text ſayes, <hi>They hearkned to the word of the Lord, and returned to depart, according to the word of the Lord.</hi> What a mighty work of God was this? what power hath God over the ſpirits of men, yea of the greateſt, who think it an unſufferable diſhonor to be controlled in any thing they have ſet their hearts upon?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> a wicked man, in the heighth of his pride and wrath, thus ſtrong, apprehending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe exceedingly wronged, ſo much of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome rent from him, and there comes onely a poore Prophet and ſpeakes to him in the name of <hi>This Lord of Hoſts,</hi> that <hi>hee ſhould not fight againſt his brethren,</hi> and all is ſtayed, he returnes back again, and ſits down quiet.</p>
            <p>Oh that now ſome Prophet of the Lord might have acceſſe to His Majeſty, and tell him that hee muſt not goe this way he doth, that he is drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide by evill men about him, that there is a miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding betweene him and his people, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done by us but according to the minde of God, that we doe not endeavour to deprive him of any lawfull power he hath given him by God or

Now you ſee what the Scripture ſaith about Gods providence in battel. You have the ſumme preſented here together, in which is a full and ſtrong encouragement to thoſe who fight the battels of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now if the Queſtion be asked, Why doth the <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Lord thus work in Armies?</p>
            <p>The Anſwer is, 1. Becauſe the lives of men are <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> precious to him. In them multitudes of creatures <note place="margin">Why the Lord doth work in Armies.</note> are caſt for their eternall eſtates. If not a ſparrow, not a haire from the head falls to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out providence, much leſſe the life of a creature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> appointed for eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe of the great things of conſequence that depend upon War: the mighty turnes of Nations, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and changes of Kingdoms depend upon them.</p>
            <p>But how comes it to paſſe, ſeeing God is thus <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> that yet the adverſaries of Gods <note place="margin">Ob.</note> people doe often prevaile in battel?</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is for the chaſtiſement of his people. <hi>Aſhur</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> is made ſometimes the rod of Gods anger. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 7. <note place="margin">Why the adverſary often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes.</note> 
               <hi>I have given the dearly beloved of my ſoule into the hands of her enemies.</hi> She is the dearly beloved of Gods ſoule, yet ſhe is given into the hands of her enemies. We muſt not judge by the preſent prevailing, that God loves thoſe who have the day, and hath reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe who ſeeme to have the worſt. God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for chaſtiſement, brings the worſt of men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 24. <hi>I will bring the worſt of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and they ſhall poſſeſſe their houſes.</hi> The Lord hath raiſed up againſt us many that are the worſt, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt upon the face of the earth, and they have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the houſes of many of his Saints, the dearly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95477:15"/>
beloved of Gods ſoule. We uſe to take the vileſt, the worſt of men to be Hangmen; the worſt rags and clouts to ſcoure withall. It is an argument that we are very foule, that God hath choſen ſuch wiſps and clots to ſcoure us with.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God ſuffers this, becauſe his people are not humbled throughly. The want of through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> humiliation before God, coſt the lives of forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, <hi>Iudges</hi> 20. although in that battel they had a good cauſe. A good cauſe is not enough for ſafety in time of battel; there muſt be humiliation before this great God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the adverſary may prevaile, becauſe the Saints doe not awaken the Lord of Hoſts by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Prayer. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59. 9. <hi>Thou therefore O Lord God of Hoſts the God of Iſrael, awake to viſit all the heathen, be not mercifull to wicked tranſgreſſors. Eſay</hi> 51. 9. <hi>Awake, awake, put on ſtrength, O arme of the Lord, awake as in the ancient dayes, as in the generations of old. Art not thou he that haſt cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?</hi> We have here in one verſe three times crying to God to <hi>awake.</hi> God hath ſtrength enough to help his people. There is an <hi>Arme of the Lord,</hi> but yet this Arme of the Lord may be for a time as it were aſleep, therefore the <hi>Church</hi> cryes, <hi>Awake O Arme of the Lord:</hi> And that ſhee may be ſure the Lord ſhould heare, ſhe cries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, <hi>Awake, awake, O arme of the Lord, put on ſtrength.</hi> We are now to look back to former times, to ſee how God hath manifeſted himſelf <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and to cry to him, that now in our dayes hee would ſhew forth the glory of this glorious title of his, as he hath done in the generations of old.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, God hath many ſecret paſſages of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95477:16"/>
to be brought about, which in after times we come to ſee clearely, but for a time are hidden, and therefore the adverſary is ſuffered to prevaile. The 46. <hi>Pſalme</hi> ſpeakes much about the fury of the adverſary, and of this Title of the Lord; and the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of that Pſalme is, <hi>A ſong upon Alamoth,</hi> which word ſignifies <hi>ſecrets,</hi> becauſe of the hidden counſailes of <note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> who is holy, will delight to be amongſt them that are godly, to bleſſe them in their way. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 9. <hi>When the Hoſt goeth forth againſt the enemy,</hi> then <hi>keep thee from every wicked thing,</hi> yea they muſt keep from outward bodily uncleanneſſe, they muſt carry a paddle with them to cover it, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. the reaſon is there given, <hi>For the Lord thy God walketh in the middeſt of thy Campe, therefore ſhall thy Campe be holy, that he ſee no uncleane thing in thee, and turne away from thee.</hi> It is true, God lookes more at the cauſe then at the inſtrument; yet he rejoyceth moſt to uſe inſtruments that are fitted to give him the praiſe of his worke.</p>
            <p>One day the Lord will convince the world, that the ſtrength of Nations and Kingdomes conſiſt in the intereſt that the godly have in this <hi>Lord of Hoſts.

Who hath the burden of the great worke in this State layne upon but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious party? hath it not beene publiſhed in your

               <hi>City</hi> by chiefe men in the Army, that the great things in the Army were done by thoſe that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Round-heads?</hi> We hope our Governours will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day be more and more convinced that their ſtrength is in theſe. <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 14. <hi>Hee is the Lord of Hoſts, the King of Kings,</hi> and they <hi>that are with him are</hi> called, <hi>and</hi> choſen, <hi>and</hi> faithfull, <hi>and</hi> therefore it is ſaid <hi>the Lamb ſhall overcome:</hi> They are not ſuch as are <hi>called</hi> faithfull, but ſuch as are called and <hi>faithfull:</hi> There was one in our Army whoſe name was <hi>Faithfull</hi> that turned head againſt us, but theſe that are with <hi>the Lamb are called and faithfull.</hi> It is a bleſſed thing for a Kingdome when their Army may be ſaid to be as it was ſaid of that Army, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 13. <hi>a heavenly Hoſt.</hi> This great Lord of Hoſts, who is the God of Heaven will certainly doe great things by ſuch an Hoſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If God be the Lord of Hoſts, if this be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> one of Gods glorious titles, then the worke of a <note place="margin">An honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to bee a Souldier.</note> ſouldier is an honourable imployment.

expreſſes a ſouldier and a Knight by the ſame word, <hi>Miles.</hi> The ſerving under this or that Captaine, they expreſſed by this phraſe, <hi>Mereri ſub hoc vel illo duce.</hi> Hence, <hi>miles emeritus,</hi> for an old ſouldier that was to take his eaſe. In any lawfull ſervice, you ſerve under <hi>The Lord of Hoſts;</hi> but the more the ſervice concerns his glory and the good of his Saints, the more will God own it. The very Chronicles or Records of the wars of the Church, the Lord is pleaſed to have ſtyled, <hi>The Booke of the wars of the Lord, Numbers</hi> 21. 14. The Name of the Lord is exceedingly much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in theſe wars. You young ones, who are willing to offer and venture your ſelves in this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, you honour your ſelves betimes; yea, God and his people doe and will honour you; God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the kindneſſe of your youth. You tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted mothers, bee not unwilling to give up your children, the fruit of your wombes to this ſervice, but bleſſe God that ever ye bare any in your wombes to be of that uſe, to ſtand up for God and his people, as your children have an opportunity now to doe: If (as you heard) when God hiſſed for the fly and for the bee they came, much more doe you come when God calls, and that aloud, to <hi>come</hi> and <hi>help him againſt the mighty.</hi>

            <p>And when you are in the ſervice, ſeeing it is ſo <note place="margin">Cowardiſe branded with infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> honourable, take heed you ſtain it not as others have done, of whom it may be ſaid as it was of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Ephraim, Pſal.</hi> 78. 9. <hi>The children of Ephraim being armed turned back in the day of battel, They kept not the covenant of God.</hi> The covenant of a ſouldier is the Covenant of God. Hence the oath that a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier took when he came to his Captain, the Romans
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95477:18"/>
called <hi>Sacramentum.</hi> A brand of diſhonour was upon <hi>Ephraim, Judges</hi> 12. 4. <hi>Yee fugitives of Ephraim.</hi> Let not ſuch a Brand be upon any of you, ye Fugitives of ſuch a county, of ſuch a town; your General the Lord of Hoſts is worthy of all you can poſſibly do for him. <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells of <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> ſhewing a friend of his three hundred of his ſouldiers exerciſing their Armes neare the Sea where there was a high tower, <hi>There is never a one of all theſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but if I bid him climbe up that ſteepe tower, and from the top of it caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down into the ſea, but he will readily do it.</hi> What, will not you be ready to ſhew more reſpect to your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral this <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> then any heathen ſhall do to a <hi>Heathen</hi> General? be willing to venture your lives for him; this is your glory, for he accounts it his.</p>
            <p>If in this cauſe you ſhould turn your backes upon your enemies, with what face could you ever after look upon your friends? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 6. <hi>Let not them that waite for thee O Lord of Hoſts, be aſhamed for my ſake.</hi> Take this Text with you into the Army, and pray to God, <hi>O Lord grant that I may ſo behave my ſelfe in this great buſineſſe I have undertaken, that none of thoſe that waite on the Lord, that have prayed for, and now wayte for the ſalvation of God, may be aſhamed for my ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have read of one <hi>Abaga</hi> a <hi>Tartarian,</hi> that had this device to make cowards valiant, he cauſed them that ran away from the battell ever after to weare wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens clothes; I do not ſay that there ſhould be this brand of diſhonour, but one brand or other it is fit ſhould be upon ſuch as baſely forſake ſuch an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable worke, ſuch an honourable cauſe as this is.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If God be <hi>the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> hence there is no war to be undertaken but for God and according <note place="margin">

to Gods will, it muſt bee by commiſſion from this great General. To goe into the field without him is dangerous, but to go againſt him is deſperate. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 20. 5. <hi>In the Name of the Lord will we ſet up our banners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any ſhall ſay, We are afraid we goe not by <note place="margin">Ob.</note> the Commiſſion of <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> becauſe we goe againſt the <hi>King:</hi> Doth God give Commiſſion for Subjects to fight againſt the <hi>King?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer, The ſound of theſe words in the eares <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> of men, oh what an efficacie have they! But when they are examined and applyed to this buſineſſe, the truth is, there is nothing at all in them to any man that will be rationall.</p>
            <p>For firſt, It is not againſt the King, it is defenſive onely, to defend our lawfull liberties, our eſtates, which we inherit as truly as the King inherits any thing he hath. It is to defend our Religion, which is our chiefe inheritance. The law of Nature and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth us to defend our ſelves from violence and wrong.</p>
            <p>God hath not put man, and whole Kingdoms into a worſe condition then brute creatures, and yet they by an inſtinct of nature defend themſelves againſt man that vvould hurt them: and yet they vvere made for man; but Kingdoms vvere not made for Kings, but Kings rather for Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>And the Scripture warrants this, you know <hi>David</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 23. 13.</note> gathered 600. ſouldiers together to defend himſelfe againſt any injury <hi>Saul</hi> intended and indeavoured againſt him. And when the children of <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> came to him to the hold, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 16, 17, 18. The ſpirit came upon <hi>Amaſai,</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>Peace be to thee, and peace be unto thy helpers, for thy God helpeth</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95477:19"/>
thee. What <hi>David</hi> did in this kind was no other but what God helped him in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not <hi>againſt</hi> the King, but <hi>for</hi> the King; it is for the preſervation of true Regall power in the King and his poſteritie; it is to reſcue him out of the hands of evil men, who are his greateſt enemies. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bids, that <hi>the wicked ſhould be taken from the throne of the King;</hi> Who ſhould take them away? if he had a mind to doe it himſelfe, he need not ſuffer them to come to his throne; but when he does ſuffer them to come there and abide there, yet they <hi>muſt be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> if a Repreſentative kingdome hath not power to take them away, who hath?</p>
            <p n="3">3. That which is done is not done againſt the power of the King; His power is that which the lawes of the land inveſts him withall. The Scripture bids us <hi>be ſubject to the higher powers, Rom.</hi> 13. 1. It doth not bid us to be ſubject to the <hi>wills</hi> of thoſe who are in higheſt place. If we be either actively or paſſively <hi>ſubject</hi> to the Lawes of that country wherein we live, we fulfill the very letter of that <hi>Scripture</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to be <hi>ſubject to the higheſt powers.</hi> Wherefore that which is now done, is not againſt the King; though it be againſt the <hi>perſonal command</hi> of the King, yet it is not againſt the <hi>Legall power</hi> of the King; when we ſpeak of a King, we mean ſuch a man inveſted with a Regal power by the lawes &amp; conſtitutions of that country he is the King of. Now if nothing be done againſt this power that the laws and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our country inveſts him with, then nothing can be ſaid to be done againſt the King. People are much miſtaken who do not diſtinguiſh between a man in authority and the authority of that man. A
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95477:19"/>
man in authority may command what authority does not command.</p>
            <p>But may we go againſt the command of the King? <note place="margin">Ob.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is not againſt his authorative command. Many, <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> if not moſt men miſtake in this, they think the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative commands of the King chiefly conſiſt in his perſonall verbal commands, but the truth is, his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is in his commands by his officers Seals, and Courts of Juſtice; we may appeale from his perſonal verball command, to his command in his Courts of Juſtice, &amp; whatſoever is his command in one Court of Juſtice, may be appealed from to a ſuperior Court, and ſo to the higheſt, and there we muſt reſt.</p>
            <p>But the King ſayes, That this which is done, is <note place="margin">Ob.</note> done againſt Law.</p>
            <p>If when the moſt inferior Court of Juſtice deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> any thing to be Law, it is not the Kings perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall diſſent, and ſaying it is not Law that diſanuls it, but the judgement of ſome ſuperior Court; then if the higheſt Court in the Land, which is the Parliament, ſhall judge a thing to be Law, ſurely the perſonall diſſent of the King, and ſaying it is not Law, cannot diſanul it.</p>
            <p>But although the Parliament tels us that what <note place="margin">Ob.</note> they doe is Law, yet they doe not ſhew where that Law is; where ſhall we finde it extant?</p>
            <p>We are to know that our Common-wealth is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> not onely by Statute Law, but by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law; now this Common Law is nothing elſe but <hi>recta ratio,</hi> right reaſon, ſo adjudged by Judges appointed thereunto by Law, and this is various according as caſes doe occur; ſo that although ſome preſidents, ſome generall maximes of this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95477:20"/>
Law be extant, yet if new caſes ariſe, then there muſt bee determination according to the nature of ſuch a new caſe, which determination by ſuch as are appointed Judges is now Law, although it were no where written before. And certainly we have now ſuch things faln out, as no former time can ſhew preſidents of: As, That a King ſhould goe from his Parliament, ſo as ours doth: That a King ſhould take up Arms, as now he doth; with many other things of conſequence, of a high nature, which our Houſes of Parl. in their Declarations publiſh, which our eares tingle to hear of, and our hearts tremble at the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of. Theſe things were never heard of ſince <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was a Kingdom, therefore we can expect no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents of what determinations there can be in theſe caſes; and ſome determinations of neceſſity we muſt have, or elſe wee ſhall run to confuſion.</p>
            <p>The determination then of the higheſt Court of Juſtice in the Kingdome, wee muſt account Law in this caſe. This is the way of determining Caſes that fall out in the Common Law.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the determination muſt not be againſt any Statute Law, and ſo is the determination of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now, there is no Statute Law againſt it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it muſt be according to ſome generall Maximes of that Law. Now this is one great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime of it, <hi>Salus populi ſuprema Lex,</hi> The ſafety of the people is the ſupreame Law: and according to this their determination is.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when any inferior Judge makes this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination againſt any party that thinks himſelfe wronged, he makes his Appeale to the Kings Bench: If at the Kings Bench that be judged Law againſt a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95477:20"/>
man, which he thinks is not right, then he hath a Writ of Appeale <hi>ad proximum Parliamentum,</hi> to the next Parliament; ſo that it is apparent by the frame of Government in our Kingdom, that the Parliament is ſupreame Judge of what is <hi>Recta ratio,</hi> Right reaſon in caſes of difficulty and controverſie; and this not being againſt any former Statute Law, &amp; agreeable to the received Maximes of Common Law, it is to be accounted Law, although we finde not that Caſe, or that Determination written in any Book before.</p>
            <p>This is needefull for the ſatisfying mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that things are carried according to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government of our Kingdom, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this we do not ſin againſt Authority. If mens conſciences be not ſatisfied in theſe things, what ſhal they do? Now therefore becauſe that which is urged upon mens conſciences is the authority of man, that we muſt obey, we can never ſatisfie our conſciences untill we know what this authority of man is; &amp; that we cannot know but by the Law of the Kingdom. It is neceſſary therefore that men underſtand what kind of government they live under, that they may know when they offend againſt Authority, and when not; that they may not be deluded, and brought into ſnares, and things of dangerous conſequence, meerly by the name of Authority.</p>
            <p>But yet it may further be ſaid, Grant the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be the Judge, how can it judge without the <note place="margin">Ob.</note> King? For the Parliament conſiſts of three Eſtates, the Houſe of Commons, the Houſe of Lords, and the King: How can that then be ſaid to be the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Parliament, which is not the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the King?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:95477:21"/>
It is true, for the making any Statute, the paſſing <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> any thing by way of Bill, all the three Eſtates of the Kingdome are required to joyne: but for the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of what is Law, that may be done by both the Houſes, in the abſence of, or without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the King, as uſually it is: In caſes that are brought before them in the puniſhment of Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, they doe not ſend to the King for his aſſent to joyne with them in their determinations, but in thoſe proceed as a Court of Juſtice themſelves.</p>
            <p>But what if authority be abuſed, may we reſiſt? Is <note place="margin">Ob.</note> not paſſive obedience required, if active cannot be given?</p>
            <p>There is a great deale of difference between the <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> commands that are from abuſed authority, and the commands that are from the wils of men in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but not from the authority of thoſe men. That is abuſed authority, when thoſe to whom power of making Laws belongs, ſhall make evill Laws; in this caſe there is no help, but paſſive obedience, or flying, untill ſome way may be taken for rectifying that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that is abuſed. But when men that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority command any thing out of their owne <hi>wils,</hi> which is no Law, it is not Authority that doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it; in this caſe there is no reſiſting of Authority at all, although the thing be denyed that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; in ſuch a caſe if we neither yeeld active nor paſſive obedience, we cannot be ſaid therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt authority: For as <hi>Samſon</hi> ſaid in another caſe, <hi>If you doe thus and thus unto me, I ſhall be but as another man:</hi> ſo if theſe men who are in place of authority, do ſuch things as the Laws and Government of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey will not bear them out in, they are but as other
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95477:21"/>
men; yet ſome reverence ought to be ſhewed to their perſons, both in words and actions, in regard of their place.</p>
            <p>What ſay you to the Kings of <hi>Judah?</hi> Many of <note place="margin">Ob.</note> them did otherwiſe then they ought, and yet we doe not reade they were reſiſted, but obeyed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In a defenſive way they were reſiſted, as appears by what was ſaid before in the caſe of <hi>David,</hi> gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> up 600. men to defend himſelfe againſt <hi>Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Yea when <hi>Saul</hi> would have killed <hi>Jonathan,</hi> the people reſiſted him, and would not ſuffer him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We reade, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 32. when the King of Iſrael ſent a meſſenger to kill the Prophet, the Prophet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt the Elders of the people, calls the King <hi>the ſon of a murtherer,</hi> and bade that they ſhould ſhut the door againſt the meſſenger, and hold him faſt at the door. The former Tranſlation hath it, <hi>Handle him roughly,</hi> though ſent by the King: Yea the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was following, yet his meſſenger comming with his command muſt be handled roughly. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>You ſhall oppreſſe him,</hi> ſo <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> tranſlates it, <hi>opprimet is, you ſhall uſe great rigour to him.</hi> It is a vaine conceit in people to think that the command of the King is enough to bear out an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in illegall and unjuſt acts, as if every one were bound to obey, if he comes by the command of the King: there is no ſuch thing: if any man doth any thing illegal, although the King bids him, he muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for it as if it were his own act: therefore it is that the Acts of Authority that come from the King, they come by Officers, becauſe the Subject may have ſome to call to account in caſe of injury, not being fit to moleſt the Kings own Perſon for every dammage the Subject ſuffers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:95477:22"/>
Theſe three examples are out of queſtion juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And if we would goe to bare example, we ſhall finde that ten Tribes brake off from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> becauſe he would follow the counſel of his young Cavaliers, to make their yoaks heavie, to <hi>make his little finger heavier then his fathers loynes:</hi> yea and God ſayes it was of him vvhat was done.</p>
            <p>But further, this is no certain rule, that juſt what power the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> had, that and no more ſhould all Kings have; If in ſome things they may have more, then it cannot follow, becauſe they had this or that power, therefore all Kings muſt have the ſame. If their examples be the rule for all Kings power, then their examples muſt as well be to limit the power of Kings, as enlarge it: but Kings would think it much to be limited by their power, therefore they muſt not urge the enlargement from their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer too hard.</p>
            <p>I will inſtance in one thing, wherein the Kings of <hi>England</hi> vvould not vvillingly be limited by their example, namely, The confining of their ſucceſſion to the heire male. The daughters of the Kings of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> did not inherit, onely the males; but the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our Kings do. If this Queſtion be asked, Why in ſome countreyes onely the Male inherits, as in <hi>France;</hi> in others, the females likewiſe, as in <hi>England;</hi> why in ſome Countries the King is elective, as in <hi>Denmark</hi> and others; in others it is hereditary, as with us: The Anſwer will be given, This is from the diverſity of the Laws of Kingdoms. So then it follows not, becauſe ſome Kings in Scripture were thus and thus, therefore all Kings muſt needs be ſo; but according to the diverſity of the Laws of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95477:22"/>
ſo is the diverſity of the power of Kings. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Countrey in the firſt conſtitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath power to divide the Government, ſo much to the King, ſo much to the Nobles, ſo much to the Commons, as they ſhall ſee beſt ſutable to the condition of their Countrey: ſo that we are not to goe by ſuch a rule, what power ſuch and ſuch Kings have had, but what power every King hath in the Countrey where he is King. Civil Government <note place="margin">1 Pet 2. 13 <hi>All civill Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even that of Kings, is called a humane creation, for ſo the words are in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> is left to the wiſdome and juſtice of every Country, in the conſtitution of it: They may confer power upon ſeverall Magiſtrates by ſeverall portions, as ſhal be moſt for the good of that Countrey. That there ſhould be Civil Government, God hath appointed; but that it ſhould be thus or thus, all in one, or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into many, that is left to humane prudence, going according to rules of Juſtice, for the publique good. If the kinds of Civil government were of Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, it muſt be all the ſame in every compleat Common-wealth, which no man that I know wil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. Eccleſiaſtical Government, becauſe it is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and hath a ſpirituall efficacie in it, muſt therefore of neceſſity be of Divine inſtitution, &amp; ſo the ſame in all places in the world where Churches are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pleat. <note place="margin">Ob.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſhal wee ſay to the example of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the Primitive times, who ſuffered ſo much wrong under Tyrants, and would never reſiſt?</p>
            <p>The Civil Government under which they lived was ſuch, as it gave power to thoſe Emperors to doe <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſuch things as they did; the laws of thoſe Countries being againſt them, they could not help themſelves, but it is not ſo with us: The Laws of our Countrey are for us, and we ſeek nothing but to maintain thoſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95477:23"/>
liberties we have by Law; We have legall wayes to help our ſelves, which they had not.</p>
            <p>But above all Objections this ſticks moſt with us, Doth not the Scripture ſtraitly charge us not to <note place="margin">Ob.</note> touch Gods Anointed?</p>
            <p>Firſt, This doth nothing concerne this raiſing of Armes, for it is for defence of our ſelves, not offence <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> againſt Gods Anointed.</p>
            <p>But further, that I may ſatisfie fully, I wil ſay three things to this Objection: Firſt, we will examine the Scripture out of which this Objection is raiſed, and ſee whether there be any ſuch ſenſe in it as is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily taken for granted: Secondly, I ſhall ſhew that <hi>Anointing</hi> is not proper to <hi>Kings,</hi> but belongs to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as well as Kings: Thirdly, I will ſhew the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene that <hi>anointing</hi> that Kings had in time of the <hi>Law,</hi> from that they have <hi>now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, This Scripture is 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 22. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 15. it is the ſame in both places. 1. They both ſpeak of times before ever there had been any Kings of Iſrael. 2. The Anointing here is apparently meant of the people of God, of the Church, of the Saints; God gives here a charge, that none, no not Kings ſhould touch them to doe them any hurt. It is not here meant that people ſhould not touch Kings that are anointed, but that Kings ſhould not touch people that are Gods Anointed. The Church of God being ſeparated from the world to God, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to God, Gods ſanctified ones are here called <hi>Gods anointed:</hi> and that it is meant of people, it is plain if you conſider this Scripture, from the 12. <hi>ver.</hi> to this 15. <hi>ver. When they were but few in number, and ſtrangers in the Land, when they went from one Nation to another,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:95477:23"/>
               <hi>from one Kingdom to another people, he ſuffered no man to doe them wrong, yea, he reproved Kings for their ſakes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Touch not mine Anointed:</hi> To whom did he ſay it? he ſaid it even to Kings: Whom ſhould they not touch? Not them that were few in number, that went from one countrey to another; them for whoſe ſakes Kings were reproved, he ſaid that <hi>theſe</hi> anointed ones muſt not be touched: though the Kings and people of the world thought them to be but ordinary ones, yet God accounts them his <hi>anointed ones,</hi> and will not have them <hi>touched;</hi> but if Kings ſhall meddle with them to doe them any hurt, he will reprove the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for <hi>their</hi> ſakes. You may ſee how God reproved that King <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> for their ſakes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 17. <hi>This Nebuchadnezar hath broken their bones;</hi> obſerve the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>This Nebuchadnezar:</hi> he makes but a <hi>[This]</hi> of <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> a great King, when he comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him for the ſake of his anointed ones: and mark further how the reproofe is, when their inheritance is but touched, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 17. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord againſt all the evill neighbours that touch the inheritance, &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will pluck them out of the Land;</hi> If they do but touch my peoples inheritance, I will pluck them out of the Land. And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 27. all this care of God over his people is laid upon their anointment, <hi>The burden ſhall be taken off their ſhoulder, and the yoake from their neck, and the yoake ſhall be deſtroyed becauſe of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing.</hi> I ſuppoſe now every one that lookes into this Scripture, <hi>Touch not mine anointed,</hi> will ſee that it hath been groſly abuſed, and made to ſpeak ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conceits of men then the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>But for futher ſatisfaction, conſider, it is not pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95477:24"/>
to Kings to be anointed; It is true, they were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed in the time of the Law; but as they were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed, ſo Prieſts were anointed, Prophets were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed, yea other Magiſtrates and Captaines of Gods people are called <hi>the anointed ones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, for Prieſts, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Theſe are the names of the ſons of Aaron the Prieſt that were anointed.</hi> And you know the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> anointed <hi>Eliſha.</hi> And <hi>Zac.</hi> 4. 14. ſpeaking of <hi>Zerubbabel and Joſhua,</hi> the text ſaies, <hi>theſe are the anointed of the Lord:</hi> now then if this mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could be put upon the words, that thoſe which are Gods anointed muſt not be touched, whatſoever they do, then Prieſts and Prophets whatſoever they do, muſt not be touched, for they are as truely Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed, as Kings are: yea Captaines and inferior Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates muſt not be touched, becauſe they are Gods anointed alſo.</p>
            <p>The third thing is the difference between Kings anointing then, as <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and others were, and Kings anointing now. Then God choſe ſuch himſelfe by revealing from Heaven that they ſhould be Kings; it was the immediate choice of God; and then they were upon this, ſubmitted to by the people: but now the people firſt agree that ſuch a one ſhall be King, the Kingly power ſhall be in ſuch a family ſucceſſively, and then God eſtabliſheth this choiſe or agreement. There is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two; Firſt, Gods chuſing, and then the peoples eſtabliſhing; and this, the peoples chuſing, and then Gods eſtabliſhing. There the Kingly power was not conferred by way of compact or covenant, but with us it was, and ſo is with others.</p>
            <p>But what if the Kingdom be got by Conqueſt, &amp; the <note place="margin">Ob.</note> right come in that way?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:95477:24"/>
Thoſe who plead thus for Kings, know not what they do in making this plea: For if there were no <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> other right, neither precedent nor conſequent, but meerly becauſe ſuch a one was the ſtronger and got it, and ſo holds it now, then whoſoever is the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt at any time he hath right, if a ſtronger then he comes he ſhall have the right. This is no good Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity nor Polity to plead thus; that which ſubjects my conſcience to ſuch a one, is the ſubmiſſion upon ſome compact, covenant or agreement.</p>
            <p>This may be when Kings are elective, but what <note place="margin">Ob.</note> will you ſay concerning Kings that are hereditary?</p>
            <p>Kings that inherit, inherit no more then their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> had, and their fathers no more then thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ſo that you muſt come at length to the root, to the firſt who had this Kingly power inveſted upon him; and by whom was he inveſted with this, but by the people? and what ſubjected the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of people to acknowledge this man or this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, more then another man, or another family, but only the agreement that paſſed between this people, and ſuch a man or family?</p>
            <p>But there is yet one Objection more out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <note place="margin">Ob.</note> We reade that <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmote him, but for cutting off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> was Gods Anointed.</p>
            <p>The conſequence that follows from hence is cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, That no private man in his own cauſe, (for ſo was <hi>David</hi> then) by his own power may ſeize upon the perſon of a King in an offenſive way, eſpecially ſuch a King which had his call immediatly from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: what further conſequence that concerns our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines in hand, let any ſhew from this place that can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:95477:25"/>
But is not this a Popiſh tenet, that in caſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <note place="margin">Ob.</note> Subjects may riſe up againſt their King?</p>
            <p>Papiſts hold and practice againſt this, and for this, <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> and beyond this; as they ſee they may ſerve their own turns: in their practiſes eſpecially of late they have laboured to infuſe into people, yea, and into Princes an opinion of their abſolute power, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it for the preſent moſt conducing to their ends, who have preached up that all is the Kings, that his wil is our Law, that whatſoever he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands muſt be obeyed, either by doing or ſuffering. Prelates and prelatical men have infuſed this doctrine, ſo that to queſtion this was dangerous enough, yea not to bee zealous in it was enough to have the brand of an Antimonarchical Puritan. And the reaſon why the Popiſh party labours ſo much to cry up abſolute and arbitrary Government in Kings, is, becauſe their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but few, they hope to gain ſome of them at leaſt to them, and then this abſolute power ſhall be made uſe of for the extirpation of the truth, and upholding Popery: In gaining one King they gaine almoſt the whole Kingdome, if this King may rule by his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power; if once he be a Papiſt, then this abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power is the Popes abſolute power, it is the Prelates abſolute power, for if he uſeth it not as they pleaſe, they can excommunicate him, they can free their Subjects from their allegiance: yea, being by them excommunicated. Marke what follows, it is one of the Canons of Pope <hi>Urbans, We take them not</hi>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95477:25"/>
be full Papiſts, yet if they can by popiſh matches, or by any popiſh party in the Kingdom gain them to be inclinable any way to them, or remiſſe in the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth, they get a great advantage by this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power of the King; the Prelats have upheld their tyrannicall power by infuſing this principle of the abſolute power of Kings into their eares and the cares of the people; but if the Papiſt ſees he hath no hope to gaine the King, or advantage by him, then he turnes his tenets another way, and ſayes that for the promoting of the Catholique cauſe, yea, although Kings do governe by the Laws of their Kingdom, yet becauſe they are againſt the Catholique Religion, Subjects may riſe up againſt their King and kill him. This doctrine of theirs we abhor, wee ſay, that if power be given to Kings by Law, yea, or to other Magiſtrates, though it be againſt Religion, we have no help but ſuffering or flying until we can be helped by a legall way; but if when we have Laws for our Religion and liberty, the King out of his own will, or ſeduced by others, ſhall in an illegal way ſeeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of them, now we may defend our ſelves, and in this we reſiſt not the Kingly authority, but the wil of ſuch a man.</p>
            <p>And yet further, if it be poſſible that we may give ſatisfaction in this thing, the miſtake whereof is ſo exceeding dangerous: conſider, if the taking up Arms to defend Religion and liberties that we have by Law be treaſon or rebellion, then all the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches are traytors and Rebels: Have not the reformed Churches in <hi>Holland,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> done this? Did not Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> take the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers taking up Armes to defend their Religion
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95477:26"/>
and liberty againſt their King into her protection, and aſſiſt them with money, men, Ammunition? King <hi>James</hi> in his anſwer to <hi>Perron</hi> defends the Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> for what they did: He ſayes, <hi>Their civill wars was not taking up Arms againſt their King, it was but ſtanding upon their guard.</hi> And did not our King <hi>Charles</hi> ſend aid to the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> defending their Religion and liberty againſt their King at the Iſle of <hi>Ree?</hi> and is not the Prince of <hi>Aurania,</hi> whom we uſually call the Prince of Orange, the General to the Army of the States, defending themſelves againſt the K. of <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe Countries thoſe once were? Yea, and hath not our King acknowledged our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Scots his loyal Subjects, and yet they did as much as we, yea, a great deale more? they were indeed at firſt called <hi>Traitors</hi> and <hi>Rebels,</hi> in the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers the Prelates ſent about and commanded to bee read in Churches, but upon due conſideration they were found and ſo ſtyled <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>loyal Subjects,</hi> and ſo in time we hope we ſhall.</p>
            <p>But if we ſhall thus plead and ſtand for our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, how can we expect the King ſhould ever look <note place="margin">Ob.</note> upon us with any reſpect, or confide in us? wil it not ſet the Kings heart againſt us?</p>
            <p>God forbid we ſhould do any thing juſtly meriting the loſſe of His Majeſties favour, and his heart confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> in us: The happines of a Kingdom is in Princes ruling as fathers, and Subjects obeying out of love ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then meer neceſſity. K. <hi>James</hi> ſo renowned for learning and deep underſtanding was fully of that minde, that his brother the K. of <hi>France</hi> had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Subjects in his Kingdome then the Proteſtants, which yet ſtood up to defend their liberties by force
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95477:26"/>
of Armes. His words in anſwer to <hi>Perron</hi> are theſe: <hi>I dare promiſe to my ſelfe that my moſt honoured brother the King of France will beare in mind the great and faithfull ſervice of thoſe who in matter of Religion diſſent from His Majeſty, as of the onely men that have preſerved and ſaved the Crown for the King his Father, of moſt glorious memory. I am perſwaded my brother of France will beleeve, that his liege people pretended by the Lord Cardinall to be hereticks, are nor half ſo bad as my Roman Catholike ſubjects, who by ſecret practices undermine my life, ſerve a forraigne Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, are bound (by the Maximes and rules publiſhed and maintained in favour of the Pope, before this full and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous aſſembly of the Eſtates of Paris) to hold me for no lawfull King, are by his Lordſhip there taught and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that</hi> Pauls <hi>commandment concerning ſubjection to the higher powers, adverſe to their profeſſed Religion, is onely a proviſionall precept, framed to the times, and watching for opportunity to ſhake off the yoke.</hi> Surely then it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that His Majeſties heart muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in us, (although ſeeking to maintain our lawfull liberties) rather then in any Papiſts whatſoever. Yea yet further, heare what <hi>K. James</hi> his thoughts were of the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> towards the latter end of his former Anſwer to Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> he hath theſe words, <hi>During the minority of K.</hi> Francis <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the Proteſtants of France were only a refuge &amp; ſuccour to the Princes of bloud, when they were kept from the Kings preſence; and by the over-powring power of their enemies, were no better then plain driven and chaſed from the Court. I meane the Grandfather of the King now raigning, and the Grandfather of the Prince of</hi> Conde, <hi>when they had no place of ſafe retreat beſides in the whole Kingdome. In regard of which worthy and honourable ſervice, it may ſeeme</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:95477:27"/>
               <hi>the French King hath reaſon to hold the Proteſtants in the princely Ark of his gracious remembrance.</hi> (Shall Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants be kept in the Princely Ark of the gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of a Popiſh King, and ſhall Proteſtants be caſt out of the heart of a Proteſtant King, and that onely for defending their lawfull liberties in a juſt way? God forbid.) Yet further, heare the fidelity of Proteſtants to their Prince. <hi>In all the heat of revolts and rebellions raiſed in the greateſt part of the Kingdome by the Pope, and the more part of the Clergie, they ſtood to their King to beare up the Crown when tottering and ready to fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And at this day the King of <hi>France</hi> hath in pay betweene three and foreſcore thouſand Proteſtant Souldiers for the defence of himſelfe and his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, he maintains ſo many yeerly, his chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders being Proteſtants, as confiding eſpecially in Proteſtants for their fidelity; and certainly ſo may our King doe, he ſhould finde none more faithfull to him, and ready to venture their eſtates and lives in defence of him and his Legall power, then the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, and thoſe who adhere to them, and this no queſtion even thoſe about His Majeſty doe beleeve in their hearts, whatſoever they ſay; they otherwiſe would never venture to put His Majeſty upon ſuch wayes as might exaſperate them ſo as they doe. Was it ever knowne when Parliaments have been Papiſts, and the Kingdome Papiſts, that ever any dared ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to put Kings upon ſuch things as might provoke ſuch a Parliament, and the people that then would adhere to them? Certainly other manner of effects would have followed the provocation of them at ſuch times. Why was it that the Laws againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> have been ſo remiſſely followed, and not onely <hi>Law,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:95477:27"/>
but <hi>Will</hi> againſt the <hi>Puritans</hi> have beene ſo hotly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, but this, they were afraid of papiſts that they would doe ſome miſchiefe, but for <hi>Puritans,</hi> they were confident they would not ſtir, they would doe no hurt but beare, and therefore they might doe what they liſt with them, they needed not feare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperating them, they were taught obedience to Governors out of conſcience, and ſo they had them ſure enough; but the principles of the others would not bear too hard uſage, therefore they muſt be more fairely dealt withall. I am confident, if wee could have ſeene into many of their boſomes, we ſhould have found theſe reaſonings in them, It is true, Puritans have beene taught obedience to Authority out of conſcience, and howſoever Princes may bee exaſperated againſt <hi>Puritanicall Preachers,</hi> as they call them, yet they are as much beholding to them as to any people in their Kingdomes for bringing people out of conſcience to obey Authority; whereas others obey only upon neceſſities, &amp; ſo ſerve Princes as they may ſerve themſelves by them, but in their teaching obedience to Authority they never taught obedience out of conſcience to any mens bare wils. How far obedience is due I have ſhewne before.</p>
            <p>Wherefore although honeſt men are ſtill bitterly inveighed againſt by the name of <hi>Browniſts</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries,</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſeldome or never mentioned, yet we cannot thinke but they in their conſciences are perſwaded that they are not the dangerous men for reſiſting authority. How is it poſſible for any man to thinke that a <hi>Browniſt,</hi> who onely differs from us in manner of Church diſcipline, but agrees with us in Doctrine and Civil-Government, yet that he may not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95477:28"/>
be ſuffered to live in a Kingdom, when a <hi>Papiſt</hi> may be embraced in a Boſome? Surely the conſciences of the meaneſt are as dear to them as the conſciences of the greateſt.</p>
            <p>But it is ſaid that a great part of the Army of the <note place="margin">Ob.</note> Parliaments are <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no great feare they can do much hurt, if <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> there be 40. <hi>Papiſts</hi> to oppoſe one <hi>Anabaptiſt;</hi> But ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is an unhappy miſtake to ſay that there is any one <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> in the Army, but a miſtake, like many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For it is one of the tenets that <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintain, that it is unlawfull to take up Armes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any occaſion: and therefore they are never found to weare ſword, nor in their Ships to carry Canons for their own defence.</p>
            <p>But doth not the King profeſſe that he will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Proteſtant Religion, and governe onely <note place="margin">Ob.</note> by the Laws? What need we trouble our ſelves then any farther?</p>
            <p>The Anſwer to the Kings Profeſſions and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> the Parliament hath already given; it is far more fit for them to anſwer, then that any particular ſhould: Onely this thing let me ſay, I put it to every mans conſcience to judge, whether he can think that it is more likely for the King with thoſe Cavaliers that are now about him, and the aid of Papiſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, and called in unto him, to maintain the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and Government by the Laws, then the King, together with his Parl. to maintaine the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and governe by the Laws. Surely we muſt unreaſon our ſelves before we can think ſo.</p>
            <p>But yet further, perhaps ſome may ſay, We doe <note place="margin">Ob.</note> not take that which is done to be done by both
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95477:28"/>
Houſes of Parliament, many of them are gone, but few remaining.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some are gone, but compare thoſe who are <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> gone with thoſe that abide, and you may eaſily ſee which way the ſtream of things would goe, if thoſe that ſtay, and the Kingdome with them, had not hearts to appeare for the maintaining what God and Nature, and the Laws of the Kingdome have made their owne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are not ſo many gone as are pretended; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> if they were the greater part that diſliked the others proceedings, they might come and out-vote them, and carry what they would againſt them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When I heare of ſuch and ſuch men going <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> from the Parliament, who ought to ſtay, it puts me in mind of what I have read of <hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> before he was Pope himſelfe, he was of that judgement that a generall Counſel was above the Pope, and ſome yet wondring why ſo many forſook the Counſel, and would cleave to the Pope, he gave this reaſon, The Pope had Biſhopricks, and Deanaries, and Prebenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp; fat Benefices to beſtow, but the Counſel had no ſuch things; They ſaw which way preferment went, and which way it was like to goe; They have not ſeen Offices and great places of preferment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed by the Parliament.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Suppoſe more were gone then yet are, yet the Kingdome hath a Parliament in being, untill both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Houſes have agreed to diſſolve it; and if ſo, then either thoſe that are gone, or thoſe that remain, are the Parliament; thoſe who are gone, dare not chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it to themſelves, nor none for them. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the Prelats were too bold in nullifying
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95477:29"/>
what was done in Parliament, becauſe they were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Thoſe that ſtay then are the Houſes of Parl. and if their determinations muſt not be valid, becauſe ſome of their Members be gone, then we may cal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to queſtion all determinations of Parl. that ever have been before us; for vvho knows hovv many vvere preſent or abſent vvhen it vvas reſolved upon the Queſtion?</p>
            <p n="5">5. If a Country ſhould chooſe a Repreſentative <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Body to elect a King over them, and the choice being made by that Repreſentative Body, aftervvards the Country ſhould refuſe obedience upon that ſcruple, that many vvere not preſent at that time the choice vvas made, ſome did diſlike it; vvould not the King for all that account it Rebellion in ſuch, vvho upon ſuch ſcruples ſhould caſt off their obedience?</p>
            <p>But even in the Houſes, are not things carryed on <note place="margin">Ob.</note> in a Faction? are they not led by a fevv?</p>
            <p n="1">1. If there be this liberty to object againſt the <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> higheſt Court of Judicature in a Kingdome, vvhen can vve reſt in any determinations that can be in any Civil Polity?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is this but to charge the vvhole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> vvith folly, to chooſe ſome unfaithfull; and the Houſes of Parliament ſimple, that will be led by thoſe that are unfaithfull?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If any thing for the Kings prerogative were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> propounded by ſome, and followed by others, dare any accuſe the proceedings to be factious? Why then, when any thing is propounded by ſome for the good of the Kingdome, and followed by others, ſhould it come under ſuch a cenſure?</p>
            <p n="4">4. There was more danger of faction in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:95477:29"/>
Convocations, where the moſt of the Members were Biſhops and their creatures, in ſervile ſubjection to them. There is no ſuch danger in either Houſes, there is no ſuch diſtance between the Members a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves; there is no ſuch dependance of one upon the other.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Faction cannot bee the act of a body that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon another; but in particular members <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of a body, dividing themſelves from it unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, and turbulently ſeeking to get others to joyne againſt the body. Heretofore the not ſubmitting unto the illegall Canons and Decrees, Injunctions, Orders of every Prelat, yea every paltry Commiſſaries court was accounted ſchiſme and faction; but who is the Schiſmatike, who are the factious men now? Now although there be Ordinances from the higheſt Court of Judicature in a Kingdom, theſe men forget what arguments they were wont to uſe to poore Country men in their Courts to be obedient to Authority, and and what are you wiſer then the Governours of the Church, who preſume to ſhew themſelves wiſer then their Governours now.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall ſay, howſoever thoſe who yeeld not to ordinances of Parl. cannot be accounted Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, becauſe that is a rending from the Church.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Parl. may as truly have the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Church as the Prelats, their Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> Commiſſaries &amp; Officials; will they not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Houſe of parl. to have as much power to govern the Church as they have? ſurely they dare not ſpeak out.

of theirs to make themſelves Gods Clergie, that is, Gods lot or Heritage, thereby diſtinguiſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the people, when as the Scripture makes the people Gods Clergie by way of diſtinction from the Miniſters; but never the Miniſters Gods Clergie by way of diſtinction from the people, as 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Neither as being Lords over Gods heritage;</hi> hee ſpeakes to Miniſters, that they may not Lord <hi>over the Clergie;</hi>

            <p>But are not many, if not moſt of the Houſe of Commons men of meane quality in compariſon, and <note place="margin">Ob.</note> what muſt the great affaires of King and Kingdome be ordered by them?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Would you know why ſo many of the Gentry <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> in moſt Counties throughout the Kingdome are ſo malignant? ſurely it lies in great part in this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they look with an envious eye at the Parliament, becauſe they think themſelves as good men, yea, and far better then many of them there, and why ſhould not they have been choſen in as well as thoſe that are? this pride and envie of theirs makes them ſwel at every thing the Houſe of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons doth; it makes them forget that the liberties of themſelves and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities, together with the whole Commons of the Kingdom are maintained in ſuch a way of choiſe of the Members of that Houſe, howſoever for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it hath not falne upon themſelves; beſides many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had rather inſlave themſelves &amp; their poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to thoſe above them, then not to have their wils
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95477:30"/>
upon thoſe that are under them: they would faine bring it to be with us as it is in <hi>France,</hi> that the Gentry ſhould be under the Nobility and Courtiers, and all the country people, the peſants, bee under them as ſlaves, they live in miſerable bondage under the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey there, who generally are Cavalliers.</p>
            <p>There is no Countrey in the world, where coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men, ſuch as we call the yeomandry, yea, and their Farmers and workmen under them, doe live in that faſhion and freedome as they doe in <hi>England,</hi> in all other places they are ſlaves in compariſon, their lives are ſo miſerable as they are not worth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying, they have no influence at all into the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they are under, nothing to doe in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Laws, or any way conſenting to them, but muſt receive them from others, according to their pleaſure; but in <hi>England</hi> every Free-holder hath an influence into the making and conſenting every Law he is under, and enjoyes his owne with as true a title as the Nobleman enjoyes whatſoever is his. This freedome many of the proud Gentry are vexed at, and hence it is their hearts riſe ſo againſt thoſe that are choſen by them, and againſt their Ordinances. But the Commons begin to diſcerne this more then they have done, and to be ſo wiſe as to hold their own faſter then formerly they have.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whatſoever quality any man is of before he be inveſted with power, ſhould be no prejudice to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> power when once he is inveſted with it. If a Prince ſhould be choſen out of a meane condition, as many have been, muſt not he be obeyed as a Prince, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that, as <hi>Saul, Agathocles,</hi> and others? would it not be accounted an high offence, yea Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95477:31"/>
for any to refuſe obedience to a Prince upon this ground, that when he and that Family was choſen, perhaps neither he nor his family was the fitteſt and ableſt that might have been had? No, we are to reſt in the choice being made. Is not the reaſon the ſame in this, although the degree inferiour? The one is the ſupreme man in authority, the other a Member of the ſupreme Court of Judicature, and regulating all authority.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet further, the honour of the Members of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Houſe of Commons conſiſts much in this; although perſonally ſome of them are not of very high quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet they are repreſentative of whole Shires, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Cities; whereas the Noble-men themſelves are not thus repreſentative; every one is there for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and for the good of the Kingdom, becauſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his eſtate and honour that he is born to, hee hath a deeper ſhare then other men in the good of the kingdome.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Such is the conſtitution of the Government of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> this Kingdom, that the Commons of the Land choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo many to repreſent them, have that power that they may ſo moderate the Government by No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility &amp; Monarchie, that neither of them may grow into a Tyrannie, but govern by Statute Law made by the three Eſtates and the Common Law, judged by Courts of Judicature that Law hath enabled thereunto. And this power, ſeeing they have it by the conſtitution of the Government of this kingdome, &amp; that ſutable to the very law of Nature, both His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and the Nobles do beleeve, ſo far as the Law of God and Nature will give leave, they will maintain with all their might.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:95477:31"/>
But what would the Lords or Commons have? <note place="margin">Ob.</note> hath not the King graciouſly yeelded to them, almoſt in all things they can deſire? why doe they now ſtand out ſo as they doe?</p>
            <p>True, we acknowledge with all humble thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to God and his Majeſtie for what he hath done <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>; &amp; what is for the good of the Kingdom, ſurely is for the good of his Majeſtie too; and if it be ſo worthy an Act of the King to yeeld his royall aſſent to thoſe things that are ſo beneficiall for his Majeſty and the kingdome, then ſurely the Act of Commons &amp; Lords muſt have their due praiſe in preparing ſuch good things firſt, in voting them and preſenting them to his Majeſty, for his Royall aſſent to them.</p>
            <p>But then you ſay, What would they have more? <note place="margin">Ob.</note> what doe they ſtand for more?</p>
            <p>They deſire that, and ſtand for that now, without <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> which all is done is nothing, all that they ſhall doe will be nothing, yea, they themſelves wil be nothing: No marvail therefore, although they and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with them ſtand for that.</p>
            <p>But what is that? <note place="margin">Ob.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is that the defence of the King, Kingdome, and <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> Parliament, from the danger of the plots &amp; attempts of Papiſts, and all Malignants, may be put into the hands of thoſe that they may confide in. To what purpoſe are good Laws made? To what purpoſe is a Parl fitting, if Papiſts, Prelats, Popiſh and Prelatical men, Atheiſts, Delinquents ſo infinitely diſcontent, whom we had cauſe enough to fear that they would endeavour to get power that they might diſanul all, and according to thoſe fears wee ſee what is come to paſſe; if wee may not have the <hi>Militia</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95477:32"/>
that is the onely poſitive Legall way next to that we have from the Law of Nature, to reſiſt ſuch power as would endeavour to undoe all. If a man ſhould be bound to pay me ſuch a debt, and withall to joyn with me to provide ſafe means of conveying both my ſelf and money to ſuch a place, if this man at the day appointed ſhould pay the debt duly to a farthing, but when I tell him of great danger by the way, many lye in wait to ſurpriſe me and my money, and I require of him to joyne with me to afford me ſuch aid as I may goe ſafely, for go I muſt, if he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and will onely conſent to ſuch aid as I not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good grounds have cauſe to ſuſpect to be as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous even as thoſe that lie in wait for me, yea, it may be I can prove that even ſome principal ones of thoſe he would have for my aid &amp; ſafety, are confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and of the ſame company with thoſe that lye in wait for me. Now I demand what advantage is it to me that the debt is paid me, ſuppoſing I muſt go &amp; have no other way to help my ſelf but that which he denies to me? is it not all one to me as if he had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to pay the debt? Doe you think that good words would be enough to you in ſuch a caſe, if hee ſhould ſay, Ile warrant you, you may be ſafe, when I know certainly theſe men are of the company with thoſe who lie in wait for me, &amp; I have other men by, whom I know will be faithfull, and can be no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the other party, and I deſire him that hee would ſuffer thoſe to goe along with me for my ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he refuſeth it?</p>
            <p>But howſoever were it not better to harken to <hi>peace,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ob.</note> if poſſibly there may be wayes of Accommodation?</p>
            <p>Peace is indeed a moſt lovely and deſirable thing <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95477:32"/>
we deſire with our ſoules to live in peace. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe knows, there is nothing that would be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to us, then to ſerve God &amp; the King in waies of peace; God forbid but that we ſhould in all our waies ſhew our ſelves the children of peace. We could make large orations in commendation of peace, as well as others; yea in the midſt of all the clatterings of our Arms, and ſounds of war-like inſtruments, yet peace is in our eyes and hearts: As faithfull Miniſters in all the terrible threats they denounce in the name of God againſt impenitent ſinners, ſeeke the true peace of their ſouls: ſo the true ſouldier who is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God and his Countrey, although he hath the ſword in one hand, and fire in the other, yet it is with this Motto, <hi>Sic quaerimus pacem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For a full Anſwer to this Objection, I ſhal firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer meerly as a Divine out of the Scripture, and then we may conſider what may be ſaid in true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Politic.</p>
            <p>For the firſt. The Scripture tels us, <hi>James</hi> 3. 17. <hi>The wiſdome that is from above, is firſt pure, then peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Such an expreſſion, did it not come from an Apoſtle, would be ſcorned by many profane Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſpirits amongſt us; yea they would accuſe <hi>James</hi> himſelfe, if they dared, for a Puritan, for ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thus. The Scripture frequently joynes <hi>Peace</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſay 38. 9. Heb. 12. 14. Rom. 14. 17. Rom. 1. 7.</note> and <hi>truth, peace</hi> and <hi>holineſſe, peace</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe, grace</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> together: We muſt be ſure ſo to ſeek peace, as we muſt ſeek the God of peace, the Goſpel of peace: That were a fearfull peace that ſhould make war between the God of peace and us, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of the Goſpel of peace. Let us not diſ-joyn or diſorder the Angels Doxologie, <hi>Glory be to God on</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:95477:33"/>
               <hi>high, peace on earth, good will towards men:</hi> So peace on earth, as glory may be to God on high, and the good will, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of this our God towards us. <hi>Placet iſta diſtributio,</hi> ſayes <hi>Bernard,</hi> this diſtribution pleaſeth me wel, that God ſhould have glory, &amp; we have peace. Oh that this Angelical diſtribution of glory &amp; peace might pleaſe us all! The truth is, peace is ſweet, and thoſe which are thought enemies to it, pray a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times more to the God of peace, for peace, then thoſe who plead ſo much for it. Peace is to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at any rate, but with the loſſe of Truth; if this be the price of it, we buy it too deare. We uſe to ſay, <hi>We may buy gold too deare;</hi> It would be a hard bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine if the glory of God, if the liberty of his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that now we have an opportunity to enjoy, if the moſt religious party in the Kingdome ſhould be now ſacrificed for a ſuppoſed peace, which upon ſuch terms certainly will not hold long: This would make God our enemie, not only becauſe his glory, truth, &amp; Saints are dear unto him, but becauſe thoſe who are moſt religious, have ſtuck moſt to the Parliament; they have ventured their eſtates, their lives, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, their ſervants for the ſafety of King, Kingdome and Parl. Never was Parl. ſo engaged to any party in <hi>England,</hi> as they are engaged to theſe now: Therefore it were the moſt horrible injuſtice that ever was in the world, if the Parl. ſhould leave them, yea ſacrifice them to their adverſaries, only to provide for a falſe uncertain, diſhonourable peace for themſelves and others. It cannot be imagined that ſuch a thought could enter into them; God would never ſuffer ſuch injuſtice as this to paſſe this world, without the ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſſions of his high indignation againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:95477:33"/>
And in way of true wiſdome of civill polity theſe foure things muſt be conſidered of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How far treaties may be advantagious to the adverſaries. We read <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 25. that <hi>through peace many ſhould be deſtroyed.</hi> Under the name of peace, there may be fomented the moſt bloody, cruell war that ever <hi>England</hi> hath knowne: Many people when they hear of the word Peace, they are ſo pleaſed that they run away with that, not knowing what bloody cruel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes may lye under it, and be promoted by it, and they think that if ſome follow not the treaty preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though upon never ſo great diſadvantage, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are bloody and love war; whereas in truth it is that they might prevent cruel bloodſhed, and the outragiouſneſſe of war as much as in them lies, which they ſee in all probability may follow upon giving the averſary that advantage he deſires, though the ſtanders by ſee not the cunning of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Great care muſt be had in the propoſitions of, &amp; conditions about peace. We reade 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2. when the men of <hi>Jabeſh Gilead</hi> would make a covenant with <hi>Nahaſh,</hi> he told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that upon this condition he would make a covenant with them, <hi>that he might thruſt out all their right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. You muſt be ſure you make ſuch a peace as you may confide in it, ſo as you may not be afterwards at the mercie of your adverſaries, whether they will keep the conditions yea or no: you muſt take heede of diſinabling your ſelves, to maintain what your conditions of agreement bind to, eſpecially if you have to deale with Papiſts, whoſe principle is, that no faith is to be kept with Heretiques, and for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique cauſe leagues may be broke; if your peace
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95477:34"/>
hinder your ſtrength to maintain your right, what ſecurity can you have in your peace one moneth?</p>
            <p n="4">4. As things now ſtand great care had neede bee taken that the hearts of people who have ſhewne themſelves forward, venturing their lives, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting their eſtates, may not be diſcouraged, leſt if Parliamennts ever neede the people again, they never finde them appeare for them, ſtick to them; and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may fall out that there may be neede of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſtanding by them hereafter as well as now, or elſe their priviledges may ſoone vaniſh, and their power be over-powred, and ſo come to nothing. Wee know how ſoon authority is contemned, where power is not joyned with authority.</p>
            <p>But do not our adverſaries grow ſtronger then we? <note place="margin">Ob.</note> if ſo, it is in vain for us to oppoſe.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to conceive they ſhould, except <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> the Kingdome be ſo beſotted, as never yet any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was upon the face of the earth. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. How can men of underſtanding, who have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in the Kingdome, and have poſteritie to live here, imagine that the Kingdome ſhould be better governed by the King, with thoſe Cavalliers about him, then by the King with his Parliament?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Parliament ſhould now be over-powred and ſpoiled becauſe they have gone according to their conſciences for the good of the Kingdom, muſt not all Parliaments hereafter lye at mercie?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If theſe men prevaile, is there not danger leſt things ſhould be carried as they pleaſe? if they get power into their hands, who knows but that they wil preſume to give Laws to us, that things ſhal be done according to their minds rather then the Kings? doth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95477:34"/>
not the King forbid plunderings now, &amp; yet do they not plunder as they pleaſe? if then they get power into their hands fully, what will not they do then?</p>
            <p>Theſe things being ſo obvious to every mans thoughts, that one can hardly bee a man to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any thing, but he muſt needes think of thoſe things; how then is it poſſible that the Kingdome ſhould not generally riſe with a ſpirit of indignation againſt theſe men, who are thus riſen up to make ſuch ſpoile and waſte in the Kingdome? Although they doe not yet ſtir in many places, hoping there may be ſome help of theſe things ſome other way; but if they ſee there be no other help, it cannot be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but this ſpirit of indignation muſt riſe through out the Kingdome; men will never ſuffer themſelves to be baffled out of their Religion, their liberties, their eſtates on this faſhion; They will never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily deſert thoſe whom they have choſen, and betruſted with their eſtates, liberties and lives, thoſe who have been ſo faithfull to them, ſpending their ſtrength in their indefatigable labours night and day, waſting their eſtates, and hazarding their lives for them; wherefore it cannot be imagined that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſhould ever gather more ſtrength then we.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe they could be more in number; yet conſidering how vile and wicked, what notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blaſphemers and curſers they are, they are not much to be feared. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports of one <hi>Cyneas,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Pyrrus.</hi>
               </note> diſcourſing of the opinions of the <hi>Epicurians,</hi> that they thought the gods tooke no care of, had no regard of mens doings, and that the onely happineſſe was to live in pleaſure, for ſo the gods themſelves did: <hi>Fabritius</hi> hearing this, cryed aloud, and ſaid, <hi>The</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:95477:35"/>
               <hi>gods grant that</hi> Pyrrus <hi>and the</hi> Samnites <hi>were of ſuch opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as long as they have wars againſt us:</hi> Suppoſing that if they were thus, and had ſuch vile opinions of the gods, they could never proſper to doe any great matter. We dare not ſay thus of our adverſaries, God grant that they continue thus vile and blaſphemous as they are: No, we pray if it be poſſible that they may ſee how they fight againſt God, that their hearts may be changed; but yet we are of this beliefe, that <hi>Fabritius</hi> was of, that whileſt they are ſo wicked, and ſpeak ſo vilely of God, and blaſpheme his name ſo as they doe, that they are not much to be feared, they wil never be able to doe any great matters, the wrath of the Almighty will purſue them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly, if they ſhould get more in number, yet if our cauſe be Chriſts, (which is cleare to us, for our conſciences tell us we deſire not, we endeavour not the wrong of any man living, much leſſe of our King) we then have Chriſt with us; And as <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> once ſaid to his ſouldiers, when they ſaid that their enemies were more in number, <hi>Why how many doe you reckon me for?</hi> So I may ſay in this caſe, How many doe you reckon Jeſus Chriſt for? If he be not with us, let us lay down all preſently.</p>
            <p>Wel, but we are ſure for the preſent there is a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſturbance in the Kingdom, and mens eſtates are conſumed in the extreme charge of theſe Wars, and <note place="margin">Ob.</note> what ſhall we think will become of things at laſt?</p>
            <p>It is true, when a bone is out of joynt, there is much pain; but if the care be not of ſetting it right, the very <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> ſetting will breed much more pain: There is much diſturbance, but it is onely the breaking out of what hath layn in the plots and ſecret workings of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95477:35"/>
a long time. It was once the ſpeech of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonder,</hi> that if the Lyons skin will not ſerve, we muſt <note place="margin">Plutarch. vita Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandri.</note> help it with the Foxes; Contrary now it is with our adverſaries; The Foxes would not doe the deed, and therefore now they put on the Lyons. It is well for us that things break out, when there may be help to reſiſt; our condition was as dangerous, though not ſo troubleſome before; now our diſturbance is but the noyſe of reſiſting, a deluge of evil that was flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon us: That man certainly is not a wiſe man that is not willing the flouds comming in upon him ſhould not bee ſtopped, becauſe the ſtopping of them will make a noiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But conſider wiſely who have bin the cauſe of this diſturbance; <hi>Puritanicall Preachers</hi> are cryed out of: So <hi>Elijah</hi> was ſaid to be <hi>the troubler of Iſrael: Amos</hi> was ſaid <note place="margin">1 Reg. 18. 17. Amos 7. 10 Act. 24. 5. Act. 17. 6.</note> to <hi>ſpeak ſuch words, as the Land could not bear: Paul</hi> was accounted <hi>a peſtilent fellow, a mover of ſedition:</hi> They cryed out of the Apoſtles, that <hi>they turned the world up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down. Luther</hi> in his time was called <hi>Tuba Rebellionis,</hi> the very trumpet of rebellion. But if men wil not ſhut their eyes, and ſtop their ears, they cannot but know the cauſe of our diſturbance hath been the pride and cruelty of Prelates, forcing illegall things both upon our brethren in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and upon us; Is it not as clear as the Sun, that the diſturbance began with their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their own <hi>Service-book</hi> upon them? Have not they &amp; their Preachers ſought to infuſe ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples into Kings, that all is theirs, to diſpoſe on as they pleaſe, That they are bound to no Laws? A doctrine condemned by the Heathens. We reade of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, when he ordained any Pretor, giving him the ſword, he would bid him uſe the ſword againſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95477:36"/>
his enemies, in juſt cauſes; and if he himſelfe did otherwiſe then Juſtice, to uſe then his power againſt him alſo.</p>
            <p>And as Miniſters, ſo people that have been moſt conſcientious, they have been cryed out of as diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: Thus it was in the Primitive times, if there were any evils upon the Countries where the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans dwelt, they cryed out of them as the cauſe of all, the voice preſently was, <hi>Chriſtianos ad Leones,</hi> bring forth the Chriſtians to the Lyons: ſo now, the Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads the cauſe of all. Men that will examine things, and are not mad with malice, wonder how ſuch an apprehenſion can ariſe; They ſuffer the wrong, and yet they are accuſed for the trouble of the Kingdom; by reaſon of their ſufferings they are more in the view of people then other men; and therefore when men are in a rage, they fall upon them that are next hand. They indeed will not yeeld to ſuch illegall things as others will; they think themſelves bound what lies in them to keep the Kingdome and their poſterities from ſlavery; and for this good ſervice, although it coſt them deare, they muſt be accounted the cauſe of all the evill in the Kingdome. Did they ever plot any Treaſon, as Papiſts have done from time to time? Did they even in times of Popery ever ſeek to blow up Parliament houſes, as Papiſts have done? There is a great deale of ſtir about theſe men, but what have they done? the very foundations of this our Land are out of courſe; but what have the righteous done? So far as they can they yeeld active obedience to what Law requires of them, &amp; in what they cannot yeeld active, they yeeld paſſive, and what can man require more of them? Onely they wil not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95477:36"/>
yeeld to mens wils and luſts beyond that authority they have over them, and who wil that hath the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man in him?</p>
            <p>But theſe are not friends to the King.</p>
            <p>Surely thoſe who obey ſo far, cannot without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme malice be accounted enemies to the King; They pray more for the King, then any people doe: yea they do more for him and his, in a right way then any people doe. Who have ventured ſo much of their eſtates to reduce <hi>Ireland</hi> to the obedience of the King, as thoſe that are thus called <hi>Round-heads?</hi> Will it not be found that ſome few of theſe in the City of <hi>London</hi> have disburſed more of their eſtates for the Kings ſervice in this thing, to keepe this his lawfull inheritance in his poſſeſſion, and for his poſterity, then all thoſe thouſands that are now with the King in his Army? And heretofore, who were the men that were moſt free with their eſtates to aſſiſt the Parl and to have recovered the Palatinate, but theſe kinde of men? Howſoever now God ſees, and the world ſees they are ill requited at this day.</p>
            <p>No, no, God, and we hope in time, Man alſo will find our other troublers of the Kingdom rather then theſe. The Lord judge between us and our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in this thing.</p>
            <p>As for the great coſt &amp; charge the Kingdom is at,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt know thoſe who have done leaſt in this kind, complaine moſt; thoſe upon whom the weight and burden of the work hath layn, you heare not to make ſuch complaints of the charge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Better venture halfe then loſe all. In this thing that ſaying is true, <hi>Dimidium plus toto:</hi> If we be too ſparing now, it is the onely way to loſe all:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95477:37"/>
it is better to have but a piece ſure, then by venturing to keep all, to loſe all. If we will keep all, we may ſoon loſe all, as many have done; they have kept their eſtates for the ſpoilers. Yea we were better to have leſſe, as our own with freedom, then more with bondage at the wils of others.</p>
            <p>Times of extreme danger are no times of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of charges; If a mans houſe be on fire, were it not abſurd for him to cry out againſt breaking of the tiles, becauſe it wil put him to charges? There is a ſtory of a man who in diſcontent hanged himſelf, &amp; his ſervant comming into the room at that inſtant, ſeeing his maſter hanging, he preſently cuts down the rope, &amp; ſo ſaves his life: afterward this man being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly covetous, wrangles with his ſervant becauſe he would rather cut the rope then untye it, &amp; ſo put him to more charges: Doth not all lie at the ſtake? is not the very life of the Kingdom in danger? is it not time for us now to have our hearts raiſed above theſe things? Let us take heed our covetouſneſſe be not our undoing; and if our enemies find treaſure with us, then how juſtly may they mock and jeere us?</p>
            <p>When <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was taken, in the yeer 1453. it appears by the <hi>Turkiſh Hiſtory</hi> that it was loſt through the Citizens covetouſneſſe; The Citizens were full of gold and ſilver when it was taken, but would not pay the ſouldiers that ſhould have defended them, and ſo their enemies made merry with their riches. The like is reported of <hi>Heydelburgh,</hi> taken by their enemies not many yeers ſince, upon the like ground.</p>
            <p>God hath been beforehand with us in many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and he hath yet more rich and glorious mercies for us, that ſurely will pay for all at laſt over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95477:37"/>
again. We are unworthy of our liberties, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Goſpell, if we prize them at ſo low a rate, as if they were not tranſcendently above all the coſts we have been at, or are like to be at.</p>
            <p>We think theſe charges much, but there is not one yeare wherein our neighbours in the Low Countries are not at far more charge then we have been at this chargeable yeare; all our extraordinary charges are below their ordinary.</p>
            <p>But although there is nothing can be ſaid, but God <note place="margin">Object.</note> allows of theſe wars, yet were it not better in prudence that I be not ſeen in them? for if I be, if the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty prevailes I am undone; if I be not, yea, although I ſhould do ſomething for that party, yet the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will never do me any great hurt.</p>
            <p>It is true, the lenity of the Parliament on the one ſide, and the cruelty of the other party on the other <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſide, hath been a great prejudice to the one, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the other: How many delinquents that have been complained of, and brought up with great charge to the countrey, yet have gone away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting? but whoſoever comes under the power of the other, either muſt yeeld, or is undone; yea, it may bee undone, though then hee yeeldes. What blood hath beene of late ſhed by them, even in coole blood? But how unreaſonable is this ſo to reaſon, The Parliament is more juſt and gentle, the other more cruell and miſchievous, therefore I will leave the Parliament to ſink for any help it ſhall have from me, and joyne my ſelfe with the other party. God will judge theſe evill thoughts of yours, and yet you may be miſtaken, in this your device to ſave your eſtate, you may prove falſe to the Parliament, and yet
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95477:38"/>
your eſtates not ſo ſafe as you thinke; it may befall you as it hath done others, that when theſe plunderers come to you, if you tell them you are for the King, you are no Round-head, then they reaſon thus with you, If you be indeed for the King, you will be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have your eſtates goe to be helpefull to him, and ſo they may reaſon you out of all you have, and ſo you may be deceived of what you aimed at, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering your ſelves not to be Round-heads. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you be, yet if they prevaile your goods will be found to be Round-heads. They are a little faire man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nered now and then as yet, becauſe they have not the day; but if once the day be theirs, and they have power in their hands; then they will call your goods by what name they pleaſe. <hi>Platina</hi> tels us, that when the citizens of <hi>Papia</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> were at diſſention by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the faction betweene the <hi>Guelphes</hi> and the <hi>Gibel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines:</hi> The <hi>Gibellines</hi> procured a favourer of theirs cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Facinus Cajus</hi> to aſſiſt them, covenanting that hee ſhould have the goods of the <hi>Guelphes</hi> for his labour; but he being once come into the Citie and prevailing, he ſpared the goods of neither of them: whereupon the <hi>Gibellines</hi> complained, ſaying, that their goods alſo were ſpoiled; he anſwered them that they themſelves were <hi>Gibellines,</hi> but their goods were <hi>Guelphes.</hi> You may perhaps be Royaliſts, but your goods will be Round-heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> 27. 8. <hi>What hope hath an hypocrite though he hath gained, when God taketh away his ſoule?</hi> If men by hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall deviſes ſhould gaine as they deſire, yet when God takes away their ſouls, what good have they then? But how miſerable then will it be for them, when God curſes them for the preſent, and when their ſoules are taken away at laſt? what hope can they have
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95477:38"/>
then? It is juſt that the curſe of God ſhould purſue them, who will be of any ſide for their own advantage.</p>

               <hi>Ro. Hoved. fo.</hi> 438. reports of <hi>Brabantes</hi> called <hi>Rutters,</hi> that they would ſerve on any ſide for wages; therefore they are called by <hi>Hoveden, Nefando gens,</hi> and he ſaies they were accurſed in the <hi>Lateran Councell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon the concluſion from all is, There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing required of you in this ſervice by both Houſes of Parliament, but what you may with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience undertake, by Commiſſion from this great Generall <hi>The Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Be not therefore daunted with ſuch words as thoſe, <hi>What? will you fight againſt the King?</hi> If you fight againſt the King, who doe you fight for? ſurely it muſt be for his enemies? and who are they? You know, and all the world may know you fight for none but the Parliament and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; what ſhall the Parliament and the Kingdome be accounted enemies to the King? how can they be under his protection if they be his enemies? and if the King ſhould put them out of his protection, what doe you thinke would follow upon this? No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, when things come to be examined, you ſee there is no ſuch matter: No, this buſineſſe is for no hurt to the King. Thoſe men who goe up and downe pillaging and plundring, and doing miſchiefe to all extremity whereſoever they come, who make a ſpoile of this Kingdome, and that of Ireland, and all under the name of the King: Theſe are the men who wrong the King, rendring him to the Subject as if he were another <hi>Maxentius,</hi> who reduced the City of <hi>Rome</hi> into ſuch a condition, as there was no forreſt of theeves wherein the lives of Citizens were not more ſafe then in their houſes. In his Orations he made to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95477:39"/>
his ſouldiers, no words were more frequent then theſe, <hi>Fruimini, diſsipate, prodigite,</hi> Enjoy, riot, ſpend. Theſe men doe what lyes in them to put men upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Whether the relation between King and people may not poſſibly be broke? Whether Kingly power be ſuch an indelible character upon any perſon, as nothing can ever poſſibly put it out? Whether that which is by compact and covenant, do not bind mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually? Are not they then like to perjudice the King more then any? If there be any poſſibity of ſuch thoughts riſen in people, what can occaſion them ſooner then the doing ſuch open violence, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſuch outrages aganſt the Subjects in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that with boldneſſe and confidence in the name of the King? If it were as they ſay, if people did beleeve theſe men, it might cauſe ſtrange thoughts of heart in them, even ſuch thoughts, as theſe, How can we bee in a worſe condition under any? What, hath God tyed us, if once a ſupreame Governor be acknowledged, that he muſt ever be acknowledged, Whatſoever he doth againſt us, even to deſtroy us? Where doth the Scripture ſay ſo? It need be a very cleare Scripture that ſhall tye us to this, to lie down under ſuch intollerable burdens as theſe are, to ſee our ruine, &amp; the ruine of our wives &amp; chileren before our faces. We muſt not reſiſt thoſe who have high power. True, ſo long as they goe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their power given them, or as long as they have it, but may they not poſſibly be diſcharged of it? Reſiſting the Prieſts is condemned in Scripture; what? can nothing therfore diſcharge the Prieſt of his prieſtly office, and my acknowledging of his prieſtly power? What, did our forefathers ſo
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95477:39"/>
far give all power out of their hands, as they have not left us ſo much as the benefit of the Law of Nature to help our ſelves withall? What hath God made ſuch difference between man and man, as that one ſhould ſpoile, and deſtroy, and do what he liſt, and whole Kingdomes ſhould lie downe under him and ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and doe nothing to helpe themſelves? Hath God made all the world to bee under the luſts of twenty or thirty men? Nature hath not made ſuch a difference betweene one man and another, wee ſee them to bee of the ſame mould wee are of; God hath not revealed from heaven by his Prophets, that this or that family muſt be ſo much above others, rather then other families. That then that now makes the difference between man and man, is from men ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up this family rather then another, or this perſon rather then another; but is it poſſible to conceive that any Common-wealth ſhould ſet up any to their owne ruine? Were it that men kept in due order, or that when the moſt abominable injuſtice and violence that is offered, men did not preſume ſo audaciouſly to make uſe of the name of the King, theſe reaſonings would never bee occaſioned in mens hearts: woe therefore to them by whom ſuch dangerous offences come. The Lord deliver us, and the Lord deliver His Majeſty from theſe men, and ſuch fearefull ſcandals as they caſt upon him. How dangerous a temptation is this to Princes, to have ſuch an apprehenſion infuſed into them, whatſoever they doe, whatſoever ſpoile of Kingdomes they make, and violence they offer, they ſhall ſtill enjoy what they had, and be acknowledged as they were? That Land is in a ſad condition where theſe thoughts are applyable to the Prince thereof,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95477:40"/>
and lie boiling in the hearts of the people. For our parts we deſire as long as ever we are able, to charge onelie even in our very hearts the actors of all the violence and ſpoile amongſt us, and our brethren in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as the Authors of it: and therefore we judge it is the beſt ſervice we can doe for the King, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him from theſe miſchievous men, that his throne being eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe, his Crown may ſlouriſh upon him and his poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe things I have ſpoken out of conſcience of my duty to God, and to the Kingdome, knowing that if ſome do not open theſe things as they are able, to ſatisfie the ignorant, and doubting, and erroneous conſciences of many, they will he found guilty of betraying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their brethren, their poſterities, their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now having endeavoured to cleare, that what wee doe, we doe by commiſſion from the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 4.</note> way is cleare to fetch ſoul-ſtaying, ſupporting, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying comfort from this glorious Name of God. It is not more glorious then comfortable to the Church of God. Surely we need not feare wars, ſtrength of enemies, roaring of Canons, clattering of weapons, beating of drums, neighing of horſes, ſo long as God, <hi>our God</hi> is <hi>the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I come to what I promiſed, to ſhew you this name of God written upon the Mercy-ſeat. <hi>Xerxes</hi> uſed to pitch his tent on high, and ſtand look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Army, when they were in fight, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them. This our great Generall ſtands on high, looking upon his people in their battels, let them looke up to him, and there is encouragement enough to fill any heart in the world. This Title is an

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> was wont in ſad tumultuous times to ſay to thoſe about him, Come, let us ſing the 46. Pſal. It is a Pſalm moſt ſutable for theſe times to be ſung often. <hi>Iſa</hi> 51. 12. <hi>Who art thou that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a man?</hi> Surely thou doeſt not know what thy privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is, thou knoweſt not what intereſt thou haſt in the Lord of Hoſts, that thou art afraid of a man that muſt die; wherefore it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>I am the Lord thy God that divided the ſea, The Lord of Hoſts is his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay, Ah! if we knew indeed that the Lord of Hoſts were ours, that he were with us, then we might well comfort our ſelves in theſe times of wars, but that is all the queſtion to us, for want of the aſſurance of that our hearts are troubled.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Though you doe not know certainly that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95477:41"/>
you have any ſpeciall intereſt in him, yet it is a great comfort to know that all things in wars are carryed on by him, yea, though he were a meere ſtranger to you, and you to him: as ſuppoſe you were ſure there ſhould be nothing done in all theſe ſtirs about wars but by the will of the moſt wiſe, the moſt holy, and moſt mercifull man in the world, that hath all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, all the wiſdome, all the mercy that all the men in the world ever had, although this man were a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to you, you never ſaw his face in your life, yet would it not be a ſtay and comfort to your hearts to heare that all things were committed to the diſpoſe of this man, and not a ſtroke ſtruck, nor any hurt ſhould come to any, but as this man gave out his commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? certainly it would quiet our hearts much: but that all is at the diſpoſe of this <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe holineſſe, wiſdome, and juſtice is infinite; although yet we do not know any further of him, wee cannot ſay we have any ſpeciall intereſt in him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Although you doe not know your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in this <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> yet your hearts may be ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea, comforted in this, that the cauſe hath a deep intereſt in the very heart of this <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and therefore that ſhall proſper howſoever. The ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction the ſoul takes in this is a ſpeciall argument of intereſt in this God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Yet further I will tell you how you ſhall know whether you have any ſpeciall intereſt in this Lord of Hoſts or not, from that Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 3. <hi>O Lord of Hoſts my King and my God.</hi> Here are theſe two, <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and <hi>my God.</hi> Now all the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is about the <hi>Copula,</hi> that which joynes theſe two together: there you have it <hi>my King,</hi> that is ſet
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95477:41"/>
betweene them; if then you can ſay, <hi>O Lord of Hoſts my King,</hi> you neede not ſtaie there, but may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie goe further to the other, <hi>my God:</hi> If you can out of the uprightneſſe of your hearts ſay, <hi>O Lord thou knoweſt the deſires of our Soules are that thou mayeſt rule over us, O when ſhall we heare that bleſſed voice, The Kingdomes of the earth are the Lords &amp; his Chriſts, and he ſhall reigne for evermore! O that thy Kingdome might come more powerfully in our hearts, and that it might be more conſpicuous in Church and State! The ſpeciall reaſon (thou knoweſt) why we are willing to venture our ſelves as we do, to endure any hardſhip, to part with our eſtates, is that Antichriſt may never rule amongſt us againe, but that we and our poſterity may be under the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Surelie this is the voice of thoſe who have the Lord of Hoſts to be their God. That is an everlaſting rule, If he be thy <hi>King,</hi> he is thy <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then for the full comfort and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Church of God may take from this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name, Conſider the Relation that the <hi>Church</hi> hath to this <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and the Relation this <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> hath to the <hi>Church.</hi>

               <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> it is not onelie <hi>Gods Citie,</hi> but <hi>his Citie,</hi> under this Title, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. 8. <hi>As we have heard, ſo have we ſeen in the City of the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> Wee may comfortablie ſay, This Citie of <hi>London</hi> is <hi>the City of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> God hath precious Saints here, abundance of them, and it hath done worthilie for the honour of the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> of late, and therefore ſurely the Lord of Hoſts will defend it. If there bee any Citie under heaven that may be called <hi>The Citie of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> then I am confident the Citie of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95477:42"/>
               <hi>London</hi> may. But we are to take here the <hi>City</hi> in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſenſe for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as it is uſuall in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Now we know when an Army hath to do with a City that is in the inheritance of the Generall, then if there be any power in Generall or Army, it will bee all put forth to the utmoſt, either for the defence, or gaining that City: As the City of <hi>Breda</hi> in the Low-Countries, when that was beſieged, it was ſoon won by the Army of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> becauſe that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was the Princes own City, his proper inheritance; he had a ſpeciall eye and care over that City. Surely the eye and care of this Lord of Hoſts, though it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Towns and Countries, and walled Cities, yet it is moſt over his Church; if he hath any power in all the Armies in heaven and earth, it ſhal be put forth for the defence of, and ſupplying good unto this City. Hence that paſſage in the prayer of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8 44. <hi>If thy people go to battell, and ſhall pray to the Lord toward the City which thou haſt choſen, then heare in heaven.</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem was the City God then choſe, which was but a type of every Church in the time of the Goſpel.</p>

The Lord of Hoſts is the Husband of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Church, and this is the moſt neare and ſweet relation of all. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 54. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Feare not, &amp;c. For thy Maker is thy Husband, the Lord of Hoſts is his name. The Lord hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thee as a woman forſaken, grieved in ſpirit, when thou waſt refuſed, ſaith thy God.</hi> Alas, ſaith the Church, I am a poore deſolate widow, a woman forſaken and grieved in ſpirit, every one neglects me, I am rejected of all. Well, ſayes God, I took thee when thou wert thus forſaken to be my Spouſe, I have marryed thee to my ſelfe, therefore now feare not, I am the Lord of Hoſts, the God of the whole earth. Surely a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall if he hath the heart of a man in him, he will fight for his Spouſe, he will not ſuffer his Spouſe to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed before his eyes. What ſayes <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Haman, Will he force the Queen before my face?</hi> Vile men are riſen up, and they ſeeke to raviſh the Church, the Spouſe of the Lord of Hoſts, and do you think he will ſuffer this before his face? Shall not all the Armies in heaven and earth rather come together, and fight for her deliverance?</p>
            <p>Now then if all theſe things be thus, we have cauſe then to quiet our hearts in the midſt of all our fears and diſtractions, to <hi>ſtand ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of God,</hi> the ſalvation that this <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> is working for us. This is the buſineſſe that I have been endeavouring, to enlarge before you the object of your faith, and to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the object of your feare. Surely if <hi>the Lord of Hoſts</hi> hath ſuch a relation to his <hi>Church,</hi> and the Church ſuch a relation to him, he cannot but be exceedingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked againſt any that ſhall meddle with his Church to doe it hurt. I will give you one notable expreſſion of his anger againſt ſuch, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>What mean ye that</hi>

               <hi>ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poore? ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> God here ſpeaks anger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, What am I the Lord of Hoſts, and will you offer this? What mean you? As when we flie upon a man in anger, (whom we ſee doth things to our prejudice, or the prejudice of any neer to us, in an abſurd maner) we ſay, What doe you mean to do thus? what are you mad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doe you know what you doe?

            <p>From all theſe gracious expreſſions of this Lord of Hoſts to the comfort and encouragement of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the reſult is that in the 8. of <hi>Eſay</hi> 12, 13. <hi>Say not, A confederacy to them that ſay, A confederacy;</hi> oh! many of their forces are joyned together; <hi>feare not their feare, but ſanctifie the Lord of Hoſts himſelfe, and let him be your feare, and let him be your dread.</hi> The Name of God is a ſtrong Antidote to drive feare out of the hearts of the weakeſt. Upon what we have ſeene in this title of God, we may well ſay to the fearful in heart, <hi>be ſtrong, feare not,</hi> as we have it <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 4. Let women and all ſuch as are naturally feareful, take heed of ſinfull feare. The fearfulneſſe of women hanging about their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and children, and friends, crying out when they ſhould goe forth in this ſervice, and going up and down wringing their hands, and making dolefull out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries, may do abundance of hurt, exceedingly hinder the work that the Lord hath now in hand. Let women take heed they be not hindrances, but let them learne to exerciſe faith and take ſpirit to themſelves, that they may further their Husbands, children, and friends in this work of the Lord of Hoſts. Marke that Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Yee are the daughters of Sarah ſo long as you do well, and be not afraid with any amazement.</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:95477:45"/>
Yee would all willingly be accounted the daughters of <hi>Sarah.</hi> Obſerve how the holy Ghoſt puts it upon this, that you <hi>be not afraid with any amazement:</hi> it may be nature may cauſe ſome feare, but grace muſt keepe it that it be not with any amazement.</p>
            <p>Why is it thus put upon this?</p>
            <p>As <hi>Abraham</hi> is moſt commended for his faith, and ſo by beleeving wee are the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo it ſeemes <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife in thoſe difficulties that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam</hi> went through, ſhe was no <hi>hinderance</hi> but a <hi>furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> to him, ſhe did not cry out to him, Why will you leave your fathers houſe, and all your kindred, and go up and downe in a ſtrange country in the middeſt of dangers and many ſtraits? no, but ſhee rather was a helpe to him, and an encourager of him: ſo ſaies <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> who ſpeaking to Chriſtians who lived in trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and dangerous times, <hi>You ſhall ſhew your ſelves the daughters of Sarah,</hi> if you have ſuch a ſpirit as <hi>Sarah</hi> had, <hi>not to be afraid with any amazement,</hi> not through your inordinate feare, either hinder your ſelves, your husbands, or any other in the ſervice of the Lord. If God call you or them to ſuffer, you muſt not through feare pull backe, but go on with courage undauntedly, then you are indeed the daughters of <hi>Sarah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that a ſpirit may be put even into women in theſe times that call for all to be above ſinfull feares, let them conſider theſe three things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The firſt time that ever any ſpeaking to God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> called him by this name <hi>the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> it was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that was <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Shee vowed a vow, and ſaid, O Lord of Hoſts if thou wilt indeed looke on the affliction of thine handmaid, &amp;c.</hi>

title of the Lord of Hoſts is moſt magnified, is a <hi>Pſalme</hi> tuned to that Muſical inſtrument that virgins and women uſe to play on, from whence the <hi>Pſalme</hi> hath its title, <hi>A Song upon Alamoth, Pſ.</hi> 46.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95477:46"/>
think to excuſe their ſinfull feares. I will give you a notable ſpeech comming neer this from another wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that Eccleſiaſticall ſtory records of, one <hi>Julitta;</hi> there are many famous things recorded of her, but this ſpeech of hers to other women of her acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is moſt remarkable, <hi>Ceaſe to accuſe</hi> (ſayes ſhe) <hi>the fragility of the Foeminine ſexe, What? are not we made of the ſame matter that men are? Yea after Gods Image are we made as wel as they. God did not uſe fleſh to make women of, in token of infirmity: We are bone of his bone, in token we muſt be ſtrong in the living God.</hi> If the ſpirit of <hi>The Lord of Hoſts</hi> were with you, even you may daunt your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. You may make ſuch preparations for your own defence, as not to let your lives go at a cheap rate, but that the loſſe of every one of yours may coſt the life of one of them at leaſt. Even you may caſt ſhame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. If there were ſuch a ſpirit in you, they would fly before women, for their ſpirits are baſe and vile.</p>
            <p>If God be the Lord of Hoſts, if he hath ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull workings of his providence in wars and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 6.</note>, hence in all war and battels there is ſome ſpeciall thing of God to be looked at. Surely this great Lord of Hoſts doth not uſe to raiſe War, to go into the field for nothing; there is ſome great thing aimed at, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where he appears in more then an ordinary way; as certainly he doth in theſe wars of ours.</p>
            <p>We ſhould not hearken after or ſpeake of Warres onely as matter of news, but obſerve what the way of God is in them, what his aim looks to in ordering of them, what his intentions work at, how he brings his own ends to paſſe, &amp; furthers his glory by them. Whoſoever lives to ſee the iſſue of theſe great ſtirs and warlike commotions amongſt us, ſhall ſee that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95477:46"/>
God had a hand in them to bring great things to paſſe, that the mercy he intended for us was worth all the trouble theſe have brought upon us, yea all the bloud, the moſt precious bloud that hath been ſhed amongſt us. God hath many promiſes to his Churches to accompliſh, many Prophecies to fulfil, many glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things to declare, many mercies for his Saints to beſtow, &amp; theſe ſtirs amongſt us wil make way for all.</p>
            <p>We have had much mercy from God on free-coſt; that mercie that is to come, it may be is of an higher nature; therefore God intends it ſhall be more coſtly to us, it may coſt many of our lives; but we or our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie ſhall ſee that when it comes it wil pay for all. That this Lord of Hoſts had great thoughts of heart for the good of <hi>England</hi> when he raiſed theſe Civil wars amongſt us, though it be the ſoreſt judgement, yet it may make way to the greateſt mercy. It is our duty diligently to obſerve how God works in his Providence to the attaining ſuch ends of his.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>God</hi> is <hi>The Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Hence know from whence it is that we have enjoyed ſo much peace as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> we have, with the comfortable fruits of it; it is from <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> who hath all power in his hands, to keep off or bring war as he pleaſeth. It it is he alone that hath kept off from us thoſe hideous things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ſuffered; it is from him that we have not all this while wallowed, not ſweltred in our bloud; that our garments have not been rowled in bloud, as our brethrens have; but we have enjoyed our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, beds, tables, wives, children; we have had all comforts for ſoule and body about us. <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 4. <hi>They ſhall ſit every man under his vine, and under his fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and none ſhall make them afraid.</hi> From whence is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95477:47"/>
this? The words following wil tell you, <hi>The mouth of the Lord of Hoſts hath ſpoken it.</hi> The Vines and Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees we have ſate under, have not beene empty Vines, nor barren Fig-trees to us; we have not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had refreſhment from the ſhadow of them, but much comfort from the fruit of them. It was this Lord that promiſed to Iſrael that he would cauſe their enemies not to deſire their land, when they went up to Jeruſalem to worſhip. What a mercy is it for us to be as <hi>Gedeons</hi> ſleece, dry, when all about us have been wet, not with dew, but with blood? Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of wars tell many Countries and Shires in <hi>England,</hi> what a bleſſing peace vvas, vvhich they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtood before. Peace is ſweet and good, but let us take heede we buy not our peace too deare.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This name of God ſhews us how neerly it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all people in times of wars, to ſeeke to make up <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> their peace with this God. When we goe forth to war againſt our enemies, vve had need take heed that God be not our enemy too; If hee be, all our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and power we can raiſe are to little purpoſe to help us. Let us deale vviſely for our ſelves, to make ſure that he fights not againſt us. If this be not done, againſt whomſoever elſe vve fight, vve fight with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diſadvantage. Now we muſt ſeek to make our peace with him, by our unfained-humiliations before him, and our ſincere reformations in turning to him. For the firſt, we are loth to humble our ſelves before our enemies; this we think is our ſhame. Let us hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves before this God, this is our glory. You make Fortifications, and in that you doe well; but except you adde thereunto humiliations, it will be to little purpoſe. <hi>Eſay</hi> 22. 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c. Ye made a ditch alſo</hi>

               <hi>betweene the two walls for the water of the old poole, but ye have not looked to the maker thereof.</hi> It follows, <hi>And in that day did the Lord God of Hoſts call to weeping, and to mourning, and behold, joy, gladneſſe, killing oxen, drinking wine. This was revealed in mine eares by the Lord of Hoſts, Surely this iniquity ſhall not be purged till you dye, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Mark, three times in that <hi>verſe</hi> is mention made of <hi>The Lord of Hoſts.</hi> He takes ſpecial notice of this. And the rather ſhould wee get our hearts afflicted and humbled under the mighty hand of this God, becauſe our adverſaries are ſo proud, becauſe of that high hand of pride and blaſphemie that they goe forth withall againſt God. There is no ſuch ſtratagem of war like this to get the advantage of our adverſaries, in this very thing. Doe we heare of their pride and blaſphemies? let our hearts be the more humble before the Lord; let us labour ſo much the more to ſanctifie the Name of this holy God, whoſe name the Angels celebrate, as <hi>Holy, holy, holy, the Lord of Hoſts, Eſay</hi> 6. 3.</p>
            <p>With our Humiliations, let Reformation, turning to this God be added. It muſt needs be a dangerous thing in times of wars, to carry with us, or harbour amongſt us any Traitors againſt this Lord of Hoſts, as the truth is all ſins that we retaine are. What ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance can we then expect from him, or ſucceſſe by him? You know what trouble the accurſed thing of <hi>Achan</hi> cauſed in the Camp; it made the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fly before the men of <hi>Ai.</hi> If any accurſed thing (though ſecret) be ſuch a diſturbance in the Camp, much more accurſed Officers.</p>

As if he ſhould ſay, You have been very vile and wicked, your conſciences cannot but tell you ſo, and I know it; yet returne now to me, and I profeſſe my ſelfe notwithſtanding all that you have done, I am here ready and willing to returne to you, all ſhall be forgiven, as if it had never been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.

The <hi>praying</hi> Chriſtians <note place="margin">Preces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrae, bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardae no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra.</note> in <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> his Army, were called <hi>The thundring Legion. Sozomen</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus</hi> tel us that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> by Prayer made the weapons of enemies turne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves. I am ſure it hath done as great things. One of the ſtrangeſt victories that ever was heard of, was that we have recorded <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 8. <hi>They ſlew five Kings of Midian, they ſlew all the males, and all the women that had known man, and burnt all their Cities, and took booty ſix hundred thouſand, and ſeventy and five thouſand ſheep, and threeſcore and twelve thouſand beeves, and threeſcore and one thouſand Aſſes, and thirty and two thouſand women that had not known man, ver.</hi> 32, 33, 34, 35. Now here was the wonder of this battel, that in all this great victory the Children of Iſrael loſt not one man, for ſo ſaies the Text plainly, <hi>ver.</hi> 49. <hi>Thy ſervants have taken the ſumme of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.</hi> And mark what was done when they went forth to this battel, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>The holy inſtruments and the trumpets ſounded in the hands of Eleazar the Prieſt.</hi> It was an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God amongſt them, that the Prieſts ſhould ſound with the ſilver trumpets, when they wentforth to battail, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. 9. Which was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved here, and ſee what a victory was obtained. An Army of prayers is as ſtrong as any Army of men whatſoever; yea one man praying may do more then many men fighting. <hi>Eliſha</hi> hath his ſword to ſlay, as
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95477:49"/>
well as <hi>Jehu</hi> and <hi>Hazael.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 15, 16, 17. when <hi>Elijah</hi> thought there was no help, Yes, ſaith God, <hi>Goe and anoint Hazael, and Jehu, and Eliſha.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, I have Armies in the field, he that eſcapes the ſword of <hi>Hazael,</hi> ſhall <hi>Jehu</hi> ſlay; he that eſcapes the ſword of <hi>Jehu,</hi> ſhall <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſlay. How ſhould <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſlay, but by his prayers? they will reach and cut down a great way off. That Scripture is very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 2, 3. <hi>In Salem alſo is his Tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Sion, there brake he the arrows of the how, the ſhield and the ſword and the battel.</hi> Where brake he them? there in <hi>Salem,</hi> in <hi>Sion,</hi> where his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle was, in the congregation of Saints praying, there the arrow of the bow, the ſhield and the ſpeare is broken. It is reported of the King of Sweden, that as ſoone as he ſet foot in <hi>Germany,</hi> he fell down to prayer to this Lord of Hoſts, and what great things did he in a little time? In this Gods ſervants have the advantage of their adverſaries, they can pray to the Lord of Hoſts, the other cannot: They can blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, but pray they cannot. In this they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the advantage of the hill, and the winde of their enemies, and this is a great encouragement in battaile. It puts heart mightily into Souldiers that know any thing of God, to thinke that they go forth with the bleſſing of prayers with them, and that they have prayers continually ſent up to heaven for them. At that great fight neere <hi>Banbury,</hi> October 23. when many ranaway, thoſe that were left fell on with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and gave a mighty ſhout, <hi>Now for the fruit of prayer, Now for the fruit of prayer,</hi> and ſo their ſpirits were raiſed to more then an ordinary height, and they prevailed mightily, ſlaying neer ten to one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:95477:49"/>
Wherefore then let us be encouraged to pray; let us ſtrive with God in Prayer, while our brethren are ſtriving with the enemie in battel. They venture their lives for us, and endure great hardſhip; ſhall not wee pray? Yea let us put on now with more earneſtneſſe, not content our ſelves in our ordinary way. Great workings there are of God in the world, great things depend upon the ſucceſſe of theſe wars. He is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy member of Church or Common-wealth, who hath not an heart to pray now. Now we have need of praying Chriſtians indeed. Every foole can ſin, and provoke Gods wrath; but men and women of choice ſpirits onely can pray, ſuch as have intereſt in this Lord of Hoſts. It is obſervable in <hi>Solomons</hi> Prayer, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. three or foure times he prays againſt enemies, and yet he was in peace; his time was a time of peace. If then, much more now, when vve have ſuch raging enemies in our own bowels.</p>
            <p>And as we muſt <hi>pray,</hi> ſo we muſt <hi>truſt;</hi> we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye upon this Lord of hoſts in all our War-like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20. 7. <hi>Some truſt in horſes, ſome in Chariots, but we will remember the Name of the Lord our God; He is our ſtrength, our fortitude, our ſhield, our buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler: Curſed be the man that makes fleſh his arme.</hi> Our adverſaries come out to us with Sword and Canon; but (though means are to be uſed, yet) let us goe forth againſt them <hi>in the name of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 18. We reade of the ſonnes of <hi>Reuben,</hi> the <hi>Gadites,</hi> halfe tribe of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> that they were vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant men, skilfull in War, and that there went out of them forty foure thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty: here a compleat Army of skilfull Warriors, yet they ruſted not to their ſtrength or skill, but <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>They</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:95477:50"/>
               <hi>cryed unto the Lord, and he was intreated of them becauſe they truſted in him.</hi> There muſt be <hi>depending upon God</hi> added to <hi>crying unto God;</hi> wee muſt ſo cry to God as to make account here is good to be done, here is our ſtrength and helpe when all is done. It was a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeech that <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports <hi>Herod</hi> made to his Souldiers, it came from the mouth of a <hi>Herod,</hi> but it well beſeeme the mouth of the moſt godly Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Captain, Some may ſay, ſayes he, our cauſe is juſt, but we are few and weak; where truth and juſtice is, there is God, and where God is, there wants neither multitude nor fortitude. It was an obſervation of <hi>Origen,</hi> that others ſince have obſerved, that God in all the victories he gave his people to poſſeſſe them of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he never uſed the help of horſes. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary had horſes and chariots, both the Egyptian and the Canaanites; but Gods people had none. Wel, if our enemies ſhould exceed in horſes, (which yet we hope they ſhall not) but of that they boaſt; yet let us look higher: we may have <hi>Canaan,</hi> though we ſhould want horſes. After all our endeavours, then muſt all be referred to this Lord of Hoſts. It was a moſt brave expreſſion of a valiant Commander of <hi>Joab,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>Be of good courage, let us play the men for our people &amp; for the Cityes of our God, and the Lord do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this glorious name of God, we learne how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 5.</note> fit it is that thoſe who have a ſpeciall intereſt in this God, who have him to be their God, their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they ſhould have ſpirits full of courage, and fortitude; ſuch a ſpirit as beſeems the ſervants, much more children of ſuch a God whoſe they are, whom they ſerve. God loves to ſee the impreſſion of his ſpirit
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95477:50"/>
upon theſe who are his. He is a God of wiſdom, he loves to ſee the ſhine of his wiſdom upon the ſpirits of his Saints; he is an infinite holy God, he delights to ſee the luſtre of his Holineſſe glorious upon them. He is the Lord of Hoſts, he loves to ſee a ſpirit of valour, a ſpirit of magnanimity in them. What Captain, what Souldier of renown, but delights to ſee his children and alliance, thoſe who challenge any intereſt in him to be valiant? It is reported of <hi>Manlius Torquatus</hi> his ſon, that having by a ſpirit of valour overthrown the enemies of the Romans, and killed with his own hands a man of note in ſingle combat, being full of joy, hee ſeeks out his father who was the General of the Army, bearing in his hands the ſpoiles of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſaying aloud: <hi>Father behold the cauſe why I may be eſteemed your ſon.</hi> If we have a ſpirit of courage ſutable to our Father, we may with more comfort and better acceptance come to this Lord of Hoſts to be acknowledged for his children; but otherwiſe we ſhall be a diſhonour to him.</p>
            <p>We read of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, who having a Souldier in his Army of his name that was a coward, he comes to him &amp; bad him either change his name or be valiant: If <hi>Alexander</hi> thought it a diſhonour to him to have one of his name to be a coward, he would have thought the diſhonour much more if he had had one of his blood, his own childe a coward. What an unworthy thing were it for the ſon of ſuch a brave warrior as the K. of <hi>Sweden</hi> was to be of a low, mean poor, cowardly ſpirit? hee would be a reproach to his Father, and the very mention of his Father would be a reproach to him. Chriſtians, do not you profeſſe God to be your Father? do you not know your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95477:51"/>
is <hi>the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> where are your ſpirits of magnanimity and fortitude, of courage and valour, beſeeming the children of ſuch a glorious Father <hi>the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> If you be of the right breed, you muſt needes be generous; it is impoſſible but you ſhould have ſomething of his ſpirit in you; if you be of low, unworthy, ſenſuall, cowardly ſpirits, you are not begotten of him; God hath no children but they have ſome beam of every excellencie of his that ſuch creatures are capable of.</p>
            <p>Now this is the queſtion, what have you of the ſpirit of this great God? The ſpirit of the Devil, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a proud ſpirit, yet it is a baſe cowardly ſpirit. <hi>If you reſiſt the Devill he will fly from you.</hi> The truth is, all the men in the world have vile ſpirits, Gods children are men of another ſpirit.</p>
            <p>God breeds up all his children to bee Souldiers, there are none in heaven but were bred Souldiers, &amp; as they grew up were brought up in military diſcipline. Many Nations bring up their children to be Soldiers, from their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der yeers they diſcipline them this way: The Parthians bring up their children in teaching <note place="margin">In pacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, in bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo praeſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</note> them the uſe of the bow, the Scythians in the uſe of the dart, the Germans in the uſe of the ſpeare. All Gods children are here members of the Church militant, it is fit for them to be skilful, not onely in the uſe of the ſpirituall Armour, but of bodily alſo. Who ſo fit to be uſed in the battels of the Lord, as they who have moſt intereſt in the Lord? who ſo fit to venture his body to the ſword in time of war, as he that can give his body to the fire in time of peace?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſay</hi> 13. 3. Souldiers whom God chooſeth for his battails are called <hi>his ſanctified ones,</hi> an honourable
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95477:51"/>
title given to ſouldiers, <hi>Gods ſanctified ones,</hi> and who ſo fit to be Gods ſanctified ones, ſet apart for ſuch ſervices, as thoſe who are ſanctified by his Spirit, ſet apart for himſelf eternally? The valour of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the <hi>Gaules,</hi> was admired by the <hi>Romans;</hi> it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that inſtruction they had from their <hi>Druides,</hi> of the immortality of the ſoul. Thoſe are fitteſt to venture their lives in fight, who are able to ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond life, to ſee what is on the other ſide of the ſhore of this mortality, even eternall life and glory: All the Saints, eſpecially in theſe days, ſhould be ful of ſpirit, ſtrong in the might of the Lord, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is about to pul down that great enemy of his, That man of ſin, and in his conqueſt, he is ſaid to come with his garments dipt in blood, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>Now that true ſpirit that beſeemes one who hath this Lord of Hoſts to be his Father, is</p>
            <p n="1">1. A ſpirit that ſcornes to be baſe, he wil not be a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſlave to the Devill, or any luſt of his own or other mens, he thinks himſelf too good for ſin. If you ſet one that has the ſpirit of a Soldier in him to drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he ſcornes it; he thinks himſelf above any ſuch imployment; he has the true ſpirit of a Souldier, that has got the victory over himſelf. In this every ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of this Lord of Hoſts, hath a ſpirit above the great renowned Souldiers of the World, <hi>Alexander, Pompey, Themiſtocles, &amp;c.</hi> they were all vaſſals to their luſts.</p>
            <p>And although he be willing to ſerve men under God, yet he will never be a ſlave to their luſts, but will maintain the liberty of a man and a Chriſtian to himſelf and poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> reports of a Heatheniſh people, who
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95477:52"/>
in their wars, uſed onely this expreſſion to put ſpirit into their Souldiers, <hi>Eſtote viri, libertas agitur,</hi> be men, your liberty is in queſtion.</p>
            <p>But what is this bondage, that the ſpirit of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> will not, ſhould not beare?</p>
            <p>There is a naturall ſlavery, that as a man, he ſhould <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> not, he wil not be ſubject to, that is in theſe 3. things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To give up his own propriety in what he hath, ſo as whatſoever God and Nature hath given him ſhould not be his own, but wholly at the will of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Subjection to that government, that he no way either by himſelfe or others hath ever yeelded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto, neither is bound to by the Law of God in his word, nor by the Law of Nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To be in ſuch a condition as that whatſoever ſervice he doth, he ſhall receive nothing for it by way of juſtice, but meerly out of favour, this is ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which an ingenuous ſpirit cannot beare.</p>
            <p>And as a Chriſtian, he will not ſubject his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any, but reſerves that to doe his homage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by it.</p>
            <p>A ſpirit of the right breed though it foreſees dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in the cauſe of God, yet it can and doth reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely encounter with them. That ſpeech of <hi>Eſther</hi> was a ſpeech that came from a brave ſpirit, though a woman, <hi>If I periſh, I periſh;</hi> but it was a fruit of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayer. Ay, that is the way to get a ſpirit of courage indeed.</p>
            <p>The like we have of the three Children in <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>O Nebuchadnezar, we are not carefull to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thee in this matter; Behold, our God whom we ſerve, is able to deliver us out of thine hand, O King: But if not,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:95477:52"/>
               <hi>be it known unto thee, O King, that we wil not ſerve thy gods, nor worſhip thy golden image which thou haſt ſet up.</hi> That famous expreſſion of <hi>Paul</hi> hath the like true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an valour ſparkling in it, when it was propheſyed that he ſhould be bound at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at which many <note place="margin">Act. 21. 13</note> of the Saints with him fel on weeping, <hi>Why do you weep and break my heart?</hi> ſayes <hi>Paul: I am not onely ready to be bound at Jeruſalem, but to dye for the name of Chriſt.</hi> That expreſſion that is recorded of <hi>Ignatius</hi> is famous likewiſe in this kind; it is in an Epiſtle of his to the congregation of <hi>Trallis, Let the fire, the gallows, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of wild beaſts, the breaking of bones, the pulling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder of my members, the bruiſing or preſsing of my whole body, and the torments of the devill or hell it ſelf come upon me, ſo that I may win Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Here was one that had the Spirit of the Lord of Hoſts in him. The like had <hi>Luther,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>If all the tyles of the houſes of the City of Wormes were devils, he would go thither, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was called by God to witneſſe to the truth there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This reſoluteneſſe of ſpirit manifeſts it ſelf in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous times, in a readineſſe to joyne with our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in difficult ſervices, wherein there is much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and trouble. A man of a true raiſed ſpirit, that hath true courage in it, will not ſee his brethren in hot ſervices, and let them alone in them to ſhift out as well as they can; for his part he is loth to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or ſtir, he may bring himſelfe into trouble when he needs not, no, he will not, you cannot bring him to it: To ſuch men it may well be ſaid as <hi>Moſes</hi> to the children of <hi>Gad,</hi> and the children of <hi>Reuben, Numb.</hi> 32. 6. <hi>Shall your brethren goe to war, and ſhall ye ſit here?</hi> Why ſhall they encounter with dangers, and ſuffer hard things, and you ſit ſtill and have your eaſe? you
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95477:53"/>
may have ſhifts and pretences for this, but to you I ſay this day as <hi>Moſes</hi> to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>If ye will not joyne with your brethren, behold ye have ſinned againſt the Lord, and be ſure your ſin will find you out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A ſpirit of valour. Such a one as is indeed the ſpirit of a ſouldier of this Lord of Hoſts; when hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when troubles come, it is able to endure them. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>As a good ſouldier of Jeſus Chriſt, endure hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> Many ſeem to be reſolute before troubles come, but when they come, they cannot bear them. <hi>Romanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt fortia pati,</hi> a ſpeech of <hi>Mutius Scaevola:</hi> More true, <hi>Chriſtianum eſt fortia pati;</hi> if part of a <hi>Romane</hi> to ſuffer great things, much more of a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> If you be dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and cannot ſuffer, you are not fit to be a Chriſtian; <hi>Nimis delicatus es,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian,</hi> you are too delicate.</p>
            <p>The Eagle ſhews the generouſneſſe of her ſpirit, that though ſhe ſuffers hunger, ſhe will not make a noiſe, as other fowls do when they want meat; it is not for a ſouldier to complain of cold, of want of a meale or two, of hard lodging, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From this ability of his ſpirit to endure hardneſſe, 1. He doth not repent of his engagements of what he hath undertaken or done, when he meets with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and many ſore afflictions in his way, as the baſe ſpirit of a coward will do. That Scripture <hi>Exo.</hi> 13. 17. is very obſervable for this; God ſayes there, that he would not lead the people of Iſrael through the land of the Philiſtims, although that was neare; for God ſaid, <hi>Leſt peradventure the people repent them when they ſee war, and return into Egypt.</hi> God ſaw they were of a low, mean ſpirit, though they groaned under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Egypt, and cryed for deliverance, &amp; God had delivered them with a mighty hand, yet when they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95477:53"/>
met with any danger, they would begin to repent that ever they came out of Egypt, and wiſh themſelves there again. And indeed we find in the Hiſtory of their being in the Wilderneſſe, that upon every ſtrait they were in, they began to murmur, and often ſaid, <hi>Oh that we were in Egypt again:</hi> But what would they have done then if they had preſently met with wars, when the Spies told them of the children of <hi>Anak,</hi> that they muſt fight with? When they were even at the borders of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they were diſouraged, &amp; were about making themſelves a Captain to return to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt: Theſe were men of a poore vile ſpirit, hence <hi>God</hi> ſware againſt them, that none of them ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come into <hi>Canaan,</hi> onely <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who were men <hi>of another ſpirit,</hi> as the holy Ghoſt teſtifies of them, they ſhould go in &amp; poſſeſſe the land. Thus it is this day with us, how did we not long agoe groan under our bondage? our liberties, our religion, our eſtates were almoſt gone, we ſcarce knew what was our own; our Miniſters were baniſhed, every man that departed from evill made himſelf a prey, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, oppreſſion, cruelty prevailed throughout the Land. The whole Kingdome was filled with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and ſighs, and groans, by reaſon of their cruel bondage. Vile men were exalted, and men of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirits were caſt out as filth. Now when wee knew no means of help, but lay down under our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and were as a Kingdome devoted to miſery, then did the Lord appeare in a glorious manner, when he ſaw there was no man that would ſtand up and help. Nay ſuch was the malady, as it ſeemed even to be paſt help. The Lords owne arme hath brought ſalvation; never did God more wonderfully
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95477:54"/>
appeare for a nation, then he hath done for us; ſtrange have the workings of the Lord bin, and behold how great a deliverance hath he wrought, and he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an opportunity to this Kingdom to deliver it ſelf fully: if we have hearts, the thing is ſoon done. But now becauſe ſome troubles ariſe, becauſe we ſee war in our gates, how vile &amp; unworthy are the ſpirits of many? they begin to wiſh themſelves to be as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, they would rather return into <hi>Egypt</hi> again, we were better be as we were, we were not wont to hear the beatings of the Drum, the noiſe of the Cannon, the ratling of warlike inſtruments amongſt us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This ſtrength of ſpirit doth ſo ſupport him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heavieſt, ſoreſt afflictions, that he will never ſeek to deliver himſelf out of them, by forſaking the cauſe of God, or uſing any ſhifting indirect means, but as <hi>Paul</hi> told thoſe officers that were ſent from the Magiſtrates of <hi>Philippi</hi> to fetch him out of priſon, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 35, 36, 37. <hi>They have caſt us into priſon, let them come themſelves and fetch us out:</hi> in this <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewed what a ſpirit he had, he ſtood upon an honourable way of deliverance; the ſame doth every true ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Chriſt ſtand upon, God himſelf hath brought me into affliction, now temptation ſhewes ſome back door to get out of it ſlily, Nay, ſaies a ſpirit of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, certainly I will never go out that way, let the Lord come himſelf and fetch me out.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A ſpirit beſeeming the childe of this great Captain, aims at doing great things for God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and enjoying great things from God, although with hazard of great troubles and afflictions, rather then will ſit down with ſmall things that are to be done or enjoyed with eaſe and ſafety; ſometimes God

It is otherwiſe with a true raiſed ſpirit that hath courage and magnanimity in it, ſuch an one rejoyceth in Gods highnes, as we have the expreſſion, <hi>Iſay</hi> 13. 3. <hi>I have commanded my ſanctfied ones, I have alſo called my mighty ones, even them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in my highneſſe.</hi> If God hath <hi>high things</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, theſe <hi>Sanctified ones, mighty ones,</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in this highneſſe of God, contrary to that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> of whom <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 14, 15. <hi>Iſſachar is a ſtrong Aſſe couching down betweene two burthens, and he ſaw that reſt was good, and the Land that it was pleaſant, and bowed his ſhoulder to beare, and became a ſervant to tribute:</hi> He was loath to hazard his peace, hee had good farms, a fat ſoile, he had rather live in the Countrey, bring up his cattell and be quiet, though he payes great taxes, and be brought to be very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, yet that he may not be troubled, his ſpirit can beare that ſervility; let who will minde great things, he loves to be quiet: This was a low, poore ſpirit, and his poſterity were for the generall very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and vile: For you ſhall finde in the diviſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> that <hi>Iſſachars lot fell in Galile, Joſh.</hi> 19. from the 18. <hi>ver.</hi> to the 23.

            <p>The example of <hi>David</hi> in this caſe is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. When <hi>Sauls</hi> ſervants told <hi>David</hi> that he might be the Kings ſonne in law, <hi>David</hi> was troubled at it, and did not ſeeme to entertain the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23. but when they after told him of the termes upon which he ſhould have this honour put upon him, that it was <hi>to bring an hundred of the foreskins of the Philiſtims, ver.</hi> 25. which was a work of difficulty and hazard, for on <hi>Sauls</hi> part it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded on purpoſe to be a ſnare to him, for ſo ſayes the Text, <hi>Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philiſtims;</hi> now marke, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. when <hi>Sauls</hi> ſervants told <hi>David</hi> theſe things, it pleaſed <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> well to be the Kings ſonne in law: that which he ſeemed to be troubled at, when it was propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded abſolutely, that he is well pleaſed with, when it is propounded with ſuch a condition as had ſome difficulty in it, wherby he had an opportunity to ſhew forth the excellencie of his ſpirit: A baſe low ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would have beene better pleaſed with it to have had ſuch a thing without any ſuch condition. It is reported of the Lyon, that ſuch is his ſpirit, as if he meetes with a prey that another hath killed before, he will not meddle with it, but he will ſeeke for one

to kil himſelfe; if it be done to his hand, as wee ſay, he cares not for it, but he will have one that ſhall be his own, that he muſt doe ſomething himſelfe for it, or elſe it pleaſeth him not.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A ſpirit of courage and true valour is not onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> able to ſuffer, willing to ſuffer, raiſed by ſufferings, but can rejoyce, triumph, glory in ſufferings, account ſufferings in a good cauſe great riches. When we ſit at home by our fire ſides, and have our tables furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with varietie of diſhes, and goe to our ſoft beds, and have the curtains drawne cloſe, we pitty poore ſouldiers that now lye abroad in the ſtormes, upon cold earth, who drinke water, and often want bread, yea many that might have fulneſſe enough at home: but that warlike ſpirit of theirs is above theſe things; they can rejoyce in their hardſhips, as much as you in all your abundance. They think their lives more comfortable then yours, becauſe they are in ſervice for the publique; they have opportunity to doe worthily in their generations; and you, what do you doe? you ſit at home, and have your eaſe, and pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per your ſelves, and doe nothing; they would not by any meanes live your lives. A true ſouldier like ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is in his true element when he is in the midſt of all the hardſhips of warres, he loves to live and dye in ſuch a condition. Thus the Apoſtle, a true ſouldier of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>We glory in tribulations. Moſes</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>the reproach of Chriſt greater riches then all the treaſures of Egypt, Heb.</hi> 11. 27. <hi>Ignatius</hi> hath this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>He had rather be a Martyr then a Monarch:</hi> When he heard his bones craſh between the wilde beaſts teeth, <hi>Now,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>I begin to be a Chriſtian, Cruaelitas veſtra eſt gloria noſtra,</hi> ſayes <hi>Tertullian</hi> to

the perſecutors, Your cruelty is our glory. Many of the Martyrs prepared themſelves for their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, as Brides uſe to prepare themſelves for their Bridegroomes, with joy and gladneſſe of heart. The wounds they receive in the cauſe of Chriſt have more glory iſſue forth from them then blood; they are an ornament to them, they put a beauty upon them. They account it far better to loſe for God, then to enjoy for themſelves; that part of their eſtates they part with in a good cauſe, they account the beſt part of their eſtates; they account themſelves more rich in that, then in what they ſtill retaine. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. <hi>They take joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods.</hi> The reaſon of all is, becauſe their ſpirits are raiſed above crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comforts, their happineſſe conſiſts not in them, they are not beholding to them for their peace and joy, they can finde matter of joy in the parting with them, as well as in the having them, through that divine principle of holineſſe that God hath put into them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. A ſpirit of true courage hath all its fears ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the fear of God; it hath learned to feare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> nothing but God; and in order to God, it ſets the fear of God againſt all other fears. One man fears pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but I fear the God of heaven; another fears re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, but I fear the God of heaven; another impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, but I fear the God of heaven; another death, but I the God of heaven: It ſanctifies <hi>this Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and makes him to be the fear and the dread of it onely. <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Souldier, the Centurion of the <hi>Italian</hi> band, is commended for his feare of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 2. a ſtrange commendation of a ſouldier to be commended for feare, yes, for the feare of God: This

drives out all baſe fears; by this he comes to fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but to be feared by his enemies.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He reſerves all his valour for this <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> he hath no valour at all for ſin, there he is very fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, his heart ſhakes at the very temptation to it, and at the firſt riſings of it: there he ſeems to a worldling to be a very coward. Other men have ſpirit &amp; valour enough for ſin, (if we may call it valour) but none for God. This mans valour is all for God; in his owne cauſe he is very flexible, he manifeſts little ſpirit; but when the cauſe is Gods, then his heart riſes, there you may try him; many people have paſſionate gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder ſpirits, ſoon on fire in their own cauſe: If they be croſſed in their wils, oh how reſolute are they! They will, and they will; they care not, they care not what becomes of them, as if there were no ſuch men and women of reſolution like them; but in Gods cauſe they have no ſuch ſpirit, they are far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from reſoluteneſſe and courage there, they are not <hi>valiant for the truth,</hi> as <hi>Jer.</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 3. But it is our wiſdome, if we have any metall in us, any ſpirit of courage, not to laviſh it out in mean and unworthy things, in our own cauſes, but to reſerve it for God, God may call us to ſuch things as we may find need of all the metal and courage we have in our hearts, though it were much more then it is. When ſoldiers have but a little powder, and feare an enemie, they will not ſpend that they have vainly, but keep it till they have uſe of it; they know not what they may need. Be not you ſo preſently on fire; if you be croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, keep the activity, the vigour of your ſpirits for God, for the maintenance of his truth and cauſe.</p>

baſely. <hi>Viri fortis eſt aut pulchrè vivere, aut fortiter mori:</hi> It is the part of a valiant man either to live honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or to dye valiantly. It was a ſpeech of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and it was a true one, <hi>One of the two he will have, the world cannot hinder him:</hi> And as things are now, if we ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture our eſtates and lives to preſerve Religion, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties to our ſelves and our poſterity, God may, and we hope he will give us our lives, Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and ſo we may enjoy them with comfort and honour: Of if our eſtates and lives ſhould be loſt, ſuppoſe the worſt, they wil be loſt honourably: The loſſe of them wil be better then that enjoyment we ſhall have of them (if I may at all call it an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment) that wee are like to have of them, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now be ventured; What will our eſtates or lives be worth, if our Religion be gone, faithful Miniſters be gone, the Saints be fled, impriſoned or maſſacred? When our Liberties are gone, our Lives then wil hardly be worth the account of the lives of Men, much leſſe of Chriſtians. He muſt needs be very greedy of a life, that deſires it upon ſuch terms. Wee reade of <hi>Anchiſes, Aeneas</hi> his father, when <hi>Aeneas</hi> would have ſaved his life in ſuch a way as he judged not to be honourable, he makes this anſwer to him, <hi>Abſit ut exciſa poſsim ſupervivere Troja,</hi> God forbid that I ſhould out-live <hi>Troy.</hi> If it be ſpoiled, what is my life worth? Wil our lives be worth the taking up in the ſtreets, if we out-live our Religion and Liberties? Put all theſe together, and here is a ſpirit indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming our relation to this <hi>Lord of Hoſts:</hi> Had wee ſuch ſpirits, how comfortably may we paſſe this our pilgrimage? we might goe through all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and oppoſitions, conquering and to conquer. The
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95477:57"/>
world and devil would have little heart to meddle with us, we ſhould free our ſelves from many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, we ſhould honour our profeſſion, we ſhould do God abundance of ſervice, &amp; at laſt have an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant entrance into the everlaſting Kingdome of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. An Army of ſuch ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers would be the moſt glorioos ſight in the world. We reade of the Suns ſtanding ſtil once, and it was to behold the proweſſe of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that brave ſoldier, and to enlighten his conqueſts: If ever it ſtand ſtil againe, it is like it wil be to admire ſuch a glorious ſight.</p>
            <p>Let the coſideration of the glory of our God in this his Name, teach us to give glory to him, for all <note place="margin">Uſe ult.</note> the good we enjoy by Armies, it is all from him. He hath of late been exceeding gracious to our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; he ſhewed himſelfe indeed <hi>The Lord of Hoſts</hi> in that batel at <hi>Keynton.</hi> This was the acknowledgment both of General, Captains and Souldiers: Never leſſe of man in ſuch a buſineſſe, never more of God. The Lord was ſeen in the Mount; He ſhewed us that it ſhould not be by a multitude that hee would helpe us, it was by his ſpirit comming mightily upon a handful that were left in compariſon of the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. When the adverſary thought, yea cryed out the day was theirs, God turned it ſuddenly by a mighty hand. O how free is the grace of the Lord to us in this! That Scripture <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 5. is fully made good to us, <hi>Iſrael hath not been forſaken, nor Judah of his God, of the Lord of Hoſts; though their land was filled with ſin againſt the Holy one of Iſrael.</hi> The fulneſſe of ſin in us hath not abated the fulneſſe of grace in God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. <hi>The Lord is God, the Lord is God, he is the Lord of Hoſts, holy and reverent is his Nause.</hi>

               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:95477:58"/>
There have been times wherein the Lord hath dealt in another manner, even with his own people: &amp; that I may ſet forth unto you the fulneſſe and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods goodneſſe to us in our preſervation, from being delivered up to the rage of vile men: I will ſhew you what the ſeverity of God in this kinde hath been towards his own people who were as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of mercy as we. We muſt not think that every particular is to be applyable to us onely in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; thus far the conſideration of the grievous affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Church formerly, ſets out Gods goodnes to us in preventing ſuch evils amongſt us: So that it cannot be ſaid it is with us as it was with them. Not long after God had delivered his people out of their Captivity, therein fulfilling many gracious promiſes to them, and they being returned, built the Temple and the wals of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there was a glorious refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the work of the Lord went on proſperouſly, through many and great difficulties. Yet after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, when <hi>Antiochus</hi> roſe up againſt them, God ſuffered him to prevaile exceedingly in all his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like affaires againſt them. <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>There came a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle horn, which waxed exceeding great,</hi> not onely <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South, and towards the Eaſt, but towards the pleaſant Land,</hi> that is, towards the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> for indeede it was a pleaſant Land. The word ſignifies <hi>Decus, gloria, ornamentum,</hi> towards the glory and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the whole world. So was that Countrey eſpecially in regard the worſhip of God had beene newly ſet up againe in that Countrey: Yet <hi>Antiochus</hi> comes againſt it, and waxeth great for a while, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at firſt he was but a little horne, for he was a younger brother, and had beene a priſoner not long
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95477:58"/>
before in <hi>Rome,</hi> but now having got liberty and ſome command, he rageth eſpecially againſt the people of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>He waxed great even to the Hoſt of heaven.</hi> Here the Church is called <hi>The Hoſt of heaven;</hi> howſoever deſpiſed by the world, yet this <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> accounts his Church <hi>The Hoſt of heaven,</hi> and yet <hi>Antiochus</hi> waxeth great againſt this. We have many through Gods mercy in our Hoſt, godly and faithfull, but we preſume not to give it this title that God gives his people, The Hoſt of heaven, and yet God ſuffers the enemie to prevaile againſt that Hoſt, and is pleaſed to magnifie his mercy to ours, to give them ſo great a deliverance, yea ſo to prevaile againſt that, as <hi>to caſt down ſome of the Hoſt, and of the ſtarres down to the ground, and to ſtamp upon them.</hi> He prevailes as if now he had power over the heavens, to pull down the ſtarres, and to ſtamp upon them. The more eminent any are, the more is he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged; if they be ſtarres in this heaven, if he can get to them, he puls them down and ſtamps upon them. Oh the rage of our adverſaries againſt the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Miniſters of our Kingdome! They ſtamp for anger that they have them not, and if they had them, how would they ſtamp then? That which one <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> did there, many Atheiſts and Papiſts would gladly doe amongſt us if they had power; but this Lord of Hoſts delivers us in mercie from them: yea, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>He magnifies himſelfe even to the Prince of the Hoſt,</hi> to this Lord of hoſts, he ſets himſelfe againſt him. Oh! what rage even againſt God himſelfe? what horrid blaſphemies are there againſt this <hi>Prince of the Hoſt</hi> of his people? but although he doth magnifie himſelfe and blaſpheme, ſurely he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95477:59"/>
prevaile againſt <hi>the Prince of this Hoſt:</hi> yes, he is ſuffered for the preſent to take away the daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and to caſt down the place of his Sanctuary, and <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>An Hoſt was given him againſt the daily Sacrifice by reaſon of tranſgreſsion, and caſt it down the truth to the ground, and it practiſed, and proſpered,</hi> upon which the people of God were exceedingly troubled, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>One Saint ſpeakes to another Saint asking this queſtion,</hi> (with hearts full of ſorrow enough, God knowes) <hi>How long ſhall the viſion be concerning the daily ſacrifice, and the tranſgreſsion of deſolation, to give both the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary and the Hoſt to be troden under foote?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you ſee that for any to ſet himſelfe againſt Gods worſhip, is to ſet himſelfe againſt God himſelfe, proud malicious adverſaries, eſpecially aime at this, and God here ſuffered the adverſary to prevaile even againſt this; God proceedes againſt his people for their tranſgreſſion, an Hoſt comes upon them; yea, the Text ſayes, if we obſerve it, that an <hi>Hoſt was given him againſt the daily Sacrifice, by reaſon of tranſgreſsion: Antiochus</hi> had never been able to raiſe ſuch an Hoſt, had it not beene for the tranſgreſſions of Gods people; yea ſo far was God provoked with the tranſgreſſion of his people, as that hee ſuffered this Hoſt raiſed againſt them, <hi>to caſt downe the truth to the ground, to practiſe and to proſper.</hi> We have cauſe to lay our hands upon our hearts, to acknowledge our tranſgreſſions as great as any they were charged with; and yet although God hath thus far chaſtiſed us as to raiſe an Hoſt againſt us, yea ſuch a one (ſo many of them being Papiſts, and ſuch horrid blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers) as we have cauſe enough to feare they would take away the daily Sacrifice, and caſt down
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95477:59"/>
ſo much of the Sanctuary as is built up already, and even caſt down the truth to the ground, but oh the riches of the infinite goodneſſe of our gracious God! he hath not ſuffered them, he hath turned the rage of man to his praiſe, hee hath wrought gloriouſly for us, he hath delivered us out of their power, (although many of our brethren ſuffer hard things) we may yet have the daily Sacrifice and the Sanctuary, that is, the true worſhip of God amongſt us if we will, yet the truth is preached in our Congregations, it is held forth in the beauty and excellencie of it, it is not caſt down to the ground, they indeed have practiſed, but through Gods mercy to us they have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered, this is of <hi>the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> let this glorious name of his bee magnified by us for ever.</p>
            <p>Yea, yet further, for the ſetting out mercie to us, that glory may be given to <hi>this Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what the Holy Ghoſt ſayes, <hi>ver.</hi> 23, 24, 25. of this 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> concerning Gods taking advantage againſt his people for their ſins, which hee hath not done againſt us, as it appeares this day. <hi>When the</hi>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95477:60"/>
by the help of thoſe about him he ſhall make ſuch expoſitions of darke things, as a man would wonder at it, no man could have thought that ſuch things could have beene pickt out of paſſages as he ſhall pick up, and by this he ſhall bee able to put ſuch a colour upon the fouleſt things, as they ſhall appeare very ſpecious to many.</p>
            <p>And his power likewiſe ſhall <hi>be mighty, God will ſuffer him to grow to a great ſtrength, but not by his own power,</hi> ſo ſayes the Text, although you could not ſee how he could raiſe any ſuch power of his own, yet <hi>he ſhall have a great power,</hi> he ſhall have money, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, ſtrength, from forreigne Princes, or as ſome would have it, God himſelfe ſhall give power to him, beyond what he hath of his own. Surely if the power againſt the Church be Gods rather then the adverſaries own, then the power for deliverance of the Church muſt be acknowledged to bee Gods rather then our own, but I rather take the former ſenſe to be the intent of the Holy Ghoſt in that place.

               <hi>Alexander</hi> was asked, How he did ſo great things in ſo little a time?

opportunity came, but the other uſed to ſtay till op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity was loſt, <hi>Antiochus</hi> was no ſuch <hi>Cunctator,</hi> ſtayer till opportunity was loſt, he practiſed and ſo proſpered; and becauſe he proſpered, therefore he ſtil further practiſed. But when he ſaw delaying, and gaining time might advantage him, then hee would ſeek to put off, and ſpin out time as much as he could. There is a famous ſtory of <hi>Pompilius,</hi> being ſent by the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> to this <hi>Antiochus,</hi> to declare to him the pleaſure of the Senate, that he muſt not goe to <hi>Egypt; Antiochus</hi> now requires time to deliberate, but <hi>Pompilius</hi> makes a circle about him with the ſtaffe he had in his hand, and told him he muſt not goe out of that circle, til he had given his abſolute anſwer, <hi>I</hi> or <hi>No:</hi> But <hi>Antiochus</hi> would faine have put him off with a complement, but <hi>Pompilius</hi> rejects his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, and bids him anſwer ſpeedily, otherwiſe he knew what to doe. Theſe ſpeedy reſolutions are of mighty advantage in many of the great affaires of the world, eſecially when we have to deale with cunning adverſaries, who lye to catch advantages. The Text farther ſayes, <hi>He ſhall deſtroy wonderfully,</hi> he ſhall make ſuch ſpoile of faire plentifull countries, make ſuch waſte where he comes, leave all ſo poore and miſerable, as will be a wonder for any to ſee it, who knew the Countrey in the plenty and riches of it, but a few weeks before he came into it, <hi>Yea he ſhall deſtroy the mighty and the holy people,</hi> men of brave ſpirits, even gracious, godly men, and ſtout, valiant men, yet they ſhall fall before him: And <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>Through his policie alſo he ſhall cauſe craft to proſper in his hand:</hi> If there be any devices, ſhifts, cunning under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minings, any falſe wayes in the world, <hi>he will make</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:95477:61"/>
               <hi>uſe of them, and he ſhall get advantage by them, and he ſhall magnifie himſelfe in his heart.</hi> When he hath got an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage any way, by falſifying promiſes, proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or by what means ſoever, it ſhall pleaſe him at the heart, he ſhall magnifie himſelf in his very heart, and <hi>others about him ſhall puffe him up, and ſeek to magnifie him, and by peace he ſhall deſtroy many:</hi> That is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By promiſing peace, by treatles of peace, they ſhall think all is well, now there will be peace, and ſo being ſecure, he ſhall come upon them unawares, and deſtroy many.</p>
            <p>Or 2. by peace, that is, by his proſperity that he ſhal enjoy, all ſhal account him happy, &amp; thereby be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to joyn with him; they ſhal promiſe to themſelves to be delivered from many troubles by comming in to him, <hi>Surely he will have the better of it, it is beſt for our ſafety (if we would hold our lands and eſtates) to come in &amp; joyne with him,</hi> and thus <hi>by his peace he ſhall deſtroy many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or 3. <hi>In pace,</hi> in peace, <hi>Calvin</hi> interprets thus: <hi>In a ſilent quiet way he ſhall withdraw himſelfe and his Forces; there ſhall not be much noiſe of him, but hee ſhall weary the Forces of the other and their party, and gaine time and advantages of them.</hi> When he ſeems to be quiet, and comes not againſt them in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile way, <hi>even then ſhall he deſtroy many,</hi> yea <hi>hee ſhall ſtand up againſt the Prince of Princes.</hi> He ſhall not acknowledge the Majeſty, the power of God, he ſhal ſet himſelf againſt thoſe waies of Providence that are apparently againſt him, howſoever he will not ſee it; but then ſayes the Text, <hi>he ſhall be broken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hand.</hi> God himſelf in ſome wonderfull way that you know not of ſhall break him, when all means faile, and all people ſhall be afraid that all will come
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95477:61"/>
to ruine and miſery, <hi>then ſhall he be broken without hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVe complaine much of ſad things that we ſuffer, but we ſuffer not ſuch things as the people of God, ſo deare unto him, ſuffered in thoſe times. Our ſins cry as loud as theirs for the like miſeries; but God is free in his grace. It is from the Lord of Hoſts that we are preſerved from ſuch fearful evils as theſe.</p>
            <p>It may be ſome may ſay, Why, are we in any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuch miſeries as the Jews ſuffered under <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If bloody Papiſts, and curſing and blaſpheming Cavaliers might have their wils on us, our miſeries would ſoon parallel theirs, if not riſe above them, ſeeing ſo many of them are got together, and they are growne to ſuch a height in their rage, it is onely from this great Lord of Hoſts that they break not in upon us as a deluge of the moſt hideous woes, and dreadful miſeries that ever befel any Chriſtian Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the face of the earth: but bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. Let the Crown of all our mercies, and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of that great mercy in the late battel be ſet upon the head of this glorious Lord of Hoſts. We reade 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 27, 28. when <hi>Joab</hi> fought againſt <hi>Rabbah,</hi> when the work was almoſt done, he ſent to <hi>David</hi> to come and take the City, that he might have the glory of it, that the Kings Crowne which was of gold and precious ſtones might be, ſet upon <hi>Davids</hi> head. Although God hath made uſe of inſtruments in this great work, and due honour is to be given to them, yet let the crown of the work be ſet upon the head of the Lord of Hoſts.</p>

            <p>God is the Lord of Hoſts in reſpect of that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute command he hath over all creatures, he hath all creatures in heaven and earth under him, as a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hath his Souldiers: The Angels they are his Hoſts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 17. <hi>The Charyots of God are twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, even thouſands of Angels, The Lord is among them as in Sinai.</hi> In the Hebrew, the word is in the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar number <hi>the Charet,</hi> to note the joynt-ſervice of all the Angels, they are but as one Charet, although they be many thouſands, yea Myriads of thouſands as we have it here, there never is any mutiny amongſt theſe Souldiers, their harmony is moſt bleſſed, their union firm, indiſſoluble.

            <p>But the chiefe thing I intend in this is to ſhew you the glory of God in this title of his, from this conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God is glorious in this that he hath an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great Army: The greatneſſe of an Army is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> glory of a Generall, now Gods Army onely of his Angels that are about him, is very great, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>Thouſand thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him.</hi> His Army of <hi>Locuſts</hi>

is called <hi>a great Army, Joel</hi> 2. 25. this then of the Angels is much more to be eſteemed a great Army.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Army is exceeding ſtrong and powerfull, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and in this likewiſe the glory of a General conſiſts much; God did but ſend one of his Captains he hath with him in heaven, and in one night he ſlew one hundred fourſcore and foure thouſand of the Hoſt of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 35.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He hath multitudes of Armies, it is the glory <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of a great Prince to have many Armies in the field at once, one in one place, another in another place, and ſo compaſſing round about his adverſaries with his Armies: <hi>The Lord of Hoſts</hi> hath Armies in the heavens, Armies in the aire, armies in the ſeas, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies on the earth diſperſed in every Countrey, all the whole world is filled with the multitudes of the Armies of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All theſe Armies of the Lord are always in a readineſſe, they are prepared Armies, it is but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> out the word and they fall on; they are in battel array, evermore ready armed to doe the pleaſure of their Generall: No Prince, no Commander hath thus his Armies always in readineſſe; many times when they have uſe of them, much time is loſt in getting Companies together, and in getting their Arms.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Gods Armies alwaies accompliſh what God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by them, they alwayes proſper in their fight, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> they are never conquered, but effect what God ſends them for. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140. 8. <hi>Fire, haile, ſnow, vapour, ſtormy wind, fulfilling his word:</hi> Many of you Mariners wil not fulfil Gods word, but God when he hath you at Sea he ſends ſtormie winds, and they fulfill Gods

            </p>
            <p>How many men, who think themſelves great, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane themſelves as if they thought themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Gods Commandments? but the <hi>Angels</hi> that <hi>excel in ſtrength, they doe his Commandments, they hearken to the voice of his word:</hi> They ſtand liſtening to heare what it is that God hath to command them, and are ready to obey. And that which is ſaid of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> is true of all Gods <hi>Hoſts,</hi> for ſo it followes, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Bleſſe ye the Lord all ye his Hoſts, ye miniſters of his that do his pleaſure: Bleſſe ye the Lord all his works, in all places of his dominion.</hi> God ſayes to one, <hi>Doe this and hee doth it;</hi> to another, <hi>Come, and he commeth:</hi> yea Gods Armies are ready to deſtroy themſelves in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their Lord. The command of a Generall in an Armie is powerfull; he may keep his Armie from ſpoile if he pleaſe. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Pompey</hi> tels of him, that hearing of his ſoldiers offering violence in an unjuſt way, he cauſed all their ſwords to be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up, ſo as no man dared break open the ſeale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave. He did more then bid them, yea more then command them that they ſhould not ſpoile. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>

There are no other creatures but devils and men but doe readily and faithfully fight for God, and even theſe God forces to fight for him whether they will or no, even then when they ſeeme to fight moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. As many men who ſay they defie the devil, yet even then are the ſlaves of the devil, and doe his will; ſo many whoſe hearts and wayes are oppoſite to God, yet even then God uſeth them to fight for him, and to accompliſh his own purpoſes.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The glory of Gods infinite wiſdom appeares <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> in all his Armies, in putting of them into moſt come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order, guiding, keeping them conſtantly in their ſeverall ranks; which order and ſhining wiſdom in it were we able to ſee, it would amaze us with the luſtre of it. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 7. it is ſaid of the Locuſts, <hi>They ſhall march every one in his wayes, and they ſhall not breake their ranks, neither ſhall one thruſt another, they ſhall walk every one in his path.</hi> To order and guide in ranks ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite multitudes of Armies, is infinitely beyond the skil of any Commander upon the earth. When <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 104. was meditating upon the glory of God in his works, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. In the midſt of his meditation he could not hold, but breakes forth with admiring expreſſions at Gods wiſdome in them all, <hi>O Lord how manifold are thy works! in wiſdome haſt thou made them all, the earth is full of thy riches.</hi> Let our hearts be raiſed in our meditations of the riches of Gods wiſdome, appearing in marſhalling all his Armies. Certainly if wee did look into this, and cauſe our thoughts to dwel upon it, it would cure us of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical thoughts. How is it poſſible but a God muſt needs be acknowledged, where ſuch admirable art and skil appeares, even in the works of nature, which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95477:65"/>
they know nothing of themſelves? Is it poſſible for any man that ſhould ſee a mighty Army marching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long all in comely order, and yet think that all theſe men fell into this order meerly by accident, as they came running together? muſt he not needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that here ſurely hath been the military art of ſome skilfull Commanders working? The ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of a God, of his wiſdome muſt there needs be, if we ſaw in what order all creatures are put.</p>
            <p n="8">8. All theſe Armies God maintains every day at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> his own charge, and ſo hath done ſince the beginning of the world. They live wholly upon him, and yet are not at all burdenſome unto him. He is yet as rich as ever he was, as able to maintain them all as ever; yea and many thouſands more if he pleaſed. This ſurely is a great God.</p>
            <p n="9">9. God is able to put as much power as he pleaſeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> into the leaſt creature, to raiſe it above the nature of it, ſo as though it be never ſo poore and weak in it ſelfe, he can make it irreſiſtible. Hence it is that God by contemptible means hath ſo often brought down the power, the rage, the pride of the great ones of the earth: how terrible was he to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the very <hi>flyes?</hi> that is obſervable; whereas upon the judgement of the <hi>Haile,</hi> he did but promiſe that he would let <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> goe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 28. but upon Gods Army of <hi>flies</hi> he bids them goe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 8. But that place <hi>Joel</hi> 2. is moſt remarkable for this; obſerve what high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions God hath of a mighty Army of his, and the truth is, it was but an Army of <hi>Locuſts</hi> and <hi>Caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95477:67"/>
of him as <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> we need never feare want of Souldiers, ſeeing all creatures in heaven and earth are his armed trained Souldiers, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is infinite in himſelf. Oh how happy ſhould we be, if we could in all our ſtraits exerciſe faith in this Lord of Hoſts, looking upon him in this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration!</p>
            <p>You will ſay, It is true, this Lord of Hoſts is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a full object of faith, were it not that we have ſorely provoked him to come out againſt us; yea we are afraid he is now appearing in wrath againſt us.</p>
            <p>I will give you one Text of Scripture in ſuch a caſe as this is, when your provocations of him lye heavy upon you, and it is as ſweet, and full, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a Scripture as any I know, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 17. The Lord had profeſſed in the beginning of the Chapter, that he had been ſore diſpleaſed with their Fathers, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. yea and it appeares by the 3. and 4. <hi>ver.</hi> that they were no better then their Fathers, and <hi>ver.</hi> 12. it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts had had indignation againſt Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem theſe threeſcore and ten yeeres;</hi> ſo that even at that preſent when the Prophet ſpake to them, it ſeemes God was in ſuch a way towards them, as his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation appeared againſt them: but that their hearts might break, and their faith be raiſed; marke what a gracious promiſe comes in to them even now, in this 17. <hi>ver.

            </p>
            <p>And further, it is moſt honourable to joyne with, to be under this Generall. Souldiers boaſt much of the power, greatneſſe, magnificence of their Generall; they account themſelves honoured by it. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have infinite cauſe to make their boaſt of this Lord of Hoſts, under whoſe banners they fight, <hi>he is their praiſe and their glory. Pſal.</hi> 148. God is gloriouſly ſet forth with his Hoſts about him. The concluſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. is this, <hi>He is the praiſe of all his Saints:</hi> Not onely Objectively, becauſe the Saints are exerciſed in his praiſes; but Relatively, he is a praiſe and honour to his Saints; his Saints glory in this, that they ſerve under ſuch a Commander. There are two Captains in the world, under whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95477:68"/>
all the world ſerve, this Lord of hoſts, and the Devil, for he alſo hath his Armies fighting for him, the Dragon and his Angels; all wicked men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and fight for him: his great Lieutenant is <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> It is no diſhonour to run from theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, to get under the Banners of the Lord of Hoſts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us honour this Lord of hoſts by being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be put into what rank he ſhall pleaſe, to be ordered in what place he ſhall appoint, and there to keep out ranks. If God wil put us in the fore-front, where there is hotteſt ſervice, let us not murmur; the hotter the ſervice is, the greater will the reward be. We muſt not chooſe our own places. All other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, except the Angels, are onely paſſive to the work of their Lord in ordering them. We ſhould be active in yeelding our ſelves freely to his ordering, and be well pleaſed with it, and keep our ranks. It is an eaſie matter to keep rank whilſt we march along; but when we come to fight, we ſhall not find it ſo.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, how dreadfull muſt this glorious name of God needs be to all ungodly ones, who walk on in wayes of enmity againſt ſuch a God? <hi>Eſay</hi> 45. 9. <hi>Woe to him that ſtriveth with his Maker: let the potſheard ſtrive with the potſheards of the earth.</hi> With what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite indignation muſt God needs look upon ſuch vile wormes, who dare reſiſt ſuch a glorious Majeſty as he is? God can but ſpeak to any humour of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and it ſhall make thee lye roaring out in anguiſh, and grievous torture; thy life ſhall be more bitter then death unto thee. This God may give commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the next crumbe of bread, and it ſhall choak thee, and ſend thee down to hell.</p>

God himſelfe is againſt thee, he walks contrary to thee in all his Attributes. The ſwords point of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Juſtice is at thine heart. All the creatures of God ſtand ready armed againſt thee, and would fly upon thee, if God did but give out the word. The Angels ſtand prepared, <hi>Lord ſhall but one of us goe and cut off that wretch who dares preſume to blaſpheme thy name, to lift up himſelfe againſt thee?</hi> As <hi>Abiſhai</hi> ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 9. <hi>Why ſhould this dead dog curſe my Lord the King? let me goe and take off his head.</hi> The Ayre cryes, <hi>Lord ſhall I conveigh infection into his body, and poyſon him?</hi> The Water, <hi>Shall I ſtop his breath?</hi> The Fire, <hi>ſhall I ſeize on him, and burne him?</hi> The earth, <hi>Shall I open, and ſwallow him up?</hi> The beaſts of the field, <hi>Shall we run upon him, and tear him?</hi> Thy meat, thy drink, <hi>Shall we choak him, or be bane to him?</hi> Thou art in the midſt of Gods Hoſts, compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout on every ſide. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>When Judah loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked back, behold the battel was before and behind, and they cryed unto the Lord.</hi> Look about thee oh diſtreſſed ſoule, and ſee the Hoſts of the Lord before thee and behind thee, and cry to the Lord. Certainly there is no creature neere thee, but thou haſt cauſe to looke upon it with a ſhaking heart: thou knoweſt not but that it may be thy ruine, ſent of God to cut thee off, that thou mighteſt go to thine owne place. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it cannot be but ere long ſome creature or other will break in upon thee, and be an executioner of Gods wrath upon thee, if not prevented by thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. When God awakens a guilty conſcience, every creature is terrible to it, the wrath of God is ſeene in the face of every creature. <hi>Cain</hi> cryes out, <hi>Every one that meets me, will kill me.</hi> Why? Who was
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95477:69"/>
there in the world then to kill him? not many beſides his father and mother, and yet <hi>every one will kill him:</hi> eſpecially if it be ſome extraordinary work of God in the heavens, or ſeas, or elſewhere, as in extreame thunder, ſtormes and tempeſts, or the like: how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible is that to ſuch a conſcience, as to <hi>Caligula</hi> and others? The Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> prayed to God to open the eyes of his ſervant to ſee Gods Hoſts about him, to deliver him from feare: my prayer is, that God would open thine eyes, that thou mayſt ſee Gods Hoſts about thee, that thou mayſt feare: if thy eyes were open, it would be with thee as it was with thoſe who came there againſt <hi>Eliſha,</hi> when their eyes were <note place="margin">2 Kings 6. 17, 19.</note> opened they ſaw themſelves in the midſt of <hi>Samaria,</hi> in the midſt of their enemies. Certainly ſo long as God is thine enemy, all creatures in heaven &amp; earth are thine enemies. Wherefore conſider how unable thou art to ſtand out againſt this glorious God; lay down thy weapons of enmity, cry out bitterly of thy deſperate folly, make it thy great work above all things in the world, to make up thy peace with him. God yet offers mercy to thee, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did thoſe he warred againſt, while the Lamp burned: If they ſtaid untill it was out, there was nothing but bloud expected. The Lamp of thy life is ſtil burning; come in that thy ſoule may live. There is no ſtanding out againſt this God, he will have glory from thee in ſpight of thy heart.</p>

            <head>A briefe Anſwer to Doctor <hi>Fernes</hi> Booke, tending to reſolve Conſcience, about the Subjects taking up of Arms.</head>
            <byline>By JER. BURROUGHES.</byline>
            <p>
               <hi>THere came to my hand a Book of D.</hi> Fern, <hi>tending to reſolve Conſcience in the caſe of the Subjects taking up Armes. I find it carryed on without giving any ill termes, but in ſaw expreſſions, ſutable to a Treatiſe that concernes Conſcience, and the more likely to prevail with it. Onely now and then ſome bitternes breakes forth; I ſhall very briefly, yet faithfully give you the ſtrength of it: Where he ſpeakes right, I will acknowledge it; and where he miſtakes, I will fairly diſcuſſe and ſhew you whence the miſtakes ariſe. I confeſſe he hath great advantage in the ſubject, becauſe it is for the King:</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe it is ſafer to plead for the King, though a man miſtakes; but if there be a miſtake in leſſening the Kings right, a man endangers his utter undoing.</hi> 2. <hi>Truth about this argument, hath alwayes been tenderly handled; thoſe who have pleaded for the King, have with courage vented themſelves to the utmoſt; but others have been forced to be ſilent, or elſe but even to whisper and ſpeak halfe out, leſt they preſently meet with (not arguments, but) things of another nature to anſwer them. In which regard the power of Kings hath been raiſed to the height, and men have drunk in ſuch opinions of abſolute power in them, as they have heard confidently affirmed, practiſed, and ſeen in Books, and feeled by many taxations and cenſures; but whatſoever might informe them hath layne in the darke, not daring to appeare: Therefore well might the D. call what now people begin to heare, and enquire after, a new doctrine; it is an old truth, but newly diſcovering it ſelf. The name of</hi> King <hi>hath taken ſuch impreſſion in the hearts of people, that for a while they will be prejudiced againſt whatſoever may but ſound of limiting his power, or maintaining our right againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What there is in the Epiſtle that may prejudice any mans conſcience, will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in what follows.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="preamble">
               <head>Preamble to SECT. I.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SO many good people that are come to a ſenſe of Religion and godlineſſe, are miſerably carryed away by a ſtrange implicite ſaith, to beleeve whatſoever is ſaid or done in the name of the Parliament, &amp;c. to be infallibly true and juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems thoſe who have not a ſenſe of Religion, do not ſo eaſily beleeve the truth and juſtice of what is done in the name of the Parliament. This is moſt <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> certaine, who are hardeſt to beleeve what the Parliament ſayes, but Papiſts, and notorious blaſphemers, and prophane livers? I condemne not all, but compare the generality of the one ſide, and of the other; you ſhall finde an apparent difference in the lives of the one, from the lives of the other: Yea, ſo it is now that if a man as heretofore were not prophane, or looſe at leaſt, or zealous for ceremonies, he was accounted a <hi>Puritan;</hi> ſo now a <hi>Round-head,</hi> that is, in their ordinary interpretation, one for the Parliament.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, This is becauſe Religion is pretended on the Parliaments ſide: So it is on the other, with as loud a cry as the Parliaments. In ſuch things where I muſt have regard to humane teſtimony, to what part I ſee the moſt that have the ſenſe of Religion to adhere, that ſide I will be on, except I ſee better grounds
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95477:70"/>
then yet the D. brings to draw me from it. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>That thou mayſt walk in the way of good men, and keepe the paths of the righteous.</hi>

               <p>IN this <hi>Sect.</hi> theſe ſpecial things are conſiderable: 1. What he grants 2. what we grant. 3. What he ſayes we grant. He grants we may deny obedience to the King, not onely in things unlawfull by the Law of God, but by the eſtabliſhed Laws of the Land. It is well this is granted; Heretofore we know this was the generall Tenet, whatſoever was commanded by the King, yea by any men in authority, if but by a Prelate, except it were againſt Gods Law, we were bound to obey it; any thing that was not ſinne, muſt be yeelded to and that for conſcience ſake. The D. in this is ingenuous; he confeſſeth that not onely Gods Law, but mans Law limits Kings power: This is a great caſe to many mens conſciences to know ſo much.</p>
               <p>And further, if this be true, that all thoſe Scriptures that urge obedience to Kings and men in authority, muſt be underſtood with this limitation, that is, if they command according to the Laws of God, and according to the Laws of the countrey over which they are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſayes, <hi>In point of reſiſtance we grant it muſt be in ſuch a caſe where there are</hi> Omnes ordines regni conſentientes, <hi>an unanimous conſent of the two Houſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no determination that the greater part preſent of either Houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees upon, but is as truly valid and legal, as if there were an unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> of them both. It is ſo in all bodies where things are carried by vote.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſayes, <hi>We yeeld it muſt be a meere defenſive reſiſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the King ſhould ſend any to miſchiefe us, to ſay, we muſt onely defend our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo as not to offend them, is a contradiction; as for the Kings perſon, is it <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> not the profeſſion of the Parl. to defend it? therefore we neede not diſpute now, about defending our ſelves againſt it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſayes, <hi>this likewiſe is granted that the Prince muſt firſt be bent to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Religion, Liberties, and Laws, and will not diſcharge his truſt, before there muſt be reſiſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this he would inſinuate that our Arms taken up are unlawfull, becauſe the King hath not declared himſelfe thus. <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>What need we be put to meddle with any thing but this in the caſe in hand? That a Kingdom ſeeing it ſelf in imminent danger of enemies to infringe the liberties of it, may ſtand-up to defend it ſelfe; yea although they come forth againſt it in the name of the King: This is our caſe, and if the D. diſputes againſt any thing but this, he ſights with his own ſhadow.</p>
               <p>If this be caſe as certainly it is, then a great part of the Doctors book is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to the buſineſſe of the Parliaments raiſing forces: For forces may bee raiſed upon other grounds then the Kings being bent to overthrow Religion.</p>

               <head>SECT. II.</head>
               <p>THe ſtrength of this <hi>Section,</hi> and almoſt all the book, is in that place of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. and in this place I beleeve the D. will ſee, or if he doth not, others will, that he is utterly miſtaken in the ſenſe of that place.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſayes expreſly, <hi>Whoſoever reſiſts, ſhall receive damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he doth not ſay expreſly, whoſoever reſiſts the higheſt men ſhall receive damnation, but whoſoever ſhall reſiſt the power: <hi>Let every one be ſubject</hi> not <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> to the wills of the higheſt men, but <hi>to the higher power:</hi> there is a great deale
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95477:70"/>
of difference betweene theſe two: The higher power, that is, that authority that God, &amp; man hath put upon ſuch a man, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that muſt be ſubjected to, &amp; not reſiſted. We profeſſe againſt reſiſting power, authority, though abuſed: If thoſe who have power to make Laws, ſhall make ſinfull Laws, and ſo give authority to any to force obedience; we ſay here there muſt either be flying or paſſive obedience; but if one that is in authority command out of his own will, and not by Law, I reſiſt no power, no authority at all, if I neither actively nor paſſively obey, no I do not ſo much as reſiſt abuſed authority. This may ſeeme ſtrange at the firſt; but if you thinke of it, you will beleeve it. The D. thinkes the anſwer to this place is onely from the limitation of the perſon, or the cauſe of reſiſting, as if we held that no particular men upon any cauſe, but States may reſiſt upon ſuch and ſuch cauſes; whereas we doe not anſwer ſo, but we diſtinguiſh betweene the man that hath the power, and the power of that man, and ſay, although the power muſt not be reſiſted according to the letter, and the ſenſe of the Text, yet the illegall will and wayes of the man may be reſiſted, without the leaſt offending againſt the Text. But we ſhall meete with this Scripture again and again, and ſhall fellow it with anſwers accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He comes to examples, as firſt, the peoples reſcuing of Jonathan from Saul. He ſayes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>the people were in Arms already, and did but uſe a loving violence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This example is onely brought to prove that Subjects may withſtand illegal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Kings, and no further, and that it plainly proves; onely, he ſayes, it is <hi>a lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> 
                  <hi>violence.</hi> Well then, it is a violence; they reſolve that the Kings command ſhall not be fulfilled, yea though hee adds an oath to it. It was indeede a loving violence to <hi>Jonathan;</hi> ſo is all the violence that the Parliament offers, a loving violence to the Kingdome, yea and there is true love to the King too in it. The King hath not yet ſworn that he will have ſuch things as the Parl. will not ſuffer, ſo as to come to our cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſince; but <hi>Saul</hi> ſwore that he would have ſuch a thing done, and yet the people would not ſuffer it to be done, and yet you dare not blame them for this, nay you commend them for it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond example is, <hi>David</hi> reſiſting <hi>Saul,</hi> the D. ſayes, <hi>It was to ſave his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from Cut-throats.</hi>

               <p>But examine the place, you ſhall finde it as certain as a ſuppoſition can be; It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares plainly that <hi>David</hi> had ſome expectation that the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would have <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> ſtood to him and kept oft <hi>Saul</hi> comming againſt him, and if they would, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by the Text, that <hi>David</hi> would have ſtood to it though <hi>Saul</hi> had come againſt him.

               <p>
                  <hi>Hi, laſt anſwer to</hi> Davids <hi>example is, that his example was extraordinary becauſe he was anointed to be King after</hi> Saul.</p>
               <p>But yet for the preſent he was a private man, although God had beſtowed ſomthing <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> extraordinary upon him more then upon other men; but it follows not therefore that in this caſe he had an extraordinary power to reſiſt the Prince: Prince <hi>Charls</hi> hath no more power to reſiſt his Father then the Parliament hath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the example of Eliſha uſing the Kings meſſenger rough'y, that came to take away his head, he ſayes it ſayes little to the queſtion in hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet he grants as much as it is brought for, that defence is lawful againſt ſudden and <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> illegall aſſaults of Meſſengers ſent by the King; if againſt ſudden, why not againſt deliberate and plotted? for, they are worſe: This is one end of the raiſing of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to prevent ſuch aſſaults: If it be lawful to be done by violence by 2. or 3. when the meſſenger is but one, then it may be done by 2. or 3000. when the meſſengers are 1000.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the example of the Prieſts thruſting out the leprous King.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1 Chro. 26</note> That which this is brought to prove, is thus much, That there may be ſuch unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> in a King, that may cauſe Subjects lawfully to reſiſt him, when he would doe a wicked act.</p>
               <p>The Doctor ſayes, <hi>Firſt Gods hand was upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So when God ſhall leave a King to ſome horrible way of evil, certainly Gods hand is upon him then.</p>

               <p>But the Scripture tels us, the Prieſts likewiſe thruſt him out; they would not ſuffer <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> him to be in the Temple.</p>
               <p>The next thing in the Sect. is, a ſimilitude from the naturall body: <hi>Though a member may defend it ſelfe againſt outward violence, yet no member muſt be ſet againſt the head, for that tends to the diſſolution of the whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the ſimilitude may be followed, we ſay, that ſome members are as neceſſary to the life of the head, as the head is neceſſary to the life of thoſe members.</p>

               <p>But that example of <hi>Eliſha</hi> is brought to prove the lawfulnes of uſing force againſt Kings in uſing violence: and what violence hath been already uſed, the world knows.</p>

                  <hi>Page</hi> 10. He comes to Scriptures, <hi>denying reſiſtance:</hi> let us ſee what full Scriptures theſe are.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> The firſt is, <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 1. <hi>&amp;c. The conſpiracie of Corah and his company againſt Moſes and Aaron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſtrange that this example muſt be paralleld with our Parl. taking up Arms: Was <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95477:71"/>
it not a moſt unjuſt and vile conſpiracie, meerly out of the pride of malicious ſpirits? Can the D. or any man think, that in juſtifying Arms in ſome caſe, we juſtifie all villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous conſpiracies and out-rages?</p>
               <p>Beſides, this place condemns riſing up againſt the Prieſt, as well as the King. Yea cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if they had riſen againſt the meaneſt officer that God had appointed in Church or Common-wealth, as here they did againſt <hi>Moſes &amp; Aaron,</hi> it would have bin a very hainous offence; Yea if <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf ſhould have thus riſen againſt any Officer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, it had bin a vile ſin in him; therefore this proves no more againſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects reſiſting Princes, then Princes reſiſting ſubjects, or one ſubject reſiſting another.</p>
               <p>Further, we do not riſe againſt His Majeſty, as they roſe up againſt <hi>Moſes &amp; Aaron;</hi> we deſire not that he ſhould have leſſe power then God &amp; the Laws have given him, but we would preſerve this in him, and keep off the ſtroke of any further power, ſo that we need not for this thing ſo much as examine the cauſe upon which they roſe, whether it were ſuppoſed or not, for the caſe is far differing in the end of the riſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> Corah <hi>and his company ſuppoſed the cauſe ſufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſed cauſes for any thing is not enough; now we are not examining the truth of the cauſe of taking up Arms, but whether they may not be taken up by the Subject <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> againſt the mind of the King for any cauſe.</p>
               <p>Wel, our conſciences need not be much ſcrupled from this Scripture: Let us examine the reſt he brings.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 11, 18. <hi>where the oppreſſion of the King is mentioned, and no means of help mentioned but crying to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is</hi> the bare relation of the oppreſſion of a King without mention in that place of any means of help, but crying to God, a ſufficient proof that though Kings oppreſſe never <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> ſo much, yet there is no help? Suppoſe I bring a place of Scripture, where there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Subjects riſing up in a wicked way againſt their Prince, &amp; in that place there is no other help mentioned, but only the Prince committed this to God, &amp; God reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it, can there be drawn from thence an argument, that when Subjects riſe againſt Princes that they have no other help againſt them, but committing the cauſe to God? We need not go far for a Scripture in this kind, the very place the D. brought before wil do it; <hi>Num.</hi> 15. when <hi>Corah</hi> and his company roſe againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> we there read of no other help that <hi>Moſes</hi> uſed, but he committed the thing to God, &amp; God revenged it.</p>
               <p>But you wil ſay, yet there are other places that ſhew that Princes may make uſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help.</p>
               <p>So there is for Subjects to make uſe of other helps againſt the oppreſſion of their Princes, many Scriptures have been mentioned formerly and cleered. <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Further, beſides this, we anſwer, that the power of all Kings is not alike, it is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment becauſe one King hath ſuch and ſuch power, therefore all muſt needs have. The power of Kings is limited or enlarged by the ſeverall Laws of ſeverall Countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us ſee what the third Scripture ſayes, for yet our conſciences are not ſcrupled, it is</hi> Numb. 10. <hi>That the people might not go to war but by order from him that had the power of the Trumpet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe there was a poſitive order there that <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt make trumpets and thus uſe them; Doth it follow that this muſt be ſo every where? you may by as true a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> urge the neceſſity of ſilver trumpets, and that the Prieſts ſhould blow them, as well as the former: The conſequence would be full as good. No King can uſe Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets in war but by the blowing of the Prieſts, for it is commanded there, as that no people can go to war till the Magiſtrates uſe the Trumpets, becauſe it is ſo ordered there; we know the Law is judiciall, and for thoſe judiciall Laws the equity binds no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95477:72"/>
further then according to rules of prudence and juſtice, every countrey ſhall ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofefull for their conditions. Beſides if this did binde, then it were a ſinne for an Act to paſſe to put the <hi>Militia</hi> for any time into any other hands, for certainly it might not then be done, no, not with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> conſent.</p>
               <p>The next Scripture is, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 9. <hi>who can ſtretch out his hand againſt the Lords Anointed and be guiltleſſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why doth the D. ſpeake of ſtretching forth the hand againſt the Lords Anointed? <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> who endeavours it? doth not the Parliament profeſſe the defence of the Kings Perſons 2. Doctor <hi>willet</hi> upon this place gives you this Anſwer, That indeed it is not lawfull for a private man to lay hands, no not upon a tyrant; for it is not lawfull for a private man to kill a thiefe of a murderer, much leſſe a Magiſtrate, a Prince. But ſecondly, he tels us of ſome that have laid hands upon a King, and yet have been guiltleſſe, as <hi>Ehud</hi> upon <hi>Eglon</hi> King of <hi>Moab:</hi> therefore from that Scripture there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a generall Propoſition drawn, that no man in any caſe may ſtretch forth his hand againſt a King. Yea Doctor <hi>willet</hi> anſwers in the third place, that yet Tyrants and wicked Governours may be removed by the whole State. He indeed limits this, and ſayes, it muſt be underſtood of ſuch Kingdomes as goe by election, as in <hi>Polonia,</hi> and gives this reaſon, From whom Kings receive their authority, by them may they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to keep within bounds. This it ſeems was good Divinity in thoſe dayes. This diſtinction he uſed, to deliver the opinion from oppoſition in <hi>England;</hi> but if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction be examined, there will appeare little ſtrength in it: We doe not find that D. <hi>willet</hi> was ever reproved, or his writings cenſured for this thing.</p>
               <p>Concerning that reſtriction of his to Kingdomes by election, we ſhall, when wee come to ſhew from whence all Kings have their power, ſee, that if it proves true of them, it will prove true of others; for the foundation of all power that ſuch and ſuch men have over others, will be found either from election or covenant, which will come to all one.</p>
               <p>D. <hi>Ferne</hi> proceeds thus, <hi>If the King had come into the battel, his perſon might have been hurt as well as any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This had been but accidentally; If a father ſhould voluntarily goe into the Army of the common enemy, againſt whom the childe is in ſervice, and the child in diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> upon the enemy ſhould ſlay his father being there, eſpecially he being deſired &amp; beſeeched by any meanes not to be there, but to withdraw himſelfe; doth the child con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract guilt in ſuch a caſe?</p>
               <p>His next Argument from Scripture is, <hi>That the Prophet reprechending the Kings of Iſrael and Judah for Idolatry and oppreſſion, none ever called upon the people for this duty of reſiſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, There is much difference betweene Kings now, and thoſe Kings: The people then did neither give them their power, nor limit their power; They doe both now when <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> firſt they are ſet up.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if this be a good argument, that becauſe when Kings oppreſſed, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did not cal upon people for reſiſtance, therefore all reſiſtance in any caſe is unlawful; then, if when people have reſiſted, &amp; caſt oft the Government of their King, &amp; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have not reproved them for it; then it is lawfull for people in ſome caſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. He that will harken to his own reaſon, muſt acknowledge there is <hi>par ratio.</hi> If the Prophets exhorted not to reſiſtance, then there may be no reſiſtance, ſayes the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor? Then if when there is reſiſtance, the Prophets rebuke not that reſiſtance, then there may with as good reaſon be reſiſtance, ſay I.</p>
               <p>When the ten Tribes caſt off the Government of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> for his oppreſſion, and

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the D. comes to his great place again,</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>which he ſayes be will free from all exceptions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, bare me an Ace of that. The truth is, he vever ſo much as mentions, nor thinks of the great exception, which duly conſidered, will clear the Text to be nothing <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> to his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt he ſuppoſes that the King is the ſupream, as</hi> Peter <hi>calls him, or the higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is true, <hi>Peter</hi> cals the King <hi>Supreame,</hi> but in the ſame place he is made an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of man, and therefore to be limited by man. He may be the chiefe man in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> and yet limited in that authority; he is ſupreame, but not abſolute; We grant that the Houſes of Parliament, and we all, are his Subjects, but not Subjects to his will, but to that power of his that Law gives him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He takes for granted the King is the higher power. Here obſerve his miſtake. Let it be granted that the King hath the higheſt power, yet what propriety of ſpeech is it to ſay that he is the higheſt power? It is proper to God to ſay that he is Power in the abſtract.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>The King hath the higheſt power, and we muſt be ſubject to this power of his, and not reſiſt it.</hi> Who denies all this? When all this is granted, the D. hath got nothing at all; for if we reſiſt not that power which Law hath given him, we do not reſiſt the higher power, although we do not do nor ſuffer what hee would have us to do or ſuffer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he reaſons from the perſon, whoſoever, every ſoule. There was then</hi> ſayes he, <hi>the Senate, &amp;c.</hi>

power is the ill uſe of what is given to men; but the ill uſe of what was never given to them more then to any other, is abuſe of their wils, but not abuſe of their power. By Power I do not mean Strength, but Authority.</p>
               <p>Further, he ſayes, <hi>Theſe Emperours ruled abſolutely, therefore upon that ground men might reſiſt, if for any thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Although the Emperors might uſe ſome force to bring themſelves to an abſolute <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> power, yet whether the people were not brought to conſent to prevent farther danger, that muſt be diſproved, when our caſe ever fals, ſo as we ſhall be brought to conſent to an abſolute power, although it be out of feare (which God forbid) then this argument will concerne us, but not before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What they got and held meerly by force, without any conſent and agreement, was no power, no authority at all but might be reſiſted, no withſtanding that prohibition.</p>

               <p>If thoſe who have power to make Laws ſhould prove ſo wicked as to make wicked <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> Laws againſt Religion, yet I am rather bound to paſſive obedience in that caſe, then if men never ſo good ſhould command according to their own will, and not according to Law; for there is an authority in the one, though abuſed, but none at all in the other.</p>
               <p>His ſecond anſwer is, <hi>This prohibition did not concern Chriſtians only, but all people under the Emperour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As before, 1. we know not but theſe people had given up their right. 2. If they had not that prohibition doth not reach them in thoſe things wherein they had not.</p>

               <head>SECT. IV.</head>
               <p>THis <hi>Sect.</hi> is about the power of people to re-aſſume what power they have conferred upon Magiſtrates, although Gods power, yet conferred by them. He argues thus, <hi>If the power be Gods, then people cannot re-aſſume.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the King gives power to an inferior Magiſtrate, the power that this Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> hath is likewiſe from God, for ſo the Scripture ſayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>All power is from God:</hi> may not this power be re-aſſumed therefore? Let none put this off, with ſaying, But people are not above Kings, as Kings are above inferior Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, for that is nothing to the argument. The argument that he makes is this, If the power be of God, it cannot be re-aſſumed: Now the anſwer is, That the power of inferiour Magiſtrates is of God, and yet it may be re-aſſumed, therefore his conſequence is not good.</p>
               <p>Further, a ſervant by ſtipulation makes a man his Maſter, who was not before: Now the power of the Maſter is Gods, may he therefore never be deprived of that power? Servants muſt ſerve Chriſt in ſerving their Maſters, as truely as Subjects muſt obey God in obeying their Prince. Paſtors and Teachers have a ruling and a miniſteriall power, and this power is Gods, may it therefore never be taken away from them.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Argument is, <hi>We cannot recall what is once given, as in things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That can never be proved, that a thing devoted to a religious uſe, can never lawfully be imployed to no other. This is a groundleſſe conceit, becauſe he brings no proofs for it, <hi>Eadem facilitate rejicitur, qua aſſeritur.</hi> But this that we ſpeake of is a civill thing. <hi>And for Kings, that the power they have may not be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> he gives that reaſon, <hi>Becauſe the Lords hand and his oyle is upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Lords hand and oyle is upon Captains and other Magiſtrates. <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> 
                  <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> are called <hi>The anointed ones.</hi> Prophets, Prieſts have Gods hand and oyle upon them, and cannot the power for no cauſe be taken from theſe? And yet how confidently doth the man conclude, <hi>This will not a true informed conſcience dare to doe.</hi> Certainly notwithſtanding all the information in this argument, he may doe it.</p>
               <p>But he proceeds. <hi>How can conſcience be ſatisfied, that this their argument groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon election and derivation of power can have place in this Kingdome, when as the Crown deſcends by inheritance, and hath often been ſetled by Conqueſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There is no body here that yet hath attempted to take any power away from <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> the King that Law hath given him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Howſoever, the point of inheritance or conqueſt cannot hinder; For firſt, none inherits but that which his Progenitors had, &amp; his Progenitors had no more originally then by conſent was given them: therefore the difference between Kings by inheritance, and Kings by election, in this caſe is not much. And for Conqueſt, that onely ſettles former right, or makes way to ſome farther agreement, to adde to, what was former. The right comes not from power to conquer, or act of conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but from ſome agreement, precedent, or conſequent.</p>
               <p>He further argues, <hi>It is probable indeed that Kings were at firſt by choice here, as elſewhere; but can Conſcience reſt upon ſuch remote probabilities for reſiſtance, or think that firſt election will give power againſt Princes that do not claime by it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Is it but a remote probabilitie that Kings were here firſt by election? I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, what firſt inveſted ſuch a Family with Regall power, more then another? <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> It muſt be either God from heaven deſigning it, as <hi>David,</hi> or men appointing it,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95477:74"/>
or taken by force: there is no <hi>quartum.</hi> It was not the firſt, and to ſay the third is the right, is an extream wrong to the King If meer force can give right, then who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is moſt forcible hath right; it muſt therefore be ſomething elſe: what can that be but the conſent of people to ſuch a family? which is in effect all one with elect on. You may give it what name you will, it is not therefore a remote pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balilitie, but a neere certainty, that even here Kings were at firſt either by choice, or by that which in effect is all one.</p>
               <p>The Doctor ſayes, that <hi>Kings of England doe not claime their right by election.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be they uſe not that word; but if the Doctor ſhall preſume to diſpute <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> their claime for them, and think to get a better and ſurer claime then the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of people, that the Regall power ſhall be in ſuch a family, ſurely he will have no thanks for his labour. Let him take heed of this. Although he is pleaſed to call Election <hi>a ſlender plea,</hi> yet I beleeve he cannot bring a ſtronger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He is at his place in</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>againe, with the abſolute Monarchy of Romane Emperours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This hath been anſwered againe and againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next thing he diſcuſſes is the covenant the King enters into, and the oath he takes. And here he tels us our Kings are Kings before they enter into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or take this Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although they be Kings before they perſonally do covenant or ſweare, yet their <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> right comes in by their Progenitors, who had their right conferred upon them by ſome agreement or other: ſo that they have covenanted in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this clauſe in the covenant or oath is not expreſſed, that in caſe he will not diſcharge his truſt, it ſhall be law full to reſist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We doe not ſtand ſo much upon the oath that every King takes, as upon the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall agreement between people and King, whereby this power was conferred firſt upon ſuch a family, and for that wee ſay that no more power was conferred then was done by vertue of that agreement; and why there ſhould not be the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Covenant between a Countrey and a Family in matters of ſo high a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as there is in other Covenants amongſt men, let the Doctor ſhew, or any for him.</p>
               <p>The Doctor confeſſeth, <hi>Page</hi> 16. <hi>line</hi> 21. <hi>That Lawes are for the restraint of the power of Princes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But at length after the diſcuſſion of the buſineſſe, he tels you that to argue any forfeiture of power by breaking his covenant, is an inconſequent argument. You muſt beleeve him, becauſe he ſayes ſo: If his bare word will not ſatisfie you, you are like to have nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>Yet we would have him and all know, that we do not think that every breach of promiſe, and not performance of covenant in every thing, makes a forfeiture: this indeed were a dangerous conſequent. But the queſtion is, Whether no breach of Covenant may poſſibly in any caſe make a forfeiture? We confeſſe our ſelves not willing to diſpute this too farre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He preſently ſeemes to grant that there may be ſome force in the argument in States elective and pactionall, but not in this Kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the ground of all power that one man hath over another in Civill Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be ſome kinde of election, explicite or implicite, or ſome kind of agreement <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> at the firſt, let the Doctor ſhew how this Kingdome is freed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But what if the King will not keepe to his agreement, may the Subject doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</hi> The Dr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

To what purpoſe are Subſidies and ayds denyed, if the King hath power to take <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> our eſtates when he pleaſeth, and there muſt be no reſiſtance?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though this</hi> he ſayes <hi>may ſeeme unreaſonable to people, and very impolitique to the Stateſ-man, yet plain Scripture and reaſon forbids it.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>THis <hi>Section</hi> is ſpent in the argument of meanes of ſafety to a Kingdome in caſe the King ſhould tyrannize; if they might not reſiſt, it ſeemes God hath left them deſtitute of all helpe, they muſt needs periſh.</p>
               <p>To this he firſt anſwers, <hi>That is the ſame argument that is uſed for the Popes cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of, or depoſing Princes in caſe of Hereſie, otherwiſe the Church hath no meanes to preſerve it ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The good of a Church is ſpirituall, and God hath given it ſpirituall means enough to preſerve its ſpirituall good, although there be no ſuch power of the Pope over <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> Princes, and we know the Church was preſerved and flouriſhed in ſpirituall beautie when there was neither Pope nor Prince to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>But the good of a Kingdom is civill and naturall, therefore it muſt have civill and naturall meanes to preſerve it ſelfe by in caſe of danger. Hence then although it be no argument that Popes may by power of Armes curb Kings, and becauſe elſe the good of the Church cannot be preſerved, yet it may be a good argument the people may in ſome caſe take up Arms to defend themſelves againſt violence, although the King gives not his conſent, becauſe otherwiſe the civill and naturall good of men in a Kingdome cannot be preſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond thing he ſayes is, What meanes of ſafety had the Chriſtians in and after the Apoſtles times?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God called them then to ſuffer; for they were not the State; though many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men that are not a State, may eaſily be brought into ſuch a condition as they have no meanes for ſafety, but they muſt needs ſuffer; and ſo many States, when the externall violence is too ſtrong for them; but when God and nature gives them meanes of deliverance, there is no neceſſitie they ſhould periſh. When the Doctor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves reſiſtance better, wee will either fly or ſuffer.</p>
               <p>As for the Chriſtians why they could not reſiſt, the Dr. ſpeakes of a reaſon that he ſeemes to be ſatisfied in, becauſe things were ſo enacted by Law, therefore they could not reſiſt: therefore he leaves their example, as invalid in our caſe, and ſo it were well that every one elſe would leave off urging, that we may never heare of the example of the Chriſtians in the primitive times applyed to our caſe more: For though it ſeems to be ſomething at firſt view, yet it is nothing when it is examined.</p>
               <p>But then he ſayes, <hi>The Edicts that concerned others were Arbitrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this the Anſwer hath been already, either the people then gave up their whole right to their Emperours, which we have not done to our Kings, or otherwiſe they <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> were not bound to their Arbitrary government, but might have reſiſted for their own preſervations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if Parliaments ſhould degenerate and grow tyrannicall, what meanes of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could there be for a State?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſſe the condition of ſuch a State would be very dangerous and like to come to confuſion; particular men could not help themſelves, and the whole State ought <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> to ſuffer much before it ſhould helpe it ſelfe by any wayes of reſiſting: but if you can
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95477:75"/>
ſuppoſe a Parliament ſo far to degenerate, as they ſhould all conſpire together with the King to deſtroy the Kingdome, and to poſſeſſe the lands and riches of the Kingdome themſelves, in this caſe whether a Law of Nature would not allow of ſtanding up to defend our ſelves, yea to re-aſſume the power given to them, to diſcharge them of that power they had, and ſet up ſome other, I leave to the light of nature to judge.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, this cannot be, becauſe the higher powers muſt not be reſiſted by any.</p>
               <p>This is not properly to reſiſt the power, but to diſcharge the power, to ſet the <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> power elſewhere. The ſervant doth not reſiſt the power of his maſter, when he upon juſt grounds leaves him, and goes to another, if he be ſuch a maſter, as is his maſter by his owne choice, for ſuch and ſuch ends and purpoſes, and had his power limited by agreement.</p>
               <p>I know this will be cryed out of as of dangerous conſequence, wherefore God deliver us (as I hope he will) for ever making uſe of ſuch a principle.</p>
               <p>It is hard to conceive it poſſible that a Parliament can ſo degenerate, as to make our condition more grievous by unjuſt acts, then it would be if the power in a Kingdom ſhould returne to the law of nature, from whence at firſt it roſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Divers lines together ofter the objection from want of ſafety in caſe of degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Parliament he ſpends in commending the temper of our government in the three Eſtates, with complaints of ſome distemper for the preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the one I joyn with him: but for the other, I undertake not to ſatisfie all his <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> apprehenſions of diſtractions in the Parliament. The man I beleeve lives at a diſtance from Parliament, and ſo looks at it through multitudes of reports which uſually (and eſpecially in theſe times) are exceeding falſe <hi>mediums</hi> to looke through: Straight things will ſeeme crooked, when the object is ſeen through water that is too thick a <hi>medium:</hi> Reports doe ſo gather ſoile before they come to him, that when they come, they are an exceeding thick <hi>medium</hi> to ſee Parliament proceedings by.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If there were ſo many of a contrarie judgement more then the others, why do they <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> not come and out-vote them in what things are amiſſe?</p>
               <p n="2">2. This addes much validitie in common reaſon to what they determine, that they are alwaies a competent number, allowable by Law to be Houſes of Parliament, and they debate and determine things in ſuch an Aſſembly that is open for ſo many, which all the Countreys and Cities in the Kingdom have choſen, to come to debate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict as they think fit. Such determinations, although I do not ſay they ſhould be accounted infallible, yet they carry with them more likely reaſon, then thoſe who are carried by a few in ſome ſecret way.</p>
               <p>Further, why ſhould ſuch an Objection be made againſt the Houſes of Parliament, that no Court of Iuſtice, no Societie that carries things by Vote, will admit, if it be once ſet? that in ſuch Aſſemblies there ſhall be ſo many at the leaſt, there may be three times more, yet ſo many makes up the Aſſembly, ſo as to enable it to ſuch and ſuch purpoſes. How can this Obiection, without wrangling, be admitted? Oh but many were of another mind, or ſome belonging to the Aſſembly were not preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After this the Doctor proceeds to the commending of Monarchy above Ariſtocraſie, and the Kings Negative voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is nothing to our buſineſſe. What though Monarchie be the beſt? and what though the King ſhould have power of a negative voice in the paſſing all Bils? this is <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> granted.</p>

               <p>The argument from this place is worn exceeding bare by this time.</p>
               <p>

               <p n="2">2. True, there is danger in the peoples abuſing their liberties, and danger in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates abuſing their power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſayes he intends not to lay the leaſt blemiſh upon the Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet in the Page before he ſayes, The Temper of the Parliament is diſſolved: and upon that ſaies, the diſtractions in the Common-wealth, ſhew the diſtempers, and <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> the danger of diſſolution, and what is the cauſe of it. It would fill much paper to gather together the blemiſhes that this man caſts upon the Parliament, eſpecially in his laſt page. But that is not my work, I would gladly have conſciences reſolved.</p>
               <p>He proceeds to ſhew the difference between the Low-Countreys and us, which no queſtion is ſomething, but not ſo as can make what they have done lawfull, and yet the Doctors tents right, nor what we have done unlawfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He farther enlarges himſelf in diſcourſe about the evils that accompany reſiſting of power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Still we ſay power ſhould not be reſiſted, and where it is reſiſted ſinfully, yea where <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> men in power are reſiſted, any way, there are like to follow ſad conſequences of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. But what is all this for the ſatisfaction to conſcience about the Lawfulneſſe or unlawfulneſſe of reſiſting men that have power in any caſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then be comes to the oath of Supremacy and the Proteſtation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Anſwer to this depends upon what hath been ſaid, we ſwear onely to the Legall power, we proteſt no further then the maintenance of that. <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſaies, conſcience will look at that power he hath as the ordinance of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True, what power he hath, that is, what the Laws give him, we ſay is an ordinance of God. <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But his abuſe of power is a iudgement of God, that we muſt cry to God againſt, and a true informed conſcience in that caſe will rather ſuffer then reſiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſtill takes abuſe of his power to be the doing whatſoever he pleaſe: we denie that to be abuſe of his power. We ſay in that he doth not exerciſe his authorative power at all, therefore he doth not abuſe it. If indeed ſome uniuſt Law ſhould give him any power to do wrong, the execution of this would be the abuſe of his power, and therein it is granted a true informed conſcience would rather ſuffer then reſiſt. But in the other caſe, when he doth what Law inables not to do, all the arguments of the Doctor cannot ſo inform our conſciences, as to beleeve the State muſt rather ſuffer then reſiſt.</p>
               <p>Now the Doctor caſts up his reckoning, and thinks he finds it comes to thus much, that he hath found Scripture and reaſon, ſpeak plainly againſt reſiſting.</p>
               <p>He cries victorie to himſelf, he tels himſelf what the iſſue of his own thoughts come to; but he reckons without his Hoſt, his conqueſt is too haſtie, we are not of his mind.</p>
               <p>I will onely obſerve one thing more in the concluſion of his <hi>Section.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any ſhall be carried away with the name of a Parliament, as Papiſts are with the name of the Church, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Church could do as much in matters of Religion, as the Parliament can do in matters of the State, the Papiſts were not ſo much to be blamed for being taken <note place="margin">Anſ.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:95477:76"/>
ſo much with the name of the <hi>Church,</hi> as we are not for being taken ſo much with the name of the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. The Church cannot make new Articles of Faith, or nullifie the old; but the Parliament can make new Maximes to be accounted Law, that were not before, and undo what were before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Church hath not a iudiciall power of interpreting the Law of God, but the Parliament hath a iudiciall power of interpreting the Law of the State, ſo as that is to be accounted Law, which they interpret to be ſo. I do not ſay that we are bound to beleeve, that whatſoever interpretation they make was the ſcope and intention of that Law when it was firſt made: But this I ſay, that their interpretation muſt be accounted as much binding to us for obedience, as the ſcope and intention of that Parliament that firſt made that Law.</p>
               <p>Thus I have done with his Scriptures, and the rationall part of his Book; and I hope others will have done with it too.</p>
               <p>If mens conſciences be ſatisfied in the lawfulneſſe of the thing it ſelf, Subiects ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Arms againſt the will of the King: His other part, every one who underſtands how things are with us, that is willing to be ſatisfied, will be ſoon able to ſatisfie himſelf. The ſubſtance of all that follows is, ſuppoſe that Subiects may take up Arms? yet whether there be ſufficient cauſe for us to do it.</p>
               <p>Toward the concluſion of the book the Dr. begins to be hot, and ſomewhat bitter, but I ſhall not here follow him in particulars, but in the generall thus</p>
               <p>What the condition of our Kingdom is, whether in danger or not? What the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Houſes of Parliament, whether they be ſafe or not? whether their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges be broke or not? Iudge you whether Doctor <hi>Ferne</hi> or all the Remonſtrances and Declarations we have had from both Houſes be able beſt to certifie us: we have received information enough, and ſeen and felt enough to make us beleeve that our Kingdom is in great danger: but it may be the Doctor ſits in his ſtudy like another <hi>Archimedis</hi> drawing his lines, and the Swords muſt be about his eares before he will ſee or beleeve any danger to wards us.</p>
               <p>The Doctor puts the caſe thus, whether the conſcience can be ſo perſwaded, that the King is ſuch and ſo minded, as that there may be ſufficient cauſe to take up Arms <note place="margin">Anſ.</note> againſt him; in this he is as miſerably miſtaken, as in all his other grounds from Scripture, and his reaſons, if he thinks this be the controverſie.</p>
               <p>For 1. we take up no Arms againſt the King,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatſoever the Kings mind be, there is ſufficient cauſe to take up Arms to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our ſelves againſt others that ſeek our ruins We know of the plots of bringing the Armies in the North upon Parliament and City: We know of the great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Arms in forreign parts to ſend over hither, and time hath diſcovered their further attempts, although it hath indeed withall diſcovered they could not bring their attempts to their deſired iſſue. We know of many Delinquents that are fled from the Iuſtice of the Parliament, which cannot be attached without force; and if they may ſo ſcape as they do, to what purpoſe doth a Parliament ſit? it will ſoon be made ridiculous in the eyes of the world. We know what is done in the execution of the Commiſſion of Array, and that by force of Arms, and all theſe things by thoſe who are under the authority of the Houſes of Parliament: wherefore if they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent theſe evils imminent, nor rectifie theſe diſorders extant, but by power added to their authoritie, although there be no ſuch horrible things as the Doctor ſpeaks of, namely, the Kings intentions to ſubvert Religion, and our Laws and liberties, if the King do but denie to aſſiſt in the delivering us from thoſe dangers, not upon ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95477:76"/>
jealouſies feared, but upon certain proofs we know we are in, and in the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of ſuch delinquents as juſtice muſt not, our ſafety cannot ſuffer to eſcape, there is cauſe enough to ſatisfie our conſciences in the lawfulneſſe of our taking up Arms. Yea, our proteſtation and duty, though we had never ſo proteſted, binds us to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by all our ſtrength the Parliament in this; and in maintaining them, we do not at all prejudice the King in any lawfull power of his.</p>
               <p>This generall is enough to ſatisfie in what is ſaid in the two laſt <hi>Sections:</hi> As for particulars mentioned there, many of them are anſwered alreadie in the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; others being matters of fact, it is more eaſie for any one to anſwer that hath a mind to examine what paſſages have falne out. To go through them particularly I ſhall leave to ſome who have more time to ſpare then I, they are far more eaſie to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer then what was before, but not ſo profitable, and yet the anſwer would exaſperate more, they are Subjects more ſuteable for Lawyers and Statiſts to treat about then for Divines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore where as in the concluſion of all, the Doctor defires thoſe who will run the Hazard of this reſiſtance; firſt to ſet their conſciences before the tribunall of God, and confider whether they will excuſe them there when they have ſhed blood, to ſay, we ſuppoſed our Prince would change Religion, overthrow liberties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No Doctor, We can comfortably, and will freely and really ſet our conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods tribunall in this caſe, but we will not make that our plea, but we will ſtand thus before the Lord.</p>
               <p>Lord thou who art the ſearcher of our hearts, and our Iudge, thou knoweſt we aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at no hurt to our King, we deſired to live in peace, we according to our ſolemne vow and Proteſtation, have only endeavoured to deliver our Kingdom &amp; Parliament from the rage of ungodly, and violent bloody men, to bring forth the wicked unto ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to preſerve what thy Maieſtie, what the law of nature, and the Law of the Land hath made our own. If thou wilt pleaſe to call us to ſuffer for thy Name, we hope we ſhall be readie; but becauſe thou telleſt us that it is not the part of a Chriſtian but of an Infidell, not to provide for his family, therefore we have not ſubmitted our ſelves, wives and children to the rage of theſe bloody men: for the ſubſtance of what we have done, it hath been in thy Name, that we may be faithfull to the King, Kingdom, Parliament, and to poſteritie. What failings thou haſt ſeen in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of it, Lord pardon to us for Chriſt his ſake.</p>
               <p>Thus we are willing to meet the Doctor at Gods Tribunall, but he ſhall not lay our plea for us, we fear he will have enough to do to anſwer for himſelf, yea to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for that Book he hath put forth in ſuch a time as this.</p>
            </div>

               <head>For a Concluſion of all.</head>
               <p>LEt none think that though we thus iuſtifie taking up Arms, that therfore we are of thoſe that delight in War; God forbid. Our ſouls deſire after peace, we pray for peace, we would gladly lay down our lives (if we know our own hearts) for peace.</p>
               <p>Lately my name was injuriouſly added to a printed paper, wherein there was a Petition againſt Accommodations: It ſayes I went along with it, whereas I knew nothing at all of it, untill neere a week after it was delivered to the Houſe: Thus are we at the mercy of every malignant ſpirit, if he can get a Printer to aſſiſt him, to be rendred to the world as odious as he pleaſeth. As great an injury I ſuffered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though in another nature, when a few pieces of a Sermon I preached to young men were gathered together, and patched up with a deale of non-ſenſe, and additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their owne as they pleaſed, and then put out as mine. Although we live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men ſet on fire, yet God forbid but we ſhould follow peace: but it muſt be the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not the peace of <hi>Babylon.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95477:77"/>
And the truth is, had the people knowne their liberties before, it is very probable theſe warres would have been prevented. This I am confident hath been the great encouraging, fomenting argument for theſe warres, <hi>If we goe in the name of the King, none will dare to ſtir against us; What will they take up Arms to reſist their King?</hi> Had they ſeen the weakneſſe of this their Argument, as it is applyed to this buſineſſe in hand, that bloud that hath been ſhed would have been prevented; And if the people of the Land knew the Liberty that God, and Nature, and Law gives them, there would ſoone be an end of theſe Warres; but a few ſuch Doctors as this is, may helpe to prolong them, by dividing the people, and putting them into a maze, comming in ſo plauſible a way to informe Conſcience; whereas in truth he gives no bottome for Conſcience to reſt on, but rather puts it to a ſtand, or rather into a labyrinth.</p>
               <p>There is a neceſſitie that in theſe times peoples Conſciences ſhould be further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in their liberties in this caſe then formerly, becauſe the time is (we hope) at hand for the pulling down of Antichriſt, and we find by Scripture this work at firſt will be by the people: <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 2. <hi>The Angel came down from heaven and cried mightily with a ſtrong voice, Babylon the great is falne, is falne:</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>I heard another voice from heaven, ſaying, Come out of her my people:</hi> ver. 6. <hi>Reward you her as ſhe hath rewarded you:</hi> and ſo to the 9. <hi>ver.</hi> her deſtruction is threatned. Now <hi>ver.</hi> 9. the Text ſayes, <hi>The Kings of the earth who have committed fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and lived deliciouſly with her, ſhall bewaile her, and lament for her, ſaying, Alas, alas.</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>And the Merchants of thoſe things which were made rich by her, ſhall ſtand weeping and wailing,</hi> ver. 15. All her Proctors, and Commiſſaries, and Chancellors that grew rich by her, they ſhall lament. No marvaile then though ſo many Proctors get together to ſeek for peace upon any terms.</p>
               <p>Here you ſee <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt down, and yet the Kings lament her fall: Who then muſt pull her down but the people? Not that the people can raiſe a War meerly for Religion, but God will ſo order things, that the Papiſts ſhall by their malice be put upon ſuch plots and enterpriſes, that they ſhall make themſelves lyable to the juſtice of the Law, ſo that Kings ſhall have no legall power to reſcue them from it, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Magiſtrates, aſſiſted by the people, ſhall in a juſt way fall upon them, even then when the Kings of the earth and their Merchants ſhall lament them. Hence <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 19. 6. the <hi>Hallelujah</hi> that is begun upon the Lord God omnipotents raigning, is begun by the people, <hi>I heard the voice as of many waters, ſaying, Hallelujah.</hi> Now the Scripture frequently ſets forth the people by <hi>waters,</hi> as <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 15. <hi>The waters which thou ſaweſt, were peoples.</hi> We reade <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 11. where the glory of Chriſt is ſet forth, it begins at the head; but <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 1. where the glory of the Church is ſet forth, it begins at the feet, <hi>How beautifull are thy feet?</hi> Surely the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe liberties God hath given people, will much help forward the great things God hath to doe in this latter age.</p>
               <p>This makes me willing to publiſh what help I can in this thing, although I know full well I run the hazard of ſuffering much in it. Let <hi>Babylon</hi> fall, let the Church proſper, it is enough, our lives are not much worth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now I have ſhewne the Commiſsion of the Lord of Hoſts for warres; I ſhall not yet ceaſe to pray for peace; ſuch a peace as may have as good a Commiſsion from the Prince of Peace, as the preſent wars of the Kingdom have from the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which I have done is but as the taking of my pen to write a Letter to a friend; but a little ſtrength is enough to oppoſe a little ſtrength.</hi>
