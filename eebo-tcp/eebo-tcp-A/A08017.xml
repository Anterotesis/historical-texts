            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Indeede SIR, I must acknowledge that vpon the first view of you seeing you in your Countrey ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, I did much vnder-value you (for which I craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) fearing that some misfortunes had befallen you, and so povertie had driven you into that meane habite, and attire, but when I vnderstood, after some conference had with you, what course of life you tooke vpon you, and that your habite did suite with your <hi>Countrey</hi> and condition, being much different from our <hi>City</hi>-fashions, I then wisht to my selfe to haue had some opportunity, having knowne you from your Cradle vntill the time that wee shooke hands at the Schoole-dore, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that docile and sweete disposition in you more fit for the Court and Citie, to know the motiues that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced you to apply your selfe wholly to the affayres of the Countrey, which at this time hating I shall desire you to impartit freely vnto me.</p>

               <p>I shall in this your request, giue you what sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction I can. The motiues that induced me to take vpon me this Course of life, were many, but chiefly my health, which I preferre before all earthly treasure; for I found that after I left the Grammar-Schoole, that the <hi>smoky fumes, and noysome vapors of the Citie</hi> did much offend me, sometimes driving me into a shaking Ague, sometimes into a Burning-Feaver, and continually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempering me, so that during the whole time I made my abode therein, there was scant a weeke together at any time that I perfectly enjoyed my selfe. Whereupon by the advise of the most learned <hi>Physitians,</hi> I tooke my flight into the Country, being by them perswaded

that the <hi>sweete and subtile ayre</hi> would best accord and suite with my Constitution: and this was one of the principall Causes that induced me to take vpon me this Course of life: other motiues there were, amongst the rest this was not the least, that I had often heard, and experience hath since verified vnto me that the <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> life is the most innocent, harmlesse, and most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God of any professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or state of life in the world. For that he doth not raise himselfe by the ruines of any: he oppresseth no fatherlesse, nor wrongs no widowes: his Commerce is for the most part with the earth, and although he grow rich, shee growes not poore, or if she doe, conceales and buries it in her selfe. He never heares of her cryes at his dores, complaints in the streets, or Petitions in the Courts against him; all his actions are exposed to the eye of the world, he doth nothing in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritie or secrecie, the places of his Commerce are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fields or the Markets; the Sunne is his light, and the Standard his measure, false lights and measures are odious and hatefull vnto him: He keepes his course as constantly as the Moone: if riches fall in his way, he stoopes and gathers them vp: if not, he vseth no sleights or tricks, or by-paths to come to them. Gaine he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth goods when it is well gotten, otherwise wrong and robbery. Ambitious indeede he is, but it is to doe his King and Countrey service; and Covetous he is, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more than ten for a hundred, yea a hundred for ten; yet keepes himselfe out of the reach and danger of the Law, so legall is his vsury, so harmelesse his ambition. These were motiues likewise that induced me to take this Course of life vpon me. Others there were many, and this was not the least, for that it was the most vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and most necessary course and condition of life of any life in the world, without which no man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and subsist: for who is he that feeds vs, or who is he that cloths vs? is it not the Countryman? doth Corne

grow in the streets, or are sheepe bred in the Markets? Are not the fields our Seminaries? and doth he not play the part of the Alchumist? are they not his labours that produceth and extracteth them? therefore although I attribute as much to the Citie as any man, yet so long as a man may be as honest, as just, as good a Christian, and a better Common-wealths man, I must ever preferre the Countrey.

They poore Ladies, desire but Clothes, and those in fashion (being all the riches that they can justly challenge as their owne) and a little meat and drinke in lieu of those great portions which they brought vnto you, and when they haue them they keepe them as carefully as they doe their eyes, and how can they be the causes of your ruine and destruction?</p>

from thence being driven, shee betooke her selfe to a long stone-wall, what worke shee there made, how shee past along the one side, and downe againe the other, and at last recovered the top of it, and tooke vp her seate in it a full yard from the ground; from thence being driven, how then shee betooke her selfe vnto the sheepe; sometimes sheltring her selfe in one flocke, sometimes in another; how from thence shee betooke her selfe to a hard stony way; how shee there doubled and redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, jumpt in and out, here and there, againe &amp; againe, and how the young whelpes went gazing on, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shut her, whilest the old stickers, <hi>Ringwood</hi> &amp; <hi>Rockwood</hi> found out her sleights; how in the whole course of this her progresse, shee ever tooke advantage of the winde and weather; in dry weather never comming neare the water, but keeping her selfe vpon the hilles, and in the woods, and in fowle weather never comming neare the woods and bushie places, but keeping her selfe in the moorish ground; and how at last, finding no safetie or protection in any of those places, shee betooke her selfe vnto the Conies in a Coni-greene, and there with them as one of them, tooke vp her lodging all night.

Againe when I tooke into my consideration the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of the Country-life, which you so much magnifie: how many myles you travell to doe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie service at the grand Assizes and Sessions, and vpon all other occasions, as often as his service shall require you, to your great charge and expence; whereas in the Citie, we goe no further than from our houses to our common Hall, confined within the precincts of our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Againe, when I called to minde, what cares you vndergoe in plowing and sowing, in reaping and mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in breeding and rearing, in buying and selling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can reape the fruits of your labours. Whereas wee goe no further than the Markets within our walles, and in an instant reape the fruits of those labours, for which you haue taken so great care and paines: againe when I considered that the Citie is the place where all the Nobilitie and Gentrie of the Land receiue their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, where the Vniversities are seated, where the Lawes of the Kingdome are read and taught, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the proper place in most parts of the Christian

world, where the Nobilitie and Gentrie make their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence &amp; abode. For although in these our parts your Country is honoured with the personall residence of many of the Peeres and Nobilitie of the Kingdome; in other parts of the Christian world it is not so, they leaue that as a forlorne Wildernesse to Boores and Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants, whilest they in the Cities eate the fruits of their labours: it may be some few weekes they start out for their healths sake, or for pleasure, or in Vintage time to see their fruits seasonably gathered, &amp; that being done, they seldome goe forth all the yeare after. Againe when I considered how in times of danger, we are more secure than you in the Country: if either a forraine enemy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to invade vs, or any Civill discord arise betweene vs, having walles and bulwarkes to defend vs: whereas you lye exposed and open to danger. Againe when I considered how we out-strip you concerning the health of the best part of vs: whereas you are enforced vpon the Sabbath day to goe a myle or two to heare divine service, and two or three myles to heare a Lecture; wee haue divine service at our dores, and three or foure Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures within a quarter of a myle.

               <p>I am glad to heare your Father was of that opinion, he was a learned man, and one that was well seene in Armes and Heraldry. The reason wherefore I desire to be satisfied therein is, because there is a Lady, or a reputed Lady in our Citie, that was the daughter of a meane man, and afterwards married with a Knight, and buried him, and since hath married with a man of meane degree; and because she was sometimes a Lady, there is not a Gentlewoman, be she the wife of the best Gentleman in the Citie, but she will step before her, and take place of her, and why forsooth, marry because the Custome of the Countrey doth giue it her, as shee saith. But when I shall tell our Citie Dames, that the Custome of the Countrey is contrary to the Lawes of Armes, and the Lawes of the Kingdome; I am sure they will not accustome her to doe as she hath done.</p>

               <p>Sir, your question hath beene much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted amongst the auncient Academicks of natures Schoole, and the Doctors haue beene much distracted about it; some haue beene so presumptuous as to lay the fault vpon <hi>Iupiter</hi> himselfe, and to say that he hath two Tubs, the one a Cabinet for vertues, the other a cage for vncleannes, and that when it seemes good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he doth distribute vnto one, justice, wisedome, temperance, and fortitude, and to another folly, pusil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimitie and intemperance; but the most wise and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete among them, haue acccused and condemned this as a fault of high presumption, and haue affirmed, that as well might they maintain that the Lyons might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Elephants, Elephants Beares &amp; Wolves; the earth that which is proper to the heavens, and the heavens that which is proper to the earth, as that the fountaine and source of goodnesse should produce any thing, but that which is good. Others haue imputed it to the Constellatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; Planets vnder which they were borne, but this hath beene rejected likewise as a paradoxe: for as well might they maintaine that order might produce confusion, as the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, that keepe their constant courses any such effect: others to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall temper and inclination, but this the whole body of nature hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned as erroneous, for as it is in the great sublunary world, consisting of reasonable, sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and vegetative Creatures, the inferior readily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselues to the superior, the vegetative to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive, the sensitive to the rationall, and all to maintaine

If a Peere of the Realme shall be so tender of his honour, that he will not admit of the least aspersion, but he will right himselfe, and take advantage of the Lawes <hi>de scandalis Magnatum.</hi> If the sacred Majestie of a King will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to haue any rumors raised, whereby his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be scandalized, and dissention grow betweene him and his people, but he will haue a strict account of it; much more the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

               <p>It is true; the <hi>Iewes</hi> did forbeare all manner of bodily labour on the Sabbath day; but this forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was not to a good end, that is, to glorifie GOD, as they should haue done.

the world, as Oxen or Horses, they had done well, and satisfied the Law punctually, but they were reasonable Creatures, God had stamped his owne image in them, and made them little inferior to the Angels in degree; wherefore there was more required at their hands, they were not to sit still and sleepe, but to glorifie him with hymnes, songs, musicke, and melodie. Deeds of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and necessitie are allowed by God to be done on that day. God that allowed man to leade his Oxe and Asse to water on that day, alloweth him to kindle a fire to dresse his meate on that day. Indeede to kindle a fire to adde furtherance to the building of the Tabernacle was not permitted. God that created all Creatures for the vse of man, alloweth him in case his sheepe or cattell doe fall into a ditch, to pull him forth on that day.

Let him in the name of God that desires to gaine sheepe vnto his flocke, vse his best meanes to doe it: but let him doe it as he should doe it, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions and intreaties, not with force and violence. O <hi>Rome, Rome,</hi> how art thou fallen, I say, from thy first station! thy Senators in former times caused that Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagate that offered himselfe to kill their enemy <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> to be bound hand and foote, and to be turned out of the Citie. When <hi>Caesar</hi> overcame <hi>Pompey</hi> in the <hi>Pharsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> fields, and <hi>Pompey</hi> betooke himselfe for refuge vnto the Coasts of <hi>Nilus,</hi> where <hi>Achillas</hi> in stead of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting him, slew him, and presented his head vnto <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> thinking thereby to winne <hi>Caesars</hi> loue and favour. But <hi>Caesar</hi> disdaining so base and ignoble an act, would not endure to looke vpon him, or his present. When <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophroditus</hi> had killed <hi>Nero,</hi> though he were the monster of men, a tyrant, and stood condemned according to the Lawes and Customes of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and though he slew him at the earnest request and sollicitation of <hi>Nero</hi> himselfe, yet as soone as ever the Senate heard he made his vaunts in publicke of what he had done, they caused him to be put to death. Such, such was the goodnesse, vertue, and prowesse of the <hi>Romanes</hi> in times past. But how vnlike are you vnto them: if your forefathers that were Heathens, were so tender of the lives of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; how much more tender ought you to be that fight vnder the banner of Christ, of the liues of your Kings and Princes; it was a merry and golden world in those dayes; but alas the times are now altered; now Simonie beares the bell in the Church; now either fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen ignorance, or ignorant fiery zeale sets the Church at variance in it selfe.

in Court ambition, luxurie, envie, faction, flattery, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are the onely things in request, and he that cannot lye or dissemble must forsake that course of life, or not thrive by it. The Nobilitie themselues hunt after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and neglect their honour; for these two, filthy lucre and true honour, are incompatible, and cannot inhabit in one and the selfe same place together; yea the very Courts of Iustice, which should be kept more pure and cleane than other places, are not without spots and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes, and the places of judicature bought and sold, and how then can a man expect justice to be duely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred; if the egge be rotten, the chicken will stinke and putrifie a great deale more without doubt. Hence it is that suits, debates, and contentions continually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise. Hence it is that the rich man goes to Law with greedines, whilest the poore man faints vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; the cause of the one being ended with all expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the cause of the other hanging in suspence: so that the rich man ever prevailes with his money, and the poore man ever goes to the ground. If a man cast his eyes vpon the Citizens &amp; Cities, there he shall finde nothing but fraud, perjurie, vsury, whoredome, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, drunkennesse, luxurie, wantonnesse. Amongst whom to deceiue is accounted the chiefest wisedome, and to be wise the greatest folly. An ill conditioned people, that rellish nothing well but filthy lucre. To conclude, the whole world is nothing els but a meere masse of wickednes: here enemies spoyle, there theeves kill: here the Atheist makes a meere mockery of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Word: here the Father sets snares to entrap the sonne, there the sonne to entrap the Father. So that here we may see the world grows to an end, and every thing worse and worse.

               <p>Certainely, if I be Iudge, I must adjudge as all our Countrey doth (notwithstanding any thing you haue said to the contrary) the rich man to be the more happie man, for that every where, both in Countrey and Citie, he is cleped by the name of a good man, and is honored and reverenced, when the poore man is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and despised; and for evident demonstration, I will tell you what I saw with mine eyes. Not long since being in the Citie, it was my chaunce to come into a Barbers Shop, where I beheld two men attending the Barber to haue his helpe for the cutting off their haire; the one was rich, and had his purse full of Crownes, the other poore, and had not a penny in his purse; the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:13426:134"/>
Barber entertained them both, but with a great deale of difference, he that had the Crownes, had the finest lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, the purest water, the sweetest balls, the choycest powders, the sharpest rasor, the keenest sissers, and as much of his art as he could afford him; but he that came for Gods sake, had no other linnen, than what he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about him, his owne shirt to wipe his hands; no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther water than what issued out of the Barbers mouth, he spat on his face, and with that water did he shaue his haire, and in stead of a rasor did he vse a kinde of a saw, which did rather <hi>deglubere</hi> than <hi>tondere.</hi> So shaved him that <hi>ad singulos tractus lachrymae exoculis vbertim mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi>; that water issued out of his eyes at every drawing of his hand. In so much, that a little dog that had beene beaten in the streets, comming into the shop for refuge, the poore man thinking that he had shaved the dog as he had done him, because he cryed so, demanded, <hi>O canis num tu rasus es ob dei timorem,</hi> alas poore dog, hast thou beene shaven too? For if he had beene a dog, he could not haue beene vsed worse than he was vsed. So that in my opinion, it is an easie matter to judge which is the more happie man, the rich man or the poore.</p>

This was a holy resolution, and did well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this good man, because he was a man of God, and had sequestred himselfe from the affaires of the world: but for a secular man, that should be a man of imployment, to sequester himselfe from the affaires of the world, and to sit Sunning himselfe with the <hi>Cynicke</hi> all his life time, I cannot commend it in him. <hi>Diogenes</hi> was named by the name of a dog, and well he deserved it, because he would not endure the company of men.

For as to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:13426:138"/>
looke after every thing is greedie Covetousnesse; so to looke after nothing is carelesse wretchednesse: our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires therefore and affections, should be guided by the rules of reason and discretion; if they be dull, they should be quickned and rowsed vp with the thought of penury and necessitie; if they be too free, they should be curb'd and kept in with the thought of shame and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominie; for as he cannot be but a poore man, and fall into misery, that having nothing cares for nothing; so he cannot be but a dishonest man, that having all things is contented with nothing: for him that hath but a little to refuse a reward from him that hath more, and can better spare it than he want it, it will be accounted folly or arrogancie in him; but for him that hath enough, to be catching and snatching from him that hath not, it will be accounted base covetousnesse &amp; crueltie in him. An example of abstinence in this kinde wee may take from <hi>Tamerlaine</hi> without disparagement; <hi>Tamerlaine</hi> being told that a Countryman within his Territories had found much treasure, he caused the same to be brought vnto him, which he perusing and finding by the effigies and inscription, that it was the Coyne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and not the proper Coyne of his Country, he caused the same to be delivered backe againe; saying, What God had sent vnto him, he would not take from him: the poore man had neede of it, and therefore was it given him.

Whereupon the <hi>Romane</hi>-Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor began thus; <hi>Romaetempla honorari, magistratibus obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiam praestari, malos Castigari</hi>; at <hi>Rome</hi> God is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Magistrates are obeyed, wicked men are punished. After him the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Ambass: began thus; <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine nobiles viros semper cum suis hostibus decertare, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum laborare, Philosophos rudiores informare</hi>; at <hi>Carthage</hi> the Noble men alwayes wage warre in person with their enemies, all men are in action, and those that are skilfull instruct those that are ignorant. After him the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Ambass: thus; <hi>Sicilia justitia administratur, veritas ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, aequalitas laudatur</hi>; in <hi>Sicilie</hi> justice is duely admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, truth is beloved, and aequalitie preferred. After him the Ambassador from <hi>Rhodes,</hi> thus; <hi>Rhodi honestos esse viros senes, pudicos juvenes, tranquillas et illabefactas matronas</hi>; at <hi>Rhodes</hi> old men are honest, young men are shamefast, matrones are sober and without spot and blemish. After him the <hi>Athenian</hi> Ambass: thus; <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis non permittuntur divites factiosi, populus otiosus, guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natores imperiti</hi>; in <hi>Athens</hi> it was not permitted that rich men should be factious, poore men idle, and Governors ignorant. After him the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Ambass: thus; <hi>Lacedaemone nec invidiam, quia omnes ibi erant aequales, nec avaritiam, quia omnia erant communia, nec desidiam, quia omnes laborabant regnari permitti</hi>; In <hi>Lacaedemonie</hi> envie hath no place, because all men are equall, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse is thrust out of dores, because all things are in common; idlenesse is banisht, because all men are made

After him the <hi>Sicion</hi> Ambass: thus, <hi>Sycione nullos extraneos, qui res novas excogitarent, nullos medicos, qui benè valentes enecarent, nullos advocatos, qui lites in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitam protraherent, admitti</hi>; at <hi>Sycion</hi> no new Lords are admitted to make new Lawes: no Physitians to kill men being in perfect health, no Advocates to spinne out and protract causes to the end of the world.

And withall, I would advise him to beare in minde these Cautions: if he did pursue the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode, then to take heede that he did not waste too much time in the vaine delights thereof, and so the night steale vpon him, and penury seize vpon him, and strip him out of his rich robes of plentie, into her owne rags of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie.

If he had a minde to take the Cities in his way, then to take heede that he did not trifle out the time too long in dallying and feasting with <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and their associates, and so the night overtake him and he be compelled to take vp his lodging in <hi>Ludgate</hi> or <hi>Newgate.</hi> If he had a minde to take his voyage through the Temple, then to beware that Simonie and <note n="(58)" place="margin">Hereditarius ille mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, qui ab initio mundi ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesias afflixit, &amp; pestundedit, est ambitio mixta avaritiâ vt ait Iac. nuper Rex in lib. 2 ad <hi>Henric.</hi> nuper principem.</note>
