         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This honeſt ſeeming man muſt needes (ſith his iourney lay to London) ſtay at the yong mans mothers all the holy daies: where as on his deſert hee was kindly vſed: at length, the young man hauing receiued his mothers bleſſing, with other his friendes giftes amounting to ſome ten poundes, was to this hypocrite as to a faithful guide committed, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward London they ride: by the way this Viſiter diſcourſes how excellent inſight he had in Magick, to recouer by Art any thing loſt or ſtolne.

                  <pb facs="tcp:6333:7"/>I had of late yeares an olde man to my tennant, who cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably a great time went twiſe in the weeke to London, either with fruit or with peſcods, when time ſerued therefore: And as he was comming homeward on blacke-heath, at the end thereof next W Shooters hill, he ouertooke two Rufflars, the one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly waiting on the other as one had beene the maiſter, and the other the man, or ſeruant carrying his maiſters Cloke, this old man was very glad that he might haue their company ouer the hill, becauſe that he had made a good market, for he had ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſhillings in his purſe, and an old angell, which this poore man had thought had not beene in his purſe, for hee willed his wife ouer night to take out the ſame angell, and lay it vp vntill his comming home againe, And he verely thought that his wife had ſo done which indeede forgot to doe it, Thus after ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had this maiſter Rufflar entered into communication with this ſimple old man who riding ſoftly beſide them, commoned of many matters. Thus feeding this old man with pleaſant talke, vntill they were on the top of the hill, where theſe Rufflars might well behold the Coaſt about them cleare: Quickly ſteps vnto this poore man, and taketh hold on his horſe bridle, and leadeth him into the wood, and demaundeth of him what and how much money he had in his purſe. Now by my troth quoth this old man you are a merry gentleman, I know you meane not to take away any thing from me but rather to giue me ſome if I ſhould aſke it of you. By and by this ſeruant thiefe, caſteth the cloake that hee carried on his arme about this poore mans face, that he ſhould not marke or view them, with ſharpe words to deliuer quickely that he had and to confeſſe truely what was in his purſe. This poore man then all abaſhed yeelded, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he had but iuſt ſeauen ſhillings in his purſe and the troth is he knew of no more, This old angell was fallen out of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purſe into the bottome of a great purſe. Now this ſeauen ſhillings in white money they quickly found, thinking in deede that there had beene no more, yet farther groping and ſearching found this old angell. And with great admiration this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thief began to bleſſe him ſaying, Good Lord what a world is this, how may (quoth he) a man beleeue or truſt in the ſame, ſe you not (quoth he) this old knaue he told me that hee had but ſeauen ſhillings, and heere is more by an angell, what an olde knaue and a falſe knaue haue we here quoth this Rufflar? Our Lord haue mercy on vs, will this world neuer bee better, and therewith went their way, and left the old man in the wood do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him no more harme.

For this is their cuſtome, that when they meete in a barne at night euerie one getteth a make to lie withal although there chaunce to bee twentie in a companie, as there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, and ſometimes leſſe: for to one man that goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, there are at the leaſt two women, which neuer make it ſtrange when they be called, although ſhee neuer knew him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Then when the day doth appeare, he rowſes himſelfe, and ſhakes his eares, and away goes wandering where he may get ought to the hurt of others.

For it was not a penny would now quench his thirſt ſeeing ſo much as hee did, thus ſwallowing his ſpittle greedily downe, ſpoyled this poore man of all the money that he had, and leapt ouer the hedge into a thicke wood, and went his way as merely, as this good ſimple man came home ſorowfully.

Then this gentleman dilligently inquired of three or foure towne dwellers there, whether any ſuch perſon, declaring his ſtature, age, apparrell, with ſo many lineaments of his body as he could call to remembrance. And <hi>vna voce</hi> all ſaid that no ſuch man dwelt in their ſtreete, neither in the pariſh that they knew of, but ſome did well remember that ſuch a one they ſawe there lurking and huggering two houres, before the gentleman came thither, but he was a ſtranger vnto them.

Ther are of theſe many, and but one that I vnderſtand of hath loſt his tongue in deed. Hauing on a time occaſion to ride to Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to ſpeake with a Prieſt there, who maketh all kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues verie well, and vſeth ſtilling of waters. And repairing to his houſe I found a Dommerar at his doore, and the Prieſt himſelfe peruſing his licence, vnder the ſeales and hands of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine worſhipful men, had thought the ſame to be good and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.

And hauing vnderſtanding before of their peeuiſh practiſes, made me to conceiue that all was forged and nought, I made the more haſt home for wel I wiſt that he muſt of force paſſe through the pariſh where I dwelt, for there was no other way for him. And comming homeward, I found them in the town according to my expectation, where they were ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for there was a Pallyard aſſociate with the Dommerar &amp; partaker of his gaines, which Pallyard I ſaw not at Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.

The Surgeon made him gape, and we could ſee but halfe a tongue. I required the Surgeon to put his finger in his mouth and to pull out his tongue, and ſo he did notwithſtanding he held ſtrongly a pretie while, at the length hee pluckt out the ſame, to the great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the beholders: yet when we ſaw his tongue he would neither ſpeake, nor yet could heare. Quoth I to the Surgeon, knit two of his fingers together, and thruſt a ſticke betweene them, and rubbe the ſame vp and downe a little while, and for my life he ſpeaketh by and by. Sir quoth this Surgeon, I pray you let me practiſe another way, I was well contented to ſee the ſame. Hee had him into a houſe, and tyed a halter about the wreſts of his hands, and hoyſed him ouer a beame, and there did let him hang a good while: at the length with verie paine, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for Gods ſake to lette him downe: ſo hee that was both deafe and dumbe, could in ſhort time both heare and ſpeake. Then I tooke the money I could finde in his purſe, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the ſame to the poore people dwelling there, which was xv. pence halfepeny, being al that we could find. That done, and this merry miracle madly made, I ſent them with my ſeruaunt to the next Iuſticer, wher they preached on the pillory for want of a pulpit and were well whipped, and none did bewaile them.</p>

Thus profitably he had conſumed the day, nothing talking of his helping the walking Mort out of the mire, neither of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt nor yet of her promiſe. Thus feeding her with friendly fantaſies conſumed two houres and more. Then fayning how he would ſee in what caſe his horſes were in and how they wer dreſſed, repaired couertly into the barne, where as his friendly foes lurked priuily, vnleſſe it were this mannerly Mort, that comly couched on a bottle of ſtraw.

If the vpright man come in where they lye, he hath his choiſe, and creepeth in cloſe by his Doxe, the Roge hath his leauings. If the Morts or Doxes lie or be lodged in ſome farmers barn, and the doore be either locked or made faſt to them, then wil not the vpright man preſſe to come in vnleſſe it bee in barnes &amp; out houſes ſtanding alone, or ſome diſtance from houſes, which bee commonly knowne to them.

Sometime ſhall come in ſome Roge, ſome picking knaue, a nimble Prigge, hee walketh in ſoftly on nights when they be at reſt and plucketh of as many garments as be ought worth, that he may come by, and may eaſily carrie, and runneth away therewith, and maketh porte ſale at ſome conuenient place of theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſome be ſoon readie in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for want of their Caſters and Togemans: where in ſtead of bleſſing, is curſing: in place of praying, peſtilent prating, with odious othes and terrible threatnings. The vpright men haue giuen all theſe nicke names to the places aboueſaid. Yet haue we two notable places in Kent, not farre from London: the one is betweene Detford and Rothered, called the Kinges Barne, ſtanding alone, that they haunt commonly: the other is Ketbroke, ſtanding by Black heath halfe a mile from any houſe. There will they boldly draw the latch of the doore, and goe in when his family be at ſupper, and ſit downe without leaue, and eate and drinke with them, and eyther lie in the hall by the fire all night, or in the Barne, if there bee no roome in the houſe for them. If the doore be eyther bolted or lockt, and be not opened vnto them when they will, they will breake the ſame open to his further coſt. And in this barne ſometime do lie forty vpright men with their Doxes together at one time. And this muſt the poore Farmar ſuffer, or els they threaten to burne him, and all that he hath.</p>
