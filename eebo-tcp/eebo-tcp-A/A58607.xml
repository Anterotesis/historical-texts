            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>MATTH. XXV. 1, 2. &amp;c.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>Then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto
ten Virgins, which took their Lamps, and went
forth to meet the Bridegroom.</p>
                  <p>And five of them were wise, and five were fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y design at present is to explain this
<hi>Parable,</hi> and to make such <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
upon it as seem most naturally
and without squeezing the <hi>Parable</hi> to
spring from it: And then to make
some <hi>Application</hi> of it to our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then shall the Kingdom of Heaven
be likened unto ten Virgins;</hi> By the <hi>Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
is meant the state and condition of things under
the <hi>Gospel;</hi> By the <hi>ten Virgins,</hi> those who embraced
the Profession of it, which is here represented by their
<hi>taking their Lamps and going forth to meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom:</hi>
in allusion to the ancient Custom of <hi>Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
in which the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> was wont to lead home
his <hi>Bride</hi> in the Night by the light of <hi>Lamps</hi> or
<hi>Torches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:42331:5"/>
But this Profession was not in all equally firm and
fruitful; and therefore those who persever'd and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
stedfast in this Profession, notwithstanding all the
temptations and allurements of the World, and all
the fierce storms and assaults of persecution to which
this Profession was exposed; and being thus firmly root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it, did bring forth the fruits of the Spirit and
abound in the Graces and Virtues of a good life, These
are the <hi>wise Virgins:</hi> But those who either deserted
this Profession, or did not bring forth fruits answerable
to it, are the <hi>foolish Virgins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this is the true difference between them
will appear, if we consider how the <hi>Parable</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
them, <hi>vers. 3, 4. They that were foolish took their
Lamps, and took no Oyl with them: But the wise took
Oyl in their Vessels with their Lamps.</hi> So that they both
took their <hi>Lamps,</hi> and both lighted them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must both be suppos'd to have some <hi>oyl</hi> in their
<hi>Lamps</hi> at first, as appears from <hi>verse</hi> 8. where <hi>the
foolish Virgins said unto the wise, give us of your oyl, for
our Lamps are gone out.</hi> They had it seems some Oyl
in their Lamps at first, which kept them lighted for a
little while, but had taken no care for a future supply.
And therefore the difference between the <hi>wise</hi> and
<hi>foolish</hi> Virgins did not, as some have imagin'd, consist
in this, that the <hi>wise</hi> Virgins had Oyl, but the <hi>foolish</hi>
had none; but in this, that the <hi>foolish</hi> had taken no
care for a further supply, after the Oyl which was at
first put into their Lamps was spent; as the <hi>wise</hi> had
done, who besides the Oyl that was in their Lamps
carried likewise a <hi>Reserve</hi> in some other <hi>Vessel,</hi> for a
continual supply of the <hi>Lamp,</hi> as there should be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
<hi>the wise took Oyl in their Vessels with their Lamps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42331:5"/>
Now the meaning of all this is, That they who are
represented by the <hi>wise Virgins</hi> had not only embraced
the Profession of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, as the <hi>foolish
Virgins</hi> also had done, for they both had their Lamps
lighted; but they likewise persever'd in that Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and brought forth fruits answerable to it. For by
<hi>Oyl</hi> in their <hi>Lamps</hi> and the first lighting of them, which
was common to them both, is meant that solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> which all <hi>Christians</hi>
make in <hi>Baptism:</hi> By that farther <hi>supply of Oyl,</hi> which
the <hi>wise Virgins</hi> only took care to provide, is signified
our constancy and perseverance in this Profession, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the fruits of the Spirit, and the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Grace</hi> received in <hi>Baptism</hi> by the practice
and exercise of all the <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Virtues</hi> of a good
life whereby men are fitted and prepar'd for <hi>Death</hi> and
<hi>Judgment,</hi> which are here represented to us by the
<hi>coming of the Bridegroom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being plainly the main scope and intention of
the <hi>Parable,</hi> I shall explain the rest of it, as there shall
be occasion, under the several <hi>Observations</hi> which I
shall raise from the several parts of it. And they shall
be these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I observe the charitable <hi>Decorum</hi> which our
<hi>B. Saviour</hi> keeps in this as well as in the rest of his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables;</hi>
as if He would fain suppose and hope, that
among those who enjoy the <hi>Gospel</hi> and make professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, the number of them that are truly good is
equal to those that are bad. For our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> here
represents the whole number of the <hi>Professors</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
by <hi>ten Virgins,</hi> the half whereof the <hi>Parable</hi>
seems to suppose to be truly and really good, and to
persevere in goodness to the end, <hi>vers. 1, 2. Then shall
the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten Virgins, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42331:6"/>
took their Lamps and went forth to meet the Bridegroom:
And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I observe how very common it is for men
to neglect this great concernment of their Souls, <hi>viz.</hi>
a due preparation for another World; and how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
men are to deceive themselves herein, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon any thing else, how groundless and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
soever, rather than to take pains to be really
good and fit for Heaven. And this is in a very lively
manner represented to us in the description of the
<hi>foolish Virgins,</hi> who had provided no <hi>supply</hi> of <hi>Oyl</hi> in
their <hi>Vessels,</hi> and when the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> was coming
would have furnish'd themselves by <hi>borrowing</hi> or <hi>buying</hi>
of others, <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I observe, That even the better sort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are not careful and watchful as they ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
themselves for Death and Judgment: <hi>Whilst the
Bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept;</hi> even the
<hi>wise</hi> Virgins as well as the foolish.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I observe further, how little is to be done
by us, to any good purpose, in this great work of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi>
when it is deferr'd and put off to the last. Thus
the <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> did, and what a sad confusion and
hurry they were in we may see <hi>vers. 6, 7, 8, 9. And at
midnight there was a cry made, Behold! the Bridegroom
cometh; go ye out to meet Him. At midnight;</hi> the most
dismal and unseasonable time of all other: <hi>Then all
those Virgins arose, and trimmed their Lamps: and the
foolish said unto the wise, give us of your Oyl for our
Lamps are gone out: But the wise ans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ered, not so; lest
there be not enough for us and you; but go ye rather to
them that sell, and buy for your selves.</hi> And how ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
all that they could do at that time prov'd to be,
we find, <hi>verse 10, 11, 12; And whilst they went to buy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42331:6"/>
the Bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in
wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h him to the marriage, and the door was shut. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
came also the other Virgins, saying, Lord, Lord,
open to us: But he answered and said, verily I say unto
you, I know you not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I observe that there is no such thing as <hi>Works</hi>
of <hi>Super-erogation;</hi> That no man can do more than
needs, and is his duty to do, by way of preparation
for another World. For when the <hi>foolish Virgins</hi>
would have begg'd of the <hi>wise</hi> some <hi>Oyl for their
Lamps, the wise answered, not so; lest there be not enough
for us and you.</hi> It was only the <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> that
had entertain'd this foolish conceit, that there might
be an <hi>over-plus</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi> in others sufficient
to supply their want: But the <hi>wise</hi> knew not of any
they had to spare, but suppos'd all that they had little
enough to qualify them for the reward of eternal
life; <hi>Not so,</hi> say they, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>lest at any time,</hi> lest
when there should be need and occasion, all that we
have done, or could do, should prove little enough for
our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly</hi> and <hi>lastly,</hi> I observe, That if we could sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
any persons to be so over-good, as to have more
grace and goodness than needs to qualify them for
the reward of eternal life, yet there is no <hi>assigning</hi>
and <hi>transferring</hi> of this <hi>over-plus</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi>
from one man to another. For we see, <hi>verse</hi> 9, 10.
that all the ways which they could think of, of <hi>borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or <hi>buying Oyl</hi> of others, did all prove ineffectual;
because the thing is in its own nature impracticable,
that one Sinner should be in a condition to merit for
another.</p>
            <p>All these <hi>Observations</hi> seem to have some fair and
probable foundation in some part or other of this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:42331:7"/>
and most of them, I am sure, are agreeable
to the main scope and intention of the whole. I shall
speak to them severally, and as briefly as I can.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> I observe the charitable <hi>Decorum</hi> which our
<hi>B. Saviour</hi> keeps in this, as well as in the rest of his
<hi>Parables;</hi> as if he would fain suppose and hope, that
among those who enjoy the <hi>Gospel</hi> and make <hi>Prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of it, the number of those who make a firm and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Profession of it, and persevere in goodness to the
end, is equal to the number of those who do not make
good their Profession, or who fall off from it.</p>
            <p>I shall not be long upon this, because I lay the least
stress upon it, of all the rest. I shall only take notice,
that our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> in this <hi>Parable</hi> represents the whole
number of the <hi>Professors</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> by <hi>ten Virgins,</hi>
the half of which the <hi>Parable</hi> seems to suppose to have
sincerely embraced the <hi>Christian Profession,</hi> and to have
persever'd therein to the last; <hi>The Kingdom of heaven
shall be likened unto ten Virgin, which took their Lamps
and went forth to meet the Bridegroom: And five of them
were wise, and five were foolish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>Decorum</hi> our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> seems carefully
to observe in his other <hi>Parables:</hi> As in the <hi>Parable</hi>
of the <hi>Prodigal, Luke</hi> 15. where for <hi>one</hi> Son that left
his Father, and took riotous courses, there was <hi>another</hi>
that stayed always with him and continued constant to
his duty. And in the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>ten Talents,</hi>
which immediately follows that of the <hi>ten Virgins,
two</hi> are supposed to improve the Talents committed to
them, for <hi>one</hi> that made no improvement of his. He
that had <hi>five Talents</hi> committed to him made them
<hi>five more,</hi> and he that had <hi>two</hi> gained <hi>other two;</hi> and
only he that had but <hi>one Talent, hid it in the earth,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:42331:7"/>
and made no improvement of it. And in the <hi>Parable</hi>
which I am now upon, the number of the <hi>Professors</hi>
of <hi>Christianity,</hi> who took care to fit and prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for the <hi>coming of the Bridegroom,</hi> is supposed
equal to the number of those who did not.</p>
            <p>And whether this be particularly intended in the
<hi>Parable</hi> or not, it may however be thus far instructive
to us; That we should be so far from lessening the
number of <hi>true Christians,</hi> and from confining the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> within a narrow compass, so as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
out of its <hi>Communion</hi> the far greatest part of the
<hi>Professors</hi> of <hi>Christianity;</hi> that on the contrary, we
should enlarge the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> as much as we
can, and extend our charity to all <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
of what <hi>Denomination</hi> soever, as far as regard
to Truth and to the foundations of the <hi>Christian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
will permit us to believe and hope well of them;
and rather be contented to err a little on the favourable
and charitable part than to be mistaken on the censorious
and damning side.</p>
            <p>And for this reason perhaps it is, that our <hi>B. Saviour</hi>
thought fit to frame his <hi>Parables</hi> with so remarkable
a <hi>Byass</hi> to the charitable side: Partly to instruct us,
to extend our charity towards all <hi>Christian</hi> Churches,
and <hi>Professors</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, and our good
hopes concerning them, as far as with reason we can:
And partly to reprove the uncharitableness of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
who positively excluded all the rest of Mankind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
themselves, from all hopes of Salvation. An odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
temper, which to the infinite Scandal of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Name and Profession, hath prevail'd upon some
<hi>Christians</hi> to that notorious degree, as not only to shut
out all the <hi>Reform'd</hi> Part of the <hi>Western</hi> Church, almost
equal in number to themselves, from all hopes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42331:8"/>
under the notion of <hi>Hereticks;</hi> but likewise to
un-church all the other Churches of the <hi>Christian</hi> World,
which are of much greater extent and number than
themselves, that do not own subjection to the <hi>Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Rome:</hi> And this they do, by declaring it to be <hi>of
necessity to Salvation for every Creature to be subject to
the Roman Bishop.</hi> And this <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> over all <hi>Christian</hi> Churches <hi>Bellarmin</hi> calls
<hi>the Sum of the Christian Religion.</hi> So that the <hi>Roman</hi>
Communion is plainly founded in <hi>Schism,</hi> that is,
in the most unchristian and uncharitable <hi>Principle</hi> that
can be, namely, <hi>that they are the only true Church of
Christ, out of which none can be saved:</hi> which was
the very <hi>Schism</hi> of the <hi>Donatists.</hi> And in this they are
so positive, that the Learned men of that Church, in
their Disputes and Writings, are much more inclinable
to believe the Salvation of <hi>Heathens</hi> to be possible; than
of any of those <hi>Christians</hi> whom they are pleas'd to
call <hi>Hereticks.</hi> The <hi>Faith</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is
certainly none of the best; but of one of the greatest
and most essential Vertues of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> I
mean <hi>Charity,</hi> I doubt they have the least share of
any <hi>Christian</hi> Church this day in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I observe, not from any particular <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
but from the main <hi>Scope</hi> and design of this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi>
How very apt a great part of <hi>Christians</hi> are to
neglect this great concernment of their Souls, <hi>viz.</hi> a
careful and due preparation for another World; and
how willing they are to deceive themselves in this
matter, and to depend upon any thing else, how ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and unreasonable soever, rather than to take the
pains to be really good and fit for Heaven. And this
is in a very lively manner represented to us in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42331:8"/>
of the <hi>foolish Virgins,</hi> who had provided no
<hi>supply</hi> of <hi>Oyl</hi> in their <hi>Vessels,</hi> and when the <hi>Bridegroom</hi>
was <hi>coming</hi> would have furnish'd themselves by <hi>bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing</hi>
or <hi>buying</hi> of others, <hi>vers.</hi> 8, 9, 10. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
themselves with having their <hi>Lamps</hi> lighted at
their first setting out to meet the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> that is,
with their being admitted into the <hi>Profession</hi> of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
by <hi>Baptism,</hi> but either were not stedfast in this
<hi>Profession,</hi> or were not careful to adorn it with the <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
and <hi>Vertues</hi> of a good life.</p>
            <p>And the true Reason why men are so very apt to
deceive themselves in this matter, and are so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought to those things wherein Religion mainly
consists, I mean the fruits of the Spirit and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of real Goodness; I say, the true reason of this
is, because they are extremely desirous to reconcile, if
it were possible, the hopes of eternal happiness in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World with a liberty to live as they list in this
present World: They are loth to be at the trouble
and drudgery of mortifying their lusts, and governing
their passions, and bridling their tongues, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all those duties which are comprehended in those
<hi>two great Commandments</hi> of the <hi>Love of God</hi> and of
our <hi>Neighbour:</hi> They would fain gain the favour of
God, and make their calling and election sure, by some
easier way than by <hi>giving all diligence</hi> to add to their
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> the <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> of a good
life.</p>
            <p>For the plain truth of the matter is, men had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that Religion should be any thing than what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is, <hi>viz.</hi> the thwarting and crossing of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
inclinations, the curing of their evil and corrupt
affections, the due care and government of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
appetites and passions, the sincere endeavour and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42331:9"/>
the constant practice of all holiness and virtue in their
lives: And therefore they had much rather have
something that might handsomely palliate and excuse
their evil inclinations and practices, than to be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to retrench and renounce them; and rather than
amend and reform their wicked lives, they would be
contented to make an <hi>honourable amends</hi> and compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Almighty God in some other way.</p>
            <p>This hath been the way and folly of Mankind in
all ages, to defeat the great end and design of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to thrust it by, by substituting something else in
the place of it which, as they think, may serve the
turn as well, having the appearance of as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
and respect towards God, and really costing
them more money and pains, than that which God
requires of them. Men have ever been apt thus to
impose upon themselves, and to please themselves
with a conceit of pleasing God full as well, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by some other way than that which he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
and appointed for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>By this means, and upon this <hi>false Principle,</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
hath ever been apt to degenerate both among
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> into external and little observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and into a great zeal for lesser things with a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
neglect of the greater and weightier matters of
Religion; and, in a word, into infinite <hi>Superstitions</hi>
of one kind or other, and an arrogant conceit of the
extraordinary righteousness and merit of these things:
In which some have proceeded to that height, as if
they could drive a strict bargain with God for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life and happiness; and have treated Him in so
insolent a manner, by their Doctrine of the <hi>Merit</hi> of
their <hi>Devotions</hi> and <hi>good Works,</hi> as if God were
as much beholden to them for their service and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42331:9"/>
as they are to Him for the reward of them;
which they are not afraid to say they may challenge
at God's hands as of right and justice belonging to
them.</p>
            <p>Nay, so far have they carried this <hi>Doctrine</hi> in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as not only to pretend to merit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life for themselves, but likewise to do a great
deal more for the benefit and advantage of others
who have not righteousness and goodness enough of
their own: Which was the silly conceit of the <hi>foolish
Virgins</hi> here in the <hi>Parable,</hi> as I shall have occasion to
shew more fully by and by.</p>
            <p>And it is no great wonder that such easy ways of
Religion and pleasing God are very grateful to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature of Man, and that men who are resolv'd to
continue in an evil course are glad to be of a Church
which will assure Salvation to men upon such terms:
The great difficulty is, for men to believe that things
which are so apparently absurd and unreasonable can
be true; and to persuade themselves that they can
impose upon God by such pretences of service and
obedience, as no wise <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Father</hi> upon earth is
to be deluded withal by his <hi>Subjects</hi> or <hi>Children.</hi> We
ought to have worthier thoughts of God, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that He is a <hi>great King,</hi> and will be obey'd and
observ'd by his creatures <hi>in his own way</hi> and make them
happy upon his own terms: and that obedience to
what he commands is better and more acceptable to him
than any other sacrifice that we can offer, which he
hath not required at our hands: and likewise, that
he is infinitely wise and good; and therefore that the
<hi>Laws,</hi> which he hath given us to live by, are much more
likely and certain means of our happiness, than any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions</hi>
and <hi>devices</hi> of our own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:42331:10"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I observe that even the better and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate
sort of <hi>Christians</hi> are not so careful and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as they ought to prepare themselves for <hi>Death</hi> and
<hi>Judgment; whilst the Bridegroom tarried, they all slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
and slept.</hi> Even the <hi>Disciples</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
whilst he was yet personally present with them, and
after a particular charge given them from his own
mouth, <hi>Watch and pray lest ye enter into temptation;</hi>
yet did not keep that guard upon themselves as to
<hi>watch with him for one hour. In many things,</hi> says <hi>St. James,
we offend all;</hi> even the best of us: And who is there
that doth not, some time or other, remit of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy
and care, so as to give the Devil an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and to lye open to temptation, for want of a
continual guard upon himself? But then the difference
between the <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> was this, that tho
they both <hi>slept,</hi> yet the <hi>wise</hi> did not let their <hi>Lamps</hi> go
out; they neither quitted their <hi>Profession,</hi> nor did they
extinguish it by a bad life: and tho when the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom</hi>
came suddenly upon them, they were not so actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
prepar'd to meet him by a continual vigilancy, yet
they were habitually prepar'd by the good dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their minds and the general course of a holy
life: Their <hi>Lamps</hi> might <hi>burn dim</hi> for want of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
trimming, but they had <hi>Oyl</hi> in their <hi>Vessels</hi> to
<hi>supply</hi> their <hi>Lamps,</hi> which the <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
no care to provide. But surely the greatest wisdom
of all is to maintain a continual watchfulness, that so
we may not be surpriz'd by the <hi>coming of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,</hi>
and be in a confusion when <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Judgment</hi>
shall overtake us. And <hi>blessed are those Servants,</hi> and
<hi>wise</hi> indeed, whose <hi>Lamps</hi> always <hi>burn bright,</hi> and
whom the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> when <hi>he comes shall find watching</hi>
and in a fit posture and preparation to meet Him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:42331:10"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I observe likewise, how little is to be done <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
by us, to any good purpose, in this great work of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi>
when it is deferr'd and put off to the last.
And thus the <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> did, but what a sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
and hurry they were in at the sudden coming
of the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> when they were not only <hi>asleep,</hi>
but when after they were awaken'd they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
altogether unprovided of that which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to trim their <hi>Lamps</hi> and to put them in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
to meet the <hi>Bridegroom:</hi> When they wanted that
which was necessary at that very instant, but could not
be provided in an instant: I say, what a tumult and
confusion they were in, being thus surpriz'd, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
represents to us at large, <hi>vers. 6, 7, 8, 9. and at
midnight there was a cry made, Behold! the Bridegroom</hi>
cometh, <hi>go ye out to meet him. Then all those Virgins
arose and trimmed their Lamps,</hi> that is, they went about
it as well as they could; and the <hi>foolish said unto the wise,
give us of your Oyl, for our Lamps are gone out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>At midnight there was a cry made,</hi> that is, at the
most dismal and unseasonable time of all other; when
they were fast asleep, and suddenly awaken'd in great
terror, when they could not on the sudden recollect
themselves, and consider what to do; when the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
was so very short, that they had neither time to
consider what was fit to be done, nor time to do it in.</p>
            <p>And such is the Case of those who put off their
<hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Preparation</hi> for another World, till they
are surpriz'd by <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Judgment;</hi> for it comes all
to one in the issue, which of them it be. The <hi>Parable</hi>
indeed seems more particularly to point at our <hi>Lord's
coming to Judgment,</hi> but the case is much the same
as to those who are surpriz'd by <hi>sudden Death;</hi> such
as gives them but little, or not sufficient time for so
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42331:11"/>
great a work: because such as <hi>Death</hi> leaves them, <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
will certainly find them.</p>
            <p>And what a miserable confusion must they needs be
in, who are thus surpriz'd either by the one or the
other? How unfit should we be, if the <hi>general Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of the World should come upon us on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
to meet that <hi>great Judge</hi> at his <hi>coming,</hi> if we have
made no preparation for it before that time? What
shall we then be able to do, in that great and universal
consternation, when the <hi>Son of man shall appear in the
clouds of Heaven, with power and great glory;</hi> when
the <hi>Sun shall be darken'd, and the Moon turned into
blood, and all the powers of Heaven shall be shaken:</hi> when
<hi>all Nature</hi> shall feel such violent pangs and convulsions,
and the whole World shall be in a combustion flaming
and cracking about our ears: When <hi>the Heavens shall
be shrivel'd up as a Scroll when it is roll'd together,</hi> and
the <hi>Earth</hi> shall be toss'd from its Center, <hi>and every
Mountain and Island shall be removed?</hi> What thoughts
can the wisest men then have about them, in the
midst of so much noise and terror? Or if they could
have any, what time will there then be to put them
in execution? when they shall see the <hi>Angel, that
standeth upon the Sea and upon the Earth, lifting up his
hand to Heaven and swearing by Him that liveth for ever
and ever that Time shall be no longer;</hi> as this dreadful
Day is described <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 5, 6. and <hi>chap.</hi> 6. 15. where
Sinners are represented at the <hi>Appearance</hi> of this <hi>Great
Judge,</hi> not as flying to God in hopes of mercy, but
as flying from Him in utter despair of finding mercy
with Him: <hi>The Kings of the Earth, and the Great
Men, and the Mighty Men, and the Rich Men, and the
Great Captains hid themselves in the Dens and in the
Rocks of the Earth; and said to the Mountains and Rocks
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42331:11"/>
fall on us and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on
the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the
Great Day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to
stand?</hi> The biggest and the boldest Sinners that ever
were upon Earth, shall then flee from the face of
Him whom they have so often blasphemed and denied;
and shall so far despair of finding mercy with Him
in that Day, who would sue to Him for it no sooner,
that they shall address themselves to the <hi>Mountains</hi> and
<hi>Rocks,</hi> as being more pitiful and exorable than <hi>He; to
hide them from the face of Him that sitteth on the Throne,
and from the wrath of the Lamb: From the wrath of the
Lamb,</hi> to signify to us that nothing is more terrible
than <hi>Meekness</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> when they are throughly
provok'd and turn'd into <hi>Fury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In such dreadful confusion shall all impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
be, when they shall be surpriz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by that <hi>Great
and terrible Day of the Lord:</hi> And the <hi>Case</hi> of a <hi>dying
Sinner,</hi> who would take no care in the time of his Life
and Health to make preparation for another World, is
not much more hopeful and comfortable.</p>
            <p>For alas! how little is it that a sick and dying man
can do in such a strait of time? in the midst of so much
pain and weakness of Body, and of such confusion
and amazement of Mind. With what heart can he set
about so great a Work, for which there is so little time?
With what face can he apply himself to God in this
extremity, whom he hath so disdainfully neglected all
the days of his Life? And how can he have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to hope, that God will hear his cries and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
his tears that are forc'd from him in this day of
his necessity? when he is conscious to himself that in
that <hi>long day</hi> of God's <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> he turned
a deaf ear to all his merciful invitations, and <hi>rejected
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42331:12"/>
the counsel of God against himself.</hi> In a word how can
he who <hi>would not know, in that his Day, the things which
belonged to his peace,</hi> expect any other but that they
should now be for ever <hi>hid from his eyes,</hi> which are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be clos'd in utter darkness?</p>
            <p>I will not pronounce any thing concerning the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
of a <hi>death-bed Repentance:</hi> But I am sure
that it is very difficult, and I believe very rare. We
have but one <hi>Example,</hi> that I know of, in the whole
<hi>Bible</hi> of the Repentance of a dying Sinner; I mean
that of the <hi>penitent Thief</hi> upon the <hi>Cross:</hi> And the
circumstances of his Case are so peculiar and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
that I cannot see that it affords any ground of
hope and encouragement to men in ordinary Cases. We
are not like to suffer in the company of the <hi>Son of God</hi>
and of the <hi>Saviour of the World;</hi> and if we could do
so, it is not certain that we should behave our selves
towards Him so well as the <hi>penitent Thief</hi> did, and
make so very good an end of so very bad a Life.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Parable</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> is so far from giving
any encouragement to a <hi>Death-bed Repentance</hi> and
<hi>Preparation,</hi> that it rather represents their Case as
desperate who put off their <hi>Preparation</hi> to that Time.
How ineffectual all that the <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> could do at
that time did in the conclusion prove, is set forth to us
at large in the <hi>Parable;</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> They wanted <hi>Oyl,</hi> but could
neither <hi>borrow</hi> nor <hi>buy</hi> it: They would <hi>then</hi> fain have
had it, and ran about to get it; but it was not to be
obtain'd neither by entreaty, nor for money: First
they apply themselves to the <hi>wise Virgins,</hi> for a share
in the <hi>over-plus</hi> of their <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Virtues;</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 8.</note> 
               <hi>the foolish
said unto the wise, give us of your Oyl for our Lamps

be not enough for us and you:</hi> The <hi>wise Virgins,</hi> it seems
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42331:12"/>
knew of none they had to spare: And then they are
represented as <hi>ironically</hi> sending the <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> to
some <hi>famous Market</hi> where this <hi>Oyl</hi> was pretended to
be <hi>sold; go ye rather to them that sell and buy for your
selves:</hi>
               <note place="margin">V 9.</note> And as dying and desperate persons are apt to
catch at every twig, and when they can see no hopes
of being saved, are apt to believe every one that will
give them any; so these foolish Virgins follow the
advice;<note place="margin">V. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and whilst they went to buy, the Bridegroom
came; and they that were ready went in with him to the
marriage, and the door was shut; and afterwards came
also the other Virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us;
but he answered and said, verily I say unto you, I know
you not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You see how <hi>little,</hi> or rather <hi>no</hi> encouragement at
all there is from any the least circumstance in this
<hi>Parable,</hi> for those who have delay'd their <hi>Preparation</hi>
for another World till they be overtaken by <hi>Death</hi> or
<hi>Judgment,</hi> to hope by any thing that they can then do,
by any importunity which they can then use, to gain
admission into Heaven. Let those consider this with
fear and trembling, who forget God and neglect
Religion all their Life-time, and yet feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with vain hopes by some <hi>Device</hi> or other to
be admitted into Heaven at last.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I observe that there is no such thing as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
               <hi>Works of Super-erogation,</hi> that is, that no man can
do more than needs, and than is his duty to do, by
way of <hi>Preparation</hi> for another World.<note place="margin">V. 8.</note> For when
the <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> would have begg'd of the <hi>wise</hi> some
<hi>Oyl</hi> for their <hi>Lamps, the wise answered, not so; lest
there be not enough for us and you:</hi>
               <note place="margin">V 9.</note> It was only the
<hi>foolish Virgins</hi> that in the time of their extremity, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42331:13"/>
when they were conscious that they wanted that
which was absolutely necessary to qualify them for
admission into Heaven, who had entertain'd this <hi>idle
Conceit</hi> that there might be an <hi>overplus</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and
<hi>Merit</hi> in others suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cient to supply their want: But
the <hi>wise</hi> knew not of any they had to spare, but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
all that they had done, or could possibly do,
to be little enough to qualify them for the glorious
Reward of eternal Life: <hi>Not so,</hi> say they, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>lest
at any time,</hi> that is, lest when there should be need
and occasion, all that we have done, or could do,
should be little enough for our selves: And in this
<hi>Point</hi> they had been plainly instructed by the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom</hi>
himself, <hi>But ye, when ye have done all, say we
are unprofitable servants, and have done nothing but
what was our duty to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet this <hi>Conceit</hi> of the <hi>foolish Virgins,</hi> as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
as it is, hath been taken up in good earnest by
a <hi>grave Matron,</hi> who gives out her self to be the
<hi>Mother and Mistress of all Churches,</hi> and <hi>the only
infallible Oracle of Truth,</hi> I mean the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
whose avowed <hi>Doctrine</hi> it is, that there are some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
so excellently good that they may do more than
needs for their own Salvation: And therefore when
they have done as much for themselves as in strict duty
they are bound to do, and thereby have paid down
a full and valuable consideration for Heaven, and
as much as in equal justice between God and Man
it is worth; that then they may go to work again
for their <hi>Friends,</hi> and begin a <hi>new Score;</hi> and from
that time forwards may put the <hi>Surplusage</hi> of their
<hi>good Works</hi> as a <hi>Debt</hi> upon God, to be laid up in the
<hi>Publick Treasury</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as so many <hi>Bills of
Credit</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> by his <hi>Pardons</hi> and <hi>Indulgences</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:42331:13"/>
may dispense, and place to whose account he pleases:
And out of this <hi>Bank,</hi> which is kept at <hi>Rome,</hi> those
who never took care to have any Righteousness of
their own may be supplied at reasonable rates.</p>
            <p>To which they have added a further <hi>supply</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi>
if there should be any need of it, by the <hi>Sacrament</hi>
of <hi>extreme Vnction,</hi> never heard of in the <hi>Christian
Church</hi> for many Ages; but devised, as it were on
purpose, to furnish such <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> with <hi>Oyl</hi> as are
here described in the <hi>Parable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus by one <hi>Device</hi> or other they have enervated
the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> to that degree, that it hath almost
quite lost its true virtue and efficacy upon the hearts
and lives of men: And, instead of the real fruits of
<hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> it produceth little else but
<hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Folly;</hi> or if it produce any <hi>real Virtues,</hi>
yet even the virtue of those <hi>Virtues</hi> is in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
spoil'd by their arrogant pretences of <hi>Merit</hi> and
<hi>Super-erogation,</hi> and is render'd insignificant to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by their insolent carriage and behaviour towards
God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly</hi> and <hi>lastly,</hi> if we could suppose any Persons
to be so overgrown with Goodness, as to have more
than needs to qualify them for the Reward of eternal
Life; yet there can be no <hi>assigning</hi> and <hi>transferring</hi> of
this <hi>overplus</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> from one man to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For we see that all the ways that could be
thought on of <hi>begging,</hi> or <hi>borrowing,</hi> or <hi>buying Oyl</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
did all prove ineffectual; because the thing is in
its own nature impracticable, that one Sinner who
owes all that he hath, and much more to God, should
have any thing to spare wherewithal to <hi>merit</hi> for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42331:14"/>
Indeed our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> hath <hi>merited</hi> for us all the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of eternal Life,</hi> upon the <hi>Conditions</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>
and <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Obedience:</hi> But the infinite <hi>Merit</hi>
of his <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> will be of no benefit and
advantage to us, if we our selves be not really and
inherently righteous. So <hi>St. John</hi> tells us, and warns
us to beware of the contrary <hi>Conceit, Little children, let
no man deceive you, he that doth righteonsness is righteous,
even as He is righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we do sincerely endeavour to please God and to
keep his commandments in the general course of a
holy and virtuous Life, the <hi>Merit</hi> of <hi>Christ's perfect
Obedience</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> will be available with God
for the acceptance of our <hi>sincere</hi> though but <hi>imperfect
Obedience.</hi> But if we take no care to be <hi>righteous</hi>
and good our-selves, the <hi>perfect righteousness</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>
will do us no good; much less the <hi>imperfect righteousness</hi>
of any other man who is a Sinner himself. And
the holiest man that ever was upon Earth can no
more <hi>assign</hi> and make over his <hi>Righteousness,</hi> or
<hi>Repentance,</hi> or any part of either, to another that
wants it, than a man can <hi>bequeath</hi> his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> or
<hi>Learning</hi> to his <hi>Heir,</hi> or his <hi>Friend:</hi> No more than a
<hi>sick man</hi> can be restored to <hi>Health</hi> by virtue of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Physick</hi> which another man hath taken.</p>
            <p>Let no man therefore think of being good by a
<hi>Deputy,</hi> that cannot be contented to be happy and to
be saved the same way, that is, to go to <hi>Hell</hi> and
to be tormented there in <hi>Person,</hi> and to go to <hi>Heaven</hi>
and be admitted into that <hi>Place of Bliss</hi> only by <hi>Proxy.</hi>
So that these <hi>good Works</hi> with a <hi>hard name,</hi> and the
making over the <hi>Merit</hi> of them to others, have no
manner of foundation either in <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Reason,</hi>
but are all mere <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Fiction</hi> in <hi>Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:42331:14"/>
The <hi>Inference</hi> from all this shall be the <hi>application</hi>
which our <hi>Saviour</hi> makes of this <hi>Parable,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V 13.</note> 
               <hi>Watch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the
Son of man cometh;</hi> as if he had said, the design of
this <hi>Parable</hi> is to instruct us that we ought to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
vigilant, and always upon our guard and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
readiness and preparation <hi>to meet the Bridegroom;</hi>
because we know not the time of his coming to <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
nor yet, which will be of the same consequence
and concernment to us, do any of us know the precise
time of our own <hi>Death.</hi> Either of these may happen
at any time, and come when we least expect them. And
therefore we should make the best and speediest provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that we can for another World, and should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
upon our watch and trimming our Lamps, that
we may not be surprized by either of these; neither by
our own <hi>particular Death,</hi> nor by the <hi>general Judgment</hi>
of the World: <hi>Because the Son of man will come in a Day
when we look not for Him, and at an hour when we are not
aware.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More particularly, we should take up a present and
effectual resolution not to delay our <hi>Repentance</hi> and
the reformation of our Lives, that we may not have
that great Work to do when we are not fit to do any
thing; no not to dispose of our <hi>temporal</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
much less to prepare for <hi>Eternity,</hi> and to do that
in a few moments which ought to have been the care
and endeavour of our whole Lives: That we may not
be forced to huddle up an imperfect, and I fear an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant
<hi>Repentance;</hi> and to do that in great haste and
confusion, which certainly does require our wisest and
most deliberate thoughts, and all the consideration in the
world.</p>
            <p>And we should provide store of <hi>Oil</hi> in our <hi>Vessels,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:42331:15"/>
wherewith to <hi>supply</hi> our <hi>Lamps</hi> that they may <hi>burn
bright</hi> to the last; I mean, we should improve the
<hi>Grace</hi> which we received in <hi>Baptism,</hi> by abounding in
the fruits of the Spirit and in all the substantial
Virtues of a good Life; that so <hi>an entrance may be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
to us abundantly into the everlasting Kingdom of
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this means, when we are called <hi>to meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,</hi>
we shall not be put to those miserable and
sharking shifts which the <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> were driven
to, of <hi>begging,</hi> or <hi>borrowing,</hi> or <hi>buying Oyl;</hi> which
will all fail us, when we come to depend upon them:
And though the Dying man may make a hard shift to
support himself with these false Comforts for a little
while, yet when the short Delusion is over, which will
be assoon as ever he is stepp'd into the other World,
he will to his everlasting confusion and trouble find the
door of Heaven shut against him, and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all his <hi>vast Treasure</hi> of <hi>Pardons</hi> and <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,</hi>
which have cost him so much and are worth
so little, he <hi>shall never see the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>lastly,</hi> we should take great care that we do not
extinguish our <hi>Lamps</hi> by <hi>quitting</hi> the <hi>Profession</hi> of our
<hi>Holy Religion</hi> upon any temptation of advantage, or
for fear of any loss or suffering whatsoever. This <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion</hi>
will call for all our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> all our
<hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Constancy,</hi>
               <q>Nunc animis opus, Aenea, nunc pectore firmo.</q>
When it comes to this <hi>Trial,</hi> we had need to <hi>gird up
the loins of our minds,</hi> to summon all our forces, and
to <hi>put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to
stand fast in an evil day, and when we have done all to stand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:42331:15"/>
               <hi>And now,</hi> my Brethren, <hi>to use the words of</hi> St. Peter,
I testify unto you,<note place="margin">1 Pet 5. 12.</note> that this is the true Grace of God
wherein ye stand. The Protestant Reformed <hi>Religion,
which we in this Nation profess, is the</hi> very Gospel of
Christ, <hi>the</hi> true ancient Christianity.</p>
            <p>And, for God's sake, since in this <hi>hour of Temptation,</hi>
when our Religion is in so apparent hazard, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to love it to that degree as to be contented to
part with any thing for it, let us resolve to practise it;
and to testify our love to it in the same way that our
<hi>Saviour</hi> would have us shew our love to Him, by <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will conclude all with the</hi> Apostle<hi>'s Exhortation,
so very proper for this purpose, and to this present
Time,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 1. 27.</note> Only let your conversation be as it becometh the
Gospel of Christ, <hi>that is, chiefly and above all take care
to lead lives suitable to the</hi> Christian <hi>Religion: And
then, as it follows,</hi> stand fast in one Spirit, with one
Mind, striving together for the Faith of the Gospel:
And in nothing terrified by your Adversaries, which to
them is an evident token of perdition, but to you of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and that of God.</p>
            <p>Now unto Him that is able to stablish you in the Gospel,
and to keep you from falling; and to present you faultless
before the presence of his Glory with exceeding joy: To
the only wise God our Saviour, be Glory and Majesty,
Dominion and Power, <hi>both</hi> now and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
