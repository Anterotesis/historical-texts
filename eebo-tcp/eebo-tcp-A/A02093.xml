         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

would straight to bedde, by the leaue of dame Bawde, who had her fee
too, and there he laye till about midnight, where three or foure old
Hacksters, whom she had prouided vpon purpose, came to the doore
and rapt lustely: who is there sayes the Bawde looking out of the
window, marry say they, such a Iustice (and named one about the
Cittie that is a mortall enemy to Cutpurses) who is now come to
search your house for a Iesuite and other susspected persons: alas sir
sayes shee, I haue none heere, well quoth they, Ope the doore. I
will, sayes shee, and with that she came into the Foystes Chamber:
who heard all this, and was a frayde it was some search for him,
so that he desired the Bawd to helpe him, that he might not be seene.
Why then (quoth she) step into this Closet. Hee whipt in hastely, and
neuer remembred his Cloathes: shee lock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be good to her, she was a poore Countrie Mayde come vp to

him at the first? With that, one of them turnd to the Bawd, and
did question with her what he was, &amp; where he was? Truly sir, sayes
<pb facs="tcp:14258:8"/>
she, they came to my house, and sayd they were man and wife; and for
my part I knew them for no other, and hee being afraid, is indeed (to
confesse the troth) shut vp in the Closet. <note place="margin"> Cardes well packt, are as halfe the game won.</note> No doubt (if it please your
Worship, saies one rakehell) I warrant you, he is some notable Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purse
or Pickpocket, that is afrayd to shew his face, come &amp; open the
Closet, and let vs looke on him. Nay sir sayes she, not for to night I
beseech your worship carry no man out of my house, I will giue my
word hee shall be foorth-comming to morrow morning. Your word
dame Bawd, saies one, tis not worth a straw. You Huswife, that saies
ye are his wife ye shall goe with vs: and for him, that we may be sure
he may not start, Ile take his Doublet, Hose, and Cloake, &amp; to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Ile send them to him by one of my men; were there a thousand
pounds in them, there shall not be a penny diminisht. The Whore
kneeled downe on her knees, and fained to cry pittifully, &amp; desired the
Iustice, (which was one of her companions) not to carry her to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Yes huswife, quoth he, your mate &amp; you shall not tarry togither
in one house, that you may make your tales all one, &amp; therefore bring
her away: and after, ye dame Bawd, see you lend him no other cloaths,
for I will send his in the morning betimes, and come you with him to
answere for lodging him. I will sir, sayes she: and so away goes the
Wench &amp; her companions laughing, and left the Bawd &amp; the Foyst.
As soone as the Bawd thought good, she vnlockt the Closet, &amp; curst
the time that euer they came in her house: now (quoth she) heere will <note place="margin"> Worse feard, then hurt.</note>
be a fayre adoe, how will you answer for your selfe? I feare me I shal
be in danger of the Cort. Well (quoth he) to be short, I would not
for fourty poundes come afore the Iustice. Mary no more would I,
quoth she; let me shift, if you were conueyed hence, but I haue not a
rag of mans apparell in the house. Why (quoth he) seeing it is early
morning, lend me a Blanket to put about me, and I will scape to a
friendes house of mine. Then leaue me a pawne, quoth the Bawde:
Alas I haue none, sayes he, but this Ring on my finger. Why that,
quoth she, or tarry while the Iustice comes: so he gaue it her, tooke
the Blanket and went his wayes, whither I know not, but to some
friendes house of his. Thus was this wily Foyst by the wit of a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile

after a little vnkinde gréeting betwixt vs (for I chid him for
his vnthriftinesse) he asked me where I had the horse: and I
told him how curteously the Seruingman had vsed me: why
then saies he, stay for him: nay quoth I, lets ride on, and get
you two vpon the empty horses, for he will ouer-take vs ere
we come at the towne, he rides on a stout lusty yong gelding:
so forward we went, and lookt often behind vs, but our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingman
came not. At last we comming to Spilsby, alighted
&amp; broke our fast, &amp; tied our horses at the doore, that if hee past

chastised my wantonnesse, and supprest my foolish

and themselues lesse sorrowfull. A fathers frowne is
a bridle to the childe, and a mothers checke is a stay to the

               <p>But leauing this digression, againe to the loosnesse of mine
owne life, who now hauing lost the glory of my youth, and
suffered such a base staue to possesse it, which many men of

shamelesse, insomuch he could not desire so much as I did
grant him: whereupon, séeing he durst not reueale it to my
father to demand me in marriage, he resolued to carry me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
secretly, &amp; therfore wisht me to prouide for my self, &amp; to
furnish me euery way both with money &amp; apparrell, hoping
as he said, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> after we were departed, and my father saw wee

liberally, as if wee had matcht with his good will. I that
was apt to any ill, agreed to this, and so wrought the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that he carried me away into a strange place, and then
vsing me a while as his wife, when our money beganne to
wax low, hee resolued secretly to go into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Countrey where
my father dwelt, to heare not onely how my father took my
departure, but what hope we had of his ensuing fauour: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I was loth to be left in a strange place, yet I was
willing to heare from my friends, who no doubt conceiued
much heart sorrow for my vnhappy fortunes: so that I
parted with a few teares, and enioyned him to make all the
haste he might to returne. He being gone, as the Eagles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
resort where the carrion is, so the brute being spred
abrode of my beauty, and that at such an Inne lay such a
faire young Gentlewoman, there resorted thither many
braue yong Gentlemen, and cutting companions, that tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled
with lust, aimed at the possession of my fauour, and by
sundry meanes sought to haue a sight of me, which I easily
granted to all, as a woman that counted it a glory to bee
wondred at by many mens eyes: insomuch that comming
amongst them, I set their hearts more and more on fire,
that there arose diuers brawles who should bee most in my
company. Being thus haunted by such a troope of lusty ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers,
I began to find mine owne folly, that had placed my
first affection so loosly, and therefore began as déeply to loath
him that was departed, as earst I liked him when hee was
present, vowing in my selfe, though he had the spoile of my
virginity, yet neuer after should he triumph in the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my fauour: and therefore began I to affection these
new-come guests, and one aboue the rest, who was a braue
yong Gentleman, and no lesse addicted vnto me, then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted
vnto him: for daily hee courted mee with amorous
Sonnets, and curious pend letters, and sent me Iewels,
and all that I might grace him with the name of my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant:
I returned him as louing lines at last, and so conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his lusting desire, that secretly and vnknowne to all the
<pb facs="tcp:14258:16"/>
rest, I made him sundry nights my bed-fellow; where I so
bewitcht him with swéet words, that the man began déeply
to dote vpon me, insomuch that selling some portio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that he had, he put it into ready mony, and prouiding Horse
and all things conuenient, carried me secretly away, almost
as farre as the Bathe. This was my second choy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, and my
second shame: thus I went forward in wickednesse, and
delighted in change, hauing left mine old loue to looke after
some other mate more fit for my purpose: how he tooke my
departure when he returned, I little cared: for now I had
my content, a Gentleman, yong, lusty, and indued with
good qualities, and one that loued mee more tenderly then
himselfe. Thus liued this new entertained friend &amp; I toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnmarried, yet as man and wife for a while, so louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as was to his content and my credit: but as the Tyger,
though for a while she hide her clawes, yet at last shee will
reueale her cruelty: and as the <hi>Agnus Castus</hi> leafe when it
lookes most dry, is then most full of moisture, so Womens
wantonnes is not qualified by their warines, nor doth their
charinesse for a moneth warrant their castity for euer, which
I proued true: for my supposed husband being euery way
a man of worth, could not so couertly hide himselfe in the
Country, though a stranger, but that he fell in acquaintance
with many braue Gentlemen, whom hee brought home to
his lodging, not onely to honour them with his liberall cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
but also to sée me, being proud if any man of worth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
my beauty. Alas poore Gentleman, too much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcht
by the wilinesse of a woman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had hee déemed my
heart to be a harbour for euery new desire, or mine eye a
suter to euery face, hee would not haue béene so fond as to
haue brought his companions into my company, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would haue mewed me vp as a Hen, to haue kept that
seuerall to himselfe by force, which hee could not retaine by
kindnesse: but the honest minded Nouice little suspected
my change, although I (God wot) placed my delight in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> desire of new choyce, which fell out thus.
<pb facs="tcp:14258:17"/>
Amongst the rest of the Gentlemen that kept him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
there was one that was his most familiar, and hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
more trust and confidence in him then in all the rest:
this Gentleman began to bee déepely inamored of mee, and
shewed it by many signes, which I easily perceiued; and I,
whose eare was pliant to euery sweet word, and who so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of all that were beautiful, affected him no lesse: so that
loue preuailing aboue friendship, hee brake the matter with
me, and made not many suites in vaine before he had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his purpose: for he had what he wisht, and I had what
contented me. I will not confesse that any of the rest had
some sildome fauours, but this Gentleman was my second
selfe, and I loued him more for the time at the héele, then
the other at the heart: so that though the other youth bare
the charges, and was sir pay for all, yet this new friend was
he that was maister of my affections: which kindnesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
vs, was so vnwisely cloked, that in short time it was
manifest to all our familiars, which made my supposed hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
to sigh, and others to smile: but he that was hit with
the horne, was pincht at the heart; yet so extreame was the
affection he bare to me, that he had rather conceale his griefe,
then any way make me discontent, so that he smotherd his
sorrow with patience, and brookt the iniurie with silence, til
our loues grew so broad before, that it was a wonder to the
world: whereupon one day at dinner, I being very pleasant
with his chosen friend, and my choyce louer, I know not
how, but either by fortune, or it may bee, some set match,
there was by a Gentleman there present, a question <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
in about womens passions, and their mutability in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
so that the controuersie was defended, <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi>
with arguments, whether a woman might home a second
friend or no, at last it was concluded, that Loue and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
brookes no fellowship, and therefore none so ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to beare ariuall. Hereupon arose a questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about friends
that were put in trust, how it was a high point of treason
for one to betray another, especially in loue, insomuch that
<pb facs="tcp:14258:17"/>
one Gentleman at the boord, protested by a solemne oath,
that if any friend of his, made priuy and fauoured with the
sight of his Mistresse whom hee loued, whether it were his
wife, or no, should secretly séeke to incroach into his roome,
and offer him that dishonor to partake his loue, hee would
not vse any other reuenge, but at the next gréeting stab him
with his poynado, though he were condemned to death for
the action. All this fitted for the humor of my supposed hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and strooke both me and my friend into a quandarie:
but I scornfully iested at it, when as my husband, taking
the ball before it came to the ground, began to make a long
discourse what faithlesse friends they were that would faile
in loue, especially where a resolued trust of the party belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
was committed vnto them: and hereupon, to make the
matter more credulous, and to quip my folly, and to taunt
the basenesse of his friends minde, that so hee might with
courtesie both warne vs of our wantonnesse, and reclaime
vs from ill, he promised to tell a pleasant story, performed as

hee courted with many swéet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

charmes that are able to inchaunt almost the chastest eares,
and so subtilly couched his arguments, discouered such loue

to sit in his face, and swore, that if she granted not him,
the end of a louers sighes then would present his heart as a
Tragicke sacrifice to the sight of his cruell mistresse. The
Gentlewoman waring pittiful, as women are kind-harted,
and are loth Gentlemen should die for loue, after a few excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
let him dub her husband knight of the forked order, and
so to satisfie his humor, made forset of her own honor. Thus
these two louers continued for a great space in such plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
as vnchast wantons count their felicitie, hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually

vnto her maister. He, little credulous of the light behauiour

more tenderly then his owne life: the maid replied, that she
spake not of enuy to him, but of meere loue she bare vnto
him, and the rather that hee might shadow such a fault in
time, and by some meanes preuent it, least if others should

should be cald in question. At these wise words spoken by so
base a drudge as his maid, the Gentleman waxed astonished
and listned to her discourse, wishing her to discouer how she
knew, or was so priuy to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> folly of her mistresse, or by what
meanes he might haue assured proofe of it, she told him that
to her, her owne eyes were witnesses: for she saw them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully
together, and please it you sir, quoth shee, to faine
your selfe to goe from home, and then in the backe-house to
kéepe you secret, I will let you sée as much as I haue mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
vnto you. Upon this the maister agréed, and warned
his maid not so much as to make it knowne to any of her
fellowes. Within a day or two after the Gentleman said he
would go a hunting, and so risse very early; and causing his
men to couple vp his hounds, left his wife a bed, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
as soone as hee was gone a mile from the house, hee
commanded his men to ride afore, and to start the Hare, and
follow the chase, and wee will come faire and softly after:
they obeying their maisters charge, went their waies, and
hereturned by a backe way to his house, and went secretly
to the place where his maid and hee had appointed. In the
meane time the mistresse thinking her husband safe with his
hounds, sent for her friend to her bed-chamber, by a trusty
seruant of hers, in whom shee assured that was a secret pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in such affaires, and the Gentleman was not slacke to
come, but making all the haste he could, came and went into
the chamber, asking for the maister of the house very fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly:
the old maid noting all this, as soone as shee knew
them together, went and cald her maister, and carried him
vp by a secret paire of staires to her mistresse chamber doore;
where, péeping in at a place that the maid before had made
for the purpose, he saw more then he lookt for, and so much
as pincht him at the very heart, causing him to accuse his
wife for a strumpet, and his friend for a traytor: yet for all
this, valuing his owne honor more then their dishonesty,
thinking if he should make an vprore, hee should but aime

done her iniury, he would reuenge it, were it with hazard of
his life: shee then told him, scarce beeing able to speake for
wéeping, that shee had a sute to moue him in, which if hee
granted vnto her, she would hold him in loue and affection
without change, next her husband for euer: hee promised to

my sute is to you, that from henceforth you shall neuer so

my sute, &amp; hereunto I haue sworne you, which oath if you
obserue as a faithfull gentleman, I will conceale from my
husband what is past, and rest in honest sort your faithfull
friend for euer, at this she burst a fresh into teares, &amp; vttered
such sighes, that he thought for very griefe her heart would
haue claue asunder. The gentleman astonied at this strange
Metamorphosis of his mistresse, sate a good while in a maze,
and at last taking her by the hand, made this reply: So God

ended, and for that time they parted. At noone the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
came home, &amp; chéerfully saluted his wife, &amp; asked if din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
were ready, &amp; sent for his friend, vsing him wonderfully

they past away the day together: At night when his wife
and he went to bed, she told him all, what had past betweene
her &amp; his friend, &amp; how she had bound him with an oath, and
that he voluntarily of himselfe swore as much, being hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sorry that he had so déeply offended so kinde a friend. The
Gentleman commended her wit, &amp; found her afterward a

him any occasion of mistrust. Thus the wise Gentleman
reclaimed with silence a wanton wife, and retained an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
