            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Greene and luſtie Age.</note> freſh, luſtie and floriſhing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged men, not much tainted, nipped, or bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with yeeres.

            <p>The ſecond is of ſuch, as for weakenes and want of ſtrength are growne to bee nummiſh in their limmes and vnweldie for any bodily trauaile:<note place="margin">Graue, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent and honorable Age.</note> which after ſome eaſie exerciſe, or now and then bayning, doe orderly feede: and after ſuch repaſt or meate doe quietly betake themſelues to ſleepe and reſt: and theſe ſorte of fatherly grayheaded men bee in Greeke tearmed <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Olde mens bodies by nature are colde and drye. For,<note place="margin">Old men, colde and drye.</note> the radicall humour and ſubſtantificall moyſture beeing in tract of time by litle and litle waſted, which (like Dewe) is diſtributed, and interſperſed in and among all the ſimilare and principall partes of the bodie; together with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heate likewiſe by litle and litle wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and drooping away: the whole bodie cannot chooſe but decay withall &amp; growe toward final diſſolution. So that now al the inſtrumental parts of the bodie being become too dry, the whole members muſt needes weakely, feebly, diſorderly, ill and out of frame or courſe performe and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their appoynted actions and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie offices. Wherefore the bodie now firſt lacking his naturall ſtrength and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, beginneth to quaile and faile in
<pb facs="tcp:10683:9"/>
his neceſſarie &amp; conuenient nouriſhment, and becommeth thereby ſlenderer, thinner and dryer then it was, or the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhould bee: and therevpon the ſtrength, powers, and faculties thereof are enfeebled, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient motions or exerciſes apparantly diſabled. But, when yet further and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtore of dryneſſe enſueth and groweth vpon it, like as Trees and Plants wither away with rottennes and want of ſappe, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo doth the body drowping with Age, finally waſt, decay and conſume: yet not in all perſons alike, but ſooner or later in ſome then in other ſome, according to the conſtitution, temperature, qualitie and complexion of their bodies: and alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vnruly, vnſeaſonable, and il dyet vſed, and things (of themſelues good and wholeſome) vntemperatly frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For, wee doe not all conſiſt, neither are wee all alike made from our birth in one equall and like meaſure of elemental qualities, and therfore neither doe we vſe one onely vniforme Dyet at al times and in all reſpects.

            <p>Wherfore, by the number of yeeres to make any certain diſtinction or difference of Ages, it is very hard, yea, vnpoſſible to doe it. For, it is often ſeene, that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the natural diſtemperaunce of ſome one principal member, or moe: or for that,<note place="margin">Why ſome growe old, ſooner then ſome.</note> from the very birth, the ſame bee not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably mixed &amp; ſorted, ſome doe liue all their life time ſicklie and diſeaſed, and ſo arriuing to vntimely olde age, doe py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly languiſh and dye. Some againe, hauing ſound Bodies, and of as excellent good conſtitution as might bee, through vntemperate dyet and ryetous life haue haſtened Old age, &amp; brought themſelues to graye heades before their time: who, if they had followed the good aduiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete counſell of the learned Phiſition, might haue continued themſelues in a more proſperous and longer health, till

            <p>For <hi>Aetius</hi> wordes (which he borowed out of <hi>Galens</hi> diſcourſe of <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Phiſition beeing nowe foure ſcore yeeres old) are theſe: Their meate muſt be as it were a litle pittance at once, but they muſt haue it thriſe in a day.<note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 13.</note> Let them haue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore about nine of the clocke ſome newe bread well moulded and made, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately baked with ſome excellent good clarified, ſkummed, and deſpumed Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

<pb facs="tcp:10683:14"/>
When they ſuppe at night, let them eate no Fiſh, but chooſe meates of the beſt nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and ſuch as will not eaſily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and putrifie: as namely a Chicken, or a Bird boyled in a ſingle broth.</p>
            <p>This ſentence, opinion and preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Aetius</hi> is confirmed alſo by <hi>Auicen,</hi> and after his blunt and barbarous maner, auouched and ſet downe in theſe wordee: The nouriſhment of Oldmen muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them by litle and litle,<note place="margin">3.

For by Sleepe in the night is digeſtion and concoction beſt performed: which in the day time vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any light occaſion, through affection of the mind and vnſeaſonable exerciſes, are many tymes hindred and vnorderly done; as by <hi>Galene</hi> in his ſeauenth Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of curing the drie diſtemperance of the Ventricle is notably declared.</p>
            <p>But in preſcribing of any Diet what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, aſwel for the whole, as for the ſick, wee muſt euer haue a regard (as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> counſelleth) to Cuſtome:<note place="margin">1.
