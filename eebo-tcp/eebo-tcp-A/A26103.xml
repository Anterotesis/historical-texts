            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But oh; <hi>Quantum mutantur Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora, quantum nos,</hi> So rare a gift have the illuminated fancies of this all-knowing age, That old women without Spectacles can diſcover Popiſh plots, young men and prentizes aſſume to regulate the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in <hi>Jreland,</hi> Sea-men and Marriners Reforme the Houſe of Peers, Poore men, Porters, and Labourers ſpy out a malignant party, and diſcipline them; The countrey clouted-ſhoe renew the decayed trade of the Citie.

Quis pudor quod non praeſtet fides quod praeſtitit infidelitas.</hi> Oh! what a ſhame is it that an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Seperatiſt ſhall covertly draw Subſcribers out of blind zeale to looſe papers, and thoſe to be annext to ſome <hi>Embryon</hi> yet unhatcht, and delivered in the name of a County, with confidence, when a Knight of a ſhire ſhall perhaps ſmother the true child, and dares not owne it.

The Iudges being honourable, and impartially receiving the arguments on both ſides, I preſume none will diſcover a diſtruſt of a faire acceptance, or betray a Truſt (out of a perſonall reſpect) by detayning ſuch Petitions, as the Counties have committed into their hands. If all ſuch as are already ſigned ſee the light, I am ſure this volume will be a large one, and the Number, and quality of the Defendants, as much over-ſway the Opponents; as their arguments drawne from the Lawes of God and man, will out-weigh the Motives of thoſe, who only will, becauſe they will. As if it were cauſe enough to overthrow eſtabliſhed Lawes, that they have deſired it, though they ſhew no reaſon for it: But if all other Counties, all true Proteſtants with like liberty expreſſe their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the diſtractions of the Church will be quickly ſetled; To that good worke I have lent my hand, by lending thee and the world this light. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

            <p>Yet when wee conſider, that Biſhops were inſtituted in the time of the Apoſtles; That they were the great lights of the Church in all the firſt generall Counſels; That ſo many of them ſowed the ſeeds of Religion in their bloods, and reſcued Chriſtianity from utter extirpation in the Primitive Heathen perſecutions; That to them wee owe the redemption of the purity of the Goſpell wee now profeſſe from <hi>Romiſh</hi> corruption; That many of them for the propagation of the truth, became ſuch glorious Martyrs; That divers of them (lately and) yet living with us, have beene ſo great aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of our Religion againſt its common enemy of <hi>Rome</hi>; And that their Government hath beene ſo long approved, ſo oft eſtabliſhed by the Common and Statute-lawes of this Kingdome; And as yet nothing in their Doctrine (generally taught) diſſonant from the Word of God, or the Articles ratified by Law.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59547:8"/>
and ſubverſion of that Order and Forme of <hi>Divine Service</hi> which hath happily continued amongſt us ever ſince the Reformation of Religion: Out of a tender and zealous regard hereunto, wee have thought it our duty, not onely to diſavow all ſuch Petitions, but alſo to manifeſt our publike affections, and deſires to continue the Forme of <hi>Divine Service,</hi> and <hi>Common-prayers,</hi> and the preſent Government of the Church, as the ſame have beene continued ſince the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and ſtand ſo eſtabliſhed by the Lawes and Statutes of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>For when wee conſider that the Forme of <hi>Divine Service</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and contained in the Booke of <hi>Common prayer,</hi> was with great care, piety, and ſincerity, reviſed and reduced from all former cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtitions, by thoſe holy and ſelected Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Reformation of Religion within this Church, and was by them reſtored to its firſt purity, according as it was inſtituted and practiſed in the Primitive times, ſtandeth confirmed, eſtabliſhed, and enjoyned by Act of Parliament, and Royall Injunctions, and hath ever ſince had the generall approbation of the godly, and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like uſe and continuance within this Church. And that Biſhops were inſtituted, and have had their being and continuance ever ſince the firſt planting of Chriſtian Religion amongſt us, and the reſt of the Chriſtian World, that they were the lights and glorious Lamps of Gods Church, that ſo many of them ſowed the ſeeds of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in their blouds, which they willingly powred out therefore, that by them Chriſtianity was reſcued and preſerved from utter extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in the fierce and moſt cruell Perſecutions of Pagan Emperous, that to them wee owe the redemption of the purity of the Goſpell, and the Reformation of the Religion wee now profeſſe, from <hi>Romiſh</hi> corruption, that many of them for the propagation of that Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came glorious Martyrs, leaving unto us an holy example, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable remembrance of their faith and Chriſtian fortitude, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them lately, and yet living with us, have beene ſo great Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and Champions of our Religion againſt the Common enemy of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that their Government hath beene ſo ancient, ſo long approved, and ſo often eſtabliſhed by the Lawes and Statutes of this Kingdome, and as yet nothing in their Doctrine (generally taught) diſſonant from the Word of God, or the Articles eſtabliſhed by Law, and that moſt of them are of ſingular learning and piety. In this caſe to call the forme of <hi>Divine Service</hi> and <hi>Common-prayers,</hi> Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, Popiſh, Superſtitious, Idolatrous, and Blaſphemous, and to call

               <p n="1">1 WEe conſider that Chriſt, either left his Church without a laſting Government, or elſe Biſhops and Presbyters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them are that Government; the former wee feare to ſay, leſt wee might ſeeme to accuſe the Wiſdome of the Father, of Improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in the not providing for his Family; the Feeder and the Ruler in Scripture being all one in Office, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Biſhops and Presbyters reſpectively doe ſucceed; and alſo many actually did ſucceed the Apoſtles in their <hi>Chaires,</hi> being ordained Biſhops by the Apoſtles themſelves that did ſurvive, and alſo beyond all exception that Chriſt did inſtitute a Government; appeares in thoſe Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall words, (who then is that <hi>Faithfull and wiſe Steward whom his Lord ſhal make Ruler over his houſhold, &amp;c.)</hi> which Rulers are Biſhops, and Prieſts under them, or elſe the Church hath beene Apoſtate from

her Lord, ſhee having clearely for fifteene hundred yeares had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rulers then ſuch.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wee conſider that, whether it can be a Church or no without Biſhops, is at leaſt a queſtion of great conſideration, and the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is maintained by Apoſtolicall, and Primitive men and Martyrs, and by the greateſt part of Chriſtendome; and thoſe few (in reſpect of the whole, that diſſent being moſt certainely, not infallible, to bee ſure with Epiſcopacy, it may be a Church <hi>eatenus,</hi> therefore it is the ſureſt courſe to retaine it, for feare we ſeparate from the Church, the Pillar and ground of Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3 No Ordination never was without a Biſhop, and if any Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did impoſe hands, unleſſe in conjunction with a Biſhop, hee was accounted an Uſurper, and anathematized by publike and unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned authority; and ſo without Biſhops, no Presbyter, then no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, no conſecration of the Sacraments of the Lords Supper, and for theſe wants no man can make a recompence or ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="4">4 No Presbyter did ever impoſe hands on a Biſhop,<note place="margin">Viz. <hi>De jure, non eidem de facto,</hi> till 555 years after Chriſt, and then but once in the caſe of Pope <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius,</hi> and that irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly &amp; never ſince unleſſe by Papall u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation.</note> which if ſo famous a reſolve, or publike voice of Chriſtendome may have an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, ſhewes their diſparity, and that a Biſhop hath a Character, which cannot be imprinted without at leaſt, an equall hand.</p>
               <p n="5">5 VVithout Biſhops no Confirmation of Children, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation (called in Scripture Impoſition of hands) Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his famous Catechiſme accounts a Fundamentall point, and the Church hath alwayes uſed it, and it was appropriate to Biſhops, by the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable cuſtome of Chriſtendome, and by the example of the Apoſtles, in the caſe of the <hi>Samaritane</hi> Chriſtians, whom <hi>Phillip</hi> the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt had converted, and is charged upon the Parents of Children, that they bring their children to Biſhops to be confirmed, and it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver otherwiſe, but juſt as in the caſe of Ordination, <hi>(videlicet)</hi> by ſingularity and uſurpation, till of late that the Ieſuits to enlarge their <hi>Philacteries,</hi> have ſtriven to make Biſhops not neceſſary, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating Confirmation to the Prieſts of their Order.</p>
               <p n="6">6 To take away Biſhops, is againſt the Wiſdome of the State of <hi>England,</hi> ever ſince the Reformation, and having beene attempted by clancular practiſes, was checked by the Princes reſpectively, and their Councell, and confidently, by the wiſdome of preceeding Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and this although the Biſhops then were leſſe learned, and as much infamed.</p>
               <p n="7">7 We are ſure that Epiſcopall Government hath conſiſted with Monarchy, ever ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy was Chriſtian, &amp; we are to try whether any innovated Government can or will.</p>

               <p n="9">9 Wee conſider that Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> (pretented as the maine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticke enemy againſt Epiſcopacy) yet ſayes,<note place="margin">Comment in Epiſt. ad Titum.</note> That Biſhops were conſtituted as an antidote and deletory to diſ-improve the iſſues of Schiſme, and that by the Apoſtles, who beſt knew the remedies. And now that Schiſmes multiply, there is more need of Biſhops, ſo that they cannot be taken away, upon pretence their Regiment is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for the taking them away makes them more neceſſary by the multiplication of Schiſmes.</p>
               <p n="10">10 All Learning will be diſcountenanced, if not extinguiſhed, upon the demolition of Epiſcopacy, the Biſhops being parties for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Learning; and on the other ſide, if the Government ſhould be in the hands of Presbitery, or lay Elders, we know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſufficient to ſtifle our feares, leſt preferment be given to people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and unfit to have the mannaging of Soules, eſpecially, ſince a learned <hi>Clergy</hi> will be ſuſpected by their Lay-Elders, as too knowing to be ruled by their Dictates, which will not have ſo much artifice and fineneſſe, as to command by ſtrength of reaſon: which our feares are alſo increaſed, by conſidering that by the multiplication of Lay-Elders, or other Governours, their perſonall intereſt being increaſed partiality muſt be more frequent, and all this is beſides their incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of judging the abilities of Schollers.</p>
               <p n="11">11 The remove all of Biſhops would be a ſcandall, not onely to many weake Chriſtians, who feare all Innovation, as guilty of ſome ill intendments upon their conſciences, but alſo to the ſtrongeſt, which ſhewes it to be the fault of the giver, not the weakneſſe of the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and if we muſt not ſcandalize our weake brethren, much leſſe our ſtrong; ſince this will intrench upon us in a high meaſure, they not being apt to be ſcandalized upon umbrages, and impertinencies.</p>

            <p>And we are the more incouraged in this ſuit, becauſe wee find it to be the unanimous and undevided requeſt and vote of this whole Country, who cannot without ſome trembling entertaine a thought of change.

            <p n="3">3 We pray likewiſe that in every Pariſh unprovided, there may bee a Preaching Miniſter, and a competent maintenance raiſed for him, and where Impropriations are, and Preaching Miniſters not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently cared for, allowance may be had or bettered.</p>
            <p n="4">4 We pray likewiſe that ſuch of our Clergy, as upon enquiry, ſhall be found either Scandalous or not Orthodox, may bee admoniſhed, and bound for the better ſupply and diſcharge of their Cures, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Wee pray likewiſe that ſome poſitive Law may bee Inacted for Parſons and Vicars recovery of their Tithes, and that ſuch courſe may bee taken for the obtaining of them, as may bee moſt ſpeedy, and leaſt chargeable; <hi>That ſo thoſe that Miniſter at the Altar, may live by the Altar.</hi>

            <p n="7">7 As likewiſe that there may be ſome Coerſive power or Law, ordained for compelling of refactory men to the payment of their rates, and for the reparations of their Pariſh Churches, in which of late ſome are growne very remiſſe and backward.</p>

            <p n="9">9 Wee likewiſe pray that ſome ſpeedy courſe may bee taken for the Redemption of thoſe wofull Chriſtian Captives in <hi>Barbarie,</hi> the want of whom, hath occaſioned an extraordinary decay and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in our Maritine Townes and Pariſhes, and that our Coaſts may bee ſufficiently gaurded and ſecured.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Wee likewiſe pray that whereas this County hath beene and is ſurcharged double, at leaſt, with Armes, and very high in Subſidies, much above our abilities, and the reſpective charge of diverſe parts of this Kingdome; we may (in conſideration hereof) bee relieved in future.</p>

            <p n="12">12 Wee likewiſe pray that ſuch Dutchcy Tenants as within our County pay over their rightfull Rents and Duties unto the Dutchy Officers may not bee doubly charged by Proces out of the Exchequer, as now they are, by extreame and continuall Amercements.</p>
            <p n="13">13 Wee likewiſe pray that there may bee a reparation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of the Caſtle of Saint <hi>Mawes,</hi> and that there may bee a ſupply of the wants of Ordnances, Carriages, Powder, and Ammunition, in all which, it is extreamely defective.</p>
