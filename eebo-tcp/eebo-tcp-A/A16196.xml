            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was my good hap to be at the manſion place of my moſt honorable fauorer the right Ho. Sir <hi>Frances Knolles</hi> knight, called <hi>Greyes Court</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Oxenford</hi> in Summer laſt, where the right excellent and moſt noble Lorde, <hi>Robert Deuorax</hi> Earle of Eſſex, his grandſon beeing expected that day, it pleaſed his Honor to paſſe the time, or rather as it might be iudged, to ſtirre vp by his example the couragious minded knights and Gentlemen his ſonnes, naturally apt inough of themſelues to patrizate, imitate, or rather to excéede in all ſuch magnanimous exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, there to contend with the right worſhipfull and valorous Gentleman, Sir <hi>William Knolles</hi> knight, his ſonne &amp; heire, in ſhooting with a ſmall péece of ordinance at a marke, which péece was there ready on her carriage, appointed at that time together with another great péece, not long before the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh kings, called a Saker, which the ſayde ſir <hi>William</hi> to his high deſerued commendations, then lately had brought home
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:2809:6"/>
from the winning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Groyne in Spaine, &amp; many other ſmal ſhot there alſo ſet readie on the leads of the houſe, with trains of gun pouder to be ſhot off, to welcome the ſaid noble Earle: ſending forth amidde the regions of the aire the excéeding ioy that was there taken of the ſafe and happie arriuall of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, from the then late deſperate voiage performed into Portingale.</p>
               <p>At this time after his H. and his ſayd ſonne and heyre had each of them ſhot, I being at hand, was demanded a queſtion or two of getting the diſtance of the marke wherto they ſhot. And the ſayde Sir <hi>William Knolles</hi> was alſo verie deſirous and inquiſitiue of me, in what time himſelfe might learne ſkill ſufficient for that purpoſe. Of which ſo iuſt and wiſhed occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I was right glad, and the rather when I conſidered with my ſelfe, how theſe dangerous times threaten to ſet our great ordinance mightily on worke, and how needfull &amp; appertinent it is to the ſhooting in them certaynly and ſpeedily, to get the diſtance of the marke they ſhoote at, as well for annoying of the enemie, as ſparing of ſhootes ſpent in waſt. So that I was in manner aſſured, that no Treatiſe was like to be more acceptable vnto his H. (next vnto bookes of ſincere religion) then ſuch as ſhould tend towards the defence and ſafe keeping of this his natiue Countrie. Wherein it is wel knowen, euen to any that leaſt know him, how forward his H. hath alwais bin and continueth euerie waie whatſoeuer. That olde age and graie hayres cannot yet daunt or holde him backe from the face of that enemie that ſhould inuade the ſame, or offer violence or hurt to the perſon of our moſt gracious ſoueraign Ladie and Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whome God graunt long to raigne ouer vs to his glorie. Conſidering alſo what no ſmall want of ſome one perfect meane, Generall for all theſe actions yet remained after ſo great a number of both Latine &amp; Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh authors, writing of ſo ſundrie waies to attaine Altitudes, Longitudes, Latitudes, Diſtances and Profundities, ſome by the Quadrate, ſome by the Trigo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſome by the Croſſe Staffe, ſome by the Cyrſte, ſome by the Quadrante, ſome by the bare

And amongſt them all, no one inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſufficiently apt for all purpoſes, neither yet to doe any of theſe feates in all pointes, or almoſt in anie point of himſelfe, without the continuall &amp; readie vſe of the fiue partes of Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metike. Which in the vnlearned Gunner is not alwayes to be had: nor hauing it, eaſie for him to performe, eſpeciallie in ſuch buſie times, when the buzzing of dangerous buſineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the multitude, ſhall bring the beſt learned and ſkilfull man out of his numbers: beſides the number of preceptes ſo toile ſome, the manifolde abſurdities admitted, ſo loathſome. Upon al theſe iuſt occaſions I was in maner forcibly drawen at this time to bend the fabrication and vſe of this ſo noble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument wholie vpon theſe cauſes, which I had for three or foure yeeres before determined to haue publiſhed in a more ample ſorte, almoſt as generall for a number of matters of Geometrie, as my Iewel is for matters of Attronomie, Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mographie and Nauigation, which I yet meane to doe, but that I dare make no more promiſes in print, vntill I haue fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the ſecond part of my Iewell, ſo often ſince required at at my hand, being fiue yeres paſt: which yet this buſie world ſuffereth me not to bring forth, although I contend to looſe no manner of time.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Croſſe ſtaffe called by <hi>Gemma Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Baculus Geometricus,</hi> and how much this Familiar ſtaffe exceedeth it and all other Inſtrumentes hitherto deuiſed to like purpoſes, both for ſufficiency and facillity.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOr that I haue bene acquainted with diuerſe willing wits deſirous of knowledge, wanting the rudiments of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, whereby they might be enabled to make choiſe of ſuch inſtruments as might be ſubiect to feweſt errors and abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, to haue bene marueilouſly in loue with the croſſe ſtaffe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2809:7"/>
and that altogether, becauſe it yeldeth his vſe with that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity, though but in matters at hand. For which cauſe, I thought good euen of zeale and good will to all ſuch willinge young practiſers, to waſte this Cap. for their good, to aſſure them how weake and to ſmall purpoſe the croſſe ſtaffe is, in reſpect to be imployed in any weighty ſeruice, ſcarce doing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing well, and that not much aboue a bowe ſhute of, whereas this my familliar ſtaffe ſhall performe them no leſſe exacte at a mile, 2. or 3. diſtante, if the marke bee ſuche that the eie may cary it ſtrongly.</p>
               <p>There haue bene from time to time beſids the croſſe ſtaffe diuerſe other inſtruments, deuiſed for theſe kindes of ſeruiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meſurations, as in the Cap. before I mentioned: of which the Geometricall quadrate was thought to be the beſt, as it ſeemeth to me by <hi>G. Friſius,</hi> who often vpbraydeth the ſame quadrate with his ſtaffe, when he had in as much as mighte be doen, reduced the croſſe ſtaffe to all yerfection, letting it then to lacke no commendations, ſaying euen at the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce to the vſe of it, <hi>lib. de radio aſtro. &amp; Geomet. cap. 5. Dimenſionibus longitudinum altit. latit. &amp; diſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum antecellit radius reliqua inſtrumenta ad ſimilem v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum excogitata facillitatem habens longe maiorem &amp; copiam.</hi> But by <hi>G. Friſius</hi> good ſauour, I ſee no cauſa why it ſhould carry any of thoſe commendations, more then for the facillity in vſe, and for this, wil aske no better iudge then him ſelfe. For in taking of an altitude, which is ſimply the beſt thing it can doe, if the ſtaffe be not directed leuell with the horrizon, then cannot the croſſe bee parallell to the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and therefore breedeth error as him ſelfe confeſſeth in the ſame 5. Cap. ſaying: <hi>Vnum a paucis notatum intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabiles inducit errores. Si quidem Radius in dimenſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus per directam lineam, &amp; quaſi ad normam tendere debet verſus lineam quam metiri ſtatuimus, ſiue ea ſit longitudinis fiue latitudinis,</hi> what can a man aske more then direct conſeſſion, yet after he ſayeth againe by way of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoidance in the ſame Cap. <hi>Neque vereri de bes paruum
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2809:7"/>
a norma deflexum qui nullum inducere poteſt errorem ſenſu perceptibilem.</hi> But by his fauour againe though a litle holding from the leuell, can breede no great error in the altitude or latitude. Yet that very ſmal error, there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted: ſhall growe to ſomewhat in the longitude or diſtaunce: being he teacheth no other way in manner, to get a diſtance but by the altit. or latit. of ſome thing at thextreame of the diſtance firſt obtayned, multiplyed into the length. Which in a long diſtance will multiply that inſenſible error to become intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as he termeth it. But what ſhould we talke of longe diſtances, when as he maketh a prouiſo, we ſhall deale with none by theſe wordes in his 5. Cap. or the like in effect. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hili eſſe quantum diſtes a re menſuranda, verum opus eſt diſtantia non admodum longa.</hi> And then were wee as good to be without his ſtaffe in my opinion, as to entertaine him on ſuch ſtreight conditions. But now to remedy thoſe errors in altitudes, he ſayeth in one place you may ſette the ſtaffe leuell by a thredd and plummet aplied to the croſſe. <hi>In erectis quidem appenſo perpendiculo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Yet in another place he thinketh that, too comberſome, ſaying thus. <hi>Qua in re, ſufficit rudius oculi indicium ac examen.</hi> As for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes tranſuerſe: remedy he coulde finde none, ſaying: <hi>In tranſuerſis vero, viſui credere oportet.</hi> Yet for all theſe things he could not holde but conclude towards the ende of his firſt practiſes. Cap. 2. <hi>Itaque nulla in parte ſuperatur aſcala Geomet. verum multis modis ſuperat, quin ipſe radius, ſcala quo que quaedam eſt geometrica, tanto prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantior quanto maiorem prebet vſum,</hi> he ſhould haue ſaid <hi>facil orem vſum</hi> and then he had ſayd ſomewhat, for taking away his facillity, you take away his chiefe goodnes. The quadrate, the plaine ſtationes which ſtickes, the bare rule or ſquire, being wel handled, will do much more, as wel in great as ſmall diſtances, onely they want the like facillitie in vſe. Yea and <hi>G. Friſus</hi> him ſelfe for all his great boſtes before let fall was driuen ere he ended his booke to ſeeke another waye for his matters in maner quadrate wiſe, by hanging his croſſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2809:8"/>
Staffe, as it were by the haire of the head, with his armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, and then is his ſo well boaſted facillitye quite gone: Beſides that, the longeſt parte of your goodly inſtrumente is brought then to halfe the length of the croſſe, and a ſmall length of the ſtaffe, which in a ſtaffe of 5. foote length will bée but 15. inches, and in a ſtaffe of 9. or 10. foote, which no mans height can poſſibly reach to vſe in that manner without a lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the longeſt part will be little aboue 2. foote, and of that length though the facillity remained, a man might as eaſelye wilde a quadrate. And now conſidering that halfe the croſſe and 3. quarters of the ſtaffes length, is by this meanes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and to no vſe, who would carry all that wood about with him, except the weather were cold. Therefore to conclude, let no man be led away with the facillity of the Croſſe ſtaffe, or of any inſtrument, rather let him thinke no pains too great that produceth an exacte truth. And where as <hi>G. Friſius</hi> ſayeth, that his ſtaffe is <hi>quaeda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſcala geometrica,</hi> I ſay that my Staffe is not <hi>quaedam,</hi> but <hi>ſumma ſcala geometrica,</hi> that be is <hi>nobiliſſimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trigonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> geometricu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> For what may be doen by Triangles in Geometry, whole volumes do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and my ſelfe in another treatiſe of this ſtaffe at ſome other time will partely manifeſt. And I ſay that he ſhalbe <hi>quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam quadratum Geometricum</hi> and <hi>quidam radius Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricus,</hi> and performe the vſe of his <hi>Radius</hi> more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally then it performeth the quadrates vſe. What ſhould I ſay, it is <hi>Baculum Catholicon ſiue generaliſſimum,</hi> and ſhal recompence the tractable facillity of the croſſe ſtaffe, with his familiar palpaple vſe, as well in his performance of theſe menſurations, as his daily vſage for an ordinary and familiar walking ſtaffe.

                  <p>Of the framing and faſhioning of this noble inſtrument, called the Familiar ſtaffe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>THis</hi> ſtaffe conſiſteth of two ſeuerall partes, or rather two ſeuerall ſtaues, the one I call the ſtanderd ſtaffe, the other the running ſtaffe. Both in manner like, very plaine to conceaue: being each but as it were, two ſtreight rulers ioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, to open and ſhutte euen like an ordinary paire of compaſſes.</p>
               <p>The ſtanderd ſtaffe is here repreſented by this figure <hi>A B C,</hi> hauing his two legges or limmes <hi>A B</hi> and <hi>A C,</hi> ioyncted at <hi>A,</hi> each legge conſiſting of 3. rules, or narrow boordes 5. foot in length, of breadth and thicknes conuenient to carry it ſelfe ſtreight, of ſome ſuch wood as wil beſte keepe from warping, glewed and wrought together, ſo that both legs <hi>A B</hi> and <hi>A C</hi> being ſhutte cloſe: ther may be within it a concanity of one ynch and an halfe ſquare quite through to containe the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtaffe for eaſy carriage. After this: for eaſier handling in vſe, let this ſtanderd ſtaffe be brought into an 8. ſquare. And either lette the round or pomell of the ioincte <hi>A</hi> be of 4. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches diametre at the leaſte, hauing a ſcrewed pinne of yron throughe the centre with a ſcrewed boxe on the vnder
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2809:9"/>
                  <figure/> ſide to faſten or locke faſt the ſtaffe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open at anie angle or width: or els let ther be a third rule or graduator, like vnto that of the running ſtaffe, which is far more ſure if you may conuey him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the roome, and ſo may the ioynte <hi>A.</hi> be as ſlender as you will. Within the hollowneſſe of this legge are two channelles made in the vpper and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ſides parrallell, to their fiduciall or centre lines: by or in which, two boltes or péeces of woode, vz. M. &amp; N, do ſlippe to &amp; fro carrying either two ſight pinnes halfe rounde, theyr plaine ſides running cloſe to the ſtaffe, euen with the fiduciall or centre lines, hauing each a pretie button or pearle on the top, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to direct the eie to anie marke: or els two halfe round deepe holes or ſockets, into which two like ſight pins or anie other kinde of ſightes may be put at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie time when you ſhall vſe them: other two like ſight pinnes, you muſt haue fixed néere vnto the centre, their flatte halfe rounde ſides euen alſo with the fiducial lines, on each
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2809:9"/>
leg one. Thoſe two bolts or péeces carrying the two running ſight pins muſt haue each of them a ſpring of mettall, to cauſe them runne the more pleaſant, &amp; alſo a ſcrewpin at all times to faſten them at anie part of the ſtandardeslegge. So much for the ſtandard ſtaffe.</p>
               <p>The running ſtaffe repreſented in this figure by <hi>E. D. F.</hi> is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verie like to the ſtandard, being alſo but the like two legs or limmes <hi>D. E.</hi> and <hi>D. F.</hi> ioynted at <hi>D.</hi> each made of thrée rules or narrowe boordes of foure foote length and better, and of breadth and thickneſſe, conuenient to fill the hollownes of the ſtandard ſtaffe, hollow as the former, not eight ſquare, but foure ſquare. Herein it differeth, that at the point <hi>G.</hi> of the ſide <hi>D. E.</hi> twentie inches from <hi>D.</hi> the parte <hi>G. F.</hi> ſhall bee to take off and on with helpe of a ſquare ſocket or ſome ſcrewe, made in the end <hi>G.</hi> of the parte <hi>T. G.</hi> to be taken off, when it is to be vſed as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners quadrant, or to be ſet on at <hi>E.</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the ſide <hi>D. E.</hi> as occaſion ſhal ſerue. Alſo at the point <hi>G.</hi> there muſt be ioynted another light foure ſquare hollowe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, viz. <hi>G. H.</hi> equall in length to <hi>G. F.</hi> which (the inſtrument ſhut together) muſt fall into the channels of <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>E. I.</hi> This ſquare ruler <hi>G. H.</hi> I call the Graduator, becauſe hee yeeldeth degrees. The centre of this graduators ioynt <hi>G.</hi> ſhall be euen with the middeſt of the breadth, and his length ſhal be ſuch, that taking <hi>D. I.</hi> in the ſide <hi>D. E.</hi> iuſt equall to <hi>D. G.</hi> and the running Staffe opened exactly to a ſquare angle, as here you ſee, that the extreame of the graduator, viz. <hi>H.</hi> which I will hence forth cal his Apex, may but iuſtly touch the point I. making there a right angled <hi>Aequicrurall</hi> triangle. And let the graduator haue at his Apex <hi>H.</hi> ſome deuiſe with a ſocket or payre of chéekes, or elſe annexed to ſome ſuch running bolt, as before in the ſtandard carrieth the ſightes, and a ſcrew pin to faſten him in anie parte of the ſide.</p>
               <p>There muſt be in thecentre <hi>D.</hi> a pinne turning round, hauing either an halfe round hole, quite thorough, to fit vpon the ſight pins which the running bolts of the ſtandard do car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or elſe an halfe round pin ſtanding out to fit into the halfe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2809:10"/>
round holes or ſockets of thoſe boltes. You muſt haue alſo for each ſide of this running Staffe, one running ſight or wing (as they call it) like vnto thoſe of the Croſſe Staffe, as in this figure you may ſée, &amp; alſo two fixed ſight pins for eache end of
<figure>
                     <head>A Supporter.</head>
                  </figure>
each ſide one parallel to the fiducial lines, which for diſtinction ſake, I will call ſight pegs: and muſt be ſo planted, that they may riſe and fall into the ſides, ſuffering the wings to ſlip ouer them when occaſion ſerueth. And if the ſtandard it ſelfe had on each legge the like paire of ſight pegs, it were not amiſſe.</p>
               <p>Your inſtrument thus prepared neatly in all pointes, as a workman can better of himſelfe tell how, then if I ſhoulde write much more. You ſhal diuide each legge of either of theſe ſtaues into as many inches as they will containe, beginning from the centres <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> and euerie inch, into eight partes, which partes ſhall ſignifie feete, paces, perches, pike lengths, or anie other kinde of meaſure that you ſhall vſe: ſo ſhall the fiue ſoote length of the legs <hi>A. B.</hi> and <hi>B. C.</hi> of the ſtandarde, containe each 480. equall partes, and the ſides <hi>D. E.</hi> and <hi>D. F.</hi> of the running Staffe as many like partes as it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, all which to be ſubdiuided againe, each into foure equall partes, and ſet numbers vnto them, encreaſing by tens, each ſorte of diuiſion drawen to his ſeuerall ſpace limbe-like, as v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually workemen can doe full well. Thus is your inſtrument
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2809:10"/>
fully finiſhed, ſauing for his degrees, which in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I will ſhew.</p>

I thought good to preſent you with this inſtance out of <hi>Tartaglia,</hi> which in the next Chapter I meane alſo to applie to my Staffe. He giueth but a glance in his firſt booke, 1. <hi>Colloquie,</hi> that anie one peece being mounted from point to point, and minute to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of the gunners quadrate, and the randomes or diſtances in paces of that peece taken at euerie ſeuerall mounting, and noted in a table (being carefully dealt in) would ſerue to know the randoms of any other péece likewiſe eleuated from point to point: if you do but know anie one ſhoot at anie one point eleuated of that other peece. For looke what proportion the ſhoot of any point of the firſt, beareth vnto any other point of the ſame peece.

               <p>IT hapneth often that it is thought more conuenient to win <note place="margin">Of altit</note> a towne or fort by ſcaling with ladders and ſuch like, then to batter it with ordinaunce. In ſuch a caſe where the walles may be come to, without daunger, it is ſo eaſie and common to get the height by any inſtrument, that I could ſcarſe ſpare it a roome, but that it may ſerue as a ground, or firſt introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the reſt. This my familliar ſtaffe as in the 2. chap. I ſaide, may be vſed in moſt caſes, eyther as himſelfe, or as the quadrante or circle, or as the quadrate, or as the croſſe ſtaffe, or as the gunners quadrant: and in this caſe indifferent to them all. For if you take your running ſtaffe ſet at his ſquare
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2809:15"/>
angle, and apply the leuell ſide to your eye, lifting vp the centre till the line and plummet out of the centre do hange iuſtly on the 45. deg. or 6. gunners poinct of the graduator, which are both in one ſtreight line, what vpright ſoeuer you ſée, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with the leuell ſide the height thereof is equall to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtannce from you. In ſo much that when at any time you ſhall by this inſtrument or any other finde the altitude of the ſunne 45. deg. if then you runne and meaſure the ſhaddow of that tower or wall, the ſame ſhall be equall to the height ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as moſt aucthors affirme, but in very déede it ſhall be leſſe then the height by ſo much as one quarter of a degrée co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to, as in the treatiſe of my new Aſtronomicall ſtaffe not yet extant ſhall appeare: in the meane time take the ſhaddow at 44 ¾ degrées high, and the ſame ſhall be your deſire.</p>
               <p>But now, if you will doe it croſſeſtaffe wiſe, then ſet the extreme of the leuell ſide of the running ſtaffe to your eye car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it ſquare to the vpright, as néere as you can, the hanging ſide vpwards and parallell to the wall, and go in or out ſo, till you may ſée the toppe of the vpright, euen with the toppe of the hanging ſide, and there ſhall you finde the diſtaunce to the <figure/> wall equall to the height thereof, as before. And if you place the wing in the middeſt of the hanging ſide, and by that ſée the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2809:15"/>
toppe from the extreme of the leuel ſide, then is the diſtance to the vpright double to the height, if at a fourth part from the centre, then is the diſtance 4. times the height, &amp;c. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in this figure the running ſtaffe ſet at his ſquare angle, and carried ſquare to the wall as you ſée: if you go in or out till you might ſee the toppe <hi>P</hi> of the tower <hi>R P</hi> euen by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames <hi>E</hi> and <hi>F</hi> there ſhall the diſtance from your ſtanding to the tower be equall to <hi>P S,</hi> then adding thereto your height viz. <hi>R S,</hi> you haue the height deſired.

               <p>But here I can no longer delay, but warne you of two things in this working, both which, <hi>G. Friſius</hi> halfe wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth at in the vſe of his Croſſe Staffe, becauſe he would haue it commended forſooth for facillity. But I haue euer deteſted that facillity that ſhould produce any abſurdity. The one is, that the hanging ſide of our inſtrument be parallel to the wal, the other, that your eye in both ſtations be ſett in one leuell, that is to ſay, no higher aboue the baſe in the one ſtation, then in the other, both which are fowle faults to be admitted, if the vpright ſhould be far of: yet are eaſely ſalued with a little paines. And I earneſtly exhort euery practiſer in theſe actions, to defy that eaſe, that ſhould ſhame him ſelfe &amp; bringe his arte in queſtion: a notable faulte amongſt moſte of our land meaſurers in theſe daies, I meane thoſe that meaſure by platt, who partly by want of skill in Geometry, partly by want of perſeuerance and knowledge in other ſciences and faculties, wherwith a perfect ſurueior ought to bee ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and furniſhed: and chiefly by want of induſtry, paines and diligence, doe bring them ſelues and a moſt excellent Science into diſdaine and obloquy, when as ſeldome two of them can produce one meaſure or like plat of one ſelf grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and that which more is, ſcarce one of them ſhal agre with him ſelfe. I meane produce at his ſecond meaſurement either the ſame platt or the ſame meaſure which he did at the firſt. But God willing when ſo euer I ſhall goe in hand to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of this inſtrument, I ſhall ſett downe moſte certaine ſalues for euery ſore in thoſe caſes. In the meane time, to retourne vnto the two errors, that might accreaue to this matter we haue in hand: they are eaſely ſalued with no pains at all in reſpect: becauſe the greatnes of the Staffe requireth an aſſiſtaunte or partner at the further end: who ſhal diſcharge you thereof. The firſt is eaſie remedied by a plum line, or rather a plum rule mentioned in the third Chapter, applied to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2809:18"/>
the hanging ſide, as in the ſecond Chapter was ſaide, which your partner may eaſely guide whiles he ſtayeth theend for you, eſpecially hauing an halberd pitched in the ground to help him reſt his hand ſteddy. The ſecond as eaſy ſalued by a ſpare halberd, or a ſtaffe pitched ſomewhat farther in towards your vpright then your ſecond ſtation ſhall be: which halberd ſhall haue a bright marke viz. <hi>Q</hi> placed on it, euen with your eie at the firſt ſtation, by which marke <hi>Q</hi> you and your partner may eaſely direct the leuel ſide of your inſtrument at both ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of one height. Note that whatſoeuer is before writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of altitudes, the ſame doth <hi>G. Friſius,</hi> Chapter ſeuenth <hi>de Rad.

You may not doubt do it as well by this Familiar Staffe, as by the Croſſe Staffe: but I will not bid you to do ſo much as a little harme, leſte you doe a litle more, and then all ſtarke naught.

caſe the vpright be far from you, whoſe height you ſeeke, then ſhall the proper and naturall working of this my Familliar Staffe ſerue your turne much better in this manner.

               <p>

                  <note place="margin">Of tal angles.</note> is the angle comprehended betweene the viſuall line directed vnto any place appointed, and the meridian line of your being. But if we call the angle made by two lines iſſuing from one place or ſtation vnto other two places, an angle of poſition (though happily more aptly to be termed an angle of ſtation) the matter is not great, being it is the angle of poſition or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the one place from the other in reſpect of your ſtation. This angle ſhall moſt caſely by this familiar ſtaffe two waies be taken, the firſt eaſie and familiar to <figure/> conceaue, the ſecond more eaſie and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to be performed.</p>
               <p>For the firſt way ſuppoſe <hi>P</hi> your place of ſtation and <hi>N</hi> and <hi>T</hi> the two places or markes whoſe angle of ſtation or poſition you ſeeke. Let your partner and you get ech of you your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter mentioned in the 3. chap. on which two ſupporters, you ſhall ſo reſt the one legge of your ſtaffe, viz. <hi>A C.</hi> (his centre iuſt ouer your ſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> marke, viz. ouer <hi>P</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you may by the ſight pinnes, or pegges of that legge ſée the one of your places, vz. <hi>N:</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:2809:21"/>
there looke that leg of your ſtaffe lye faſt on his reſt, leauing that to your partners charge by his ſteddy holding of his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter both with hand and knee. That legge ſo ſetled euen with the mark <hi>N,</hi> you ſhall gentlye open the other legge <hi>A B</hi> lifting it vp and downe withall, vntill by the two toppes of the ſight pinnes of that legge <hi>A B</hi> you may ſee the other mark <hi>T,</hi> and there with your centre ſcrew pinne, locke your ſtaffe faſt at that angle <hi>T A N:</hi> for the ſame is the angle of ſtation or poſition deſired. And if you take this angle by the running ſtaffe in this manner, then doth the graduators apex alſo ſhew you the degrees which that angle contayneth on the leuell ſide of the ſtaffe. But for your ſupporters, it is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall to make ſuch reckoning of them as to be choiſe about them: for two ſtickes pulled out of an hedge, knit together with a point towardes the one ende may ſerue for a ſhift. Or if a Captayne haue but his halberd, let him ſticke it faſt in the ground vpright, and with his garter tye the one ende of the legge of the ſtaffe thereto, he may then vſe the other at his pleaſure without helpe. Or ſometimes he may reſt him to a tree, or on the very barrell of the Cannon. In theſe caſes I would haue no man tyed to precepts, but be ready to ſupply as occaſion ſhall miniſter.</p>

Sticke your dagger or anie ſtick vpright in the ſtation marke <hi>P.</hi> in the ground, and thereon reſt the centre, viz. <hi>A.</hi> of the ſtandard or running ſtaffe. Then applie your eie vnto the extreame of his one legge, viz. to <hi>B.</hi> and let your partner apply his eie to the extreame of the other leg, viz. to <hi>C.</hi> each of you opening his leg by little and little ſo wide, till your ſelfe ſee the mark <hi>T.</hi>

               <p>Many things might be noted, which in halfe a daies prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe will be eaſier found, then though I ſhoulde write many nights.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, the greater diſtance that your two ſtations are in ſunder, except they be vnreaſonable much further then the marke: the more certaine is your working.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſharper that the angle is made betweene the legges of the Staffe, as for example, <hi>F A K</hi> in this ſecond figure or the blunter, as <hi>G A K:</hi> The greater diſtance of the ſtations is required: otherwiſe the point of Croſſing either at <hi>F</hi> or <hi>G,</hi> will hardly appeare.</p>
               <p>For theſe cauſes you muſt vſe as much diſcretion in poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your ſecond ſtation as the ground <figure/> will allow you. The beſt is, when your marke maketh an equicrurall triangle with your ſtations or neare about, as <hi>D A N</hi> and this requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth leaſt diſtance betweene your ſtations. Wherefore if you may chuſe your ground, point your ſecond ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo, that you neuer open the legges of your ſtaffe much more or leſſe then the right angle, though you make your ſtations the ſhorter: a litle leſſe is alwaies beſt, but neuer much bigger then a right angle if you can poſſible chuſe: if ſo, then make your ſtations the longer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you meane to get an exact diſtance, you had néede (yea by your beſt poſition) let the diſtance betweene your ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be no leſſe then one eight part of the diſtance to your
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2809:23"/>
marke as neare as you can imagin. Otherwiſe you ſhall hardly get the true point of croſſing, as you may perceiue at <hi>H:</hi> or at the leaſt let it be neuer leſſe then one twelſe parte: either of which are eaſie to be had in a ſmall ground, and will ſerue for a great diſtance: for fortie pearches is but a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable diſtance for two ſtations, and are to be found common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a ſmall cloſe, and yet that is the eight part of a myle of a thouſand pace, and it is the twelfth part of your common longeſt vſuall myles.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Other ſmall conceites are to be noted as if the diſtance of the ſtations in the laſt example were ſo ſmall, that in account on the legge <hi>A C</hi> of your ſtaffe it falleth out ſo neare the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, that the running ſight <hi>N</hi> might not be brought thereto: then may you ſet your ſight <hi>N</hi> at double that number, and when you haue done, take halfe the number found on the legge <hi>A B</hi> betweene <hi>A</hi> and the ſight <hi>M</hi> for youre diſtance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, or if you ſet him at thriſe or foure times, and in the end take a third part or quarter of that you finde, all commeth to one paſſe. Yea if the diſtance be very ſhort, you may reckon euery tenne but for one, and then if you r<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="6">6 One thing I had almoſt forgotten: for as in rekoning the diſtance of your ſtations on the legge <hi>A C</hi> you ſhall euer be rather led to encreaſe your ſcale, as in the fift note I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſpecially, for ſhort diſtances or longitudes, as they call them: So contrary wiſe for long diſtances, when as the mark deſired is a myle or two from you, except your ſtations bee made much the larger, you ſhall be driuen to place halfe, or a third, or a quarter of your ſtationary diſtance betwéene <hi>A</hi> and <hi>N:</hi> and then take the double, treble, or quadruple of that you finde betweene <hi>A</hi> and <hi>M,</hi> for your deſire, as in ſteade of the fortie perches betwéene <hi>P</hi> and <hi>K</hi> to haue ſet twentie or ten euen partes betwéene <hi>A</hi> and <hi>N.</hi> Yea, or if your ſtations had béene fortie ſeuen: (here becauſe fortie ſeuen is not eaſily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a quarter becauſe of the fraction) you might firſt

worke by a quarter of the euen number, that is to ſay of fortie, and then worke by the ſeuen by it ſelfe, and adde the two productes, as if by ten you found an hundreth perches, you muſt take foure hundreth for thoſe: and then working by the odde ſeuen, you ſhall get ſeuentie more to bee added to foure hundreth, ſo is your whole diſtance foure hundreth and ſeuentie.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AS I haue thought it very requiſite to ſhew the grounde platte of theſe precepts in hand, ſo it were in vaine for mée here to iterate any expoſitions or diffinitions of vſuall termes Geometricall, ſince they are now a dayes very common, and are of Euclide and diuerſe other recited, and of me in my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall Iewell 1. booke ſufficiently declared. Underſtand therefore that if in any triangle you drawe a line parallell to any one ſide, the ſame line ſhal cut of a triangle like, &amp; equian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled to the former. For example within the triangle <hi>A B C</hi> let there bee <figure/> drawen the line <hi>D E</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell to <hi>C B</hi> I ſay that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> triangle <hi>A D E</hi> is equian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled to the triangle <hi>A B C,</hi> that is to ſay, the angle
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2809:24"/>
                  <hi>E</hi> is equall to the match angle <hi>B,</hi> and the angle <hi>D</hi> to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <hi>C,</hi> and the angle <hi>A</hi> of the one, to the angle <hi>A</hi> of the other, for the angle <hi>A</hi> is common to both, &amp; alſo the triangle <hi>A D F,</hi> ſhall be like to the triangle <hi>A B C,</hi> that is to ſay, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the ſides of <hi>A D E</hi> beare one vnto another, the like proportion doe the ſides of <hi>A B C</hi> beare one to another. For Familiar proofe of the firſt, open your compaſſes at auenture, and with one ſcantlet on the centres <hi>B</hi> and <hi>E,</hi> deſcribe two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall arches cutting the ſeuerall ſides, encluding the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles <hi>B</hi> and <hi>E,</hi> as you ſee <hi>F G</hi> and <hi>H I,</hi> and thoſe two arches you ſhall finde by your compaſſe to be iuſt equall the one to the other, and therefore of neceſſity the angles <hi>F</hi> and <hi>B</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by thoſe arches are equall: in like manner may you proue the angle <hi>D</hi> to be equal vnto the angle <hi>C,</hi> and being the angle <hi>A</hi> common to both, therefore the triangles are equian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, if you deſire more artifyciall proofe, repaire to Euclide <hi>lib. 1. propoſ.</hi> 29. and <hi>lib. 6. propoſ.</hi> 5. 6. and 7.

               <p>FIrſt come as neare the wall as you can without danger, <note place="margin">Of longitu or diſtance</note> ſo that it be not ouer neare, and take your running ſtaffe ſet at his ſquare angle, and both the winges placed on the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſide.

The vpper wing ſo placed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine fixed, then let your partner and you together ſettle your ſtaffe a litle further or neare (his hanging ſide kept plumbe) till you may from the extreame of the leuell ſide, ſee the higheſt part of the wall or tower euen with the ſaid fixed wing. Marke that ſtation on the ground. Then goe backe a good quantitie, and there chuſe another ſtation, doing in the very ſame manner with the other wing, placing him alſo fixed at ſome euen ten or fiue. Then meaſure exactly the diſtance betwéene thoſe two ſtations: For looke ſo many times as the euen partes or diſtance betweene the two winges, are contained amongſt the euen partes from the centre of the ſtaffe to the vpper wing: ſo many times is the meaſurement betweene your two ſtations contained in the whole length betwéene your furtheſt ſtation and the wall.</p>

               <p>As for example, admitte that the diſtance betwéene the ſtations <hi>M</hi> and <hi>N</hi> were twentie pearches, and that at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtation <hi>N</hi> you ſet the one wing, to wit <hi>L</hi> at two hundreth perches from <hi>D</hi> the centre of the ſtaffe, and there fixed. And at <hi>M</hi> the outer ſtation, you ſet the other wing, that is to ſay <hi>H</hi> at an hundreth and fiftie partes. Your ſtations <hi>M</hi> and <hi>N</hi> ſo choſen, that at <hi>N</hi> you ſee the toppe of the towre, to wit <hi>P,</hi> by the viſuall line <hi>E L P,</hi> and at <hi>M,</hi> by the viſuall line <hi>E H P.</hi> The number of euen partes (by taking an hundreth and fiftie out of two hundreth) I finde fiftie, betweene the winges <hi>L</hi> and <hi>H.</hi> Now I conclude becauſe <hi>L H</hi> that is to ſay fiftie, is foure times contained in <hi>L D:</hi> two hundreth therefore foure times the diſtance of <hi>M N</hi> that is, foure times twentie perch is the true diſtance from <hi>M</hi> the outermoſt ſtation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the towre, to wit, the length of <hi>M R.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another way is thus, get the altitude of the towre top aboue the leuell of your eye, that is to ſay of <hi>P S</hi> by the ninth or tenth Chapter, which had, reckon the ſame on the hanging ſide of your running ſtaffe, and thereto ſet the wing fixed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit at <hi>H.</hi> Then chooſe you a ſtation as farre from the towre as you thinke good, admit at <hi>N,</hi> there direct your ſtaffe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the towre as before, kéeping the ſtation <hi>N</hi> directly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2809:27"/>

Or to get the length and breadth of any Forte a far off, thereby to gather of what receite the ſame forte is. Or to get the width of a riuer fronting any fort, keeping your ſelfe a farre off without daunger of ſhotte.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FIrſt you ſhall by the fiftéenth, ſeuentéenth, nineteenth, or <note place="margin">Of lati</note> laſt Chapter, get the ſeuerall diſtances of the ſame fortes from your ſtation appoincted, ſeeke the one diſtance in the one legge, the other diſtaunce in the other legge of your ſtanderd Staffe, and to each ſett the running ſighte pins fixed, then pitching againe at the ſame ſtation, take with your ſtanderd Staffe the angle of poſition between thoſe fortes by the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téenth Chapter, and there wreſte him faſte to keepe that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſure. Laſtly place the centre of the running Staffe on one of the ſaid fixed fight pinnes, applying alſo one of his ſides vnto the other ſighte pin, and the number of that ſide of the running Staffe, there touching that other ſight pin is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce betwene the two forts deſired. Or you might apply the ioincte piece or any parte of the running Staffe betwéene the ſight pinnes, but that it is not ſo eaſy to rekon as from the centre it is.</p>
               <p>In like manner may you get the diſtaunce betweene two trées or two towers in one forte, and thereby get the length
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2809:30"/>
or bredth of the ſame forte, and be able by that meanes to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crie of what receit the ſame is. Alſo the bredth of any riuer by taking two markes, as trées, buſhes, or buildings on each ſide of the riuer one. But you are by this neuer the neare, to know the diſtance betweene two ſhippes on the ſea, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writers and thoſe no ſmall ones, do teach you by a like precepte arithmeticall, except thoſe ſhippes lie at ancor that they ſtirre not, yet in the twenty foure Chapter following, I ſhall ſatisfie you for that.</p>
               <p>For example, admitte the diſtaunce of the one forte founde to bee fiue hundred paſe from your ſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paſe: the firſt viz. fiue hundred I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon on the one legge of the ſtanderd, <figure/> there I ſette the ſighte pinne viz. at <hi>E,</hi> the ſecond viz. ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth I reckon on the other legge of the ſtanderd, there I ſet the other ſighte pin viz. at <hi>D.</hi> That doen, I take the angle of poſition betweene both thoſe fortes, or rather ſome two principall towers of them, which admitte to be the angle <hi>C A B,</hi> there I lock the ſtanderd Staffe, then clapping the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the running Staffe on the ſight pin before fixed at <hi>E,</hi> I directe his owne ſide vnto the other ſight pin fixed at <hi>D,</hi> and the quantity thereof betwéene <hi>D</hi> and <hi>E,</hi> ſheweth me the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce betweene the two fortes or towers deſired.

               </argument>
               <p>IN ſuch dangerous times when any aſſault of an army by <note place="margin">Of lo or diſt</note> land or of ſhips by ſea is expected againſt any fort or hauen, you ſhall appoinct in the ſame hauen or fort two certaine towers fartheſt diſtant, in ſtead of your two ſtations. Their exact diſtaunce you ſhall alwayes haue in a reddineſſe gotten by the laſt chap. Let one of theſe towers be called the firſt ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the other the ſecond. In this firſt tower you ſhall haue alwayes your ſtanderd readie placed by ſome kind of ſteadfaſt ſupporter, his one legge directly on the other tower or ſtation, not to be eaſely wreſted aſide from that poſition, the other leg next the enemy at liberty. In the ſecond tower let the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtaffe be alwaies readily placed in like manner, his one ſide ſtedfaſtly on the firſt ſtation, his other ſide next the enemie at liberty. Your inſtruments thus exactly placed, alwayes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die at your two ſtations, and the certaine diſtaunce betwéene them foreknowen, your worke is at any time almoſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ere you begin. Let your ſelfe at the firſt ſtation, and ſome practizd body at the ſecond, guide the looſe legs of your inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes directly ſtill vpon the mayne toppe of ſome principall ſhippe, or formoſt Auncient of the army, and let a third man within a little after he ſhall perceaue both your eyes layde to your inſtruments with a trumpet or horne, giue a ſhort blaſt: and immediatly vppon the inſtant of the blaſt, let both of you locke faſt your inſtruments at thoſe angles, which angles had
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2809:31"/>
and taken both at one inſtant of the blaſt giuen. Let each of the obſeruers come from their towers and bring their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to méete together as ſpeedily as they can, and clapping one vppon another in ſuch manner, as in the 20. chap. was done, you ſhall there immediatly deſery how farre that ſhippe or army was off at the blaſt giuing.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it may be long ere two can come out of the toppes of towers to meete: beſides that, becauſe it is harde bringing ſuch an inſtrument downe ſtayers, or letting it downe with a rope for feare of ſagging or ſlipping of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles taken. Therefore to remedie this, let him that obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in the firſt tower, haue a ſpare running ſtaffe, beſides the ſtanderd ſtaffe wherewith he obſerueth: And let him that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the blaſt, bee placed néere about the middeſt betwéene theſe two ſtation towers. And when the blaſt is giuen let him in the ſecond tower that obſerueth with the running ſtaff, looke what degrée of the graduation on the leuell ſide of his ſtaffe, the graduators Apex doth ſhew, and report it with a loude voyce to this middle man: And let him report it againe to the obſeruer in the firſt tower or ſtation, who hauing the ſayde ſpare running ſtaffe ſhall immediatly ſet it by the ſame degrée and minute reported vnto the very ſame angle that the running ſtaffe at the ſecond tower is at, and therewith worke in all reſpects as before euen as though the other running ſtaff had beene brought to him.</p>
               <p>But if any man will obiect, what if there bee not two towers in the hauen, then I ſay it is likely there is but one Church, and that it is a ſmall matter in ſuch daungerous times to make ſcaffoldes with boordes on houſen toppes for ſuch good purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Alſo in the very like ſpéedie manner, you may worke with a cople of ſtations readie pitched on the ſea bankes: withall you muſt euer haue regarde to the notes of the 15. chap.</p>

Then ſette the centre of the running Staffe on the ſight pin of the leuell legge, directing his one ſide to the middle or centre of the other ſight pin, his other ſide euen with the centre of the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd. There locke the running Staffe faſt at that angle, and marke what number of the running Staffe is there cut off by the centre of the ſighte pin. For if that be equall to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of the ſhippe or marke before gotten, then doth that ſighte pinne ſhew your deſire, if otherwiſe then moue the running Staffe faſt lockt at the ſaid angle to and fro, the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the ſtanderde by helpe of the ſighte pinne whercan hee rideth, vntill there be cutte off in the ſaide ſide of the runninge Staffe, the exacte diſtaunce of the ſaid ſhippe or marke before found.

               <p>This matter would haue an example.

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:2809:33"/>
ſtation, viz. <hi>A</hi> as before is ſaide, then by remouing his ſighte pinnes to ſuch two places, viz to <hi>I</hi> and <hi>O,</hi> that by your eye you finde the ſhippe directly in one line by them both, viz. in the line <hi>I O C,</hi> and that the ſighte pinne in the perpendiculer legge, viz. <hi>I</hi> doe ſhewe 100. partes, the other in the leuell leg three hundreth partes. Now take your running Staffe and ſette the centre thereof on the ſighte pinne <hi>O,</hi> and directe his owne ſide vnto <hi>I,</hi> and his other ſide euen with the centre <hi>V</hi> of the ſtanderd, and there locke him faſt at that angle. And if now you finde on the running Staffe betweene <hi>O</hi> and <hi>I</hi> the iuſt number of the diſtaunce <hi>I C,</hi> viz one hundreth twentye, then doth <hi>I V</hi> ſhew the exacte number of perches of <hi>I B</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But in very déede you ſhall finde betweene <hi>I</hi> and <hi>O,</hi> thrée hundreth ſixtéene ⅕ or thereabouts, which is more then one hundreth twenty. Therefore you ſhall moue the ſight pin <hi>O,</hi> together with the running Staffe inwards towards <hi>V,</hi> vntill ſuch time as you finde but iuſte one hundreth and twenty betwéene <hi>I</hi> and <hi>O,</hi> and then ſhall you haue but thirty eight iuſt betweene <hi>I</hi> and <hi>V,</hi> your deſire.

But if it be not high aboue the ſea, it is leaſt worth: And the higher, ſo much it is the better for this purpoſe, and alſo for the Gunner, as it ſhould ſeeme vnto me by <hi>Tartaglia</hi> who ſaith in his firſt booke, ſecond Colloquy, that a peece ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mounted or embaſed from the leuel of the Horizon ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with more force and further, then it wil, being ſhot leuell. The chiefe ſubſtance of our practiſe in this, conſiſteth in the exact finding of the leuell of the water vnder your ſtation on the clifte toppe: For which cauſe I promiſed the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Whereas others haue left it very abſurdly to be done with a line and plummet of lead let down from the clift toppe: as though euery clift or any clift almoſt would admit ſuch pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable facillitie.</p>
               <p>Well, to the purpoſe. In ſuch a ſet place you ſhall haue alwaies your ſtation ready prepared, with the depth of the leuell of the water knowne by helpe of the laſt Chapter: and there your ſtandard ſetled at his ſquare angle, and alwaies ready pitched in maner of the laſt Chapter, on ſome ſuch reſt that he may ſpeedely be turned which way ſoeuer any ſhippe commeth, keeping him ſelfe ſtill plumbe and leuell, the ſight pinne of the perpendiculer ſide, fixed faſt with his ſcrue at the euen part, anſwering the hight of your ſtation aboue the water, your ſtandard ſtaffe thus alwaies ſet in a readineſſe, your worke is done in manner ere you beginne. For ſo ſoone as you eſpye any ſhippe making neare to your coſte, direct the extreame of the leuell legge of the ſtandard to the ſhippe, and clap on the centre of your running ſtaffe, to ride on the fired ſight pinne of the hanging legge, and there lifting vp or downe the one ſide of the running ſtaffe cloſe by the ſaid leuell

               <p>Note that the other ſide of the running Staffe is to no vſe in this practiſe. And one thing more I thought good to warne you off, that in placing of your ſight pin <hi>I,</hi> you haue a care of the riſing or falling of the leuell of the water by reaſon of the tides. For which cauſe, you had neede to haue ſome ſpeciall markes purpoſely ſette in the bottome of the next clifte or ſea

               <p>THis is the moſt curious matter which we had to deale withall, and as ſleightly dealt in by other writers, whoſe whole deuice hetherto, hath béene to looke from the top of the ſhip wherein they are, vnto the bottome of the other ſhip, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it after the ſame reaſon that in my 26. Chapter is ſhewed. For they appoint the knowen length of the maſt of their ſhip, in ſtead of the knowen height of the clift in that 26 Chapter. And to make the matter ſeeme of more account, they call this a diſtance gotten at one ſtation. A goodly thing: as who ſaith that the ſquare angle, which they imagine at the bottome of the maſte, and the length of the maſt knowen, is not in all reſpects a ſecond ſtation, as it were readie, made to theyr hand. Let me alwaies haue a reentangled triangle to deale with, and I will neuer aſke you but one ſuch ſtation, for all that I haue before written. But now looke yet neerer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter, and though the ground of this their working is vnfallible, yet ſee to how ſmall purpoſe, and in manner abſurd, theyr precept is in this. For if (as in the fourth note of the foureteenth Chapter I ſhewed) the ſecond ſhip bee diſtant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue ten or twelue maſts length, their working is of ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, euen on plaine ground: but then conſider the tottering of the ſhip on the water, they ſhall be forced for want of ſteddy taking of the angle euen <hi>totalliter errare.</hi> For which cauſes I cannot content my ſelfe to deliuer this matter ſo ſleightlie, as that I thinke it to anie purpoſe to be done in anie ſhip, but rather by helpe of two ſhippes, or in a calme one ſhip and help of the cockbote.

in the one, and the running ſtaffe, in the other, bee placed with two obſeruors to each ſtaffe, to take the angle of poſition, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſecond manner of the foureteenth Chapter, betweene the ſayde forte and his fellow obſeruors, in the other ſhip ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly at a blaſt giuen, as was done in the 22. Chapter, there locking faſt their inſtruments, and haſting by haling in the ſhips to bring them together, they ſhall deſcrie the diſtance to the forte deſired, in ſuch ſort as in the 20. or 22. Chapter was done, or without haling the ſhippes together by reporting the angle taken one to another, and help of a ſpare running ſtaffe, as in the end of the ſaid 22. Chapter is ſhewed. For the length of the cable and both ſhips knowen, yeldeth the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene your two ſtations.</p>
               <p>And for the more ſpéedy and ſure taking of thoſe angles, let each paire of obſeruors hang a verie white cloth vnder the centre of their inſtruments.

               <p>Note that if a man be ſo ſtraight driuen, that he hath no helpe but one bare ſhip, then let him doe it in the verie lyke manner, placing his obſeruors at both endes of the ſhip, as far

And when you haue thoſe angles noted, and would reduce them into mappe, if you can not otherwiſe more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily doe it, then take paines in ſuch manner as they teach, by helpe of that ſmall cyrcle, which they call, and fitly a protua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, in the mean while till I may haue a wiſhed time to write of this my Inſtrument more at large. Then will I teache you to lay a ſide your detractor, and ſhewe you more knacks then I dare at this time to name or make promiſe of for my owne quiet ſake, leaſte I ſhould be by ſome importimacyes interrupted from the ſeconde part of my Iewell, which I woulde moſte gladly bring forth with as conuenient ſpéede as may bee.</p>

            <head>An Appendix of the author, touching ſome alteration of this Familliar Staffe.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing on the foure and twentieth of Ianuary laſt, preſented the coppy of this ſmal treatiſe in written hand, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Staffe, framed in ſuch manner, as in the third and fourth Chapter is ſhewed. It pleaſed his Honor within two daies after, to ſee triall of ſome of the concluſions in Gréene wich parke. Upon the good liking whereof, his H. ſhewed the ſame to diuerſe, both No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Hondrable, and worſhipfull, in the Courte: and withall deliuered me againe the written coppy, as a thing which he thought more méete to be made publike, for the benefite of his countrey, then to be referued to his owne priuate vſe. But I well nowd that the generall opinion of the greater number of beſt iudgement, was, to haue him made in two ſeuerall ſtaues, in ſuch manner as in the ende of the thirde or fourth Chapter I noted, thereby to haue them both of a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient tractable quantity. Which I more willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente vnto, becauſe I finde ſome wante of a thirde ſlippinge rule in the ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derd Staffe, like unto the graduator of the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Staffe, to keep him ſure and ſtedfaſt in working: which after the firſt fabrication may not be wel conucied.</p>
            <p>But now if ſhe ſhall like of this alteration of our Staffe: there are alſo many things of the third and fourth Chapter to be quite altered.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that you haue two ſeuerall channells in the hollowneſſe of your Staffe, the vndermoſt for the gradua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and the bolte leading his apex to and fro: the vppermoſte for the running bolts that muſt carry your ſighte pinnes to and fro, which bolts ſhall alſo now haue your wings or broad
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2809:39"/>
ſights of braſſe (appointed to the running Staffe) ſo annexed vnto them, that they may folde or ſhut into the Staffe, when you carry it. <figure/> Secondly the gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators of theſe ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtaues ſhall haue no maner of degrées or gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them except you liſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie there ſhall be no ioincte piece like vnto <hi>G F</hi> to bee taken off and on, but both legges ſhall bee whole and ſounde quite through.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, wheras the chiefeſt cauſe of the ioincte piece <hi>G F</hi> was in reſpecte to be taken off, when the running Staffe was to be vſed for the leueling or mounting of a piece of ordinunce, in manner of the ſixth Chapter. We ſhall ſupply that vſe (though both legges of the Staffe be whole) by ſetting the gunners points on the leuell ſide <hi>D E,</hi> by helpe of a quadrant, deſcribed on the pointe <hi>G,</hi> as in the fourth Chapter you did ſette them on the graduator <hi>G H,</hi> by helpe of a quadrant deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed on the pointe <hi>D.</hi> the Saffe ſtanding ſtill at his ſquare angle. Orels (which I think better) you may ſet the Staffe vnto the angle of forty fiue degrées, and there faſten him, and then on <hi>N</hi> deſcribe a quadrante, and thereby ſette on, either the twelfth gunners points, or the 90. degrées on the ſide <hi>D E</hi> as before, and ſo ſhall a line drawen from <hi>G</hi> to the middle pointe of the twelfth, bee perpendiculer to <hi>D E:</hi> for which cauſe you ſhall now number them, from that middle pointe, but vnto ſix on either ſide, becauſe the one half of theſe twelue pointes, ſhal nowe ſerue for mounting a piece vnto the ſixth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2809:40"/>
poincte, which as <hi>Tartaglia</hi> ſtteth downe is the furtheſt randome, the other halfe ſerueth for embaſing your piece vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſixt point, vnder the leuell or pointe blancke, in all reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to be vſed as in the ſixt Chapter is ſhewed, ſauing that now the hanging ſide <hi>D G F</hi> muſt be turned vpwards, which there was turned downwards, and the angle <hi>F D E</hi> ſette at the angle of forty fiue degrees, which there was ſet at the ſquare angle.</p>
            <p>Note that if you <gap reason="illegible: fold" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſte, you may ſette the pointes of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, beyond the ſee point, as far as the length of the ſide <hi>D E</hi> will extende.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Touching the proportion and the timber fit for this Staffe.</head>
               <p>I Thought it not amiſſe to note, that making your Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into two ſeueral Staues, the fitteſt proportion that I like, is, that each legge of your Staffe be fiue or ſixe feete in length, one inche bread, and one inche and an halfe thicke to receaue the channells.</p>
               <p>The one channell for the graduator to be ſhutte into, off, halfe inche wide, the other for the bolts of the running ſights, to ſlip to and fro in: of one quarter of in inche wide, and the three cheekes encloſing theſe two channels, to bee eche one quarter inche thicke: ſo is your whole inch and halfe thicknes beſtowed.</p>
               <p>Now for him that will beſtowe coſt, let each of theſe legs be made of fiue rule pieces, that is toſay, three, to ſerue for the ſaid thrée cheekes, which muſt be of peare tree or plum tree, as well for tough ſtrength, as to receaue the grauinge, the other two pieces ſerue to fill vp or backe the channelles which muſt be of Cedar, or ſome ſuch very light and ſtronge wood, to the end your Staffe be not ouer heauy. Alſo for a Captaine it may be faſhioned, out to a ſharpe pointe aboue the iointe (not much vnlike the number of a paire of common
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2809:40"/>
fire tongs) to the end, toreceaue thereon the hed of a pike or leading Staffe.</p>
               <p>Or if anie man will beſtowe ſomewhat leſſe coſt, then let each leg bee made but of thrée rule péeces, and haue but one channel, the two out ſides of peare trée; the middlemoſt of cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as before. But then he muſt haue ſome forecaſt, that the boltes for his running ſight pins, and the bolt that leadeth the graduators apex to and fro, may all runne and worke theyr wils in that one channell, which I know may be done.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for the common ſort that will beſtow little coſt, let each leg be made but of one péece, keeping the former breadth and thickneſſe, and let the channell or channels bee cut out of the whole woode, but then make him not ouer long, leaſt hee ſagge. For aſſure your ſelfe, the more péeces he is made of, the ſtronger he is from ſagging, and the ſurer from warping. And howſoeuer hee bee made, let him at the leaſt be brought to an eight ſquare, or rounded, for the more pleaſant handling.</p>
               <p>To conclude, anie thing here ſet downe for haſt without fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, that may not bewell conceiued or gathered by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, my ſelfe will be moſt readie to giue directions for, vpon anie ſmall requeſt. I ſhall eaſily bee heard of about maiſter Treaſurers lodging in the Court, or at <hi>Swallowfield</hi> by <hi>Reading,</hi> where I dwell. There dwelleth a verie arteficiall workeman in Hoſier lane, called <hi>Iohn Reade,</hi> who can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you, whoſe helpe I haue vſed about one or two of theſe ſtaues.</p>

               <p>AMongſt many that tooke view of my Familliar Staffe at the Court, the right noble and wopſhipfull Knight, Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> Knight Marſhall of <hi>England,</hi> and chiefe Captaine of the Ile of <hi>Wight,</hi> tooke no ſmall notice of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie parts, and requited me inſtantly to apply him as well for the vſe of the ſea, as I had don for the land: which amongſt a number of other Aſtronomicall and Geometricall concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

I meant to haue reſerued for ny ſecond edition. But yet to ſatiſfie his Worthineſſe and others of like affection: let it be knowen, that for taking the altitude of the Sunne, Moone, or Starre. If you put a ſhort pegge into the centre of your Staffe, and reſt the ſame peg on the very vtter corner of your eie, and then open the legs of your ſtaffe, vntill (with your eie ſo reſted on the ſame peg, and your other eie cloſed) you ſée by the one leg or his ſight pin, the brim or parting of the ſea from the element: by the other leg, the Sunne, Moone, or Starre deſired, there ſhall the graduators apex ſhew you, among the degrées or graduation of the Staffe, the altitude deſired.</p>
               <p>Note that your Staffe being ſhut almoſt cloſe, you may by a thred faſtned to the Apex, pull the Staffe open it pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Then for taking the diſtance of two Starres or Planets, which as I take it, is a ſecond matter vſed at ſea. You cannot poſſibly (as I gather) do it better by the Croſſe ſtaffe it ſelf, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you and your partner may doe it, after the ſecond manner of the fourtéenth Chapter before.</p>
               <p>I coulde alſo ſhewe you meanes, by applying the extreame of the leuell ſide to your eie, and pulling the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duators apex towards you, how you might take the altitude or diſtance of ſtarres by ſinking of the hanging ſide, by lyttle and little from the ſquare angle, in mae<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To make a finall end, if for theſe Marine cauſes you make my ſtaffe no longer, then their common Croſſe ſtaues are, I ſee no cauſe, but it is as readie, and my be handled with as much facilitie as their Croſſe ſtaffe. And if yet there remaine anie doubt or defect, I make no doubt, but vppon aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof to ſupplie it.</p>
               <p>Farewell my Familliar Staffe, commend me to mine old acquaintance <hi>Richard Stockwel,</hi> Gumer of the Ile of <hi>Gernſie,</hi> if thou méete him, tell him thou art priuided to ſatiſfie him of al our communication had at <hi>Greyes</hi> this laſt Summer, and let him lodge thee in the ſtored ſhrine of all his pretie conceits.</p>
