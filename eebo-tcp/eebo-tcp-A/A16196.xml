            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>At this time after his H. and his ≈øayd ≈øonne and heyre had each of them ≈øhot, I being at hand, was demanded a que≈øtion or two of getting the di≈øtance of the marke wherto they ≈øhot.

               </argument>
               <p>FOr that I haue bene acquainted with diuer≈øe willing wits de≈øirous of knowledge, wanting the rudiments of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, whereby they might be enabled to make choi≈øe of ≈øuch in≈øtruments as might be ≈øubiect to fewe≈øt errors and ab≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, to haue bene marueilou≈øly in loue with the cro≈ø≈øe ≈øtaffe

and that altogether, becau≈øe it yeldeth his v≈øe with that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity, though but in matters at hand. For which cau≈øe, I thought good euen of zeale and good will to all ≈øuch willinge young practi≈øers, to wa≈øte this Cap. for their good, to a≈ø≈øure them how weake and to ≈ømall purpo≈øe the cro≈ø≈øe ≈øtaffe is, in re≈øpect to be imployed in any weighty ≈øeruice, ≈øcarce doing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing well, and that not much aboue a bowe ≈øhute of, whereas this my familliar ≈øtaffe ≈øhall performe them no le≈ø≈øe exacte at a mile, 2. or 3. di≈øtante, if the marke bee ≈øuche that the eie may cary it ≈øtrongly.</p>
               <p>There haue bene from time to time be≈øids the cro≈ø≈øe ≈øtaffe diuer≈øe other in≈øtruments, deui≈øed for the≈øe kindes of ≈øerui≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me≈øurations, as in the Cap. before I mentioned: of which the Geometricall quadrate was thought to be the be≈øt, as it ≈øeemeth to me by <hi>G. Fri≈øius,</hi> who often vpbraydeth the ≈øame quadrate with his ≈øtaffe, when he had in as much as mighte be doen, reduced the cro≈ø≈øe ≈øtaffe to all yerfection, letting it then to lacke no commendations, ≈øaying euen at the fir≈øt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce to the v≈øe of it, <hi>lib. de radio a≈øtro. &amp; Geomet. cap. 5.

For in taking of an altitude, which is ≈øimply the be≈øt thing it can doe, if the ≈øtaffe be not directed leuell with the horrizon, then cannot the cro≈ø≈øe bee parallell to the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and therefore breedeth error as him ≈øelfe confe≈ø≈øeth in the ≈øame 5. Cap. ≈øaying: <hi>Vnum a paucis notatum intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabiles inducit errores. Si quidem Radius in dimen≈øio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus per directam lineam, &amp; qua≈øi ad normam tendere debet ver≈øus lineam quam metiri ≈øtatuimus, ≈øiue ea ≈øit longitudinis fiue latitudinis,</hi> what can a man aske more then direct con≈øe≈ø≈øion, yet after he ≈øayeth againe by way of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoidance in the ≈øame Cap. <hi>Neque vereri de bes paruum
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2809:7"/>
a norma deflexum qui nullum inducere pote≈øt errorem ≈øen≈øu perceptibilem.</hi> But by his fauour againe though a litle holding from the leuell, can breede no great error in the altitude or latitude. Yet that very ≈ømal error, there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mitted: ≈øhall growe to ≈øomewhat in the longitude or di≈øtaunce: being he teacheth no other way in manner, to get a di≈øtance but by the altit. or latit. of ≈øome thing at thextreame of the di≈øtance fir≈øt obtayned, multiplyed into the length. Which in a long di≈øtance will multiply that in≈øen≈øible error to become intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as he termeth it. But what ≈øhould we talke of longe di≈øtances, when as he maketh a proui≈øo, we ≈øhall deale with none by the≈øe wordes in his 5. Cap. or the like in effect. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hili e≈ø≈øe quantum di≈øtes a re men≈øuranda, verum opus e≈øt di≈øtantia non admodum longa.</hi> And then were wee as good to be without his ≈øtaffe in my opinion, as to entertaine him on ≈øuch ≈øtreight conditions. But now to remedy tho≈øe errors in altitudes, he ≈øayeth in one place you may ≈øette the ≈øtaffe leuell by a thredd and plummet aplied to the cro≈ø≈øe. <hi>In erectis quidem appen≈øo perpendiculo<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

Cap. 2. <hi>Itaque nulla in parte ≈øuperatur a≈øcala Geomet. verum multis modis ≈øuperat, quin ip≈øe radius, ≈øcala quo que quaedam e≈øt geometrica, tanto prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantior quanto maiorem prebet v≈øum,</hi> he ≈øhould haue ≈øaid <hi>facil orem v≈øum</hi> and then he had ≈øayd ≈øomewhat, for taking away his facillity, you take away his chiefe goodnes. The quadrate, the plaine ≈øtationes which ≈øtickes, the bare rule or ≈øquire, being wel handled, will do much more, as wel in great as ≈ømall di≈øtances, onely they want the like facillitie in v≈øe. Yea and <hi>G.

Staffe, as it were by the haire of the head, with his armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, and then is his ≈øo well boa≈øted facillitye quite gone: Be≈øides that, the longe≈øt parte of your goodly in≈øtrumente is brought then to halfe the length of the cro≈ø≈øe, and a ≈ømall length of the ≈øtaffe, which in a ≈øtaffe of 5. foote length will b√©e but 15. inches, and in a ≈øtaffe of 9. or 10. foote, which no mans height can po≈ø≈øibly reach to v≈øe in that manner without a lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the longe≈øt part will be little aboue 2. foote, and of that length though the facillity remained, a man might as ea≈øelye wilde a quadrate. And now con≈øidering that halfe the cro≈ø≈øe and 3. quarters of the ≈øtaffes length, is by this meanes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and to no v≈øe, who would carry all that wood about with him, except the weather were cold. Therefore to conclude, let no man be led away with the facillity of the Cro≈ø≈øe ≈øtaffe, or of any in≈øtrument, rather let him thinke no pains too great that produceth an exacte truth. And where as <hi>G. Fri≈øius</hi> ≈øayeth, that his ≈øtaffe is <hi>quaeda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ≈øcala geometrica,</hi> I ≈øay that my Staffe is not <hi>quaedam,</hi> but <hi>≈øumma ≈øcala geometrica,</hi> that be is <hi>nobili≈ø≈øimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> trigonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> geometricu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>.</hi> For what may be doen by Triangles in Geometry, whole volumes do te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and my ≈øelfe in another treati≈øe of this ≈øtaffe at ≈øome other time will partely manife≈øt.

                  <hi>THis</hi> ≈øtaffe con≈øi≈øteth of two ≈øeuerall partes, or rather two ≈øeuerall ≈øtaues, the one I call the ≈øtanderd ≈øtaffe, the other the running ≈øtaffe.

                  <p>If a Wall or Tower were to be ≈øcaled, and that you may come vnto the ha≈øe of it without daunger, How by this familiar ≈øtaffe ≈øpedily to get the height thereof, thereby to make your ≈øcaling ladders according.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT hapneth often that it is thought more conuenient to win <note place="margin">Of altit</note> a towne or fort by ≈øcaling with ladders and ≈øuch like, then to batter it with ordinaunce. In ≈øuch a ca≈øe where the walles may be come to, without daunger, it is ≈øo ea≈øie and common to get the height by any in≈øtrument, that I could ≈øcar≈øe ≈øpare it a roome, but that it may ≈øerue as a ground, or fir≈øt introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the re≈øt. This my familliar ≈øtaffe as in the 2. chap. I ≈øaide, may be v≈øed in mo≈øt ca≈øes, eyther as him≈øelfe, or as the quadrante or circle, or as the quadrate, or as the cro≈ø≈øe ≈øtaffe, or as the gunners quadrant: and in this ca≈øe indifferent to them all. For if you take your running ≈øtaffe ≈øet at his ≈øquare
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2809:15"/>
angle, and apply the leuell ≈øide to your eye, lifting vp the centre till the line and plummet out of the centre do hange iu≈øtly on the 45. deg. or 6. gunners poinct of the graduator, which are both in one ≈øtreight line, what vpright ≈øoeuer you ≈ø√©e, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with the leuell ≈øide the height thereof is equall to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtannce from you. In ≈øo much that when at any time you ≈øhall by this in≈øtrument or any other finde the altitude of the ≈øunne 45. deg. if then you runne and mea≈øure the ≈øhaddow of that tower or wall, the ≈øame ≈øhall be equall to the height ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as mo≈øt aucthors affirme, but in very d√©ede it ≈øhall be le≈ø≈øe then the height by ≈øo much as one quarter of a degr√©e co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>meth to, as in the treati≈øe of my new A≈øtronomicall ≈øtaffe not yet extant ≈øhall appeare: in the meane time take the ≈øhaddow at 44 ¬æ degr√©es high, and the ≈øame ≈øhall be your de≈øire.</p>
               <p>But now, if you will doe it cro≈ø≈øe≈øtaffe wi≈øe, then ≈øet the extreme of the leuell ≈øide of the running ≈øtaffe to your eye car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it ≈øquare to the vpright, as n√©ere as you can, the hanging ≈øide vpwards and parallell to the wall, and go in or out ≈øo, till you may ≈ø√©e the toppe of the vpright, euen with the toppe of the hanging ≈øide, and there ≈øhall you finde the di≈øtaunce to the <figure/> wall equall to the height thereof, as before. And if you place the wing in the midde≈øt of the hanging ≈øide, and by that ≈ø√©e the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2809:15"/>
toppe from the extreme of the leuel ≈øide, then is the di≈øtance to the vpright double to the height, if at a fourth part from the centre, then is the di≈øtance 4. times the height, &amp;c. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in this figure the running ≈øtaffe ≈øet at his ≈øquare angle, and carried ≈øquare to the wall as you ≈ø√©e: if you go in or out till you might ≈øee the toppe <hi>P</hi> of the tower <hi>R P</hi> euen by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames <hi>E</hi> and <hi>F</hi> there ≈øhall the di≈øtance from your ≈øtanding to the tower be equall to <hi>P S,</hi> then adding thereto your height viz. <hi>R S,</hi> you haue the height de≈øired.

               <p>For example, Admit you placed the wing of the hanging ≈øide 120. euen partes from the centre of the ≈øtaffe, viz. at <hi>H</hi> by which at the fir≈øt ≈øtation viz <hi>M</hi> and thextreame of the leuell ≈øide of your ≈øtaffe, viz. <hi>E</hi> you ≈ø√©e the toppe of the wall of the tower, viz. <hi>P</hi> by the vi≈øiall line <hi>E P.</hi> That done, then place the wing of the leuell ≈øide <hi>E D</hi> one halfe of <hi>D H</hi> (being 120. parts as is ≈øayd) viz. 60. euen partes from <hi>E</hi> at <hi>I,</hi> and ≈ø√©eke you a ≈øtanding nearer to the tower <hi>P R,</hi> where you may euen by the winges <hi>H</hi> and <hi>I</hi> ≈ø√©e <hi>P</hi> the toppe thereof againe viz. at <hi>N,</hi>

               <p>But here I can no longer delay, but warne you of two things in this working, both which, <hi>G.

But I haue euer dete≈øted that facillity that ≈øhould produce any ab≈øurdity. The one is, that the hanging ≈øide of our in≈øtrument be parallel to the wal, the other, that your eye in both ≈øtations be ≈øett in one leuell, that is to ≈øay, no higher aboue the ba≈øe in the one ≈øtation, then in the other, both which are fowle faults to be admitted, if the vpright ≈øhould be far of: yet are ea≈øely ≈øalued with a little paines.

I meane produce at his ≈øecond mea≈øurement either the ≈øame platt or the ≈øame mea≈øure which he did at the fir≈øt. But God willing when ≈øo euer I ≈øhall goe in hand to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of this in≈øtrument, I ≈øhall ≈øett downe mo≈øte certaine ≈øalues for euery ≈øore in tho≈øe ca≈øes.

the hanging ≈øide, as in the ≈øecond Chapter was ≈øaide, which your partner may ea≈øely guide whiles he ≈øtayeth theend for you, e≈øpecially hauing an halberd pitched in the ground to help him re≈øt his hand ≈øteddy.

                  <note place="margin">Of tal angles.</note> is the angle comprehended betweene the vi≈øuall line directed vnto any place appointed, and the meridian line of your being. But if we call the angle made by two lines i≈ø≈øuing from one place or ≈øtation vnto other two places, an angle of po≈øition (though happily more aptly to be termed an angle of ≈øtation) the matter is not great, being it is the angle of po≈øition or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the one place from the other in re≈øpect of your ≈øtation. This angle ≈øhall mo≈øt ca≈øely by this familiar ≈øtaffe two waies be taken, the fir≈øt ea≈øie and familiar to <figure/> conceaue, the ≈øecond more ea≈øie and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to be performed.</p>
               <p>For the fir≈øt way ≈øuppo≈øe <hi>P</hi> your place of ≈øtation and <hi>N</hi> and <hi>T</hi> the two places or markes who≈øe angle of ≈øtation or po≈øition you ≈øeeke.

And if you take this angle by the running ≈øtaffe in this manner, then doth the graduators apex al≈øo ≈øhew you the degrees which that angle contayneth on the leuell ≈øide of the ≈øtaffe. But for your ≈øupporters, it is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall to make ≈øuch reckoning of them as to be choi≈øe about them: for two ≈øtickes pulled out of an hedge, knit together with a point towardes the one ende may ≈øerue for a ≈øhift.

Then goe backe a good quantitie, and there chu≈øe another ≈øtation, doing in the very ≈øame manner with the other wing, placing him al≈øo fixed at ≈øome euen ten or fiue. Then mea≈øure exactly the di≈øtance betw√©ene tho≈øe two ≈øtations: For looke ≈øo many times as the euen partes or di≈øtance betweene the two winges, are contained among≈øt the euen partes from the centre of the ≈øtaffe to the vpper wing: ≈øo many times is the mea≈øurement betweene your two ≈øtations contained in the whole length betw√©ene your furthe≈øt ≈øtation and the wall.</p>

               <p>As for example, admitte that the di≈øtance betw√©ene the ≈øtations <hi>M</hi> and <hi>N</hi> were twentie pearches, and that at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ≈øtation <hi>N</hi> you ≈øet the one wing, to wit <hi>L</hi> at two hundreth perches from <hi>D</hi> the centre of the ≈øtaffe, and there fixed.

               <p>Another way is thus, get the altitude of the towre top aboue the leuell of your eye, that is to ≈øay of <hi>P S</hi> by the ninth or tenth Chapter, which had, reckon the ≈øame on the hanging ≈øide of your running ≈øtaffe, and thereto ≈øet the wing fixed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit at <hi>H.</hi> Then choo≈øe you a ≈øtation as farre from the towre as you thinke good, admit at <hi>N,</hi> there direct your ≈øtaffe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the towre as before, k√©eping the ≈øtation <hi>N</hi> directly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Your in≈øtruments thus exactly placed, alwayes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die at your two ≈øtations, and the certaine di≈øtaunce betw√©ene them foreknowen, your worke is at any time almo≈øt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ere you begin.

and taken both at one in≈øtant of the bla≈øt giuen. Let each of the ob≈øeruers come from their towers and bring their in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to m√©ete together as ≈øpeedily as they can, and clapping one vppon another in ≈øuch manner, as in the 20. chap. was done, you ≈øhall there immediatly de≈øery how farre that ≈øhippe or army was off at the bla≈øt giuing.</p>
               <p>But becau≈øe it may be long ere two can come out of the toppes of towers to meete: be≈øides that, becau≈øe it is harde bringing ≈øuch an in≈øtrument downe ≈øtayers, or letting it downe with a rope for feare of ≈øagging or ≈ølipping of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles taken. Therefore to remedie this, let him that ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in the fir≈øt tower, haue a ≈øpare running ≈øtaffe, be≈øides the ≈øtanderd ≈øtaffe wherewith he ob≈øerueth: And let him that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the bla≈øt, bee placed n√©ere about the midde≈øt betw√©ene the≈øe two ≈øtation towers. And when the bla≈øt is giuen let him in the ≈øecond tower that ob≈øerueth with the running ≈øtaff, looke what degr√©e of the graduation on the leuell ≈øide of his ≈øtaffe, the graduators Apex doth ≈øhew, and report it with a loude voyce to this middle man: And let him report it againe to the ob≈øeruer in the fir≈øt tower or ≈øtation, who hauing the ≈øayde ≈øpare running ≈øtaffe ≈øhall immediatly ≈øet it by the ≈øame degr√©e and minute reported vnto the very ≈øame angle that the running ≈øtaffe at the ≈øecond tower is at, and therewith worke in all re≈øpects as before euen as though the other running ≈øtaff had beene brought to him.</p>
               <p>But if any man will obiect, what if there bee not two towers in the hauen, then I ≈øay it is likely there is but one Church, and that it is a ≈ømall matter in ≈øuch daungerous times to make ≈øcaffoldes with boordes on hou≈øen toppes for ≈øuch good purpo≈øes.</p>

The chiefe ≈øub≈øtance of our practi≈øe in this, con≈øi≈øteth in the exact finding of the leuell of the water vnder your ≈øtation on the clifte toppe: For which cau≈øe I promi≈øed the la≈øt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <p>Well, to the purpo≈øe. In ≈øuch a ≈øet place you ≈øhall haue alwaies your ≈øtation ready prepared, with the depth of the leuell of the water knowne by helpe of the la≈øt Chapter: and there your ≈øtandard ≈øetled at his ≈øquare angle, and alwaies ready pitched in maner of the la≈øt Chapter, on ≈øome ≈øuch re≈øt that he may ≈øpeedely be turned which way ≈øoeuer any ≈øhippe commeth, keeping him ≈øelfe ≈øtill plumbe and leuell, the ≈øight pinne of the perpendiculer ≈øide, fixed fa≈øt with his ≈øcrue at the euen part, an≈øwering the hight of your ≈øtation aboue the water, your ≈øtandard ≈øtaffe thus alwaies ≈øet in a readine≈ø≈øe, your worke is done in manner ere you beginne. For ≈øo ≈øoone as you e≈øpye any ≈øhippe making neare to your co≈øte, direct the extreame of the leuell legge of the ≈øtandard to the ≈øhippe, and clap on the centre of your running ≈øtaffe, to ride on the fired ≈øight pinne of the hanging legge, and there lifting vp or downe the one ≈øide of the running ≈øtaffe clo≈øe by the ≈øaid leuell

               <p>Note that the other ≈øide of the running Staffe is to no v≈øe in this practi≈øe. And one thing more I thought good to warne you off, that in placing of your ≈øight pin <hi>I,</hi> you haue a care of the ri≈øing or falling of the leuell of the water by rea≈øon of the tides. For which cau≈øe, you had neede to haue ≈øome ≈øpeciall markes purpo≈øely ≈øette in the bottome of the next clifte or ≈øea

               </argument>
               <p>THis is the mo≈øt curious matter which we had to deale withall, and as ≈øleightly dealt in by other writers, who≈øe whole deuice hetherto, hath b√©ene to looke from the top of the ≈øhip wherein they are, vnto the bottome of the other ≈øhip, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it after the ≈øame rea≈øon that in my 26. Chapter is ≈øhewed. For they appoint the knowen length of the ma≈øt of their ≈øhip, in ≈øtead of the knowen height of the clift in that 26 Chapter. And to make the matter ≈øeeme of more account, they call this a di≈øtance gotten at one ≈øtation. A goodly thing: as who ≈øaith that the ≈øquare angle, which they imagine at the bottome of the ma≈øte, and the length of the ma≈øt knowen, is not in all re≈øpects a ≈øecond ≈øtation, as it were readie, made to theyr hand. Let me alwaies haue a reentangled triangle to deale with, and I will neuer a≈øke you but one ≈øuch ≈øtation, for all that I haue before written. But now looke yet neerer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter, and though the ground of this their working is vnfallible, yet ≈øee to how ≈ømall purpo≈øe, and in manner ab≈øurd, theyr precept is in this. For if (as in the fourth note of the foureteenth Chapter I ≈øhewed) the ≈øecond ≈øhip bee di≈øtant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue ten or twelue ma≈øts length, their working is of ≈ømall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, euen on plaine ground: but then con≈øider the tottering of the ≈øhip on the water, they ≈øhall be forced for want of ≈øteddy taking of the angle euen <hi>totalliter errare.</hi> For which cau≈øes I cannot content my ≈øelfe to deliuer this matter ≈øo ≈øleightlie, as that I thinke it to anie purpo≈øe to be done in anie ≈øhip, but rather by helpe of two ≈øhippes, or in a calme one ≈øhip and help of the cockbote.

in the one, and the running ≈øtaffe, in the other, bee placed with two ob≈øeruors to each ≈øtaffe, to take the angle of po≈øition, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ≈øecond manner of the foureteenth Chapter, betweene the ≈øayde forte and his fellow ob≈øeruors, in the other ≈øhip ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly at a bla≈øt giuen, as was done in the 22. Chapter, there locking fa≈øt their in≈øtruments, and ha≈øting by haling in the ≈øhips to bring them together, they ≈øhall de≈øcrie the di≈øtance to the forte de≈øired, in ≈øuch ≈øort as in the 20. or 22. Chapter was done, or without haling the ≈øhippes together by reporting the angle taken one to another, and help of a ≈øpare running ≈øtaffe, as in the end of the ≈øaid 22. Chapter is ≈øhewed. For the length of the cable and both ≈øhips knowen, yeldeth the di≈øtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene your two ≈øtations.</p>
               <p>And for the more ≈øp√©edy and ≈øure taking of tho≈øe angles, let each paire of ob≈øeruors hang a verie white cloth vnder the centre of their in≈øtruments.

            <p>But now if ≈øhe ≈øhall like of this alteration of our Staffe: there are al≈øo many things of the third and fourth Chapter to be quite altered.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt is, that you haue two ≈øeuerall channells in the hollowne≈ø≈øe of your Staffe, the vndermo≈øt for the gradua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and the bolte leading his apex to and fro: the vppermo≈øte for the running bolts that mu≈øt carry your ≈øighte pinnes to and fro, which bolts ≈øhall al≈øo now haue your wings or broad
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2809:39"/>
≈øights of bra≈ø≈øe (appointed to the running Staffe) ≈øo annexed vnto them, that they may folde or ≈øhut into the Staffe, when you carry it. <figure/> Secondly the gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators of the≈øe ≈øeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ≈øtaues ≈øhall haue no maner of degr√©es or gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them except you li≈øt.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie there ≈øhall be no ioincte piece like vnto <hi>G F</hi> to bee taken off and on, but both legges ≈øhall bee whole and ≈øounde quite through.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, wheras the chiefe≈øt cau≈øe of the ioincte piece <hi>G F</hi> was in re≈øpecte to be taken off, when the running Staffe was to be v≈øed for the leueling or mounting of a piece of ordinunce, in manner of the ≈øixth Chapter. We ≈øhall ≈øupply that v≈øe (though both legges of the Staffe be whole) by ≈øetting the gunners points on the leuell ≈øide <hi>D E,</hi> by helpe of a quadrant, de≈øcribed on the pointe <hi>G,</hi> as in the fourth Chapter you did ≈øette them on the graduator <hi>G H,</hi> by helpe of a quadrant de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed on the pointe <hi>D.</hi> the Saffe ≈øtanding ≈øtill at his ≈øquare angle. Orels (which I think better) you may ≈øet the Staffe vnto the angle of forty fiue degr√©es, and there fa≈øten him, and then on <hi>N</hi> de≈øcribe a quadrante, and thereby ≈øette on, either the twelfth gunners points, or the 90. degr√©es on the ≈øide <hi>D E</hi> as before, and ≈øo ≈øhall a line drawen from <hi>G</hi> to the middle pointe of the twelfth, bee perpendiculer to <hi>D E:</hi> for which cau≈øe you ≈øhall now number them, from that middle pointe, but vnto ≈øix on either ≈øide, becau≈øe the one half of the≈øe twelue pointes, ≈øhal nowe ≈øerue for mounting a piece vnto the ≈øixth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2809:40"/>
poincte, which as <hi>Tartaglia</hi> ≈øtteth downe is the furthe≈øt randome, the other halfe ≈øerueth for emba≈øing your piece vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ≈øixt point, vnder the leuell or pointe blancke, in all re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to be v≈øed as in the ≈øixt Chapter is ≈øhewed, ≈øauing that now the hanging ≈øide <hi>D G F</hi> mu≈øt be turned vpwards, which there was turned downwards, and the angle <hi>F D E</hi> ≈øette at the angle of forty fiue degrees, which there was ≈øet at the ≈øquare angle.</p>
            <p>Note that if you <gap reason="illegible: fold" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>≈øte, you may ≈øette the pointes of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, beyond the ≈øee point, as far as the length of the ≈øide <hi>D E</hi> will extende.</p>

               <head>Touching the proportion and the timber fit for this Staffe.</head>
               <p>I Thought it not ami≈ø≈øe to note, that making your In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into two ≈øeueral Staues, the fitte≈øt proportion that I like, is, that each legge of your Staffe be fiue or ≈øixe feete in length, one inche bread, and one inche and an halfe thicke to receaue the channells.</p>
               <p>The one channell for the graduator to be ≈øhutte into, off, halfe inche wide, the other for the bolts of the running ≈øights, to ≈ølip to and fro in: of one quarter of in inche wide, and the three cheekes enclo≈øing the≈øe two channels, to bee eche one quarter inche thicke: ≈øo is your whole inch and halfe thicknes be≈øtowed.</p>
               <p>Now for him that will be≈øtowe co≈øt, let each of the≈øe legs be made of fiue rule pieces, that is to≈øay, three, to ≈øerue for the ≈øaid thr√©e cheekes, which mu≈øt be of peare tree or plum tree, as well for tough ≈øtrength, as to receaue the grauinge, the other two pieces ≈øerue to fill vp or backe the channelles which mu≈øt be of Cedar, or ≈øome ≈øuch very light and ≈øtronge wood, to the end your Staffe be not ouer heauy. Al≈øo for a Captaine it may be fa≈øhioned, out to a ≈øharpe pointe aboue the iointe (not much vnlike the number of a paire of common

fire tongs) to the end, toreceaue thereon the hed of a pike or leading Staffe.</p>
               <p>Or if anie man will be≈øtowe ≈øomewhat le≈ø≈øe co≈øt, then let each leg bee made but of thr√©e rule p√©eces, and haue but one channel, the two out ≈øides of peare tr√©e; the middlemo≈øt of cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as before. But then he mu≈øt haue ≈øome foreca≈øt, that the boltes for his running ≈øight pins, and the bolt that leadeth the graduators apex to and fro, may all runne and worke theyr wils in that one channell, which I know may be done.</p>
               <p>La≈øtly, for the common ≈øort that will be≈øtow little co≈øt, let each leg be made but of one p√©ece, keeping the former breadth and thickne≈ø≈øe, and let the channell or channels bee cut out of the whole woode, but then make him not ouer long, lea≈øt hee ≈øagge. For a≈ø≈øure your ≈øelfe, the more p√©eces he is made of, the ≈øtronger he is from ≈øagging, and the ≈øurer from warping. And how≈øoeuer hee bee made, let him at the lea≈øt be brought to an eight ≈øquare, or rounded, for the more plea≈øant handling.</p>
