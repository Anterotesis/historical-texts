            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>SIR, let me tell you what your Pen has done,</l>
            <l>You have accomplisht what was oft begun,</l>

            <l>Others have dropt Remarks thereon; but they,</l>
            <l>Content with that, ne'er made a full survey;</l>
            <l>But you at last</l>
            <l>Have largely shown the wide and sovereign power</l>
            <l>Of Money, and how all things bow unto her.</l>
            <l>Perhaps some curious Critick will alledge,</l>
            <l>You have not hit the Humour of this Age:</l>

            <l>It's better far some Matters to relate</l>

            <l>Were you to write of Emperors or Kings,</l>
            <l>Of conquer'd Towns, or great Heroick things,</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Pegasus</hi> shou'd mount, and spread his tow'ring Wings.</l>

               <l>Appear upon a Stage to shew his Skill,</l>
               <l>And Art in Fencing, there before Men's Eyes,</l>
               <l>And publickly will fight to get a Prize;</l>
               <l>Himself adventure to be cut and slasht,</l>
               <l>And sometimes maim'd perchance, or soundly gasht.</l>
               <l>By his Antagonist; sometimes in rage,</l>
               <l>Disgracefully in scorn thrown off the Stage.</l>
               <l>So sprightly vigorous is Money's Charm,</l>
               <l>He will adventure both Disgrace and Harm:</l>
               <l>Nay Men about Miss <hi>Money</hi> make such stirr,</l>
               <l>That they will resolutely die for her.</l>

               <l>To find the place where Money does abound;</l>
               <l>There up he sets his Stage, where ev'ry Day</l>
               <l>He shews himself, <hi>Andrew</hi> the Fool i'th' Play</l>
               <l>For Money does appear, who for a Wit,</l>
               <l>Does come behind his Master ne'er a whit:</l>
               <l>Thus Money can produce any Disguise,</l>
               <l>Can make a Wise Man Fool, and Fool seem Wise.</l>
               <l>Then when from ev'ry quarter of the Town,</l>
               <l>People are crowded in to see the Clown,</l>
               <l>And gaz'd at him some time, and laugh'd a-while,</l>
               <l>The Master then, with gracefull Cringe and Smile,</l>
               <l>Begins aloud to set forth and proclaim</l>
               <l>His own admir'd Merits, and his Fame,</l>
               <l>And tells what mighty Cures both far and near,</l>
               <l>He hath perform'd in each Place here and there.</l>
               <l>You may, says he, enquire the Certainty;</l>
               <l>But you'd as good believe as go and see.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:60008:25"/>After his long Harangue, he's then willing,</l>
               <l>To give you a small Packet for a Shilling,</l>
               <l>Containing many Medicines, whose worth,</l>
               <l>The little printed Paper does set forth.</l>
               <l>But when you come to try the things indeed,</l>
               <l>You'll find they're all but Cheats in time of need.</l>
               <l>If you do wait with Money in your Hand,</l>
               <l>O then you may be certain to command</l>
               <l>His best Advice in whatsoe'er you will,</l>
               <l>And know the very bottom of his Skill.</l>
               <l>A Wen, Hair-lip, or Cancer too he may</l>
               <l>A Cure perhaps perform, and take away;</l>
               <l>Which any one can do as well as he,</l>
               <l>That is but skilfull in Chyrurgery.</l>
               <l>If you are Blind, or Deaf and cannot hear,</l>
               <l>He'll bid you trust in him, and do not fear,</l>
               <l>For he will cure, and can recover both:</l>
               <l>But in such Case to trust I shou'd be loath;</l>
               <l>For we can seldom hear, or ever find,</l>
               <l>That they the Deaf make hear, or cure the Blind.</l>
               <l>Money's the tempting Bait at which they bite,</l>
               <l>Care not if you ne'er hear, nor get your sight.</l>
               <l>The only thing's your Cash they hanker after;</l>
               <l>If you ne'er mend, they'll turn't but to a laughter.</l>

               <l>Now Muse farewel, for both to Age and Youth,</l>
               <l>In these thy Bluntisms thou hast told much truth.</l>
               <l>Criticks will mock, and scornfully will smile,</l>
               <l>Thy Verse appears in such a vulgar Style;</l>
               <l>'Tis Ballad-Rhime, not Verse thou canst profess,</l>
               <l>But Truth appears best in a homely Dress.</l>
               <l>If to th' Ingenious thou had'st only writ,</l>
               <l>In high and lofty Strains thou must have sit</l>
               <l>Thy Verse, their quaint nice Fancies to have hit.</l>
               <l>To th' Mob as well as th' Learn'd thou dost declare,</l>
               <l>So thou speaks home and plain to every Ear.</l>
               <l>Thou dost not mince, extenuate, or glose,</l>
               <l>But bare nak'd Truth thou plainly dost disclose;</l>
               <l>And tho' in general Terms thou hast set forth</l>
               <l>The same, yet there are some of greater worth</l>
               <l>And Vertue, that above Temptation are,</l>
               <l>Whom neither Gold nor Silver can ensnare</l>
               <l>A dirty or unlawful thing to act,</l>
               <l>Or their Allegiance suffer to be crackt:</l>
               <l>And so no general Rule there is but hath</l>
               <l>Exception to it, as th' old Proverb saith:</l>
               <l>But thou hast fairly thrown each one their Lot,</l>
               <l>Some thou perhaps has humour'd, and some not.</l>
               <l>For some will laugh, some fret, and some deride</l>
               <l>At that which thou to them hast here apply'd:</l>
               <l>But in this Case thou safely mayst conclude,</l>
               <l>That none e'er yet cou'd please the Multitude.</l>

               <l>Those who with nine Months toil had spoil'd a Play,</l>

               <l>For <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi> is the Devil:</l>
               <l>Such mighty Thoughts from <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Letters flow,</l>
               <l>That the Translation is a Work for two;</l>

               <l>My Lord I thought so generous would prove,</l>
               <l>To scorn a Rival in affairs of Love:</l>

               <l>Others do their kind Husbands help to spend</l>

               <l>Some help Men unto more than they were born</l>

            <p>NO Wonder if I am at a Loss to describe him, whom <hi>Nature</hi> was as much puzled to make. 'Tis here as in <hi>Painting,</hi> where the most mishapen <hi>Figures</hi> are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Proofs</hi> of <hi>Skill.</hi> To draw a <hi>Thersites</hi> or <hi>Aesop</hi> well, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the <hi>Pencil</hi> of <hi>Vandike</hi> or <hi>Titian,</hi> more than the best <hi>Features</hi> and <hi>Lineaments.</hi> All the Thoughts I can frame of him are as rude and indigested as himself. The very <hi>Idea</hi> and <hi>Conception</hi> of him are enough to cramp <hi>Grammar,</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:60008:68"/>
to disturb <hi>Sense,</hi> and confound <hi>Syntax.</hi> He's a <hi>Solecism</hi> in the great <hi>Construction,</hi> therefore the best <hi>Description</hi> of him is <hi>Nonsence,</hi> and the fittest <hi>Character</hi> to write it in, that <hi>Pot-hook-hand</hi> the Devil us'd at <hi>Oxford</hi> in <hi>Queen's-College-Library.</hi> He were <hi>Topick</hi> enough for convincing an <hi>Atheist</hi> that the World was made by Chance. The first <hi>Matter</hi> had more of <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> the <hi>Chaos</hi> more of <hi>Symmetry</hi> and <hi>Proportion.</hi> I could call him <hi>Nature's By-blow, Miscarriage</hi> and <hi>Abortive,</hi> or say, he is her <hi>Embryo</hi> slink'd before <hi>Maturity</hi>; but that is stale and flat, and I must fly a higher Pitch to reach his <hi>Deformity.</hi> He is the ugliest she ever took Pains to make so, and <hi>Age</hi> to make worse. All the <hi>Monsters</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> lie kennell'd in his single <hi>Skin.</hi> He's one of the <hi>Grotesques</hi> of the <hi>Vniverse,</hi> whom the grand <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> drew only (as <hi>Painters</hi> do uncouth ugly <hi>Shapes</hi>) to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Without doubt he was made to be laugh'd at, and design'd for the <hi>Scaramuchio</hi> of <hi>Mankind.</hi> When I see him, I can no more forbear than at sight of a <hi>Zany</hi> or <hi>Nokes</hi>; but am like to run the Risque of the <hi>Philosopher,</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on an <hi>Ass</hi> mumbling <hi>Thistles.</hi> He's more ill-favour'd than the <hi>Picture</hi> of <hi>Winter</hi> drawn by a Fellow that dawbs <hi>Sign-Posts,</hi> more lowring than the last Day of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> I have seen a handsomer <hi>Mortal</hi> carv'd in <hi>Monumental Gingerbread,</hi> and woven in <hi>Hangings</hi> at <hi>Mortlock.</hi> If you have ever view'd that <hi>wooden Gentleman</hi> that peeps out of a Country <hi>Barber</hi>'s Window, you may fansie some <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance</hi> of him.

This I'm very confident, he has not heard himself sneeze these <hi>seven Years:</hi> And that leads me to his <hi>Tools</hi> of <hi>Hearing:</hi> His <hi>Ears</hi> resemble those of a <hi>Country Iustice's Black Iack,</hi> and are of the same <hi>Matter, Hue,</hi> and <hi>Size:</hi> He's as well hung as any <hi>Hound</hi> in the <hi>Country</hi>; but by their <hi>Bulk</hi> and <hi>growing upward,</hi> he deserves to be rank'd with the graver sort of <hi>Beasts:</hi> His single self might have shown with <hi>Smeck</hi> and all the <hi>Club Divines.</hi> You may pare enough from the <hi>sides</hi> of his <hi>Head</hi> to have furnisht a whole <hi>Regiment</hi> of <hi>Round-Heads:</hi> He wears more there than all the <hi>Pillories</hi> in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> ever have done. <hi>Mandevile</hi> tells us of a <hi>People</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that use their <hi>Ears</hi> for <hi>Cushions:</hi> He has reduced the <hi>Legend</hi> to Probability. A <hi>Servant</hi> of his (that could not conceal the <hi>Midas</hi>) told me lately in private, that going to <hi>Bed</hi> he binds them on his <hi>Crown,</hi> and they serve him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>Quilt Night-Caps.</hi> The next observable that falls under my <hi>Consideration</hi> is his <hi>Back:</hi> Nor need I go far out of my way to meet it, for it peeps over his <hi>Shoulders</hi>: He was built with a <hi>Buttress</hi> to support the weight of his <hi>Nose,</hi> and help balance it. <hi>Nature</hi> hung on him a <hi>Knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sack,</hi> and made him represent both <hi>Tinker</hi> and <hi>Budget</hi> too. He looks like the visible <hi>Tye</hi> of <hi>Aeneas</hi> bolstring up his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or like a <hi>Beggar-Woman</hi> endorst with her whole <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and with <hi>Child</hi> behind. You may take him for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Christopher</hi> with the <hi>Devil</hi> at his <hi>Back.</hi> I believe the <hi>Atlas</hi> in <hi>Wadham Garden</hi> at <hi>Oxford</hi> was carv'd by him. Certainly he was begot in a <hi>Cupping-Glass:</hi> His <hi>Mother</hi> long'd for <hi>Pumpions,</hi> or went to see some <hi>Camel</hi> shown while she was conceiving him. One would think a <hi>Mole</hi> has crept into his <hi>Carease</hi> before 'tis laid in the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> and Rooted in it, or that an <hi>Earthquake</hi> had disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the <hi>Symmetry</hi> of the <hi>Microcosm,</hi> sunk one <hi>Mountain</hi> and put up another, And now I should descend lower, if I durst venture: But I'll not defile my <hi>Pen:</hi> My <hi>Ink</hi> is too cleanly for a farther <hi>Description.</hi> I must beg my <hi>Reader</hi>'s Distance, as if I were going to Untruss. Should I mention what is beneath, the very <hi>Iakes</hi> would
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60008:70"/>
suffer by the <hi>Comparison,</hi> and 'twere enough to bring a <hi>Boghouse</hi> in Disgrace. Indeed he ought to have been drawn, like the good <hi>People</hi> on the <hi>Parliament-house,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the <hi>Shoulders</hi> upwards. To me 'tis a greater <hi>Prodigy</hi> than himself, how his <hi>Soul</hi> has so long endur'd so nasty a <hi>Lodging.</hi> Were there such a thing as a <hi>Metem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>psychosis,</hi> how gladly would it exchange its <hi>Carcase</hi> for that of the worst and <hi>vilest Brute:</hi> I'm sufficiently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded against the <hi>Whim</hi> of <hi>Prae-Existence</hi>; for any thing that had the <hi>Pretence</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> would never have enter'd such a <hi>Durance</hi> of <hi>Choice:</hi> Doubtless it must have been guilty of some unheard of <hi>Sin,</hi> for which <hi>Heaven</hi> dooms it <hi>Penance</hi> in the present Body, and ordains its first <hi>Hell</hi> here. And 'tis disputable which may prove the worst, for't has suffer'd half an <hi>Eternity</hi> already. Men can hardly tell which of the <hi>two</hi> will out-live the other. By his <hi>Face</hi> you'd guess him one of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and that he liv'd before the <hi>Flood:</hi> His <hi>Head</hi> looks as if it had worn out <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four Bodies,</hi> and were Legacied to him by his <hi>Great-Grand-father.</hi> His <hi>Age</hi> is out of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> I believe he was born before <hi>Registers</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. He should have been a <hi>Ghost</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days. I wonder <hi>Hollingshead</hi> does not speak of him. Every <hi>Limb</hi> about him is <hi>Chronicle: Par</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> of the <hi>Times</hi> were <hi>short-Livers</hi> unto him. They say he can remember when <hi>Pauls</hi> was founded, and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-Bridge</hi> built. I my self have heard him tell all the <hi>Stories</hi> of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> upon his own <hi>Knowledge.</hi> His very <hi>Cane</hi> and <hi>Spectacles</hi> are enough to set up an <hi>Antiquary.</hi> The first was the <hi>Walking-staff</hi> of <hi>Lanfranc</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which is to be seen by his <hi>Arms</hi> upon the <hi>Head</hi> of it: The other belong'd to the <hi>Chaplain</hi> of <hi>William the Conqueror</hi>; was of <hi>Norman</hi> make, and travell'd over with him. 'Tis strange the late Author of M. <hi>Fickle</hi> forgot to make his Sir <hi>Arthur Oldlove</hi> swear by them, the <hi>Oath</hi> had been of as good <hi>Antiquity</hi> as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>'s <hi>Night-Cap,</hi> or <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s <hi>Threshold.</hi> I have often wonder'd he never set up for a <hi>Conjurer:</hi> His very <hi>Look</hi> wou'd bring him in <hi>Vogue,</hi> draw <hi>Custom,</hi> and undo <hi>Lilly</hi>

and <hi>Gadbury.</hi> You'd take him for the <hi>Ghost</hi> of old <hi>Haly</hi> or <hi>Albumazar,</hi> or the <hi>Spirit Frier</hi> in the <hi>Fortune Book,</hi> his <hi>Head</hi> for the inchanted Brazen one of <hi>Frier Bacon.</hi> 'Twou'd pose a good <hi>Physiognomist</hi> to give <hi>Names</hi> to the <hi>Lines</hi> in his <hi>Face.</hi> I've observ'd all the <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams</hi> in <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy's Centiloquies</hi> there upon strict view. And t'other Day a <hi>Linguist</hi> of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance shew'd me all the <hi>Arabick Alphabet</hi> betwixt his <hi>Brow</hi> and <hi>Chin.</hi> Some have admired how he came to be admitted into <hi>Orders,</hi> since his very <hi>Face</hi> is against the <hi>Canon:</hi> I guess he pleaded the <hi>Qualification</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> of Old, to be <hi>wither'd, toothless,</hi> and <hi>deform'd.</hi> He can pretend to be an <hi>Elisha</hi> only by his <hi>Baldness.</hi> The <hi>Devils Oracles</hi> heretofore were utter'd from such a <hi>Mouth.</hi> 'Twas then the <hi>Candidates</hi> for the <hi>Tripus</hi> were fain to plead <hi>Wrinkles</hi> and <hi>Grey Hairs</hi>; a <hi>splay-mouth</hi> and a <hi>gog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle-eye</hi> were the cheapest <hi>Simony,</hi> and the <hi>ugly</hi> and <hi>crippled</hi> were the only Men of <hi>Preferment.</hi> And this leads me to consider him a little in the <hi>Pulpit.</hi> And there 'tis hard to distinguish whether that or his <hi>Skin</hi> be the courser <hi>Wainscot.</hi> He represents a crackt <hi>Weather-Glass</hi> in a <hi>Frame.</hi> You'd take him by his <hi>Looks</hi> and <hi>Posture</hi> for <hi>Muggleton</hi> doing <hi>Pennance,</hi> and paulted with <hi>rotten Eggs.</hi> Had his <hi>Hearers</hi> the trick of writing <hi>short-hand,</hi> I shou'd fancy him an <hi>Offender</hi> upon a <hi>Scaffold,</hi> and them penning his <hi>Confession.</hi> Not a <hi>fluxt Debauch</hi> in a <hi>sweating Tub</hi> makes worse <hi>Faces.</hi> He <hi>makes Doctrine</hi> as Folks do their <hi>Water</hi> in the <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Strangury. Balaam</hi>'s Ass was a better <hi>Divine,</hi> and had a better <hi>Delivery.</hi> The <hi>Thorn</hi> at <hi>Glastonbury</hi> had more <hi>Sence</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and would make more <hi>Converts.</hi> He speaks not, but grunts, like one of the <hi>Gadarene Hogs</hi> after the <hi>Devils</hi> enter'd 'em. When I came first to his <hi>Church,</hi> and saw him percht on high against a <hi>Pillar,</hi> I took him by his gaping for some <hi>Iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler</hi> going to swallow <hi>Bibles</hi> and <hi>Hour-Glasses.</hi> But I was soon convinc'd that other Feats were to be play'd, and on a sudden lost all my Senses in <hi>Noise.</hi> A Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Huntsman</hi> reeling in while he was at <hi>Prayer,</hi> asked if he were giving his <hi>Parishioners</hi> a <hi>Hollow:</hi> He has
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60008:71"/>
preached half his <hi>Parish</hi> deaf: His <hi>Din</hi> is beyond the <hi>Catadupi</hi> of <hi>Nile.</hi> All his <hi>Patron's Pigeons</hi> are frighted from their <hi>Apartment,</hi> and he's generally believ'd the <hi>Occasion.</hi> He may be heard farther than Sir <hi>Samuel Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's Flagelet.</hi> Nay one damn'd mad Rogue swore, Should he take a <hi>Text</hi> concerning the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> he might serve for the last <hi>Trumpet.</hi> And yet in one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect he's fitted for the Function; his <hi>Countenance,</hi> if not <hi>Doctrine,</hi> can scare Men into <hi>Repentance,</hi> like an <hi>Apparition.</hi> Should he walk after he's dead, he would not be more dreadful than now while he is alive.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Maid</hi> meeting him in the <hi>Dark</hi> in a <hi>Church-Yard,</hi> was frighted into <hi>Phanaticism.</hi> Another is in <hi>Bedlam</hi> upon the same Occasion. I dare not approach him without an <hi>Exorcism. In the Name, &amp;c.</hi> is the fittest <hi>Salutation:</hi> Some have thought the <hi>Parsonage-House</hi> haunted since he dwelt there. In <hi>Yorkshire</hi> ('tis reported) they make use of his Name instead of <hi>Raw-head and Bloody-bones,</hi> to fright <hi>Children.</hi> He is more terrible than those <hi>Phantoms</hi> Country Folks tell of by the Fire side, and pretend to have seen, with <hi>leathern Wings, cloven Feet,</hi> and <hi>sawcer Eyes.</hi> If he go to <hi>Hell</hi> (as 'tis almost an <hi>Article</hi> of my <hi>Creed</hi> he will) the <hi>Devils</hi> will quake for all their warm <hi>Dwelling,</hi> and crowd up into a <hi>Nook</hi> for fear of him.</p>
